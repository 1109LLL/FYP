32137,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The room was perfect Comfy bed and very quiet Location was superb and Michael at reception was fantastic I left my watch after I had checked out on the Sunday He called within the hour and it was in the post the following day Thank you 
32138,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Strange large grey box fixed to the wall in my room which took up most of the space Strange, The room was pretty good but the bathroom door handle was broken and the walls weren t very thick as you could hear the room next door going to the toilet The staff were very friendly and helpful and its in an excellent position for shopping bars and restaurants
32139,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location next to Shepherds Bush Market Station for travel into city and walking distance to Westfield top Mall and Shepherds bush Market diverse and energetic Good too for Wembley stadium Committed staff Facilities excellent Very well thought out and quality fitments No hesitation about returning if price is right 
32140,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The hotel didn t have any breakfast although next door there were many cafes where you could have breakfast But it was advertised with breakfast so that was not so nice There was a problem in the bathroom with water when we arrived but then they immediately changed our room , The hotel was next to the train stain which went directly to Olympia Exhibition center which was very useful for me as we were an exhibitor at Olympia It took only 3 minutes to reach there It s also at a walking distance to a very nice and new shopping mall 
32141,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room too small Bed not comfortable Sheets weren t changed I was not at all impressed, Just the location It s close to the Westfield shopping centre
32142,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Just had trouble getting the safe to work Otherwise all good , Location good for rail and underground link Set back away from the road Lovely courtyard at the front to sit and have a coffee and read the newspaper Open facilities for staff 24 7 Room very clean and staff extremely helpful and very pleasant 
32143,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nowhere on the description on your site does it mention that this room is in the basement and the only window is a small opening in the ceiling This opening leads up to a window which is at ground level on the outside An adult could easily fit through this window and drop down onto the bed and take whatever you ve left in the room It was really difficult to lock we used a coat hanger to reach the latch The safe that was in the wardrobe is not fixed to the wall and could be picked up and removed There was supposed to be a fridge in the room but we had to ask for this as well as the bathrobes This room is NOT big enough for 4 adults as you would expect from the photo To get to the bathroom you have to pass the bottom of the double bed at the other end of the room and if someone is getting something from the wardrobe you can t pass unless they move out of the way It was a struggle when we all showered before going out The guy on the desk spoke good English but when challenged about the room he at first looked blank then said he would speak to his manager which he never did The room smelt of stale cigarettes every time we entered and there were cigarette burns in the carpet even though it was a no smoking room I would not book this room again , The accommodation was so close to everything tube restaurants bars and the venue we attended air con was good and bathroom facilities good 
32144,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Unfortunately the temperature setting on the shower wasn t working correctly so the only temperature option was boiling hot We were only staying for one night so the hotel didn t have a chance to rectify this The recepti, The receptionist was kind enough to let us check in over an hour early at no extra charge 
32145,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There is no restaurant in the hotel quite unusual for a 4 star one The room was a bit on the small side London s standard But still enough space to move around , Small hotel very clean and neat just beside the tube station yet no noise in the room The young lady at the reception Estemine I hope I remember her name correctly was absolutely gorgeous very welcoming and helpful Wifi was not functioning on my iPhone in the room and she did everything in her possibility to fix the problem and she did it too Also there was a problem with my credit card at the moment of booking and the hotel has contacted me without cancelling my reservation what normally happens if the credit card is refused 
32146,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, We had a twin room downstairs It was very clausaphobic with small windows Beds very soft for us Pillows thin too and when we requested new ones reception said they would bring some and never did Fridge was broken warm so food we bought went off Strong green light that flashed brightly all night Holes in the wAll where plugs should have been Fire alarm had been removed which is dangerous Loud macerater In the bathroom that made noise even when no water used or loo flushed , Good location and free wifi
32147,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No hooks in the bathroom Better signage needed outside the hotel because the hotel extrance is almost not visible coming out of the Metro station , Bathroom is very clean and well equipped with toiletries Bed is comfortable Good hotel standards relative to neighbouring guesthouses 
32148,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I had a really bad experience I book this hotel because it has such a good rate but now I believe are fake I knew the hotel was next to the Underground station but I didn t know it was next to a night club too all I wanted was to sleep rest and have a quite night but the music from the club didn t stop till 5 am the internet connection wasn t working properly the room was super hot thecwater from the shower came out not a big problem this but to make it noticed AC didn t works and duvets at this period of the yr the receptionist at that night shift didn t care about my demands of help for none of the reasons mentioned before So I can t say I had a pleasant stay I m super disappointed on booking for the rate of this hotel I start thinking are fake and now is just about selling what they want ,No Positive
32149,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Room and staff were both lovely Great location and perfect for a few nights It was quiet at night which was a surprise because it is such a busy little district So many restaurants and pubs close by Staff were very polite and so many public transport options It was approx 15 00 to the airport via taxi 
32150,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I ve ordered a room with king size bed hmmm I m not sure about British standards but it was not that big both the room and the bed it looked bigger in the photo The soap shampoo were special but we had to ask for refill twice it felt like someone is trying to be too efficient , Good location friendly and helpful staff quiet very clean good wifi great soap the room was pleasant to be in 
32151,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It didn t feel safe my door did not lock from the inside and the fire door at the bottom of the stairs right below my room was open most of the time I reported it twice This made me feel very unsafe because of the possibility of fires and because the hotel is down a dirty lane and anyone could have walked in off a very busy street and upstairs to the bedrooms The door is off to the side and reception can t see who s going in or out When I reported it as open twice they didn t even realise that it was I also asked for a quiet room as I am a very light sleeper and was put in a room right at the front with a train line running right up the side of it and another lane at the side of it where people from bars etc come out to smoke till very late at night so there was a lot of shouting I didn t sleep at all as the air conditioning was either very cold or off and I couldn t open the window because of the noise outside I complained in the morning and the receptionist said some one would be in touch nothing yet That is probably why there were a lot of people at reception asking to change rooms or checking in and checking out straight away , The location
32152,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room wasn t ready eventually offered us what felt like a cell with no window Room we ended up in wasn t great rather worn small and not a boutique experience at all , Staff where nice and friendly
32153,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No problems at all, Lovely experience Easy to find From the tube station turn left and enter the second alleyway It will open up to a cobblestone driveway Hotel is dead ahead where you will be greeted by a friendly reception Room was good loved the bar Would I go there again Definite YES 
32154,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room safe was faulty and would not re open without a staff key Not much of a problem as we just asked the receptionist to open it for us in the morning , Great location for seeing a band at the O2 Empire good value nice and clean and friendly efficient staff 
32155,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Awkward steps in the bedroom to bathroom not suitable for person with mobility priblems but not mentioned beforehand AC difficult to use Hair drier kept cutting out , Staff were friendly and helpful
32156,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Unfortunately the room was v small could barely turn in the shower The air con didn t work properly and whilst the staff provided a fan that isn t sufficient when it s 26 degrees in a cramped room ,No Positive
32157,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nothing, Bed and pillow very comfy Lovely tidy clean room staff very friendly and always happy to help probaly one of the nicest hotels I ve visited
32158,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Our room had no windows basement The bathroom had a very unpleasant smell and you could not put any paper down the toilet not what you expect in a UK hotel You are charged to book in early When we returned in the evening the barman had to be told by the receptionist to serve us rather than continue to do whatever he was doing and ignoring us Another guest warned us as he was leaving to make sure that we didn t get a room on the left hand side of the building as the noise from the railway was very loud , Proximity to Shepherd Bush Empire Good size room for three people Comfortable bed Nice shower but didn t drain away very well 
32159,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Noisy and difficult to sleep especially for our daughter Very close to the overground and trains rattled by until late Lots of noise from room above whole family woken by someone using the shower in the middle of the night which sounded like thunder above us , Large room nicely furnished Lovely toiletries Nice reception and little bar area 
32160,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It was shame there was no breakfast i can imagine that would have been lovely too , Location was great less than 5 mins walk away from the Westfield shopping center The over ground was next door The hotel itself was lovely Nice cool modern and comfy rooms This was particularly needed in the heat Shower was really good and staff was so nice Bringing drinks to our room always welcoming as we went in and out of the hotel Prices for drinks were good too I will definitely stay here again 
32161,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Not very clean carpets stained dirty coffee cups dusty Tiny sink Bathroom most certainly needs redecorating mould on sealant and just a little shabby Although the bed was comfortable room temp was too high and the regulating unit didn t work Couldn t keep the window open because of noise Also they charge you just to keep your luggage in the front of the hotel which I thought was a little extreme and not mentioned on the booking information Overall not as nice as the pictures and could do with a facelift But for a London hotel probably one of the better ones I have stayed in I got a discounted rate on the room would not pay full price not worth it , Location was good right next to the underground station and not too far into central London The area has everything one needs Comfortable bed Reasonable sized room for a London hotel 
32162,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great customer service everyone was really friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble The room was spotless and fresh when we arrived Wifi was fast and had a great connection 
32163,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I was upgraded to large family room which was nice but the room above me was extremely noisy and you could hear every footstep and floor board The shower in the room above is right above the bed so you could hear every water drop and movement in the bathroom and it was unfortunate that I had noisy neighbours , The staff was very friendly Location good for where I needed and lots of restaurant choices Tucked away from the main road 
32164,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, It s a small hotel that has it all love every thing about the hotel staff are super amazing and very helpful especially Afzan Ernesta and Anita will stay there again Insha Allah 
32165,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Tiny wash basin with a shelf so close it was hard to use for shaving , Clean comfortable accommodation at a reasonable price Great location for where I m working Decent shower 
32166,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Neighbourhood was a bit rough but you didn t need to spend too much time there as you could just hop on the tube which was literally 1 min walk around the corner to get anywhere , Great location right next to the Shepard s Bush Market tube station and zero noise once you have the windows closed Great amenities small but perfectly formed 
32167,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Television did not work Wrong wifi password in room literature Room had no window an was underground No breakfast available but near good cafe , Clean Quiet Night staff excellent tried to sort out problem with television not working see below and offered us free drink in compensation 
32168,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No sign board in front of the hotel Should have big signage outside the hotel which can be seen from far, The bed is comfy Many shops and restaurant nearby Near with shops and restaurants we can found many halal restaurants too 
32169,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Noisy room on basement floor Constant noise from bathroom and people moving around from very early in morning Tiny room as expected but very pricey for what it is , Convenient location
32170,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The lift was out of action still I noticed from previous reviews but not needed in our case plus the family room down stairs had a bad odour from bad drainage in the bathroom but the staff where quick to respond , Perfect Boutique hotel for travelling up to the city sites the Apollo and shopping at Westfield s The staff where very helpful in answering my questions fixing a small problem and with unloading loading of the big family car 
32171,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, People sat outside the main door early in the morning late at night talking loudly on phones was disruptive The lobby area is teeny so staff guests are forced to pop out to chat Carpets were stained and had iron burn marks on which always looks tatty We paid 118 for a cancellable room so on the whole not too bad but I ve stayed for less in better hotels close by , The location is great we used smart parking at westfields 6 per day and walked the three minutes it took to get to the hotel which is just around the corner The two very close tube stations take you into town in just a few stops Staff were pleasant let us check in an hour early Beds were comfy decor inoffensive 
32172,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Bed was made of two mattresses and was uncomfortable Everything was very small and I didn t think it was worth the money , The location in proximity to Bush Hall where there was an event last night was great Staff was friendly 
32173,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room extremely hot as it was in the top of the building air conditioning only worked for 15 minutes then switched off very poor sleep window opened but noise from street made for disturbed nights Lower levels of building were very cool so this room got all of the upward heat from the building Could help if the window opened outwards from the bottom rather than the top to permit the hot air to escape upwards , Nicely decorated clean room excellent shower daily towels lovely smellies plenty of storage comfy beds 
32174,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Wifi didn t work very reliably from my room 105 in some parts of the room the tube station wifi worked better Not exactly the hotel s fault but on my last day someone in another room was smoking and the smell filled my room too , Location is amazing Less than a minute to the station whilst at the same time not really noticing any sounds from it The room was nice Bathroom was nice 
32175,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, A little bit of noise from the Tube station but it is London and I did have my window open , Tiny weeny hotel in an ideal location for the purpose of my visit Friendly staff and clean comfortable room Air conditioning and WiFi 
32176,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Smell from drains in bathroom I thought breakfast was available and it mentioned in the room the times for breakfast but i guess they no longer do this , Ideal place to stay for shopping centre with easy transport access for visiting London Comfortable clean and good value for money Room was in basement so nice and quiet and as it was dark we managed to have a lie in a very rare pleasure
32177,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Could not fault hotel as it was perfect, Fantastic staff could not have been more helpful with helping us with finding our way around London The location is fantastic close to shops and tube station clean great staff great location will stay again on next trip to the area 10 10
32178,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room was freezing ineffective heating despite the small size of the room I woke up in the morning to find NO HOT WATER in the shower Staff came in to have a look then disappeared for half an hour I had no clue what was happening wasn t informed what was going on Had to ring reception again which is when I was told that the boiler was broken they where waiting for an engineer and it wasn t their fault After having a quick dreadful cold shower as I had to leave I went down to check out No apologies as if nothing had happened I was only asked if I need an invoice or a receipt I complained they asked me for my contact details for the manager to get in touch with me NEVER heard from any manager or anyone whatsoever I understand faults like this can happen but their response was ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL , Close to the tube station
32179,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was meant to be included but the hotel is having work done so no eating facilities available yet my booking cost included breakfast , Location and the room
32180,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The sink in the bathroom is very small , The localization is fantast c There are excellent pubs around and a great shopping center The metro station is by side from the hotel The attenders are very helpful The room and bathroom are very clean 
32181,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, My room was under reception and the noise went on all night of people banging around above I asked to change my room the second night and was told I d have to pay for an upgrade ,No Positive
32182,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It is a little smaller than the pictures show but it is manageable No restaurant or food on site which is fine during the day but if you want to indoors and relax you have to get food beforehand for the room , very good location and comfortable bed It was clean and staff were friendly I had an extremely helpful staff at reception when I checked in 
32183,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Safe in our room didn t work Wifi did not work in our room No robes and slippers provided as advertised A fairly typical small overpriced London hotel room really nothing remarkable quite disappointed as a lot of the reviews seemed to rave about it , Convenient location for us for a concert in the church across the road Good location for shopping at Westfield Comfortable bed 
32184,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No day light coming in at ALL room 01 was I was coming from a 2 months stay in a South Asia and needed a quiet place to stay for 2 days to readjust from jet lag before getting back to work Well that was the worse place I could have been From 9am to 7 8pm I was subject to walls literally shaking all day as I was trying to sleep by doors violently slamming I could hear the staff coming back and force and talk like I was in a same room Horrible feeling I understand most guests don t stay in their room all day but the facilities being quite small you would NEVER expect THAT level of noise And my room room 01 being the first next to a main door and front office doesn t help , Clean spacious room nice bathroom
32185,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Constant droning noise every 10 20 minutes lasted for about 5 Think it was macerator but maybe not Reported to reception on departure, price convenience
32186,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There were no breakfast facilities a fact that wasn t clear on the website , We were going to a concert at Bush Hall and this was a very handy place to stay Beds were so so comfortable Shower brilliant window opened staff very friendly and helpful 
32187,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Wall to next door was a little thin could hear the tv in the next room Although it did not stop me from sleeping , Lovely hotel hidden gem Close to tube shops bars restaurants Nice smart clean rooms with everything that was needed Would definitely stay again excellent value for money 
32188,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Beds were needing replaced comfortable but lumpy Doors walls need soundproofed we could hear our neighbours at 5 30am having a good time Compared to other 4 star hotels this needs a bit of work to bring it up to its competitors , Location to tube station and o2 Shepherd s Bush Empire was great lots of restaurants and bars in the area Couldn t hear outside noise Room did what it was supposed to for the duration of stay
32189,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The toilet makes a really loud noise when flushed didn t sound healthy and also didn t flush very well The drainage was also very slow in basin and shower Not sure whether any of this was due to being in the basement We could hear a lot of noise from the guests above sounded as though they were storming around at 6 in the morning which woke us up so not well soundproofed , The location was great next door to an underground station taking us to central London in 30 mins both circle line and Hammersmith and city line Around the corner from Westfields which was very handy a lot of restaurants Beds were comfortable and a very large room for 3 people it was a 4 persons room 1 double and 2 singles Very happy with the cleanliness of the bathroom and I can be picky Staff were friendly 
32190,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I arrived very late and extremely exhausted after a very long drive and writing this review a couple of days later so it s not reflecting my tiredness that evening I was shown my room and really hope that room was the worst in the place double bed filling the entire room a kind of platform taking up space a blackened out window to a kind of yard from where there was a constant humming noise from some machinery as well as a bad draft and smell Extremely poor sound insulation thin walls could hear exactly what was going on in the adjacent rooms plus when the toilet s were being flushed You couldn t access the bathroom without sliding around the bathroom door and then closing it after entering tiny I weigh 60 kg so not due to my size I was charged 30 extra for my cat which was admittedly on their terms and conditions which staff showed me when I complained about it not the amount however but not on the booking com website No breakfast is served teabags and kettle in the room Over priced and grossly over rated the photos look lovely on the site and perhaps I was just given a bad room no idea was just a very bad experience and an expensive one at that cost me around 135 which I deeply regret spending didn t want wild luxury just a decent size room and no noise or draft, The only thing I liked was the shower and the soaps that were provided
32191,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Only thing was that they were working on the breakfast room would have been nice to know this before we stayed but didn t really upset our stay, We went for a match and it suited us for location staff were friendly
32192,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Before arriving at the hotel i checked the pictures on their website and the rooms were made to appear bigger on the pictures I even requested to have a decent sized room in my booking but did not get this on arrival The toilet was literally like a box and we could not sit comfortably on the toilet seat My partner actually hurt himself on the toilet seat as it was very close to the edge of the wall and this actually scratched his skin , the staff were friendly and the location was perfect 
32193,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The area is so so but that is how it is once inside just lovely Not central London but only 4 or 5 stops on the central line to the West End, The price Goodness me this must be the best bargain in London I have paid 3 times this for much pokier rooms Bed very comfy staff very smiley and we were even taken to our room by one member of staff The other one we met offered to help me locate something online without being prompted Good shower too I will recommend this hotel highly especially if this price is the norm
32194,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, not much sound proofing between rooms, cosy place to stay great for an overnight stay as went to the empire to see a gig staff very helpful they make sure everything is ok
32195,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Poor wifi, Good location right next to a metro station Westfield mall is about 3 minutes away there are many good stores Room was clean and comfortable Great price value
32196,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, When we booked in October for January the hotel advertised a continental breakfast No breakfast facilities were available when we asked We were told they discontinued them from 1st January even though a continental breakfast was still advertised on their web site The internet service was intermittent , The location was excellent for what we wanted to do The room was clean and comfortable 
32197,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There was a dripping pipe right outside the window of our room 106 which kept us awake Also lots of noisy building work above us in the morning , Great location and helpful happy staff 
32198,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Our room and maybe some others had no window or natural light Not a major problem for one night but we didn t know that was a possibility , Good location and right next door to the train station so no problem with having to haul luggage around 
32199,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Small room but didn t spoil our stay at all Possible drainage problems smell coming from drain in shower cubicle easily rectified by keeping a towel over plug hole when not in use , Hotel was quiet clean comfortable modern cheap Staff were friendly helpful nothing too much trouble I would definitely stay here again happy to recommend to Friends Family Transport links location to Westfield Sopping Center absolutely brilliant no taxis required Can t comment on the food as we didn t eat here but lot s of great pubs restaurants in walking distance Considering the Hotel is a stones throw from the tube there was no train or traffic noise at all So pleased I found you Happy New Year to you all
32200,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It was freezing a c heater was weak felt nothing had to ask for help thinking it was something I had done wrong to be offered a plug in heater strange no bath robs as stated room was quite small with a small tv the view was of scaffolding, Location close to Westfield and next door to the train station Staff were friendly
32201,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, When it says Boutique it means small The rooms are very small so if you are claustrophobic then you may want to consider an alternative , Comfortable and clean good value and location with some really good pubs close by on the Green The rooms are small but if you are just looking for a bed for the night and a shower in the morning then it is perfect 
32202,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Rooms are really small for the price but when you re in London and only need a place to sleep it might be ok , It was really clean and the staff was polite
32203,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It was tricky to find the location of the hotel , Good location Just opposite of Shepherds Bush Market and next to Shepherds Bush Station Tube and also next to QPR Football Stadium Loftus Road 
32204,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It was quite hard to find at first but that s the least of my problem I love to explore, Staff was very attentive and very polite It s right next to shepherd s bush market station Depending on a person s preference it could be bad due to noise or convenient since it s easier to go anywhere and for myself it s the latter It s close to Westfield shopping centre for you shopaholics 4 min walk for me For the Muslims there are quite a number of halal eatery in the area and a very nice halal burger joint Awesome The internet is superfast and a minibar is provided with tea and some biscuits
32205,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast to be included in the cost of the room would have been nice , Pleasant little hotel perfectly located for the purpose of our visit Not the biggest room we ve ever stayed in but clean and in a peaceful setting 
32206,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Even the King bedroom was tiny reception was a small area similar to a waiting room for a taxi rank and the continental breakfast very sparse really not worth having Extremely expensive for the facilities offered but perhaps that is largely the case in London , An excellent location to see a show at the Empire Staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful The room was clean 
32207,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Cobblestones outside a little slippery in the rain but that is just a minor grumble , Super clean modern room with a comfy bed and in the perfect location Very quiet considering where it was and perfect for the Shepherd s Bush empire which was just round the corner Nicely laid back off the road and privately gated made this a real find for our weekend away Westfield shopping centre just around the corner too as a bonus 
32208,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, More space in the room would have been nice but ok it was clean tidy modern , close proximity to Shepherds Bush Empire venue Lots of restaurant possibilities in the close vicinity Shopping centres nearby Tube relatively close by
32209,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Kings room was a little small but very clean well equipped and quite hot temperature throughout the night Breakfast was OK Great location for Westfield shopping centre and next to Circle line 
32210,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Windows were soundproof but walls were rather thin I could hear everything from the next room They should also re evaluate the quality of the taxi service that they provide to to their guests I almost missed my tour because the driver didnt know where the meeting area was His GPS apparently wasnt working well He even scolded me for not leaving early enough , Rooms were small but it s got all the basic amenities you need in a hotel room 
32211,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, the room 4 tiny very thin walls door next to foot of bed refurbished but cheap fittings shower area had small black mould bits, staff friendly good location
32212,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, To be fair I was given a 10 refund when I complained about the following The bathroom had fluff and a particular type of hair on the floor and the water was slow to drain from the sink When I took the metal plug off to investigate the pipe was clogged with months years worth of disgusting gunk I was very tired when I went to bed and it wasn t until the morning that I found a large knot of long hair on the bottom sheet near the foot of the bed Yuk One of the wall sockets was hanging off the wall Couldn t turn the lights off from the bed Only one tea bag originally supplied although they did provide more when asked , The location is excellent right next door to the tube station but you don t seem to hear them opposite Shepherds Bush Market and a stone s throw from various restaurants the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire and not far from the Westfield shopping centre 
32213,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was tiny in a basement without a window was a cupboard Breakfast was poor in a room with no windows and no ambience It was not good value for money , Nothing
32214,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, For the price it was very basic 189 if not bordering on scandalous it was a twin bedded very small room below ground so no natural light , The staff were ok I cannot find any other favourable comment s to make 
32215,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Complimentry water would have been majorly appreciated in the room with tea and coffee station , Fab hotel right on the door step of westfields shopping centre and Shepherd s Bush Market tube station
32216,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Everything great but original price far too expensive We were just lucky getting a value deal in the day , Modern clean and very comfortable We got a deal which was good for London prices st 89 for a double room but this was 49 cheaper than it should have been so very overpriced usually Would never have afforded to stay there at full price but if we did it was not worth that amount of money 
32217,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The temperature of the room was very warm even with the air conditioning on I slept with the window open all night in the middle of October, The staff were helpful and the room was clean and comfortable
32218,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The king size bed I requested was 2 singles pushed together Not what I ordered Continental breakfast was not very good Not a lot of variety and wasn t good quality , It was nice and clean 
32219,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, lift is not great , Located right by the tube station good walking distance to the Westfield shopping centre this is a small clean hotel with friendly staff Overpriced but that s London I guess 
32220,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I would have liked breakfast to have started earlier 8am is a bit late if you have to go to work, The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful
32221,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Asked to leave breakfast area on one day before I had finished eating Attempted charge for leaving luggage for a few hours after my stay they backed down after I pointed out this was listed as a service on the booking com page Two faulty items in the room were not fixed during a 5 day stay Reception staff each seemed to have their own ideas about which taxi firms to contact no shared knowledge Slow to react to the problem of local gridlock on a big match day , Staff mostly friendly and helpful Comfortable bed Useful nearby shops including a pharmacy Some of the taxi firms they found for me were excellent I will use them again I have to make repeated stays in this area It took them a while to understand and respond when I asked for a non slip mat in the shower but they one they eventually fitted was better in both function and appearance than the ones you usually see 
32222,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was too small and underground so there was no natural light you didn t no wether it was day or night sun or rain outside and the water system made terrible noises which I m sure would wake other guests , The staff Friendly helpful great 
32223,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The rooms are much smaller then expected and the breakfast is very limited to just a few cold items , The personel is very helpful at anytime the location is just next to the underground station Shepherds bush market and in a quiet area The room is clean and the bed is comfortable 
32224,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was very basic They give you a fridge but it has nothing in it you have to go downstairs to the minibar Room not completely sound proofed Taps on the sink didn t change temperature , Room was nice top floor with skylight type window was good 
32225,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I stayed in a twin room that literally had the smallest beds just 2 6 and I am sure the requirement for an adult is 3 wide and no window They should just make this room a single if it is considered too small for two adult size beds There is a fake window but when you look out you are looking at a sort of air vent which certainly needs cleaning up We chose this for the location close to Olympia and on the website they advertise bathrobes and ipod dock neither were in the room It actually didn t bother us particularly as we were working but you shouldn t have to ask for things that are supposed to be included, Generally I would recommend the hotel is quite small and although the rooms are not that big they have nice furnishings and the staff were nice and friendly I would go back but would be careful to choose another room I work in the travel industry so like to be fair with my comments there were a couple of negatives but on the whole don t let this review put you off as my complaints were to do with the one room I am sure the others are lovely 
32226,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I was up the whole night not sure why they had ongoing work during the whole night The bed was uncomfortable the sheets were dirty the toilet was not cleaned at all ,No Positive

32229,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, That is one of the slowest worst wi fi connections I ve ever experienced Why cannot the hotel pay for a normal broadband They definetely earn more than that , Despite the cramped up space the rooms are quite comfy 
32230,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room was very very small no iPod docking station as advertised bed pushed up against the wall and door to outside rather than window was frosted so no real light coming in Not enough room really to sit at the desk without having TV right in your face and back of chair up against the bed not a good environment for working I went to a restaurant instead Access via what looks like a locked gate down a wide alley is a bit off putting but nicely finished inside , Convenient location right next to Shepherd s Bush Market tube and 5 minutes walk to Westfield shopping centre restaurants Small but well laid out and finished shower WC nice toiletries Staff friendly and polite Accessible lift 
32231,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, We could not fault this hotel it was fantastic , The room was nice cosy comfortable and clean The staff were very professional friendly and helpful Shepherd s Bush Market Tube Station is right next to the hotel which was handy too It was a short 10 min walk to Shepherd s Bush station and also the Westfield shopping center which was great

32233,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, It is a clean modern and comfortable boutique hotel located next to the underground station at Shepherd s Bush Market It is easy to get to all areas of London from this location It does not have much in the way of extra amenities just a very small bar in the reception area But it is very good value for a London hotel We didn t eat at the hotel because there are places to have breakfast within a few minutes walk 
32234,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Uncomfortable bed but then in fairness budget hotel Sales staff Felt taken advantage of at the owner of the business hands for change of date on incorrect booking, location and style of rooms and general staff

32237,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The only down side and previously said is the noise problem I needed a lie in but i could here every movement above me which i think was the reception area Sound proofing definitely needs sorting if you want a good nights sleep or don t want to get up early , The hotel is slap bang next door to Shepherds Bush Market station so was ideal in respect of travel Has safe in room and iron and ironing board It had air con Staff were friendly and check in was easy even though i was a little early

32252,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The only downside to the hotel is the drive path from the road which approaches the hotel The path is run down off putting which leads to the hotel entrance The hotel itself is excellent though, Very nice interior to the hotel with a smart room Room included a quality power shower air conditioning The all you can eat breakfast on site was also lovely 
32253,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There was a little bit of noise when people were walking around upstairs and from the utility room next door , Very convenient location right next to Sheppherd s Bush Market tube station A nice clean room

32258,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Early morning cleaners were noisy when doing the disabled toilet , The staff were friendly the room was clean spacious and comfortable the continental brekkie was excellent and the location was brilliant 
32259,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nothing super all round, A real Gem of a find Right next to Shepherds Bush tube station but v Quiet at night Very helpful staff Very well equipped room We ll b using this hotel v regularly 
32260,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Every room seems to have their own problems for example two out of three rooms I stayed suffers from a loose socket cover The other room has the blinds falling off from the wall Breakfast is very limited i e almost all items are cold food apart from boiled eggs , It s a bargain to stay here Try to compare prices between here and their actual website they will match your rate if you find a better deal Staffs are very friendly and services have been good Room is very modern I like the finish of the room i e feels like home Great location too I would say it is just on the left side of Shepherd s Bush Market station on Circle Hammersmith City Line or 5 minutes walk from Shepherd s Bush station on Central Line if you want to avoid changing trains at White City Internet spped was good as well 
32261,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I was in a single basement room so I was expecting small What I hadn t anticipated was the noise I think every water pipe and other utility ran through the room so that there was the constant trickle of water and clunk of machinery Added to people clunking up and down the stairs and tap dancing on the ceiling the general noise level was high Breakfast was also a big disappointment very basic continental if I d known I would have saved the 6 50 and gone out for brekkie , Location right next to the tube station was very convenient Staff were friendly and it was reasonably priced 
32262,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was quite compact but for the price that s to be expected The dining room was very small and quite dim Some foods on the menu were not displayed however we didn t ask about them I didn t appreciate then3am wake up call from another customer who had the wrong room and urinated up the wall outside , The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean The dressing gown and slippers were an added bonus Staff were friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble 
32263,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Really don t know, The staff were excellent very considerate On arrival with a patch on my eye from surgery the gentleman on reception said that he thought it would be better for us to have a twin room because it was a little bigger than the twin room we had booked and I would have more space to move about I thought this was very kind and considerate if and when we return to this area we will book into this hotel again it was clean and refreshing
32264,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Restaurant staff let us down a little not very friendly I think the language barrier may have been a problem Also found it expensive per night , Everything was clean lovely room and staff were polite and professional Breakfast was lovely Great to have free wifi too Breakfast was a bargain at 6 50
32265,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No sound insulation so you could easily hear the people from the next room or above , Great location nearby metro station friendly staff clean comfortable bed amenities wifi and other extras like hairdryer iron and irontable water boiler for coffee or tea All you could ask for 
32266,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, When people were in the hallway I could here them and when I was in the hallway I heard in to other rooms p but that was all everything else was great , I liked that the room was always really clean when we came after long day the shower was wonderful good power and the breakfast was amazing the pancakes were delicious 
32267,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The rooms are so small that you can barely move inside The ventilation in the bathroom was not working well so it was always stinking because of humidity , Nice small hotel a bit far from the center but close to the Central Tube line Bed was comfortable and the breakfast was OK 
32268,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Too expensive for the state of the room King bed was two single ones so couldn t sleep in the middle Could hear everything from next door and upstairs Very small room Area s not the best I wouldn t walk by myself at night , Close to circle line tube Nice bathroom shower Cleaning lady does a very good job 
32269,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The payment system Although the money was never taken twice I had a full payment and a pending transaction in one go I wasn t best pleased about this Arranged for a late checkout for 1pm only to be rung at 11 05 am asking why we hadn t checked out The soundproofing within the hotel could be better as I could hear guests all day that wasn t a problem and had some noisy neighbours in the night this was although not the fault of the hotel people were loud The noise from work being done above us all day was a little annoying as we had not been informed about this , The location of the hotel was perfect extremely close to the tube station and on a good line to get in and out of the centre Even though the hotel was close to the tube line I heard no noise from it at all The hotel was lovely and clean and the staff were very pleasant The breakfast was good The robes were a lovely touch 
32270,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The main problem for us was that the room was very small maybe they could compromise on the desk bad in order to have more Space in the room Bathroom smelled moldy musty although was very clean The WIFI was very slow and somethimes not working, The breakfast was better than expected Close to tube and westfield shopping centre fridge in the room and cofee tea biscuits Electric teakettle Soundproof
32271,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, halls and room smelt of paint due to the current refurbishment luckily I didn t spend a lot of time in the room Breakfast is a very poor offering, Great location from the train station and room itself was very nice 
32272,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Needed some new paint It is right next to the metro no noise pollution but it caught me off guard becuase it looked like a scary location at first becuase of that , The employees were very kind and helpful The breakfast was very nice too they would make you something even if you didn t see it out already 
32273,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, A reason of our stay was to celebrate our 5th anniversary we wanted to have comfortable night without our children However about 2am in the morning the hook with pal which holds curtains feel down on us Both of us woke up immediately got scared badly as none of us wanted anyone to come to our room at that early hour my husband had decided to fixed the thing temporary Please note that this needs urgent fixing Also on my departure a cover of the light switch to a bathroom feel off l left that on a desk When I checked out I left these information at the reception but they seem not know what to do when gests complain Also just very minor thing I would recommend you to provide rooms with a less tog duvet as that one in the room was very warm , Room 201 was really nice on the quitter side and with a very very comfortable bed Room was very clean well done good job 
32274,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Extra charges mentioned for pets and early late check in out were high Thankfully no extra charges actually levied No cooked breakfast shame given high room prices , Very comfy big bed
32275,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The man at the front desk was extremely friendly and very helpful The room was small but cozy and clean There was a thermostat in the room which I REALLY appreciated given how cold London can be The shower had amazing pressure and the lotions body wash smelled great The breakfast in the morning was ok but given how expensive London is I appreciated having that as an option There is also a bar in the lobby so I was able to take a glass of champagne back to my room The neighborhood was very closely located to the tube and bus station but the vibe of the neighborhood was a bit weird grungy I was able to take the bus to another part of town for dinner which was an easy commute given its only a 6 minute walk to the tube bus 
32276,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There were no plug sockets in reach of the kettle so I had to move it onto the floor by the door to make a cup of tea and the shower head flew off when I turned it on in the morning and I didn t have time to get it fixed so I couldn t shower before I left , The staff were friendly and the whole place was very clean and good value for money 
32277,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No hairdryer in room but when asked staff got one but unfortunately it didn t work , The quality of the room and attentive staff and the complimentary robes and slippers 
32278,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, For the price we though this was excellent value bedroom and bathroom clean and very comfortable Only issue was getting the heating in the room right Conveniently next to Shepherds Bush Market Tube Station but we didn t hear any trains at all Breakfast simple but very well presented and the staff very helpful Will definitely stay again 
32279,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Rooms bathroom are a little to small the basin in the bathroom was to small to even was my hands in it without water splashing everywhere Breakfast was very basic they could of had a bit more to choose from , Me husband stayed here for a night for our anniversary celebration we was Very impressed with this place The rooms are very clean cosy very well looked after The beds are comfortable love the location with just a minute walk from the station very value for money Will definitely return back to this place no question about it 
32280,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, A hot breakfast would have been nice but it s a small hotel so presumably they dont have the cooking facilities Not the hotel s fault but Shepherd s Bush is a horrible horrible place There didn t seem to be any parking so it s a good job I didn t take the car , The room and bathroom were nice the location was good Breakfast was ok The bed was comfortable and the room had everything you could want 
32281,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Considering I booked an economy room with no windows I knew what I was getting into However it should be more economical if you will for the room that it was Was kind of small and you could definitely feel the fact that it had no windows Should have been cheaper Nevertheless was a good stay for 2 nights , The room was good looking and clean The place was comfortable Breakfast was basic but fine Wifi worked even in the basement It s literally a 1 minute walk from Shepherd s Bush Market tube stop Takes 25min to get to most attractions by tube which isn t a big deal 
32282,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Roms are tiny tiny I couldn t open my suitcase on the floor They also charge for luggage storage after check out , Proximity to Westfield and Public transport Nice new hotel
32283,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Nice location in front of the market and literally next to the metro station It s not in central London so it may take a while to reach your destination but apart from that it s a great place to be There s also a huge mall 5 minutes away on foot The staff was super friendly and there s free cookies in the room and a free newspaper you can pickup at the reception Even got an upgrade to a double room free 
32284,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The standard room are a little small and it s a squeeze to find space to store things But we normally book a premium room none available on this trip , The Staff are great
32285,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The beds weren t super comfortable but got the job done for the few nights we were there The heating is also a little weird but once we sorted it out we didn t have any issues , They had a nice breakfast and our room was a nice size for 3 ppl The hotel is literally steps away from the Shepherd s Bush Market tube stop making it super easy to get around and get to the airport with luggage 
32286,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, We have no complaints , Staff were very friendly and helpful Particularly with our arrival and departure Our breakfast was wonderful The hotel was scrupulously clean Thank you 
32287,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, We stayed in room 202 and were woken up really early by housekeeping rummaging around in bags just outside our door 8 30 us perhaps a little too early to be making a lot of noise on a Sunday morning especially Mothers Day Didn t like the fact we had to pay to leave our bags after check out as most reputable hotels I ve stayed at have done this for free The leaflet in our room stated 2 per bag however the member of staff on reception tried to charge us 3 per bag When he realised we had noticed he changed his mind and only charged us 1 per bag instead Just shows that they can charge what they want really , When we arrived there were no bathrobes in the room however we called reception and they were brought to us promptly The vanity mirror lights were a glamorous little touch Spotlessly clean all over and great continental breakfast provided which was included in the price The location was brilliant as the tube was literally next door connecting shepherds bush market with the rest of London on the Hammersmith and city line Shepherds bush tube station on the central line was also only a 10 minute walk down the road Would not hesitate to stay again on my next visit to London for the price well worth it 
32288,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, damp smell in corridor lift not a real lift its more of a platform one time didn t work no instructions given how to operate Reception staff could have been friendlier , bed seemed comfortable coffee machine was a nice touch Had late change of plan checked in but after going for dinner returned and checkout out at midnight
32289,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Bathroom a bit basic very stiff tap and no complimentary toiletries provided My stay was very brief though so wasn t particularly bothered, Location really convenient friendly staff and good amenities 
32290,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Really lovely staff considering we turned up quite late in the evening really considerate came and showed us the heat settings nice atmosphere amazing shower bath robes we felt pampered 
32291,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Should have been less expensive for single occupancy, Rooms very peaceful and quiet despite being close to railway Many restaurants close by Close to tube stations
32292,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, It is very difficult to please everyone in relation to breakfast but we thought there was such a high smell of sugar in the dining room Would have liked more variety and an egg cup , the hotel was clean and the staff were more than friendly and helpful It was good value for money It was a good location and we could access public transport easily 
32293,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Only small things really the tv didn t work shower leaked the telephone in the room wasn t working and there was a small amount of dust Really just me being picky , The room itself was brilliant lovely and spacious the facilities were super Bathroom was big and well stocked Staff were friendly and literally would do anything to help even offering to swap our room when they saw my partner was on crutches and we were on the second floor 
32294,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, More snacks should be provided so we can order during the day , Very good location Next to tube station across the Shepherd s Bush Market 5 min away from Westfield commercial centre The room was new and very clean Congratulations to the staff for the excellence service Michaela and Michael were very friendly to us 
32295,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Tissues in room were not replaced when finished There was no extra roll of toilet paper in the bath room just a small roll in use Both or either would have been nice since the weather gave us a bit of snivels , Location near the central line and prize were good for London Staff was friendly
32296,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Like most hotels in London you do sometimes get slight smells from the drains but this is not the fault of the hotel as it s cleanliness standard was very high I checked the shower trap on the off chance and it was sparkling clean Just one of the things you can t help in a big city , Everything was of the highest standard from staff to location and the overall feel and loof of the establishment A truly special little gem in West London ideally located for transport into the City and the best shopping centre around 
32297,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great value for money rooms not massive of course but what do you expect this close to central London Set a little way back from the road it s also very quiet considering proximity to the tube etc 
32298,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Full length mirror needed and no room between the shelf and sink in the bathroom Very limiting when travelling with a young lady trying to get ready for a night out , Location brilliant really comfy warm room and very pleasant staff Excellent value for money 
32299,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Flimsy walls We could hear other guests clearly We were on the ground floor and the noise of footsteps from above was a little annoying Broken toilet flush in the en suite bathroom Towels were of poor quality and didn t dry you off , The location was great Tube station right next door and Shepherds Bush market across the road Westfield Centre is only a short walk away as is Shepherds Bush main tube station and bus station The room was small but modern and comfortable The staff were polite and helpful 
32300,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nothing I can think of , The first experience was so pleasant I booked another stay I will continue to stay there whenever I am in London I have also recommended the place to my friends 5 star experience on a budget 
32301,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Unfortunately this was not a good hotel experience and I can make the best out of pretty much any situation We arrived at 6pm to be told our room was not ready as they were still cleaning it Having stayed at many many hotels all over the world I have never been told that I can t check in at 6pm The room was downstairs in a basement small pretty claustrophobic Toilet seat hanging off and problems with plumbing so there was a loud noise every time the toilet sink or shower was used Reception tried to charge us to leave our bags there whilst we went shopping the next day Would have had a lot more to say if we had paid full price ,No Positive
32302,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The toilets are electric saniflow and make the loudest noise throughout the night constantly waking me up and mine overflowed even without excessive use not great and not Boutique, the location is great and the staff were lovely but the overall hotel is not great for the money
32303,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No croissants either plain or chocolate were available Remainder of breakfast choice was not enticing , The rooms facilities were not ample but very clean comfortable 
32304,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, None , The room was spacious and clean and the staff were friendly We had a good night We will definitely be coming back to this hotel Easy access to the underground and about 5 minutes walk to westfield shopping centre The breakfast was great too We are very satisfied with this hotel Well done to a great team 
32305,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Well I expected bigger room as showed on the picture and bigger king size bed aswell I did not like while I tried to relax in my room I kept heard a knocking noise as drill or hammer from the level I stayed Also the room smell made me headache They used strong detergent or cleaner stuff I smelled like strong bleach And for last the air conditionair did not work for heating up the room Could not set up higher then 17 degree , The bontique was nice and tidy Friendly staff and welcoming Good customer service 
32306,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The only downside was that the room was quite small not an issue for us as we were out and about 90 of the time but not ideal if you re planning on staying in a lot , Really friendly staff who were only too happy to help with any queries that we had The contential buffet is simple but good quality and the rooms were always clean and comfortable with a great overhead shower Also we were only a 15 20 minute tube ride to the centre of London which was massively useful 
32307,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Rooms slightly smaller than i d like for a long stay but perfect for a couple of nights, Perfect location for Shepherds Bush and Westfield Clean rooms and a nice shower
32308,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Unfortunately myself and my daughter s room No 3 was next to and below rooms used by the staff as service rooms Throughout the night there was constant noise dragging of objects across the floor and even singing with clearly no consideration for guests We had a disturbed night before an important interview for my daughter I did not really think it was for us to get up and complain For this reason I would not use the hotel again , The staff member who greeted us and showed us around was friendly fun and efficient The room was well appointed for our requirements When we left early in the morning the member of staff on the desk was on the telephone did not acknowledge us or even look up We did not have time to wait to speak to him about our stay 
32309,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No heating in bedroom on entry Heating cut out and never reached more than 10o on freezing cold night in London I sat in my bed in a padded coat fur waistcoat and cried Too cold to shower, Location
32310,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Washbasin a little tiny but The shower is quite large so not a r al issue , The underground proximity and no noise at all if you have The chance to get good neighbours Kind and efficient servi e at The reception and for breakfast breakfast standard 
32311,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Small rooms and tiny bathroom sink creaky floorboards and noisy doors will wake you up at 7am Cheap iron that doesn t heat well , Good location and affordable 4 accommodation with comfortable beds high quality linen towels etc Friendly staff 
32312,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, was not a king size bed as advertised had to bend down to open bathroom door as it was at an angle its was one of those places where the picture looks better than in actuality the room was definitely smaller than in the picture, general layout and design
32313,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Rooms are too small No possibility to open windows since they are locked Breakfast is very frugal There were no croissants and pain au chocolate although it was on the menu The staff told us our first morning that they waited for new delivery but the third morning there were still no croissants nor pain au chocolate Only bread from supermarket package the only fruits they served were bananas Room on the ground floor next to the shared toilet is very noisy We asked for a new room which was actually worse , Staff is very friendly they immediately gave us a new room when we complained about the noise there was at night Next to metro station Spacious showers
32314,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Liked it all, A great place with everything you need From long mirrors hair dryer toiletries plenty of good quality towels comfy beds and clean bedding tv with plenty channels coffee tea and biscuits complimentary safe mini fridge iron and slippers Very quiet also I totally recommend as location is fantastic close to everything westfields you can be in the main touristic places within 15 min 
32315,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was limited to continental and is served in a room with no windows , Friendly staff clean rooms excellent location right next door to tube station but no train noise at all 
32316,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The time I stayed there they were busy renobating or so on the next rooms so little noisy but only during day time so not disturbing early in the morning or late at night , Location Comfortable beds Service
32317,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No parking on or near the website Pictures on booking com did not show the size of the room Were misleading The room was a double for two people but the closet door touched the front door when opened The bed was right next to tea making cupboard I was clastrophobic as nowhere in England or anywhere in the world that I have travelled had such a small room even at half this price The staff serving at the breakfast wasn t very helpful and barely acknowledged when we walked on She was cold and didn t rush to assist although the room was for two there was one robe in the closet , Very friendly and helpful guy from Ghana when we checked in Was the best staff member of all that we interacted with 
32318,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Parking was a bit of a nightmare we ended up in the Westfields shopping centre at 9 50 for the day , Really comfy bed in close proximity to Shepherds Bush Underground 
32319,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There was a slight musty smell in the room but I suspect this was due to extractor fan in bathroom not working that efficiently, Very close to tube and westfield shopping perfect for us and great value for money friendly staff and breakfast whilst not a cooked one was good Would stay again
32320,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, We had an awesome week Staff was incredible Friendly and accommodating always smiling What a pleasure it was to walk out in the morning and come back in the evening seeing their friendly faces Thank you so much We ll be back
32321,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I though there would be a wireless speaker or iPod dock in my room but there wasn t one I noticed the absence from my room though I didn t say anything about it Just bear in mind that the room is small which is normal in London and you will find it difficult to store more than 2 fully sized bags Internet It is good however in some rooms the signal may be weak , I have been searching for days to find a 4 star hotel to stay for a night for 100 or less After been reading reviews here I gave it a try and I have to say it was REALLY GOOD Good location it is right next to the tube station but with NO NOISE from the trains great staff and a very modern room for just 69 for one night I also really enjoyed the TV in the room and the furniture and the style of the room The staff I dealt with was really nice too 
32322,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, A pity the room is a little small , Friendly staff nothing was too much trouble Room and bathroom spotlessly clean and well equipped The continental breakfast was brilliant 
32323,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There was no hot water for a shower the shower cubicle was very cramped The kettle was dangerous I did report this and is was being investigated , The location was excellent for our purpose
32324,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Try to avoid the basement rooms as they are noisy and next to the restorant, The welcome Drink the politeness of the staff Within walking distance to Westfield And underground
32325,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Prices at the bar were expensive 3 50 for a bottle of beer, Excellent value convenient location right next to underground station Staff were very friendly and rooms were clean and comfortable
32326,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room we booked was to accommodate my husband and I with our adult disabled son in a wheelchair It was a little bit of a squeeze as we need so much equipment The facilities were fine but room would have been better with 2 beds or 3 beds in a larger room, Staff were particularly helpful It was good to find a room with disabled access that would sleep three as we needed 2 carers to look after a disabled adult
32327,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Noise coming from the pump in my basement room going intermittently throughout the night and sound of water running past bed kept me awake Door lock didn t work properly Room shabby Couldn t plug kettle in amd watch tv at same time Room cold , Staff friendly 
32328,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Hotel description not accurate It does say parking available when it is not They advise you to park about 20 mins walk away from the hotel which is not really great because at this time of year the weather makes it difficult for you to do that , The hotel is stylish It has a small bar if you need a drink Little bit expensive but at least it s there if you need one
32329,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Our room was in the basement, Good hotel with friendly staff Nice location 5 min to Westfild shopping mall and 10 min to shepherds bush station Room was small but nice Clean shower 
32330,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I requested for check in between 2 3 pm i arrived at around 2 45 and my room was not yet ready which was fine at the time I returned at 6 30 pm and still my room was not ready i was told the maid was preparing it and that it would not be long in fact i believe i had just seen them going there which was a room on the ground floor when in fact i had requested an upper floor room Apparently my upper floor room had no hot water so they had to put me on the ground level At around 7 30 pm i was showed to my room which was a very very small standard double sitting at the edge of the bed my feet touched the door I was extremely upset and did not feel comfortable The receptionist who was with me at the time assured me he would try to sort it out and get back to me after he did not return i went to reception to find out what was being done Finally i was given a room on the first floor that looked very much like what i had booked small but happy with more room to move and and more like the king size bed i wanted The receptionist did do what he could to help me and was quite friendly and patient am sure it was not all his doing it looked more like he had been told to offer me what i had been given Hotel is definitely smaller in reality than they look in the picture, I found the hotel very clean the staff were friendly and ideal location to shopping area The room had all the necessities for a comfortable stay
32331,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Bathroom tiled and very cold because lacked any heating being a small room underfloor heating could have been installed and would have transformed the room Also water was never particularly hot Cleaner always left room window wide open so we came back to a COLD room every evening Air con is being upgraded but ours wanted to blow out cold air rather than warm so reception had to provide us with an electric heater , Location was great for our purpose 
32332,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The hotel is a relatively small it seems many rooms have been squeezed in a small space My room was very small and therefore too expensive for the 167 I paid For a lower price it would be acceptable, Convenient location breakfast included clean pleasant staff
32333,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast choice was good but poor quality Our room wasn t that big the toilet seat was broken the bin was broken the bed was lumpy only 1 pillow provided , All staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is modern and ideally placed next to tube station and Shepherd s Bush Market There was absolutely no noise from outside Good air con in room 
32334,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was tiny and the bed was up against a wall my husband is a tall man the bed literally was against 3 walls room was warm and quite noisy from 7am We were there only a night luckily and for 1 night it was ok if the look on top of the wall thing in room 001 it s vey dusty and there is a Samsung remote which judging by the dust as been there a Long time we just left it there it was only because as I said my husbands tall and could see it the kettle you have to fill with a tea cup as the bathroom sink is a space saver entertaining I m gluten free as I m coeliac I did email to ask if I would be catered for and to let me know if not this was a good amount of time prior to arrival having asked if this would be a problem and not having received communication I thought was ok which was foolish I should have rang I was told on arrival that I could have an egg and that was it I felt they should have responded and advised this prior to my arrival so we could have booked elsewhere that did , The location was ideal for Shepherd s Bush empire and the underground They let you leave luggage If you have no dietary requirements breakfast is fine it s a continental and choice cereal toast some cakes waffles etc The shower room was clean bedding was clean and there was kettle mini fridge hairdryer ironing board and iron tea coffee milk being in a basement with no windows was weird but didn t bother us
32335,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room a bit small no windows Overnight noise from nearby businesses tube station , Vibrant multi cultural area Convenient for Tube Stations Bus services walking Lovely friendly staff 
32336,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, kind of hard to locate the hotel when u are in london , The beds were really comfy and the food was really cheap would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone 
32337,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, i have stayed in this hotel several times and have always had a good experience however my last stay room 206 I booked a kingsize room very small bathroom door cold not open fully the smell of damp and or sewage was foul,No Positive

32340,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, When we got there we were told our room was a basement room with no window This would not so We were not happy that we had to pay to get a different room, The location was ideal for what we needed Nice friendly staff
32341,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The so called family room was a bouble room with an extra 2 single beds squashed in No room for cases 1 seat for 4 of us Snelled of dampness and issue with smell from rhe drains Advised staff and having been advised there was another room we were then advised there was no way we could chnge Room in a basement Not pleasant, Not a lot It was clean
32342,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel friendly staff Although on a busy street the hotel is set back from the road and the room was very quiet Great location for Shepherds Bush tube station easy access to central London Recommended
32343,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Smallest sink ever Could not wash our faces in it with small shelf over it Entrance to property is very off putting same cigarette butts and trash in front all week Misrepresented Rooms cabin sized Had to change room due to severe sewer smell on third day , Earnestina was always pleasant and helpful Tube station very convenient 
32344,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was tiny for the money paid I have stayed at hotels with bigger rooms for less and in better areas I was quite annoyed because I booked the early deal pay now for two nights instead of one I realised immediately and emailed for help I was more than happy to pay up front as I wanted this but I had made a mistake with days I was told I couldn t change it and get a refund for one night I find this unhelpful and irritating as I didn t change my mind nor was I being a nuisance I realised witching 30 seconds and spoke to someone Money making is clearly important to the hotel I can see why as having been there I would not go back , The location of the hotel was ideal for shopping at Westfield and for the event we went to 
32345,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was extremely hot and there were no instruction on how to change it Also the breakfast was a little disappointing there were no vegan options except fruit , Ideal location for our needs VERY helpful staff comfy room lovely bathroom 
32346,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nothing to do with the hotel but parking is a bit of a challenge as you d expect , I had an economy room in the basement No window but that didnt worry me it had aircon and was comfy and well appointed Nice extras such as a range of toiletries bathrobes slippers completed the boutique image Most important the room rate was brilliant 
32347,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel,No Negative, location right outside tube close to Westfield shopping and we walked to the Thames and saw some great pubs Opposite the Shepherds Bush Market Small but nice little outside area off the street where we sat and had lunch Would recommend it to others and would return Very busy older part of London but we knew that Continental breakfast good 
32348,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room and toilet a bit small but well equipped , Really nice staff just right next to Shepherd s bush Market station 5 mins walk to O2 Shepperd Bush 7 mins to Westfield Best location 
32349,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, wall is not sound proof you could even hear people snoring next door television sounds and people talking Also have been allocated a room beside a public toilet and can hear the door slamming couple of times at the middle of the night Didn t have a good sleep for 3 nights ,No Positive

32351,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Wi Fi issues part of hour stay Breakfast only toast nice coffe though Lack of restaurants outside close to hotel We walked to Westfield area for dinner , Location close to Westfield Shopping and underground both Shepheards Bush and SP market Booked early and got a nice price some people perhaps pays twice as much and it would not be worth it Nice clean room 
32352,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The poor customer service having not been able to stay in our room due to it being dirty and damp Not a quad family room at all, The location for the Westfield Shopping Centre is the only good thing I can say
32353,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Location difficult to find SAT NAV very near but still no sign to show entrance from main road Heavy traffic meant an hour wasted going round in circles Car parking not convenient , staff tube station very handy 
32354,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room was so small you could hear everything going on around no window in the room it becomes depressing after some time I had to request extension cable to plug coffee maker and my laptop , Location staff The room was new and nicely designed
32355,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Toilet seat was not attached properly and slide to the side and the button to flush was broken so hard to push It s a cobbled street up to the house so difficult to bring a suitcase along , Lady on reception was really helpful and took me up to my room Nice sized room and the shower was good It s right next to the overground station and a 10 min walk from the tube Next to Westfield shopping centre 
32356,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Some reception staff very helpful but some largely indifferent the main point I have in mind being their willingness or sometimes lack of it to allow us to pull into the hotel car park area for a few minutes to drop off luggage , Good location close to tube station and Westfield shopping centre where we were able to park our car Plenty is shops bars and restaurants within easy walking distance 
32357,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Room was very small but fine for me Toilet water made a lot of noise door wouldn t shut easily had to get receptionist to help me and struggled to lock it securely by myself , Location was great for Shepherd s Bush empire and for Westfield shopping centre Comfortable room shower fantastic and clean 
32358,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Internet did not revealed true location which was awful no proper bar or restaurant expensive for what we got and stuffy cramped rooms Bathroom was so small we kept hitting ourselves Very poor indeed would not go again or recommend a boutique hotel it is not , Looked great on internet nothing else

32360,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, not sure if I can only some of the rooms but ok for a few nights , very nice place just check on rooms as some are on the small side next to station but no nose 
32361,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, There was a very funky smell possibly coming from the bathroom possibly the drains Breakfast could have been better I would suggest having the radio on in the breakfast room as felt very awkward and quite in there Also no fire exit signs ANYWHERE Not even in the basement breakfast room , Loved the room very cute and tidy Not too much going on 
32362,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was good but wished it would have contained also heavier stuff such as bacon sausages etc , Clean and stylish place excellent location just next to Shepherd s Bush Market underground station Would recommend 
32363,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Noise isolation was not good Even somebody walking around could be heard from the room It feels like that you are in an wooden building , Location It is just beside the Metro station Also plenty of small eateries around the hotel 
32364,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Needs soundproofing and the wifi sorted Also the access to the hotel is difficult for disabled travellers as its cobbled and needs a ramp, Great staff who went out of their way to help me as I was in my wheelchair

32369,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The Drains smelt badly in the Bathroom and the Air conditioning is loud the Breakfast room is in the Basement with no windows it felt hot and claustrophobic to us , Location was close to Shepherds Bush Tube Room was modern and clean had a fridge hairdryer and good shower felt safe and secure on the first floor Staff were polite and friendly Lift to upper floors 
32370,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, when we arrived we found that the sheets of the bed weren t switched and with hair of the previous guests , The breakfast has plenty of food bread croissant jam pancakes butter cheese eggs yogurt apple banana coffee milk juice The hotel is localized near of shepherd s bush market underground 
32371,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, I knew I had booked a room in the basement with no window but it was truly tiny with a very low ceiling and not even a chair to sit on Claustrophobics stay out of that basement Also WiFi did NOT work at all in the basement rooms , Convenient location right next to Shepherd s Bush Market tube station Clean Modern rooms modern furniture Nice good shower 
32372,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, My room was situated at the bottom of the stairs nd below receptions All nght I could hear People moving around upstairs and in the morning everyone coming down the stairs for breakfast Also the main watertank must of been near me and could hear a constant running of water in the morning Did not get a good sleep at all , The cleanliness of the hotel
32373,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Nothing except for the smoker that set off the fire alarm twice in 3 nights Would book again , Great location literally next to Shepherd s Bush Market Station with Westfield and Shepherd s Bush station less than 10 minutes walking Hardworking staff that really did everything to help and accomodate us It s a new building so everything was spotless and in working order particularly the AC and the WiFi

32379,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, No Cooked Breakfast but minor as what was availble was great, Location perfect clean hotel great staff Had eye surgery at Westfield and felt very comfortable here
32380,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, there was no parking facilities was hard to find on sat nav we had to park up and ask for directions The room was ridiculous hot we had windows open fan on air conditioning on but it was stiflingly it was much cooler outside The breakfast was continental style lovely and fresh but my partner likes a full english, The hotel was spotless reception staff couldn t do enough for you The room was lovely and clean 
32381,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The wifi should be improved D, It is exactly next to a underground station but is not affected by the noise at all I would say the facilities looks very good and staff are very warm I travel with two young cousins and they were surprised by the extraordinary clean room and very good breakfast services Strongly recommend 
32382,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Little small and admittedly the neighborhood isn t exactly downtown but perfect budget hotel , Great value while not centrally located it is literally 50 feet from a tube station
32383,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Staff weren t very helpful on check in no directions were given to our room and the corridors aren t your average long straight corridors that are easily located When we found our room our luggage had just been dumped right in the doorway I had to ask where we had breakfast as no info was given on check in I just had a general feel that the staff either weren t very well trained or they aren t very happy in their job I am gluten intolerant and in the morning at breakfast the hostess didn t understand my requirements all I asked for was gluten free bread and in response got the bread is over there as if I was stupid We stayed in a hotel In Shepherd s Bush with the same star rating a few nights previously and in comparison for a similar price this hotel was slightly disappointing , The air conditioning was very good and wifi effective Facilities were clean bedding very good quality and shower nice and strong The hotel kindly held our luggage as we arrived early and weren t leaving the city till later the following night 
32384,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, Need 24h room service no cleaners after 4pm meaning if u need clean laundry and etc you will have to do it yourself hotel has no facilities other than breakfast lounge which is very small with no variety Overall this is a 2 hotel at best , The staff are friendly although some are not very helpful as they don t even know the extension for the reception

32389,Shepherd s Bush Boutique Hotel, The room was a lot cheaper then it s price tag Only one socket in the entire room Holes in the furniture My King room which I paid a premium for was actually two single beds pushed and not secured together and the room was tiny even for a double No cooked breakfast options I felt like I was mislead and I could have got a lot more for my money elsewhere If I was charged half the price then I d consider it fair value for money , The staff where friendly and helpful
