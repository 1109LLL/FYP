177175,Le A, everything was ok, it s a small hotel but very well located and also charming the whole staff is very courteous the room was super with one of the best beds I have a chance sleep in a hotel this is really a boutique hotel where guests can fell Paris atmosphere
177176,Le A, The room is too small and the cleaning of the bathroom is less satisfactory bit smelly everyday And the network is not good as well , Good location and nice staff
177177,Le A, For croissant and coffee paid 18 euros Room was ordered for 2 people but we got bed for one person Room was like a pocket very very small We had to change room and were charged extra 60 euros , 
177178,Le A, The blow dryer in the room was awful Coming from the US it s a simple nice touch to supply a good blow dryer Light switches and electrical outlets complicated and in inconvenient areas I would suggest the hotel staff stay in the hotel for a night with luggage etc to feel it out When you have to move around furniture to plug in phone etc those sort of things can be easily fixed Did not really like the shower somewhat complex one of those showers that is not enclosed all the way water on the floor common in Europe , Overall good value A 4 minute walk from Champs Elysees However there are many great areas in Paris that are also great besides Champs Elysees The staff was warm and friendly Good location to take Uber from as they can pick you up right in front of the hotel Taxis they can request for you or you can walk a block hail a taxi yourself We booked the junior suite size was good for 2 people However the room could add some nice touches as they show in the photos on website and booking com No cute pillows or flowers or color in the room All white For an art deco hotel you re expecting these sort of things but you really only see it in the lobby downstairs Overall a good value for the money You get what you pay for Good continental breakfast Croissants cereal yogurt coffee Very simple but nice Complimentary water in room is nice Junior suite is a decent size for Paris for 2 people 
177179,Le A,No Negative, Small but modern and sofisticated hotel Very convenient because of its perfect and central location just 2 min walk to Champs Elysees Desk staff was very helpful and had a nice detail with the tea time goodies offered by the hotel Super service Wifi worked fast and perfectly all over the hotel Breakfast was simple but good enough since you can request egg dish on the moment Breakfast manager was also very kind and with a smile on her face all the time 
177180,Le A, The minibar is placed in the wardrobe the heat discharge from the minibar builds up in the wardrobe and feels like a hazard with the heat building in the wardrobe this is something that facilities housekeeping may consider looking into Room sizes are small for the price this is generally true for Paris as a whole so not a specific to the hotel , This was our first experience with a boutique hotel and overall it was very pleasant and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel Some of the things we particularly liked are Staff are very friendly attentive and are willing to help the guests to their utmost Property is managed really well and is clean and welcoming including housekeeping of the room and toilette Personally we loved the minimalist design and decor extensive use of white and grey with very clean lines which does make the rooms feel bigger and airy than they generally are 
177181,Le A,No Negative, Small hotel with bohemian feel and very comfortable The staff was very friendly helpful and attentive Helped us with directions and use of the metro Great location just off of Champs Elysees and metro stops 
177182,Le A, The glass partition of the bath tub is rather too short so when standing taking a shower it could not prevent water from wetting the floor Room size a bit too small if you have 2 normal size suitcases they will not fit in luckily we brought only 2 carry ons so it was ok , Good locatio Good service All those receptionists were helpful 
177183,Le A, If the rooms were bigger and if the bathroom had more space But it s not bad at all Also on Sunday room service is closed which sucks, I loved the attention to detail in the room the amenities were of high quality and they were generous with them the towels are large and of good quality waterfall shower is beautiful the staff are exceptionally amazing 
177184,Le A,No Negative, Hotel is modern and clean rooms are nice bed is very comfy and bathroom is fantastic 5 min walk from Champs Elysees Staff are very helpful and kind I can t complain about anything 
177185,Le A,No Negative, The hotel is everything you want for a lovely long break in Paris excellent staff and facilities and the location was perfect Best hotel I have stayed in where the service from the staff was exceptional and I travel all over the world Will be staying here always when visiting Paris 
177186,Le A,No Negative, The wonderful and warm staff The comfortable bed The bottle of water in the room every day The l Occitane products The rain shower and bath in bathroom The fantastic breakfast selection and kindness and attentiveness of waiting staff each morning The location The welcome drink on arrival Basically everything 
177187,Le A, Nothing , The staff were extremely helpful when it came to organising a coach journey for us to get to Beauvais airport as we didn t realise how far away it actually was Very friendly rooms perfect with lots of space they were lovely clean Will be returning without a second thought 
177188,Le A,No Negative, Jewel of this hotel are their staff specially Hani and the nice lady from the breakfast Everything was perfect comfortable room size and clean facilities delicious breakfast and outstanding customer service I would always come back because of the great people they hire super location and just a short walk from the city Loved it 
177189,Le A, Nothing everything was wonderful , Very nice hotel Great location very close to Metro stations and to coffees and restaurants The stuff was helpful and kind The room was very clean big and comfortable 
177190,Le A, Although there is a parking place available for guests However there is only two parking spaces for the hotel and only 1 key that you are not allowed to keep Also you have to return your room key evertime you go out which makes it very unconveniant to go through when you have lots of stuff a baby to carry and another car waiting behind you to get through So don t plan to rent a car in paris , The location of the hotel is very close to champs elysees The hotel staff are very kind and helpful The room was a bit small but that was expected for hotels in Europe We really enjoyed staying there 
177191,Le A, I was lucky I had an inernal room the street rooms gets noisy on the weekends As it is a boutique hotel forget about room service after 10 30 pm , The people working there are great Helpful polite The hotel is great location is great regarding metro and near everything Would go again anytime 
177192,Le A, Room on the last floor was quite small Fiddly shower Did not find out until we left how we could light up only some of the lights in the room seemed to be all or nothing, Excellent location in the city center Comfortable beds Good breakfast with a large choice of cold items youghurs cheese charcuterie jams croissants etc and eggs on demand Very helpful staff Although I did not request it in advance they kindly checked us in at 11 o clock instead of 15
177193,Le A, I m used to larger rooms but concede the size of the room would be normal for mid Paris location , Liked everything about this hotel extremely helpful staff clean and bright rooms with balcony view on to street scene interesting art excellent location with good little restaurant across the road Would certainly recommend to others 
177194,Le A,No Negative, Great location just off the Champs Elysees and very close to a metro station Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful Rooms are modern and very nice bed very comfortable 
177195,Le A,No Negative, Le A was clean perfectly located but most of all the staff were the friendliest and most helpful team we have ever encountered in a hotel stay Nothing was too much trouble Thank you for a wonderful stay we ll definitely be back 
177196,Le A, a girl with a reception service is not too kind and lazy with questions of booking restaurants or search for other information about Paris It is not right ,No Positive
177197,Le A, Nothing to declare , Amazing staff good location just 5 mins away from Champs lys es quit and safe they offering free coffee and drinks afternoon time the staff are nice to chat with and they speaking different languages 
177198,Le A, At check in the reception staff told me the room came with complimentary breakfast but at checkout it was charged on my bill and they said my room didn t come with breakfast they told me i have to pay now and email the hotel and they ll see what they can do Cleanliness could be improved some towels have stains and the room carpets aren t always thoroughly vacuumed I didn t like the painting on the wall it seemed twisted or somewhat satanic even scared my little boy Laundry is too expensive I booked the junior suite didn t seem like one at all , The staff are very kind and helpful The location is great less than a 5 min walk from the Champs Elysees I enjoyed my 7 night stay at this hotel 
177199,Le A, The room is extremely small We had 2 medium pieces of luggage that we couldn t fit in We had to remive a table and a chair to be able to put our luggage and we could barely walk in the room The bathroom was stinky from day one and we were told that nothing could be done about it , The location is just perfect The rooms are modern and nicely decorated 
177200,Le A, Street noise, The staff are fantastic Couldn t be more helpful and friendly from recommending and arranging dinner reservations visits to attractions arranging taxis The hotel is beautifully decorated with interesting art a break away from standard hotel decor Great breakfasts and fantastic location within easy walking distance of everything We would definitely stay here again without hesitation 
177201,Le A, No issue with room or staff Can t comment on food as didn t have any However we did have a nightcap in the bar and got 2drinks on the rocks no mixers and they were 12 each which was expensive Just ask for the menu before ordering , Room was clean and comfortable Shower was amazing and the toiletries were a nice touch Location right by a metro stop was very convenient could get anywhere in the city easily Herbal teas in room were nice 
177202,Le A, Issues with our room but management understand and did their best after knowledge of it to resolve the matter Thank you to the manager for that Will come back next year most likely to see our room is fixed , Like the staff recommendation for dinner and overall all staffs were good Good breakfast french style with buffet Good location near Champs lys e and near subway 
177203,Le A,No Negative, The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble The location is great with nice bakeries and cafes close by We got a free upgrade as our room wasn t ready on check in and the staff couldn t have done more for us The junior suite was spacious with a nice bath and separate shower very comfy bed and clean white decoration I would highly recommend this boutique hotel 
177204,Le A, Nothing It was all great , The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and while I spoke rather well in French they were understanding of my boyfriend only being able to speak English The rooms were also gorgeous 
177205,Le A, I used Hipmunk to find your hotel and their website stated on two different pages that breakfast was included in the room price However Hotel com which actually booked my stay when I clicked through to choose a room had no breakfast included This was unclear and contrary advertising of your hotel The internet connection was unfortunately fairly weak , The wonderful shower and comfortable bed The front desk staff was also very helpful 
177206,Le A,No Negative, We were at the hotel after the horrific events of Friday 13th The staff were all so helpful reassuring and concerned All of the events we had planned were cancelled and their suggestion of where to eat for a special birthday meal was spectacular
