395573,Hotel Beethoven Wien,No Negative, IAt the end of a Danube River cruise my husband and I stayed in Vienna for two extra days I wanted a hotel with local vintage charm and modern comfort On Trip Advisor I found a hotel review with the words My husband loved the smoked salmon at breakfast included Well MY husband loves smoked salmon too I booked it What a lovely hotel We had room 406 Gracious elegant spotlessly clean fantastic bed lavish breakfast in a lovely setting COLD air conditioning opening casement windows behind thick velvet drapes view of the Vienna Theatre with its plaques honoring Beethoven and many others Elevator but also beautiful marble stairs leading down to the beautiful lounge and breakfast rooms 24 hour coffee and tea with some pastries and fruit if you wished The location was also perfect 3 blocks from The Ring and right beside the Naschmarkt where we browsed the food stands and ate two excellent open air dinners Sadly we left on Saturday and missed the weekly Sunday house concert played by an ensemble in the lovely lounge Turned out to be economical also as we could walk to everything My husband said I love this place 
395574,Hotel Beethoven Wien, Coffee served at breakfast wasn t the best, The Hotel was closed last year for 6 months for modernisation and how it showed excellent modern bathroom with wet floor shower and all modern fitments D cor freshly done bed linen excellent The Sunday evening short concert with complementary glass of sparkling wine was a nice touch
395575,Hotel Beethoven Wien,No Negative, Everything to like especially free Sunday night chamber music concerts for guests Fabulous breakfasts and a garden for enjoying it as well as indoor space We ve stayed there before the remodel which is terrific with each floor a different Viennese theme We knew our room would be small but it still had a nice desk area and two lounge chairs Huge window so good air flow though no view as we knew would be the case so no disappointment Beautiful modern bathroom very well designed Just a block from Secession and entry to Karlplatz underground transport area so you can walk all the way to the old town walk streets without having to cross any boulevards About 100 yards to Naschmarkt with every choice of food and wine and resturants you can imagine We will stay there again everyone is so friendly it s a great place 
395576,Hotel Beethoven Wien, The room was very small felt crowded for two for the price of hotel although city hotels tend to be small I m told The location was safe Vienna is said to be so but the hotel feels a little isolated a half block from a busy street , The decor of the lobby and dining areas were very nice Great breakfast very helpful concierge Short walk to Opera and museums close to metro station and fairly close two stations from Hauptbahnhof inter country train station Grateful for air conditioned rooms and lovely bedding Loved the Sunday 6 pm classical recital at hotel 
395577,Hotel Beethoven Wien, Jotjing, The hotel was excellent The staff were helpful with tickets lost luggage and left cal information The room was super clean and comfy There were complimentary refreshments on the mezzanine floor and breakfast had healthy options as well as hot options I am hard to impress but was with the hotel The only problem was the bath was a bit slippery and the mats did not solve the problem

395605,Hotel Beethoven Wien, The electric outlets in my room blew out when I plugged in my extension cord But the lady at the front desk fixed it herself right away , Staff is great and so is the extremely ample and tasty breakfast that comes with the room price Right next to the market with lots of food for sale and good restaurants Quiet street I liked the design of this small hotel It felt very safe and pleasant 
395606,Hotel Beethoven Wien, Great corner bedroom but it had an awkward step beside the bed Also a great tub but no way to fix the shower to ensure the water did not go all over the floor and then into the bedroom , Very quiet considering the busy streets nearby Good ambience with a great position near the Nacht market and the museum and palace area

395618,Hotel Beethoven Wien, Felt the Bistro area was a little pokey and although one could have the meal upstairs and that was fine would perhaps have been nice if there had been somewhere to order and eat together in different area , The ambience and comfort of the hotel was lovely breakfast good and very nice lounge area upstairs with complimentary tea and coffee and little cakes As single rooms they were of a reasonable size 
395619,Hotel Beethoven Wien, It would be nice to have a few books about Vienna by Rick Steves in the hotel library which would be very helpful for the international visitors , Very helpful friendly hotel team Very clean quiet room Convenient location close to State Opera St Stephen Cathedral and the main city sightseeings museums and restaurants Wonderful breakfast in the hotel with a big variety and a lot of very good food excellent coffee It was very convenient to be met by the taxi in the airport and then be delivered back to the airport by the taxi which has been ordered and organized by the receptionists for a good price Sunday evening one hour concert of classic music with a complimentary glass of champagne is a nice touch Thank you very much for everything to the nice friendly helpful hotel staff

395630,Hotel Beethoven Wien, We booked this hotel for three nights for the New Year 30 Dec 2 January The price was high for the hotel outside the Ring but this was expected for the holiday period I specifically emailed the hotel after booking the room and asked for a quiet and renovated room otherwise I would not book They responded that they will provide a quiet room However when we arrived we were provided with a very noisy room right next to the elevator and with window facing the wall of the opposite building As the room was tiny the bed was essentially right next to the elevator wall You can hear elevator well The room was also very dated We asked to change to a quieter room and the reception was not very nice and helpful The lady started telling us that the room is quiet while we could hear the elevator well At the end they agreed to wait more than an hour in the lobby in order for them to change our room Not very nice attitude by the staff They could not even recommend a good place to eat Overall this hotel is outside the center at least 10 min walk to the Opera and 20min walk to the Stephansdom the rooms are tiny and interior is very dated The breakfast was very average This is not a 4 star quality more like a three star average hotel Well overpriced for the quality , Vienna is amazing so even this hotel could not spoil our experience 
395631,Hotel Beethoven Wien,No Negative, Breakfast was lovely especially if you like honey The hotel is spacious and the staff very friendly They provide a guest lounge with coffee tea and cake Here they have an informal recital on Sunday evenings ours was with a pianist and a cellist and was very good The hotel is easy to reach from the Ubahn station follow the directions on the hotel s website Also very close to the Altstadt and easy for a day trip to Schonbrunn 
395632,Hotel Beethoven Wien, I thought the cleaning staff could have noticed a few cobwebs on the bathroom ceiling or the thick layer of dust on the inside of the bathroom door , The location was great close to the opera house shopping and sites Breakfast buffet had a nice assortment but no vegetarian sausages or cheeses 
395633,Hotel Beethoven Wien, The room lighting was slightly too dark for reading Perhaps one more blighter stand or additional wall light could improve this aspect Also somehow the sound from other floors etc were quite penetrating and even though it wasn t unpleasant noise I was surprised that the walls and doors were not very sound proof , Location next to the theater you can actually watch the artists rehearsing across the huge panoramic window Very good size for a bathroom bath tub sink toilet good storage furniture plenty of drawers and closet besides a good size solid desk stationary supplies invitation to lovely Sunday evening concert with champagne though I had a conflicting schedule couldn t attend Beautiful lounge with a piano a lots of books on music art and history Beautiful samovars for the breakfast tea Matching pink flowers on the table very romantic and pink napkins y

395638,Hotel Beethoven Wien, Structure of the building seems to prevent more than one small lift which was sometimes used by domestic staff cleaning the rooms in the morning as well Wifi connection was frustratingly inconsistent Mostly slow poor or not working Two Internet stations were in operation most of the time in the lobby Told the provider was trying to fix the problem , Excellent location for opera and other music Close to main major museums and galleries Close to night market Plenty of nearby eating options Friendly and helpful staff always on duty 24 hours Breakfast provided many choices for our seven day stay This would be our first choice for another visit to Vienna

395643,Hotel Beethoven Wien, We were ripped off The booking com site for this hotel says there is a garage for 20 euros I left the car in the garage and when I went to pick it up two days later was charged 37 euros per day I asked the hotel staff and they told me I needed to present a ticket from the hotel to get that price at the garage I explained to them that I had asked several times for directions about the parking but the hotel staff said nothing about a ticket They replied that since I had payed with a credit card there was nothing they could do So my parking for two days costed 75 euros I find this situation totally unaceptable The room was small not clean at all and the bathroom had no ventilation and smelled I would have been better sleeping at the car , Location
