209267,H tel Powers, Overall the staff are not so friendly The hotel is old on the inside and not entertaining at all The lobby area is miniscule and there s no music or anything So it feels a bit dull , I think the location is strategic and close to so many attractions The hotel looks nice on the outside 
209268,H tel Powers, The hotel is getting old Some staff members are not as professional Aircondition didn t work Housekeeping was poor Didn t replace dirty cups lotions although replaced towels promptly Complained once but they didn t address it When I told the staff as we checked out but the staff told me that I had to continue to let them know Hmm once should be enough for them to address it I wouldn t recommend it to friends and I wouldn t go back there again The area has so many options near in good locations with similar prices , Location 
209269,H tel Powers, It would have been nice to have had a bathtub , All of the professional staff at Hotel Powers really made my stay special so merci beaucoup to all of them From the moment that I arrived Gilles was especially attentive and helpful The room I was given on the first night was not what I expected from the photos on Booking com but he made sure that I was given a very nice room for the rest of my stay Both rooms were very comfortable and clean They were charming yet had all the modern amenities to make my stay comfortable The lobby and dining room were inviting and elegant Great location to walk to the Champs Elysee s for dining and shopping I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel or stay there again for a delightful Paris experience 
209270,H tel Powers, Air conditioning could have been a bit cooler typical Americans It was very warm in Paris but the night cooled down Jacuzzi tub could have been cleaner , Bed was heaven and pillows High end toiletries very nice Staff was lovey friendly helpful and great recommendations for the city and dinner 
209271,H tel Powers, we made reservations for 3 rooms unfortunately we had to cancel one rooms because one of us was involved in accident with the car injured moved to hospital and got a surgery we offered to submit an official document from hospital the hotrl did not show any understanding sympathy ir compassion and the hotel insisted on charging us and gave us penalty There s a lot of hotels in paris i will not choose kind of hotels What about you , The room is big
209272,H tel Powers, The only negative for me was that the bed was hard as a rock For the money spent a pillow top mattress would have been nice , The staff were very helpful and friendly The location is excellent A short walk to the Georges V metro stop a taxi stand across the street as well as the 32 bus which I took to the Eiffel Tower and Roland Garros stadium Restaurants line the block A 1 minute walk to the Champs de elysee with all the shops and restaurants you could ask for 
209273,H tel Powers, The big keys to open the door it was a bit old fashion you have lack the room s door with those huge keys when you re in the room, Great location
209274,H tel Powers,No Negative, Excellent hotel staff was outstanding Front desk were kind and very hospitable Location 200 meters from Champs Elysee Fabulous Bravo Hotel Powers 
209275,H tel Powers, Perhaps because located in the middle of the building the room where I stayed number 36 did not benefit from a strong signal which resulted in unreliable wi fi connection which was free i e included in the tariff In the common areas of the hotel including the reception the signal was ok , Excellent location close to the Champs Elys es good both for tourism and business Spacious bedroom very comfortable bed modern and perfectly working bathroom Friendly staff continuously attentive to the well being and satisfaction of the guests 
209276,H tel Powers,No Negative, Nice room A little dated but very spacious and with a large modern bathroom We were on the first floor with a window facing the street so the room was noisy Breakfast is just fine but you have a lot of coffee shops and restaurants within 2 blocks I strongly suggest going out instead of the hotel breakfast 
209277,H tel Powers, The only slight criticism is the price of breakfast which seemed steep even for a city centre location we chose to eat breakfast out , The Reception team were friendly and helpful The room was airy and light with some lovely period features and the balcony overlooked an attractive road with the Eiffel Tower just visible above the buildings opposite The bed was extremely comfortable We loved the proximity to the Champs Elysees with its shops and restaurants and Charles De Gaulle Etoile was within 5 10 minutes walk We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
209278,H tel Powers, The room was unfortunately quite noisy and the bathroom was cramped , Beautiful old building which still retains its old world charm despite its conversion to a modern hotel Friendly staff and comfortable and clean room 
209279,H tel Powers, Cleanliness NOT smoke free in the rooms and hallways Rude night shift First two days until I confronted them Rooms smelled and dingy Need major upgrade Definitely NOT 4 STAR 2 star at most , Location That all 
209280,H tel Powers,No Negative, Located in Paris Golden Triangle and just a block from the Champs Elysees the location was absolutely fantastic Great restaurants shops and a metro station are all within a short walking distance from the hotel The hotel is aging but full of charm and well maintained Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated Loved the balcony and the view A big thank you to the front desk staff who were wonderful accommodating and always so friendly They really made our stay very enjoyable and we look forward to staying here again 
209281,H tel Powers, Bath had mold Bed cover has seen better days Obvious stains and has not seen a washing machine for years Noise from the street Had to return the keys every time I left, Location concierge
209282,H tel Powers, The furniture is old and narrow the doors are the same old the bathroom is small the toothpick and the shawl accessory you have to ask at reception, The staff is very kind
209283,H tel Powers, We d booked a junior suite and were originally assigned to one on the sixth floor which was a very different quality and type of room to the junior suites advertised on the hotel website I appreciate not all rooms can be photographed but the webpage should at least be indicative of the quality type of room you are booking The staff were helpful in moving us to a different room for the remainder of the stay However the room we were put in pictures provided looked like the deluxe room on the website While it was better than the room we were in it either wasn t a junior suite which raises questions around the equity of pricing for deluxe suites vs junior suites or the pictures on the website are very misleading , Good location very clean nice old fashioned hotel free wifi and helpful night staff 
209284,H tel Powers, Wifi was down for the first day which was disappointing but the staff were extremely helpful , Awesome location lovely staff helpful service close to all the sites and public transport 
209285,H tel Powers, elevator is small and always breaking small lobby no arabic TV channels I didn t try the hotel restaurant , location cleanness wifi speed amenities staff housekeeping security balcony etc 
209286,H tel Powers,No Negative, Great boutique hotel 1block off Champs Elysees Had the smallest room there but still very comfortable Did not want or expect a large modern North American hotel Exactly what we wanted Great location for shopping and wandering 
209287,H tel Powers, Perhaps the hotel could offer guests free bottles of drinking water , This was our third visit to the property We love the location of the hotel and the ambiance of the rooms This time we had a room on the 1st floor which was really large for Paris standards Our bathroom was lovely and we even had our own walk in closet 
209288,H tel Powers,No Negative, The staff were lovely and very helpful The hotel has a lot of character and is in a convenient location for sightseeing it s also very close to the metro which is a great way to get around Paris Would definitely stay here again 
209289,H tel Powers,No Negative, Cute little boutique hotel one block off of the Champs lys es I m sure we had the smallest room but it was clean with a new small bathroom and we were in Paris in an old building so did not expect or want a modern North American hotel Walking distance to Louvre 15 20 mins walked to the Eiffel Tower 10 15 mins Many many restaurants close by And shops every which way you turned Great for just window shopping in the evenings too Never felt unsafe in the area Front staff were courteous and helpful with all our questions Always a taxi or 2 waiting just across the street from the entrance to the hotel We did not have the breakfast offered I would return to this hotel and recommend it 
209290,H tel Powers, Bar was rather quiet I know that depends on guests at the hotel but it didn t seem to draw you in with its atmosphere , Staff were exceptionally efficient friendly and helpful Rooms spotless and position excellent 
209291,H tel Powers, We didn t have an open balcony a feature I was really looking forward to There was a lot of noise from an upstairs room one of the nights and upon telling reception in the morning I was not a fan of how they told me I could have called throughout the night and that there was nothing they could do I would have liked to have been offered some form of compensation for our stay as this is quite an expensive hotel per night I was made to feel a little like a silly child who had moaned about something ridiculous but at the end of the day this stay was a treat for me and my partner and not something I would usually splash out on so I was upset that I only got about 3 4 hours sleep on my second night , The bed was great it was huge and really comfortable We got upgraded which was really nice The staff were very efficient especially with room service The hotel is styled in a traditional Parisian way and the junior suite is an incredible size
209292,H tel Powers, I wanted to watch TV the cable wasnt plugged because it was broken i asked for help from reception unfortunately the technician wasnt available I found it outrageous for a room that cost me Eur 450 , The location is good and there is a big mirror above a chimney that are nice the only nice thing in the room
209293,H tel Powers, No slippers only a bath robe No facilities for make a coffee or a tea in the room , Right behind champ de Elyse beside Cartier jewellery shop and Rolex shop The only problem for me it was that in the room no kettle coffee or tea In the rest all perfect
209294,H tel Powers, Couldn t try the breakfast as at roughly 28 euros a head this was a bit much , Staff were amazing willing to help with everything and very friendly yet still professional couldn t be better Rooms were beautiful cleaners did an excellent job every day with the most incredible location best stay in Paris ever 
209295,H tel Powers,No Negative, Reserved for my Mother in law because it was just across the street from us They upgraded her to a room with an Eiffel Tower view and she couldn t be happier to get the full Parisian experience 
209296,H tel Powers, Maybe because it s an old building the wooden floor make noise No tea coffee maker for a 4 star hotel, Excellent location surrounded by shops and restaurants near to metro station very safe All staff are very helpful
209297,H tel Powers,No Negative, I have stayed in several hotels in Europe by far this is the sweetest one Location perfect staff perfect room decoration incredible heating system very very good We did ot want to go out from the room Strange but true 
209298,H tel Powers, It was difficult to use the wifi he disconnected And law signal The lift is very small, The staff are very kind and friendly they tried to helped us in any issues The location is perfect
209299,H tel Powers, The lift is a bit too small but since it looks like a vintage hotel so it s fine, The location is excellent just right next to the champs elysees and there are lots of shops around the hotel area More importantly the service and the staff is extrodinary Very friendly and nice staff 
209300,H tel Powers, The bathroom is very old with problems and it s maintenance is not serious and should be renew next time I will check it before I pay , Only the location
209301,H tel Powers,No Negative, Incredible location just minutes walk from the Champs lys es We received a free room upgrade with a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower which made our stay even more special The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble 
209302,H tel Powers, Our room was slightly hot most nights even with the control of thermostat, Staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel was beautiful and location was perfect central to everything 
209303,H tel Powers, The internet was unacceptable It s a shame that we live in the 21st century with such an internet connection No excuses for that , The staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent staff and treatment Best location you can dream of in Paris Beds very comfortable Look and feel very Parisienne I loved the woodwork at the lobby 
209304,H tel Powers, Breakfast is too expensive you can have it much cheaper at restaurants in the neighborhood Soundproofing is very bad you can listen people walking and talking in the other rooms even in uper floors , The excelent location near Champs Elises with restaurants and bars 10 minutes walking to nearest metro station 15 minutes walking to Petit and Grand Palais for exhibitions Good location for shoping For airport transfer there is a taxi stand just in front of the hotel 
209305,H tel Powers, The room seemed to be very hot Had to shut bathroom door at night too much light came in , The staff were friendly and helpful You could walk to some of the sights 
209306,H tel Powers, Hotel is dated and needs uplifting Rooms toilet are awkward it looks lik8an afterthought literally it was a partition inside the room , The location is prime within a walking distances from moda shops fine restaurants coffee shops and the Champselese
209307,H tel Powers, Not much I liked about this Hotel False advertising on Booking com do not book the superior double room you get a substandard double room Unless you book the deluxe room do not consider this hotel No toilet paper on arrival in room had to go and ask twice before they brought me some Room was cleaned only after 4pm Sauna was never on so don t know if it was even working No clean glasses replacing dirty ones in the room had to also go and ask All in all I will never stay in this Hotel again and do not recommend it at all to anyone One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in don t know how it gets a 4 star status , Comfortable bed
209308,H tel Powers, Poor room aminities No slippers No mouthwash or shaving kit , Breakfast was amazing also room service food Bed is really comfortable Wifi is fast All in all I recommend 
209309,H tel Powers, Bedroom floor was squeeky It disturbed me at night bc I could hear the guests upstairs walking and running around But that s me You might not feel it No English Channel except CNN My children watched Harry Potter in French , Located very close to Champs Elyse street Nice Small restaurants across the street for lunch and dinner Quick check in check out Everyone was just so friendly at the hotel I felt at home right away 5 10 min stroll to Eiffle tower I had a view of tip of the tower from my room Quiet street at night Internet was very fast Kids loved it I had prepaid SIM with 4G so I followed GPS found pretty much everything around the hotel Short walk to small supermarket too 
209310,H tel Powers, A Tea Coffee kettle in the room with the consumables should be provided it s standard in good hotels globally longer Room service hours, Good location good clean rooms small but clean bathroom good housekeeping friendly and helpful staff
209311,H tel Powers, Room was grossly over priced I have stayed at the Powers for almost 20 years Was my favorite hotel in Paris The room I was given was the worst in 20 years Will never go there again or recommend to friends and associates Paid for a Superior Room and got economy accommodations , Location
209312,H tel Powers, The hotel is a bit old which is part of the charm but some facilities could use an upgrade For the price it s nice and affordable , No frills comfortable hotel with great staff and wonderful location Nice breakfast and atmosphere Always enjoy staying here 
209313,H tel Powers, Wifi was no n existent nail 9pm each day, Very friendly staff Room on 6th floor had a great view of the Eiffel Tower Perfectly situated in a lovely area 
209314,H tel Powers, No tea coffee making facilities in the room , Boutique hotel Clean and friendly staff Would highly recommend the breakfast Lots of fresh breads croissants and cheeses 
209315,H tel Powers, The bathroom in my room was as if created in a cupboard The lift in the hotel should be changed it is very old , The location is excellent The breakfast was not great but the staff on hand went the extra mile to see you are comfortable 
209316,H tel Powers,No Negative, I like this hotel so much Very classic French style with wonderful service Perfect location and room service And our Parisian balcony is super big with spectacular street view 
209317,H tel Powers, Breakfast prices too high go out and enjoy the street cafe breakfasts at a third of the price, staff very helpful and good walking location for Eiffel Tower Champs Elyses Arc D Triumphe and the Seine Surrounded by restaurants 
209318,H tel Powers, The only thing is that all sounds coming from the streets could be heard quite clearly I d recommend bringing earplugs for the light sleepers among us , This was my 15th time in Paris and I can quite honestly say that with this hotel you cannot go wrong The spacious room atleast the deluxe room the facilities the balcony the location 1 a 2 min walk to champs elysees All magnifique 
209319,H tel Powers, Road noise outside in the early hours and most frustratingly being woken up at 06 00 hrs by the dustmen emptying the bins outside The double glazing totally insufficient to block what must be seen as a regular occurance given its location , Great location easy to reach all the main attractions Friendly staff and clean and tidy accomodation 
209320,H tel Powers, Nothing , Everything about this hotel was amazing the room was excellent great central location and a really good breakfast Also the staff could not do enough to help 
209321,H tel Powers, The bed was a bit too short for 180 cm 173 cm tall couple As a dairy free allergic I would have wished for soya milk and soya yoghurt with my breakfast , The interior was enjoyable staff polite rooms quiet We did enjoy 
209322,H tel Powers, Saddly the heating could not be turned of and at night it was then very warm in the room, The location of the hotel and the suite with the balcony was perfect 
209323,H tel Powers, The beds are so uncomofortable The whole hotel is so noisy with creaky floorboards and no sound isolation whatsoever There is no coffee and tea in the room , The location is excellent and the hotel looks elegant The staff is very friendly Unfortunately it is so uncomfortable I am a frequent traveller to paris for work and have tried all hotels in the vicinity and i won t repeat my experience with this one 
209324,H tel Powers,No Negative, This hotel is really in a convenient area to visit Paris In a very historic building it is a cosy hotel with nice rooms and nice view of Eifell Tower Definetly stay again 
209325,H tel Powers, The first day they gave us a very huge room The size of the room was perfect but the windows were opened to a closed area I mean no view no light And the neighbors of the hotel was making a lot of noise so it was impossible to sleep We requested to move to another room the staff was first wasn t helpful Then we said we would move to another hotel so they changed the room Last room was small but beautiful At the end of the day it is a beautiful hotel But nothing extraordinary , The location of the hotel is perfect 
209326,H tel Powers, Our Room was quite basic for what we paid I believe our room was the old staff quarters there was no tea and coffee making facilities It was also loud at night time we were woken up each morning around 4am from a nightclub just down the road Our bathroom door wouldn t close so we lacked privacy , Staff on Checkin were excellent Very Friendy Location is perfect and walking distance to everything for shopping and restaurants Bed was comfortable and nice bathroom products lovely 
209327,H tel Powers, Breakfast was a little bit expensive but didn t affect my enjoyment of the hotel stay and whole experience , Fantastic staff location and the rooms were really comfortable 
209328,H tel Powers, This may be a British thing and if so I appoligies but could have really done with tea and coffee making facilities in room , Beautiful architecture and luxuries rooms Feels just like you would imagine a Parisian hotel to be like excellent atmosphere Absolutely brilliant location 15 min to walk to Eiffel Tower 5 to main subway line 10 from arc de triumph and RER station Friendly staff Luxurious breakfast 
209329,H tel Powers, nothing, The staff were politly and helpfull Room big comparing to other paris hotels very clean and comfy The best thing the location steps from le champ And montaige st Carfure city store few blocks away Very nice for family
209330,H tel Powers, Wi Fi was usually out of signal , After we enter the recepiton they indicated that they have upgraded our room due to our honeymoon Hotel is very close to Champ Elysee backalley I do not know how they manage but the Hotel employees were always smiling with openhearted The room was fabulously clean and comfortable 
209331,H tel Powers, The room was a little dated and the Spa bath in the room did not work However these were minor minor things it was our first time in Paris and we were out for a significant part of our trip , Location Staff Cleanliness
209332,H tel Powers, The first room on the 6th annex floor had the most spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower and the bathroom was spacious and modern However and this is a big however the room itself was quite dismal and looked like a college dorm room very old and ugly furniture a picture of a huge flower in a 1970s frame no bedspreads I could go on and on not at all like picture on internet I did say in the nicest way I could to them that it was a shame that perhaps their room with perhaps the best view was so poorly furnished and decorated They switched us to another room on 4th floor that was gorgeous Be aware of particular room you are booking and even call the hotel to clarify We booked a suite but there is a huge dichotomy between suites When I asked the comanager about how to book the loveliest suite with the view rm 58 she was evasive and made it seem almost impossible to book in advance I hope they spend a little money and redecorate that 6th floor room asap , Yosef Kahn the concierge was fabulous He booked everything and went out of his way to find restaurants that we would love He was always there with a smile and exceptional service for my mother and myself We also loved the breakfast staff they were attentive well dressed and very friendly The breakfast had a huge selection and was in an extremely elegant room A great way to start our day We loved our second room though it didn t have Eiffel tower view it had a lovely street side view and the bed was extremely comfortable The chandelier is elegant though no candelabras on beautiful fireplace as in picture they are in the breakfast room The large jacuzzi bath was especially nice after a long day of walking and site seeing We adore Paris and this hotel is extremely well located 
209333,H tel Powers, The room type is different with the pic I saw in website Internet is too slow no tea cup and kettle in room , The bathroom is very big perfect for girls 
209334,H tel Powers, Hotel and the rooms need renovation limited choices for breakfast and one of the staff wasn t really friendly , Great location large sized rooms good room service and free wifi connection I would stay again 
209335,H tel Powers, Nothing , The location the breakfast cerial fruit meats smoked salmon selection of breads There is small selection of hot food Traditional Paris type hotel in converted town house 
209336,H tel Powers, There was nothing about our stay we didn t like Except perhaps the rain But even then the hotel provided umbrellas , Great location just minutes from both the Champs lys es and the metro Our room had a view of the Eiffel Towers was on the top floor and was quiet The bed and pillows were very comfy The staff were all very friendly spoke perfect English but helped me out when I tried to speak French We would definitely stay at this hotel again 
209337,H tel Powers, Paid for luxury room Would have liked to have seen standard as although room was nice enough not sure it was luxury Not cheap either but I guess I was paying for the location too , Excellent location Good sized clean room Nice breakfast 
209338,H tel Powers, I am not Sure it is their problem or it is something wrong with people booking by booking com the rooms offered to us was VERY TINY under Roof I checked out other rooms they were bigger that is the Only negative Point , it is Located in best and Shortest distance from coolest places in Paris 
209339,H tel Powers, I specifically wanted a view of the Eiffel tower and did not get it as requested until the 2nd night of our stay , the concierge was amazing I wanted to leave but stayed just because of him 
209340,H tel Powers, I booked a deluxe room and its written in booking that it has a balcony but our room didn t have one so I talked to the manager and she said that not all rooms have balcony I didn t like the key rooms and the breakfast was the same everyday The rooms didn t have coffee maker , Location is superb near to champs elysees avenue montaigne george V and the room is nicely decorated 
209341,H tel Powers,No Negative, Wanted a romantic weekend escape to Paris and this is exactly what we got Our room was amazing located on the top floor with a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower this was very unexpected and a wonderful surprise The bathroom was large the shower was good the bed was comfortable and the room very clean Location of the hotel was very central only a couple minutes walk to the champs lys es and about 10 to 15 to the Eiffel Tower it was also surrounded by lovely little cafes and bars Do not have a bad word to say and I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here 
209342,H tel Powers, A little bit disappointed there is no view of the window and air conditioner is loud Then I lost an important receipt in the room but they cannot find out for me which resulting the loss , Basically the staff is kind and room is very clean and comfortable 
209343,H tel Powers, Noisy floors when people walk , Staff were friendly and looked after me when I got sick after eating bad food from outside They knew that I was alone and helped me with medicine 
209344,H tel Powers, Ther s no coffee or tee in our room, Location
