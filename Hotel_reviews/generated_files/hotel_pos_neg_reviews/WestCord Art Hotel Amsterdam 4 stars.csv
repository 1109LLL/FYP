455966,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, They could do with an ATM in the hotel tell u can get cash at central station yet Harlem plane is 3 bus stops away there is a bank staff should be more informef, Accomadation and staff
455967,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The location was the only let down as it was a good 30 minute walk to the town whereas I had read the hotel was only 5 minutes from the centre expect taxi costs of 10 euros each way to the centre , The room was lovely very clean and modern nice large bed and the nespresso machine was a nice touch too 
455968,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There is lots of public transport near to the hotel and the centre is a 15 20 min walk However when we stayed it was raining heavily and it wasn t that convenient to get to key attractions unless we took taxis The restaurant food was ok but there were limited choices , The hotel had a nice outdoor area and was right next to two swimming pools and a sports area There is an on site bar an restaurant which was convenient The rooms are very clean and a good size 
455969,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, could of done with some English channels on the TV and the swimming pool could of stayed open a lot later than 5 never had the chance to use it as wanted to use it on an evening but then found out it had closed apart from that it was a lovely stay and really enjoyed it could do with some more smoking rooms as if I was to stay again I would want the smoking room again x, i loved the bed it was so comfy and the cleanness of the room and the hotel staff was friendly was very helpful and if you needed anything they was happy to help x
455970,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, We had such a great time renting bicycles from the hotel and cycling to the city centre of Amsterdam The staff said yes to every request and the room was lovely 
455971,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Everything was perfect , Very good location rooms where amazing beds are really comfy and the hotel staff are very helpful really enjoyed our stay here Thank you
455972,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, They needed an umbrella bag so the floor or desk won t get wet from the wet umbrella , The restaurant was amazing Eric was extra nice and informative of things to do Also the reception desk has everything you can ever need Umbrella or a sewing kit they have it Outstanding service will be coming back 
455973,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Been over charged money has been taken on 2 of my cards Reception lady states my 1st card declined which wasn t true Myself friends had 5 rooms booked and 3x out of 5 were apparently declined to find that all 3 of us have had both cards debited the lady obviously didn t knw what she was doing So i m awaiting for a refund and a breakdown of what I was charged for , The family room sizes are great 2 adjoining rooms 240 with a brightness Very Modern Beds are comfortable Bus 22 runs every 15 mins and takes you into Dam central Very easy I ve stayed at all 3 Westcord Chains in Dam Preference order Fashion Hotel 1 Art 2 City 3 
455974,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was nothing bad i can think of to be honest, Everything was as it said value for money Awsome rooms nice atmosphere and location was perfect for us easy to get in to central amsterdam
455975,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, They made huge mistakes when paying on checkout They charged us twice for the room We should have been able to pay cash on checkout They took a deposit on arrival which we weren t aware of Yet still debited a credit card and debit card for the same They have also been very unhelpful in resolving the matter We have booked another stay in October because we like the hotel Let s hope we get a discount because of all of this inconvenience , The room was nice and the breakfast was nice
455976,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Hotel was a bit further from the city center than I thought we walked each day so it was about a 30 to 45 minute walk to get to the sites depending upon where we were going or coming from However for the price and quality of the room I would stay here again , Booked a luxury quadruple room for our family of four Space was excellent with a separate bedroom with two twin beds and a little window couch area The beds were amazingly comfortable and the A C was fantastic we visited during a heat wave Neighborhood is very charming and there are great restaurants nearby in Westerpark and nearby streets Very safe and modern hotel Breakfast was great lots of options 
455977,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing all great , Great hotel couldnt fault it location great as nice and quiet and lovely walk into centre Everything was great bed shower The restaurant and bar area was inviting great selection of food and drink all reasonable priced 
455978,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The toilet flusher always got stuck when pressed and it was troublesome to always spend a couple extra minutes in the bathroom trying to get it unstuck The furniture was a bit weathered e g cigarette burns on the sofa At check in we were ask whether we d liked to pay upfront or upon checkout Opting to pay at checkout we were asked for the card and they reserved the whole amount on it no PIN number required on a PIN and chip card This rendered the whole sum unavailable on the card At checkout all they had to do was press a button on their side and the sum was withdrawn from the account Essentially we paid at check in with no PIN number confirmation even though we had opted to pay at checkout This felt fishy Fortunately we had no issue because of it but it did not feel very secure straightforward nor trustworthy , A bus ride or 30 minute walk away from the city center Very comfortable bed Quiet and clean Spacious room Safe box in the room
455979,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The shower wasn t sealed well The toiletries, The hotel is located near the park relatively close to the city center The bus 22 takes you to Centraal The rooms are bright and relatively big The bed is good Breakfast good The staff is friendly 
455980,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was nothing I did not like , The hotel was very clean modern The room was amazing with a super comfy bed the bathroom was fantastic LOVED everything about this room 
455981,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Only minor detraction for us was that only public transit to city center was local bus While good quality vehicle it just meant some wait times which added to overall travel times Would not dissuade me us from using hotel again , Excellent front desk staff Very helpful at check in even moving us to a more quiet room at the back of the hotel We had lost a personal item either at the airport or the train station and they tried hard to help us recover it registering our details at all the appropriate offices and providing the hotel as a contact point Later after we had issues changing money outside the hotel and they solved the problem with ease and grace Included breakfast was best of four hotels we stayed in on our trip through Netherlands 
455982,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, We like the hotel very much Easy parking polite and helpful staff bright rooms area is not noisy but you can easily reach the center The breakfast was very delicious Nespresso coffee machine in the room All family enjoyed 
455983,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, In the first night we were woken up at 5 A M by a terrible noise sounds like a drill from the bathroom ceiling the noise repeated a few times we were told by the front desk that they can solve it only in the morning The next day we requested to move a room and to be compensated on the horrible night we experienced they did move us to a different room but we didn t receive a proper apology and weren t compensated for that night whatsoever In addition the directions with public transport to the hotel are not clear the name of the bus station is not written and we got lost on the way in as a result of it , The room was very clean present and spacious The hotel is decorated in good taste we had a great bath good breakfast 10 min drive from the Amsterdam Central Station all public transport 
455984,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No train Metro stations near by but had a bus stop 5 minutes away Also the airport shuttle does not operate after 11 00PM, Beautifully decorated I had a late check in and an early check out but everything about my room and the hotel generally was amazing 
455985,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, 1 In the first day the 20 kg wooden wall covering fell on my head I was not offered any compensation I had to ask about it on reception and I got ridiculous free breakfast 2 Tiny tea coffee package just two teabags and a couple of coffee cups per DAY For a 250 night room 3 The hotel room was presented on booking com simply as a luxe in fact it was a Bridal Suite with transparent shower in the middle 4 Strange canteen where it is impossible to find napkins or to wash hands 5 If you compare service with Hilton for example it was awkward , Jacuzzi lighting airing cleanliness 
455986,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly at the hotel We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Suite on check on which was lovely The room was lovely and spacious Great location also as the bus is right outside the hotel 
455987,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, They double booked my room and then one of the girls at reception told me that I had been upgraded Which was completely untrue as we had booked the luxury quadruple room and what we received upon arrival was a junior suite with a double bed and a SINGLE FOLD OUT BED I was very annoyed at being lied to upon my arrival I complained at the front desk and they were not apologetic at all and could only get me into my originally booked room the next afternoon Not only that they rushed us out of the wrong room the next morning for another guest It wasn t a very good first impression of the hotel at all I felt completely unimportant to them as I had arrived with two friends a couple and I was expected to sleep in their room on a fold out bed I didn t pay all that money for that Not sure if I would stay again as there was no sense of urgency about it all It didn t seem like a big deal to them There was also two mice in the restaurant during lunch and dinner on my second night My roommate couldn t bring herself to eat down there again Not great , It was close to the centre of the city and had a lovely bar and restaurant The rooms were very clean and comfortable 
455988,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We tried the restaurant inside the hotel it was lovely but not a lot of choices for food, Lovely bathroom with jacuzzi bath really comfy bed Close to the centre but not too close so it was lovely and quiet 
455989,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, This hotel is lovely the staff were so helpful and always had a smile on their face The breakfast was great with lots to choose from The room was very clean and the shower was great The bed was comfortable and room had a nice view 
455990,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No complaints, Staff were helpful professional friendly Room cleaned everyday Hotel clean wouldn t walk into city centre but bus stop 600m from hotel No 22 bus goes city centre But not very reliable that s not hotel responsibility 
455991,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location was fine for us as walkers but was a bit out of the city centre although good bus service nearby , Wonderful croissants and excellent all round breakfast although could have been refreshed more frequently Westerpark nearby was wonderful 
455992,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Went for breakfast but wasn t told start or finishing time so after being at breakfast for 10 minutes we were asked to leave , Room was lovely very good free wifi
455993,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Further away from centre than expected bus good bus connection very noisy room neighbours partying and screaming till early morning staff in bar did not know much even 1 was a unfunny joker not able to answer a normal question, Very complete breakfast Friendly staff at reception
455994,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Hotel tried to fob us off with a 1st floor room that was a converted conference room and only had a partition for a wall with no sound proofing between it and the next room It was changed after we complained Food was good but evening meal service was appalling with us having to flag down a waiter for EVERY step of the meal even though the restaurant was only half full , Friendly staff stylish hotel quiet position with excellent sound proofing good breakfast
455995,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Broke my spoiler You charge me 3 times for a room has to investigate with my bank Staff was not helpful at all and try to lie to me that they charge me 1 time as I was showing to them on my mobile phone proof that they are wrong Safe faulty Fridge faulty, Not much
455996,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Lack of restaurants within walking distance but bus services were excellent and easy to use , Excellent family room with windows on two sides Very clean and quiet room Staff were all very polite and friendly 
455997,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Bed was very comfy food was lovely staff was friendly and very helpful We had a wonderful experience here and we are very glad that we choose to spend our nights here We are also thinking about going back in the summer and would highly recommend 
455998,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I didn t like how booking com location made it seem like this was a short walk to central when however it was a 40min walk not happy at all Food not very good , Room clean and staff helpful and friendly 
455999,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Pleased with value for money it s not really a boutique hotel but the art focus makes it feel like less of a business travelers option , Roomy layout with separate bath shower and a view from the bathtub even Bed was firm but not uncomfortable pillows very fluffy Bikes can be rented from the hotel biking into centre of town takes 10 minutes WiFi reasonably speedy 
456000,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Bed was so comfortable which was needed after long treks around the city Cocktails lunch and evening food were all divine We didn t have breakfast
456001,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Lighting in sitting area could have been better but only a minor criticism , Spa bath excellent shower and toilet facilities large comfy bed coffee facility 
456002,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Rooms were very nice and the bed was comfy The hotel was only a short bus ride into town Ideal base to explore the city We got the Amsterdam card which was very helpful as we could jump on and off public transport as we pleased 
456003,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Staff did not seem to understand how to use cash passport card so rejected payment on it and asked for another card subsequently found payment taken from both, Room was very good all of staff were very good but mix up on check out has caused duplicate payment issue Breakfast very good limited choice for other times so ate elsewhere in centre none really near hotel 
456004,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The building work in the area wasn t great but there are good public transport links to the city, The Artwork was great Bed very comfortable had a nice quiet room staff friendly and helpful
456005,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Pillows were not to our taste they were a weird shape and very hard to sleep on Mini bar price list could have been included within the room as we didn t know the prices of the stuff in the fridge and instructions on how to use the shower and tele could have been included , Room was amazing Hotel breakfast catered to everyone with a huge selection Free wifi and luggage hold when checked out The staff were friendly and informative and we felt at ease being English in a foreign country 
456006,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Would have been better if windows could be opened also not enough power points Reception staff helped by supplying extension lead , Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly 
456007,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I would have liked some creamer or milk in the room to add to the tea Also they could add English Breakfast tea or some version thereof to their tea range in the room , We were given early check in and very kindly upgraded to their junior suite which was spacious and very comfortable The staff everywhere from front desk to the restaurant were friendly and helpful The WiFi connection was strong everywhere in the hotel The breakfast was excellent and the range was amazing From hot cooked food to the cold cuts and breads they had the best quality and a lovely spread 
456008,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Didn t realise the distance from centraal station Atleast 10 15 minutes on a bus And they asked for a 50 euro deposit which it doesn t tell you when booking , Free room upgrade to a suite 
456009,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Loved our stay here was lucky enough to get a free upgrade to a apartment The staff were friendly location was ideal only a 15 minute walk into town The room was very clean A perfect place to stay 
456010,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I was originally given a much smaller room than I had paid for and even after being upgraded the room still lacked many of the features specified at the time of booking Obtaining the correct room took hours and at no point were the staff at all apologetic about this My bed was very uncomfortable the two mattresses were inadequately joined together and so dipped in the centre I suffer from back pain after a spinal operation so this cause me a lot of pain The hotel was also stated to have a pool when I arrived the pool was half empty covered in green scum and surrounded by birds and rabbits as if it hadn t seen use in some time , When eventually shown to the correct room it turned out to be nice especially the bathroom 
456011,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing , Excellent hotel Couldn t fault it at all Very friendly comfortable spotlessly clean Food service great Very close to bus stop buses run every 15 mins Shops nice cafes restaurants close by Rooms extremely quiet too couldn t hear a murmur from other rooms or traffic Would thoroughly recommend 
456012,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I had to pay more money then what it said on the website and ending up being around 80 pound down, The staff were very welcoming and happy to help the stay was excellent
456013,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We didnt prebook breakfast and on our first morning just paid up front which was a bit expensive but the spread of food was good , The bed was huge and nice and comfortable Room was very spacious and well looked after Bathroom area was big with seperate bath and shower Bus stop just outside hotel goes straight to city centre and runs regularly meaning it was very easy to get to and from the hotel 
456014,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was nothing we didn t like , We loved the layout of the room and size of the bathroom The hotel was a really good location only a short bus ride away from the centre The staff were excellent when we arrived the receptionist gave us a map and marked the areas we should visit We especially want to thank Anwar he was really friendly and recommended a great restaurant 
456015,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The manager we spoke to was very helpful and accommodating as were most of the staff We were given a map and told some places to visit while staying in the city and was given enough info to navigate ourselves 
456016,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only bad thing I would say would be the location We flew in the AMS and took the train into Amsterdam Centraal It seemed like I would a short ride there but racked up over 30 on the way there alone , The hotel design and staff were great and welcoming Great drink prices as well The artwork was a cool touch and gave you something to look at As for the rooms they were clean had a n esspresso machine and the separate shower and bath were great as I was able to soak in the tub for partying the night before as my partner showered lol it s a great place and the price was nice as well 
456017,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The heating takes a wile to warm up the room Due to the location i found the room 2 expensive , room very clean and spacious the WiFi is very good 
456018,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No complaints , Full English breakfast coffee orange juice what more do you need on a stag weekend Great selection of food at breakfast and the Art Burger was huge and fantastic Staff were excellent and friendly 
456019,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, A few miles out of the city in a quite area of West Amsterdam No shops or places to eat near by , Very friendly helpful staff Quiet hotel got a good undisturbed nights sleep 
456020,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The double beds were right next to each other touching Would be nice to have some space between them if possible , Staff water in lobby art on walls
456021,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Pool closed for winter , Quiet Not as cookie cutter as most hotels Big desk Nice bathroom with awesome tub and shower Price a good value for Amsterdam 
456022,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Very quite me and my partner are young and went for a lovely quite break and still got to enjoy the Amsterdam life with the number 22 bus taken to straight to dam square
456023,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The rat mouse running around the lounge kitchen area one evening We ordered room service for dinner one night for quickness we didnt know about the rodent at this point we were going to meet friends and didnt have a lot of time Mistake We waited over an hour then received a phone call to say that we wouldn t be getting our food as there was a problem in the kitchen Then attempted on two occasions to charge us for it we also paid a bill on the saturday and they tried to charge us again on checkout day ,No Positive
456024,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Noisy people coming in from nights out Rang reception but there was one answer , The room was absolutely beautiful and could have asked for any more The staff were very helpful 
456025,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The bed is so comfy good full English breakfast food presentation was lovely anwar the bar staff was so nice and helpful Lovely man Very close to the centre Staff were always helpful
456026,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only bad thing was having to travel into the town everyday as it s a bit out from dam square But only like 10 minutes on a bus to central station, Hotel staff were very nice we got a junior suite room which was amazing 
456027,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We weren t warned about the 50 deposit so next time will take extra spending money , The pillows on bed were so comfy The staff were very friendly and helpful and the loaction was a nice distance from the centre making it a quick 10 minute journey on the bus 
456028,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We ate in the hotel one night most of the food was great and the staff were really friendly The only thing we didn t like were the burgers , The hotel is situated just outside the center There is a bus stop less than a 5 minute walk outside of the hotel from there the bus only takes 10 minutes It is a really cool place to stay with different artwork throughout and also a really clean hotel all around I will definitely be back 
456029,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Very very very loud people no sound isolation at all Its like people are talking in your room Even though it was banned i was annoyed by the smell of WEED And elevator broke down 3 times , Good breakfast super staff clean and cozy Close to city central 
456030,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I didn t like leaving, I liked the fact that this hotel was only 12 mins on bus to the city centre or 6 via uber Great location and great hotel will definitely stay again 
456031,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, See above, The hotel was 20 minutes away from the town centre by bus and not as close as we were led to believe online The night barman on our first two nights couldn t wait to get rid of us and was quite miserable I saw a mouse running around the kitchen area The staff said the were aware of the mice but couldn t get rid as they were protected The hotel was pricey for it s location although very nice inside 
456032,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Have nothing bad to say about it , Stayed in one of the suites it was great and had everything we needed the booking com site actually complicates the travel it s only one bus for a 5 10 minute journey to central great spot not to far away 
456033,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Requested Security deposit 50Eur Breakfast is cheaper in Hotel than on Booking com site To short Bed linen for Double bed, Room is nice and comfortable close to the bus station not far away form the city canter breakfast until 12pm 
456034,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I like a really hot shower but despite shower being warm not hot enough for me very minor niggle, Very clean and friendly staff who had good knowledge on every enquiry we had
456035,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and couldn t fault the service we received The hotel is a little outside of the centre but only a 10 minute bus journey away This was perfect for us as it was peaceful and away from the madness of the centre 
456036,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Didn t have a bath in my room I booked with the 4 star hotel but I think we stayed in the 3star side No bath at all Not enough towelling for 3 people During the day when we were in Amsterdam I received a message to say someone is excessive my Facebook account I left my tablet in the room to charge When we got back I opened my tablet to see why I got the message There was a complete different username on my Facebook and a password typeface in I couldn t clear it to put in my own personal information After struggling to clear it I had to delete my Facebook from my tablet Nothing got stolen but it is sad to know own that the cleaner went though my personal stuff I did tell reception about it and they that it was handed over to management Sad to say management never contacted me to say what happened there We stayed in room 424 from 10 14 January 2017, I like the hotel Breakfast was excellent
456037,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, When i made my reservation month and a half befor our arriving i asked for room with bathtub bur i did not get such , In general everything Nice and clean comfortable room Good location for me 20 min with bus from Amsterdam train station and the central area 
456038,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, for a business hotel starting the breakfast only at 7 is challenging if you have early morning meetings , Clean silent nice decoration friendly staff
456039,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was only coffee creamer instead of milk and probably not enough coffee 3 Nespresso pots a day one decaf and it wasn t until the last day that we found English tv so the tv could have been a bit easier to use Breakfast was a bit overpriced for what it was but was probably very nice , The room itself was beautiful I especially liked the separate toilet and bath rooms The bed was comfy pillows to die for Staff were very friendly and helpful 10 10 would stay there again 
456040,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, breakfast was absolutely below standard The warm buffet was ice cold because the heaters were turned off The cold buffet was clearly not fresh cheese being dryed out at the edges One of the two coffee machines remained out of use during the complete breakfast because it needed to be refilled Luckily breakfast wasn t very crowded , the room was quite large and clean 
456041,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Could have changed the bed sheets at least once in our 3 night stay and the bus stop isnt right in front of the hotel anymore its a 5 min walk , Great Hotel loved the big suite we got 
456042,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Road works outside the hotel which made it awkward walking to from the bus stop, The rooms were a good size bed was very comfortable Staff were very very helpful with everything they helped us with how to get to places they booked all the tours for us which was brilliant 
456043,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location of the hotel is a bit outside of central Amsterdam We walked to the centre and that took us 20 30mins So if you don t mind either spending money on buses or walking for some time then this hotel is of quite good value , Nice modern hotel rooms had good space and nice facilities including bathtub Nespresso coffee machine and a normal shower bath as well Friendly staff speaks perfect English and will gladly help you whether it s about storage of your luggage or how to get back to the airport There is a lot of art displayed in the halls We didn t use the bar restaurant but from the outside it seemed like a nice cosy stylish place The pictures of the hotel does in fact represent it very nicely 
456044,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, It looks nothing like it does in the pictures at all Room is a basic room like a travel lodge was majorly disappointed The hotel is far to over priced I messaged the hotel on the day of my arrival and asking if it would be possible for early check in and I got ignored no response I come to Amsterdam a lot and normally stay in apartments but though we would try this hotel out as it looks amazing on pictures but this was false hope and would not pay the price to stay here again , Was a safe hotel and food was reasonable priced 
456045,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Friendly clean and great fascilities Very comfy bed and lovely rooms Bus was easy and quick into the centre but we also found a great bar just a ten minute walk away Would stay again thank you 
456046,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, A little bit too far away from city centre for walking But handy bus stops to and from , Beautifully presented and stylish Very clean Friendly staff 
456047,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Unfortunately we found bed bugs in our room However the staff were very quick to get myself and my family out of our room immediately and into a different room Our trip and the hotel was amazing until this happened which is unfortunate , The staff was amazing They were very helpful and any problem you had they tried to do there best to fix it Breakfast was very good and we had a clean towels and beds were made everyday It is a bit of a walk to where everything is at but if you don t mind walking then it s not a problem 
456048,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Rooms don t have radiators so are a bit cold in winter our air con unit didn t really heat up the room on high Pillows weren t great looked good and the style was in keeping with the room style but they were a bit too lumpy for my liking, Room was lovely and had everything we needed including plenty of towels nice toiletries and a nespresso machine Location was perfect 5 minute walk to the bus and then 12 minute ride to central station Personally I don t understand why people complain about location given that it s accurate on their website and great value for money If you want to be centrally located then pay 3 times the price for a mediocre central hotel Staff were very nice and accommodating
456049,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location wasn t great too far out so we had to get a bus everywhere and bus stop is not just outside hotel as advertised Also roadworks outside so had to cross the road and couldn t walk on any of footpaths Not great selection of food in restaurant , Staff were friendly and helpful and room was big 
456050,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing really to fault other than a lot of road works going on outside the hotel which wasn t mentioned before we arrived which made us have to get off at the next stop not too far to walk though and easy to get used to, The bed was amazing the hotel itself was really quirky and wasn t too far from dam square 7 min bike ride The rental bikes from the hotel were perfect and it s great there is the option of leaving your bike in the garage to avoid a wet seat Didn t eat at the restaurant but it looked lovely room service was great and easy Hotel was secure as well and a free safe in the room that you could choose your own code to was perfect 
456051,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Road works outside The bus stop wasn t in use because of this The make shift footpath was very uneven dirty and dangerous , The bed was very comfortable
456052,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only negative about the property is that it s not too close to central station but luckily you can get there very quickly via public transport so it s fine , I absolutely adored my stay at the WestCord Art Hotel The hotel is beautiful with lovely artsy modern features The wall art to the decor is amazing The suite we stayed in was huge from the dining table to the sofa to the his and her sinks in the massive bathroom The restaurant was also amazing We ate there all 4 nights of our stay I loved everything about this place and I would 100 stay again 
456053,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location is a wee bit far away but bus is 15 mins to centre There s one every 10 mins , Nice hotel different to others but we liked it Staff were pleasant and helpful at all times Would defo go back 
456054,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The hotel is about a 40 minute walk from the central station Our view out the window was of train tracks which had an old broken down train sitting there for the whole stay Also there were roadworks outside of the hotel and the pavement was very muddy and didn t look very nice I know not the hotel s fault but we had no idea that would be happening , The bed was very comfortable and the room was a lot bigger than we thought it was going to be Staff were very friendly and showed us a map with all of the places of interest in Amsterdam and told us how to get to them 
456055,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was nothing really not to like , Beds were sooo comfy There were 8 of us staying there of varying ages in 3 rooms Rooms were very spacious The staff were always helpful My brother even left his tablet in the room after we checked out and when he called later that day they had it at reception safe and all intact From the hotel you got a bus from right outside the hotel to Amsterdam central that took from 10 to 15 minutes depending on time of day 
456056,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing , Everything hotel was smart clean great decor staff were excellent very friendly and helpful room was great bed was massive and really really comfy 
456057,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, When we arrived there where no footpaths or even roads we had to walk through a building site a JCB NEARLY reversed over us and my new shoes that u paid 80 for the day before where tollaly ruined the staff on desk said it wasn t there fault You as a hotel have a duty of care towards your guest and could have put up signage so your guests had a clear and safe footpath to access the hotel in total I ruined two good pair of shoes and could not believe that the hotel thought it was exceptable to have no signage or clear footpath for there guests it s also not a ten minute walk to central it s over 50 min walk and 10 min on the bus, The room was lovely and beds very comfortable cleaned daily
456058,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, On arrival the front of the hotel footpath and road were been relaid It was literally a building site and was nearly hit by a jcb trying to get to front door Was never informed prior to this and hotel said booking com should have advised us Either way after complaining they offered us free breakfast for our stay and that saved us 120 Euro so in my eyes it was fair deal or maybe I m just easily bought , Big Jacuzzi in the suite we had Spotless hotel and friendly staff Breakfast was nice 
456059,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Emailed the manager Patrick before hand and he surely made our trip extra special staff were very friendly suite was amazing perfect for a birthday weekend Bus was very frequent and super fast making location not a factor at all 10 10 will be returning

456061,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, nothing everything was great , Hotel is brilliant the staff are lovely and helpful the rooms are spotless and comfortable and the number 22 bus runs from outside the front door straight to central station which takes approx 10 15 minutes 
456062,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Th location was a building site which was never higlighted not wven a note on the websitw to state the condition of the site When I spoke to the staff about this matter the response was its on the government website which is appauling A room which is advertised as a suite was no way near a suite instead a large bedroom Overall experience of this hotel poor customer service and no regard for customer relations ,No Positive
456063,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Can not fully turn off air in rooms so you hear the fan twenty four seven , A modern clean comfortable hotel Nice food and friendly staff Ten minutes from centre on good bus service

456065,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Parking for a van told to park at train station and get bus back to hotel Quality of hot food at breakfast, Friendly staff Choice at breakfast Good food Nice beers
456066,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The separate toilet with no hand basin at the opposite end of the room to the bath shower was a pain The head of the bed being on a different level to the rest of the bed and the same carpet covering both levels and the step down was a real tripping fall hazard we both fell off the step at various times during the nights we stayed The hotel is currently in the middle of what feels like a building site with no proper pavements for quite some way along the road My husband had a fall as he tripped on the edges of the rubber matting which were very slippery when wet and not laid evenly Although not badly hurt it made the holiday less enjoyable as he d pulled a muscle in his back , Hotel was very clean and the temperature of the room just right There was little or no noise coming into the room

456069,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We were not informed of construction taking place just in front of the hotel the area was fenced off and the paths were replaced with black mats S slight discount would have been good Breakfast and lunch trays were left on the floor of the corridor all day, The room was wonderful and the bus was always frequent
456070,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Some building work in progress in the area It will be fine once completed , Staff friendly knowledgeable and their English was excellent Comfy beds and lovely rooms Excellent bus route on the doorstep 
456071,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The parking in the garage had a restricted height which was a problem for us as we were looking for secure parking and ended up parking on the street Would have been helpful if this had been mentioned in the hotel description The lady on reception was very helpful to help us resolve the problem though , Very nice rooms spotlessly clean the hotel and the staff were both excellent and we will definitely book again for our next Amsterdam trip 
456072,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing Everything perfect , The room was great I loved the bathroom very large and modern The bed was comfortable Even the position was good quiet place well linked to the centre with two line buses For me it was even nice to have a walk to the centre 
456073,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Had a lovely stay here with a few friends Staff on the desk were very friendly and welcoming We had a luxury quadruple room and it was lovely even nicer than I expected from the pictures It may not be in the city centre but we had no problems getting to and from the centre via bus 22 and later on the night bus Would definitely stay here again in the future

456080,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I suggest the croissants were underdone inside apart from that everything was great the 22 Bus runs just outside the hotel , The beds were very comfortable and the rooms air conditioned We are two sisters travelling I am from Australia my sister from N Ireland Thank you for a wonderful stay 
456081,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Had emailed the hotel earlier for directions and she mistook one airport with another Cost us Eur300 taxi to get there , Everything was good If landing in Eindhoven just get a bus to Amsterdam center and bus number 22 from there stops exactly in front of Hotel 
456082,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Breakfast buffet wasn t worth the price , The rooms were modern and spacious Access to public pool Bikes for rent We walked everywhere even though it was a few km each day it was very enjoyable Bus service right out the door on bus 22 to central station and downtown 
456083,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We were locked out of our room fridge because there was a problem with my card I went downstairs and it went through ok it would have been nice to have been notifed there was a problem instead of just locking us out , Rooms were lovely and very clean Shower was great too The hotel decor was very cool loved the artwork 
456084,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Location out of the city 15 minute walk into the centre which we enjoyed each morning It was quiet with lots of space Secure car parking We loved the outdoor swimming pool behind the hotel 
456085,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The lift I have to change lift on the 3rd floor That s not convinient Beside the beds there are no power point at all I like to charge my phone while sleeping Other things not a problem at all , The staff there are really helpfully and welcome It s nice to stay there Easy to go anywhere in city And in the hotel they have bath tank I really like it 
456086,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Circuitous route to from parking garage to apartment , Stayed in one of the apartments with kitchenette which made for relaxed breakfasts and midnight snacks Small grocery store with 0 5 km Convenient drive to from airport Bus to downtown right outside front door 
456087,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Too far to walk into old town but bus stops right outside and very frequent service to central district, Breakfasts were great staff very friendly and helpful
456088,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Bathroom windows let in too much light and the separate toilet didn t have a sink so had to then go to the bathroom to wash hands, Modern rooms comfortable really good breakfast and only a short bus ride to ciry glad didn t stay in the city far too busy
456089,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only fault was it was 10 15 minutes outside centre by bus depending on traffic, Very clean and modern hotel rooms were very spacious and the bed was big and comfortable
456090,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The breakfast is over priced We knew this going in yet traveling with a baby with no other breakfast options nearby it worked out well for us We did enjoy the selection yet just know that you are paying a lot for what you get although if like us it is more convenient I am sure you will find something you like , The location was perfect for us quiet yet an easy quick bus ride to the city The room bed was very comfortable with good light The coffee machine was an added bonus The pool area looked like it would have been great fun if it hadn t rained our entire time there Would return
456091,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I think that the breakfast could be better priced , The hotel was perfectly positioned It was slightly outside of the main city center but easily accessible by bus The bus stops just outside the hotel and takes about 10 minutes to the central station Our room was very comfortable and the Nespresso coffee machine was a real treat Although we didn t swim the outside pool and terrace area was really nice 
456092,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, All of it , Very nice room Excellent breakfast Staff was very helpful in explaining how to get to downtown by bus Bus stop only 100 yards from hotel Would highly recommend this hotel and its location Very quiet 
456093,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Air circulation in rooms could be improved with an oscillating fan , Front Desk staff was exceptional Very helpful very knowledgeable and very professional The rooms were clean and well designed but a little tight for three people The breakfast buffet was well stocked with a large variety of delicious sweet and savory items 
456094,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Everything was marvelous and we appreciated the bus line right outside the door as well , The breakfast was AMAZING and the courtyard we sat in to eat was so lovely The Staff was so helpful and kind going the extra mile when we were initially unhappy with the first room they offered us due to the completely see through shower we were mother and adult son yikes They offered us a bigger room and a breakfast and we were very pleased and felt valued and respected by the lovely staff Our visit to Amsterdam was made all the more delightful by our lovely stay at the Westcord Art Hotel 
456095,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Single electric socket in entire 4 suite Located far away from the bed No alarm clock same reason Could not rent a bike because all were rented out or broken This continued throughout my stay, Room was spacious clean and well designed Staff was nice and helping
456096,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Air conditioning after complaining twice they provided a fan Not ideal but better than no air at all Had issue over mini bar Had to ask for it to be unlocked even though we had paid the 50 Euros deposit , Comfy beds bus stop directly out front of hotel bus took 10 minutes to Centraal Station Westerpark near by great park to hang out in when you want fresh air 
456097,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, That each table at breakfast didn t have a separate olive oil dispenser Breakfast starting at 7am I prefer an early day so I was expecting 6am breakfast The toilets not having a muslim shower made it a bit tricky The fact I didn t know that faucet water was drinkable it would be a nice gesture to leave a note in the toilet explaining that The USB ports in my room didn t work and I only had a single power outlet to charge my two phones laptop and tablet , The hotel atmosphere and staff were very helpful and pleasant My room s view was really nice overseeing the pool The fact faucet water is drinkable in the Netherlands is awesome The free maps of the city in the reception was amazing The fact it was a short bus trip away from central station 
456098,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Noisy air conditioning which we could not turn off constant humming noise and blast of air Fridge cannot be used for other items than mini bar No other restaurants or supermarket nearby , Good beds and well equipped bathroom Very clean Good coffee and tea facilities Staff at reception kind efficient and well informed 
456099,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The breakfast was so expensive so we didn t even think about eating there How can you charge a 2 year old full price for a breakfast , The family room was great with two kids 2 and 6 years old 
456100,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The bed is step up Can cause fall if person wakes to use the wc when half asleep during the night Location not close to a variety of restaurants , The bed was comfy The staff were extra helpful Room was nicely appointed and clean 
456101,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was an issue when booking via booking com it said double rooms have a bath while they don t The staff were kind enough to upgrade our room to a junior suite on arrival and from there it was perfect , The interior of the design the junior suite and the breakfast were absolutely amazing The hotel isn t in the centre of the city which we personally liked very much There are two buses that stop right outside and will take you to the central station within 10 15 minutes 
456102,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There really wasn t anything we didn t like , It was easy to bus into the city and navigate other locations by bus Staff was very helpful with all our questions Easy access to airport 
456103,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, It was a bit expensive , The room was very nice and the bed was big enough and comfortable We particularly liked the Nespresso machine in the room with some complimentary capsules so we could enjoy coffee in bed every morning The bathroom was quite big for the size of the room Our room was particularly quiet and the hotel is situated in a very nice area It takes about 25 minutes on public transport to get to the airport a nice street with caf s and restaurants is just a few minutes away and you can walk to the city centre in less than 20 minutes The staff was also very nice and helpful All in all it was a great choice 
456104,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Standard buffet breakfast price was expensive Great coffee machines in room but no milk had to get from bar Air con not great in room, Great view from room Good bar snack and breakfast menu Easy bike hire Rooms were available early and made available to us 
456105,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, We were put off breakfast because of the price and also think the parking is expensive Also we had a shower head in our room which wasn t working properly and the lighting in the shower room isn t really sufficient , The location was excellent for what we needed to do and the hotel and staff were very nice the bar was nicely decorated and had a god atmosphere and good food 
456106,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Reception is small and usually involved a wait although staff were very helpful, Good location public transport right outside 10 min to centre bike hire available and easy ride to Westerpark or Centre Food and drinks service was good and reasonably priced in my opinion 
456107,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, A little out of town, Bar area and staff were great Good idea having blankets on backs of chairs incase it gets chilly Staff were friendly and very helpful 
456108,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Bed and pillows not very comfortable , Staff friendly Room very clean Breakfast plentiful Food in restuarant very nice Bus stop right outside directly into central station 
456109,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, It s supposed to be a 4 stars hotel but there s no one to take care of your luggage The disposition of the rooms isn t clearly explained so we got lost with all our suitcases fortunately a Spanish cleaning staff member helped us and explained to me where to go in Spanish because he doesn t speak English No one speaks French so my parents couldn t get any help from the staff to open the fridge for example so they had to drink from the tab One of the lady at the entrance desk was haughty and impolite Not even a fresh bottle of water was offered The room service is a nightmare late to deliver the breakfast which was incomplete for my parents They had to ask for the rest of what they had ordered and it arrived 20 minutes later when their drinks coffee and chocolate were already cold My breakfast was delivered 30 minutes late so I didn t get to eat before leaving The room is noisy so it s impossible to sleep The car park is awfully expensive Run away from this hotel because apart from its great look it has nothing to offer , The room and of the bathroom were okay and clean 
456110,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I would have had to been very picky to find something so nothing to report , The rooms were excellent and spacious Food was very good and although fried eggs were not on display it was okay to order them from staff and they were presented quickly 
456111,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Breakfast It seemed milk was always empty and you can improve the situation with better pancakes and crisp versus soggy bacon On 2 of my days I felt it dangerous to eat it , The front desk staff out of all was very nice The decor was also exceptional Oh and the bar guys were engaging and helpful All good but as an American we sometimes appreciate more outgoing personalities 
456112,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I didn t like the fact that I had to check out at the end of my holiday wish I could have stayed forever , The bed was amazing comfortable and roomy location was ideal and the food was fantastic Staff were incredibly helpful as well
456113,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The Hotel with its art theme was great and different It was clean and spottless The staff was very helpful We only stayed one night and wish we could have stayed more Next time 
456114,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, they allowed friends to access our rooms by asking for our keys they had no control over who could get into each others rooms I could have been anyone ,No Positive

456117,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, That there was no 24hr room service couldn t even go down to the bar and order a hot or cold drink which was disappointing , Lattes are great first thing in the morning good food 
456118,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Bedroom 10 cm platform for one half of the room Glass door on the bathroom a hazard No washbasin in the WC room unhygienic, Close to bus 22 bus stop Good breakfast 
456119,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I wish their site told us that we catch Bus 69 from the airport and transfer to 22 at the Sloderdijk Station and get off at can t remember Otherwise just excellent , The breakfast was amazing It was delicious hot nicely arranged and there was an excellent variety of choices The room was not big but had all we needed Very modern The staff were totally accommodating and pleasant We were able to buy tickets to Museums Ann Frank Tour and bus passes Their advice on transportation options was great The restaurant food was also delicious 
456120,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Breakfast is very expensive , Very modern Lovely interior and exterior art Good location not far from centre Spacious room Quick check in and check out 
456121,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, breakfast cost too expensive when returning from town centre and stepping off bus there is no proper road crossing You have to walk on a muddy track , clean comfortable and spacious rooms 10 to 12 min journey by bus to town centre bus stop outside hotel shops 5 8 mins away good wifi friendly and helpful staff
456122,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, the unacceptable discipline from some guests in the hotel and the staff did not do anything to let us sleep early in the morning, The room and hotel clean facility
456123,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Although it s not right in the centre the no 22 bus stops right outside the hotel So easy to get to and from centre this way 5 mins The rooms are clean comfortable and worth the money paid Would definitely stay here again 
456124,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, That the swimming is outside At this time of year we couldn t use it, We enjoyed everything It was an amazing experience for us as we visited Amsterdam for the first time Room was clean and comfortable well presented Breakfast and dinner was jus so delicious And all staff members that we met were very friendly and helpful Looking forward to stay there again
456125,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Everything was great The Windows didn t open and I don t like that far too stuffy for my but that s he same in most hotels so can t knock it down , The breakfast was just when you need in the dam Woke up starving hungry each day then added to that by smoking and then had a full on healthy breakfast The evening meals are great too The PEA SOUP WAS DELICIOUS 
456126,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Great to have a nespresso coffee machine in room however only 3 coffee pods supplied daily A couple 2cups each 4pods Hotel reluctant to hand out more , On bus route not far from centre of town Walkable if good weather 
456127,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Quite far from the city although transport is good having to always get buses in and out was a little annoying, Beautiful hotel nice rooms showers and beds Restaurants with beautiful food and good transport links
456128,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Breakfast was fabulous The restaurant was probably the best meal we had the whole of our trip Staff were fantastic and catered for your every need nothing was too much trouble Very clean Bus stops are right outside You could buy your travel tickets at reception which is extremely helpful Definitely buy your attraction tickets at the hotel too as you will skip the huge lines Cannot fault the hotel and the staff 
456129,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There was a big dip in the bed which made sleep very difficult The carpet was also a little dirty looking in the room , It was quiet and the food in the bar was good The staff were lovely too 
456130,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No milk for coffee Had to pay 22 50 euro per day for parking , The beds were very comfy Easy flat walk to city centre Very helpful and polite staff
456131,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, no milk for tea in rooms only coffee whitener No designated smoking area too cold to just put people outside Westcord Fashion hotel has a smoking area, bed very comfy rooms modern and very spacious
456132,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Wouldn t change anything The place was really clean and comfortable and the location was good too Easy to get to central station , The staff were really friendly and accommodating and anything that we asked for they always tried to help us which made us feel comfortable 
456133,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing , Very polite and patient counter staffs Excellent breakfast every thing we needed Good size and very clean room 15 minutes walk to city center Good value for money 
456134,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I dislike nothing about this hotel, Great hotel with brilliant staff Could help us with all our questions and demands as they were Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to stay in Amsterdam 
456135,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and helpful they made the stay very enjoyable and catered to our needs The rooms were spacious clean and very comfy and had everything that s required Reception helped us to navigate around the city and attractions and helped us to use transport the incredible staff at reception really made our stay The time we stayed here was comfortable and enjoyable I would highly recommend this hotel for all 
456136,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, You can t turn down the air conditioning but there isn t really a reason to , The room was simply amazing and the value for money of this hotel is insane 
456137,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The cocktail barman Manno was so helpful there was no cocktail he wouldn t make even if it wasn t on the menu He provided me with so much information about attractions and was very polite and a good worker The bed was very soft which was perfect for my girlfriend but a little too soft for me but it didn t affect my sleep so I am more than happy
456138,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, nothing really , The rooms are beautiful and clean The staff is helpful and kind The location is good but you have to take bus to go to the center of Amsterdam but that s not a problem because the bus station is right in front of the hotel I would definately recommend it 
456139,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Our only grumble was the bus stop arriving at the hotel Upon leaving the bus two lanes of traffic need to be crossed which is fine however there is then a grassy area before a further carriageway to cross and a small grassy slope to climb A path of bark chippings did appear during our stay but it would be advisable for the hotel to create a more permanent crossing between the carriageways and some steps I know the carriageway is an unsurmountable issue to make the journey across easier Having said that it is a minor issue and we loved our stay , We had booked a large room and weren t disappointed at the size or the d cor The room had a large double bed desk minibar good wardrobe space two large drawers TV showing BBC1 and BBC2 ample plugs including USB ports to charge those all important smart phones without reducing the plug space and a large desk The room had a large couch banquette type by the window aircon Nespresso machine kettle take your own teabags The bathroom was interesting because it was enclosed in glass which you may see from photos Fear not if staying with friends or parents the frosted glass stops prying eyes and the toilet is in a completely separate section of the room The shower was good quality sunken bath excellent Overall the room was well appointed however not particularly bright light wise due to bulbs not working and a rather strange switch and lighting arrangement The bed was extremely comfortable think a Lenny Henry endorsed chain in the UK and then some in size and quality of linen Overall room was excellent quality and value 
456140,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only thing I can say is that there s no crossing on the road when getting off the bus had some muddy shoes walking across the grass but that s not really a complaint , The rooms are absolutely gorgeous bed was big and comfortable Had a brilliant sleep every night The staff were knowledgeable about everything and really friendly The quality of food in the restaurant is beautiful and room service was also very quick Everything was perfect 
456141,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The dinner menu in the Gallery Restaurant was the same each day could do with a different menu daily As a couple they only supplied 3 capsules of coffee for the Nespresso machine Could have done with more supplies , The staff were very welcoming and friendly The room was large and bright I really like the Nespresso machine in the room this made a change from other hotels with the usual Nescafe sachets Bus service just outside door of hotel couldn t be easier if going into Amsterdam only 10 minute drive The food in the Gallery Restaurant was excellent and staff friendly 
456142,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Too far from the central but for the price it was fantastic The fridge make sure you check with reception about the fridge bill haha that made me feel uneasy about storing things like milk etc, Staff was very helpful Let us off load our luggage there even though we had already checked out Pillows was amazing D
456143,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Everything is perfect except I wouldn t order the buffet breakfast There is not much variety for the price paid and if you join the buffet late the food starts to get put away before the time is finished Better off to eat in the city , Rooms are very comfortable 
456144,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Be careful with the fridge They stock it up with everything you could want but be warned As soon as you take an item out of the fridge the hotel will charge your card Other than that it s amazing , Bed was lovely Bath was amazing Very clean and very comfortable A bus ride away from Central Amsterdam Stayed in the junior suite 
456145,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Lighting concept in the room was not well designed The very bright downlights above the headboard of the bed look nice in pictures but hurt the eyes first thing in the morning However they have have to be switched on if you want more than just the mirror lights in the bathroom The parking garage was rather small the ramp extremely steep and there were lots of pillars and edges so we had to be very careful maneuvring into and out of a space Charging 24 50 EUR per day for parking seemed a bit much even for Amsterdam where parking is expensive , Interesting art and design concept The room 4 stars L was good sized and well appointed Nespresso machine in the room was a nice touch Close to the Westergasfabriek and Westerpark 
456146,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location was a bit far out for the old town of Amsterdam Parking was very expensive and the staff quite dismissive of the cost it s expensive in Amsterdam was all I got , The rooms were spacious and comfortable for a family Room service provided good food and in all was a good retreat for us 
456147,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Hotel is out of the city and not very easy to reach We had to trek across the muddy road to get to the hotel too on a busy road in the dark with suitcases Inside art is a little strange not to everyone s taste Inside interior felt cheap but inside the bedrooms was much smarter and more upmarket , Room was very clean comfortable Good bathroom everything you needed Lovely and quiet too 
456148,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, services were perfect as always staff was so nice and helpful the whole time also allowed us a late check out when we needed it is my forth time at the hotel everytime i m amazed but how perfect t is 
456149,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The reception Was not happy with how they dealt with my partner and myself from arrival to departure And our problem still has not been resolved Very disgusted in this ,No Positive
456150,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The only problem was that the heat didnt work well in our bedroom But they tried to fix it , Although the hotel is ten minutes away from the train central station this is not a problem and it is a really nice hotel for a good price I preferred this hotel instead of one not so pretty in the center I would go there again 
456151,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The first room I was offered The attitude of the front desk staff The manager s attitude after I complained The way he dealt with it was very poor The junior suite had no windows The second room we was in was cold heating didnt work Hotel didnt even read my requests The food was tasteless , Nothing my whole experience was a shamble waste of time and money I wish I didnt stay here 
456152,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The check in and check out process was slow compared to other places The rooms didn t look as good as other four star hotels , The hotel was very close to the bus station 
456153,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The food in the bar was not great the portions for the price were quite small I felt , Everything very hard to fault the hotel Everywhere is kept very clean the junior suite was lovely so quiet I was worried because we were near the lift that we d get a lot of noise pollution but you couldn t hear a thing The staff were also very accomdating courteous polite Bus stop right outside the door so your at central station in 10minutes so convenient 
456154,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No complaints or issues at all , The location was an easy commute from the airport and 5minutes from city centre with bus stop right outside The staff were incredibly friendly and could not have been more helpful Also helped me arrange a surprise for my fiance upon arrival The rooms are clean comfy quiet and with a very modern feel 
456155,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Our room was quite cold at times and there wasn t the option to control the temperature from the room , Staff were extremely helpful especially in regards to navigating the public transport Our room was beautiful and spacious especially the large bath The hotel was very modern and relaxed the coffee machine in our room was a great added feature 
456156,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No bad comments , Nice clean hotel Not too far from central Staff were nice and helpful before we even arrived and after Enjoyed our stay Just got back and Already booking for summer 
456157,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Breakfast in the hotel was quite expensive for what it was much better to go into the centre and get something there , Hotel is located just outside Amsterdam centre 5 10 mins on a bus bus stop right outside the hotel was so easy bus ticket allowed you to hop on and off buses and trams in the city centre without extra charge and could be bought from hotel reception Hotel it s self whilst not amazing was clean and very comfortable everything you would need for a cheap weekend away 
456158,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Distance from central Amsterdam is a hassle Location requires 10 minute bus ride to central station and there are limited dining options or services nearby in the neighborhood , Friendly staff and comfortable room 
456159,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The location is pretty quiet and relaxing but no place to eat out nearby this hotel Once you get tired from walking the city and come back to the hotel to rest your feet it might be the only choice to eat at hotel Hotel meal was still ok slightly expensive but the service was pretty nice , They had welcome drink always which is water with lemon mint and orange It really made us relax and saved money to purchase stilled water always The room was cozy and the location was also nice if you prefer staying a bit far away from the city noise 
456160,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Staff were very welcoming and helpful Room was cosy had all the facilities you d require and was very clean The bar and restaurant were open late serving good drinks and food All the artwork around the building was quirky and gives the hotel something over others It is a little further out of the town than some hotels but there is a bus stop just outside with a regular service and a day pass for busses and trams is only a few euro Takes 10 minutes at most to get in to the town 
456161,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Good location easy to access from airport and go to down town Only 15 20 min to down town by Bus also near AH supermarket Room is quiet clean and comfortable 
456162,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Made reservations to have a Bath and received confirmation through email however upon arrival we received a room without Bath and the staff gave us no alternative options ,No Positive
456163,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing, We had a blast We were greeted with a smiley professional welcome from Emiley while we r checking in very informative helpful At the check out staff were extremely helpful rooms are clean spacious bathroom is spacious as well Food in the restaurant is world class food Breakfast had everything all staff working there r professional and welcoming Definitely a place we would recommend to all our friends 
456164,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location as its about a 25 min walk to dam square however that s not the hotels fault and theirs public transport links right outside, Very comfy bed and large bath in the room
456165,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Not possible to turn completely off the air conditioning system they don t fill anymore the breakfast with fresh products 30 min before the end time so if you arrive 30 min before you don t have plenty of products anymore, Equipment parking spacious bedroom with bath good mattress Situation bus stop accross the street
456166,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The room was very disappointing since it was really small for two people I had been there before on business and was given a very spacious room hence why I booked the hotel again The heating did not seem to work properly either as it felt very chilly no matter how much you turn the temperature up, We liked the cleanliness and modern decor
456167,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The breakfast in the hotel for two people we paid 38 euro when all we could eat was a croissant and have a cup of tea because the food was disgusting The sausages were cold and half cooked beans were freezing the bacon was burnt to a crisp My partner vomited when we got back to our room after tasting th breakfast I think it was the sausages that done it , Clean hotel the bed was very comfortable location was great ten mins on the 48 bus into central Amsterdam 
456168,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The room was smaller than what we expected from looking at photos and there was no way to control heating so we were freezing when we woke up the first night Luckily they provided us with a tiny space heater when we asked if there was a way to turn on the heater so we were slightly less cold the subsequent nights , It was a very quirky hotel with very friendly staff The staff was extremely helpful especially Rachel and they provided great customer service Although we wanted to have the experience of riding bikes to city center it was a bit cold for us so we decided to take the bus instead and the hotel was only about a 5 minute bus ride away from city center 
456169,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, There are no negative points with this hotel , Superb hotel this was our second time staying in this hotel we turned up early for our check in and because of this they upgraded us to the junior suite free of charge Brilliant service So good that i ve already booked this hotel for my next visit to Amsterdam A 
456170,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, I didn t see much difference in facilities between 3 and 4 , Good location bus to airport and city departs regularly Reception and housekeeping staff friendly good 3 
456171,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The location was fine only 10 minutes by bus The hotel is on a main road but was so soundproof The room was so spacious and attractive we stayed in a junior suite and it was lovely The hotel was kind enough to provide us with a bottle of wine and water on arrival our room had every amenity which was replenished daily Wifi was strong and the tv had a few uk channels The bath was HUGE It was definately one of the best highlights The only gripe we really have was over breakfast The price is far too high Admittedly we didn t pre book but even the discounted price is steep for the quality quantity Also the breakfast dining experience seemed somewhat cold and rushed The dinner service on the other hand was faultless and worth every penny One other point was the bed we did ask for a large double and i noticed we had two single matresses sandwhiched together with a double matress topper however this was not noticable when sleeping You get free coffee capsules for the machine every day but if these are dented which a few of ours were they wouldn t work 
456172,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, The staff were excellent very friendly and professional The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable The bus stops right outside the hotel and is about a ten minute drive into the city If I returned to Amsterdam I would definitely stay there again 
456173,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, A little far from centre of Amsterdam to walk everyday , Beautiful hotel which felt like a high end hotel Had everything we could want there including bike rentals
456174,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Beds were a bit too soft to our liking We rolled to the middle Parking slope is very steep and requires extreme caution , Easy and fasr public transportation to the city centre Very helpful staff Great breakfast 
456175,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Location of the hotel was great only took a short while from Schipol via a train and the 48 bus Using the same bus can easily get into the centre of Amsterdam the bus stop is literally across the road from the hotel Very nicely decorated and extremely quiet 
456176,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, This is by far the BEST hotel experience we have ever had The staff was superb especially Rachel She was so friendly and helpful always had a smile on her face and very welcoming The room was large and comfortable It was very clean and up to date The wifi was nice and easy to connect to The restaurant was also very good for dinner There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel that makes is so easy to get around In 10 minutes you are in the city center I would 110 recommend this hotel Not one complaint 
456177,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Confusion about room we booked but got sorted in the end , Fabulous location Very short bus journey to centre which was exactly what we wanted Amazing decor and artwork throughout hotel Beautiful room 
456178,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, A bit too far away from the city centre At least a 20min walk It s only a several minute commute on the bus which stops directly outside But it s a long wait for the bus at night, Clean Friendly informative staff
456179,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Only downside was the double bed was actually two singles so for a couple it was uncomfortable as we kept falling down the middle , Lovely hotel Very clean and food was amazing Bit of a walk to town but suited us as we are walkers Will be returning next year 
456180,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The main problem was that although the rooms are sound proofed it was impossible to turn the noisy air con off We asked at reception who had obviously been told about this before and confirmed that the air con units had to keep turning and making a noise Also there was no TV in the hotel for the last 24 hours and no one seemed bothered , The hotel was OK but not a real 4 star hotel Rooms had good facilities and the breakfast was very good It is outside the city but there is a bus stop outside no 48 which takes you directly to the central station 
456181,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Booked this hotel as a surprise 50th birthday treat for my partner I originally booked us a junior suite the manager kindly upgraded us to the bridal suite The room was amazing Food was great breakfast was fantastic Location great as bus stop right outside just 10 mins to Central area We did walk there as well which was about 15 20 mins Overall a fantastic hotel would certainly recommend
456182,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, No milk for the tea in the room Prices of drinks in the bar a little high, Very clean rooms and spacious Friendly staff and helpful Great interior design to the hotel Excellent food 
456183,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Loved the room Was amazing for the money Glad the bar was open after we got in from amasterdam Was good to finish on a drink after a lovely meal out The car park was pretty steep but what do you exspext it s Amsterdam Will be coming back for sure Thanks for the visit 
456184,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Very nice place to stay in Amsterdam We had a XXL room for 4 persons with 2 bedrooms The hotel is 10 15 min by bus far away from city center The bus number 48 stops just in front of the hotel and takes you to Central Station very near to the city centre from there Dam Square is 5 min away 
456185,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Room heater conditioner was broken after request repaired But it didn t help It was cold in the room during all stay No slippers in the room and bathrobe In overall not so bad , Good friendly personnel Not far from Amsterdam central station Good bus traffic Very quite hotel area Coffemachine in the room 
456186,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, Everything Only a short bus ride out of the busy centre you are welcomed by very friendly and efficient staff The hotel is beautifully appointed and the room we stayed in was fantastic with a very comfortable and large bed Dinner in the restaurant was perfect 
456187,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Nothing to dislike , Large triple room and comfortable beds Breakfast plenty of choice Location away from city in the evenings was restful Helpful friendly staff 
456188,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The staff was trying to establish the guest as faulty for unwanted things The charger adapter issued from hotel was taken from room without informing and later the staff who took the same was asking about misplacement of adapter Finally he agreed that he did take the adapter and apologized , Location is good and well connected 
456189,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Not worth for 170euro per night without break fast No diff between 3star and 4 star both are adjacent to each other My friend face problem with reception staff He borrowed charger from reception Without guest notice staff took the charger and asked about the charger It s not good integrity of the staff , Good peace full location
456190,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, For us as tourists it a bit too far away from the center of Amsterdam city , The hotel is fun and quirky with fabulous art throughout Loved our very comfortable and spacious room including big bath tub and nice shower The staff is very welcoming and helpful We also really enjoyed a delicious dinner in the restaurant where the staff and service were excellent 
456191,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Previously we have always gotten a hotel perfectly in the centre which has meant we have been able to walk wherever we needed to go The westcorde meant we had to buy a travel pass for the time we were in Dam this caused us to have a little less time each day to spend at our leisure However considering the quality of the Westcorde neither me or my partner were fussed at all at the extra travelling , Beautiful interior lovely food the staff were helpful when they were needed I definitely think this is five star material We were in complete comfort 
456192,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The toilet and the sink are in opposite sides of room After using the toilet one has to walk across the room to wash their hands on the other side The hotel is not generous with shower gel For two people who shower at least twice a day the small pouch is just not enough Although it was raining at the time the floors in the corridors were not very clean , Hotel is easily accessible from Schipol Airport as well as Amsterdam Central Train Station One can catch the train from Schipol to Sloterdijk and the bus 48 towards Borneo Eiland to Hempoint which is 50 metres from hotel Alternatively one can catch bus 48 towards Sloterdijk from just outside Amsterdam Central Station to Hempoint which is just across the road from the hotel Remember to ring the bell on the bus as you leave the station before your destination Rooms are decently sized with wardrobes The shower and sink area is huge and separate from the toilet Meals at both breakfast and dinner were awesome There was an iron in the room There was a functioning safe in the room albeit an oldish model Hotel sells Amsterdam Day Tickets 24 hours 48 hours etc for use on the public transport system 
456193,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Absence of mountains , Everything was just fine Generally Netherlands is one of the friendliest countries in the world let alone beauty culture civilization etc

456195,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, The breakfast buffet is pretty expensive 19 compared to what their serving We ordered the Egg s Benedict which was average and then we had Croque Madame which was not eatable since the bread was burnt , The room was very clean and looked exactly like it did on the pictures The bed linen was incredibly comfy 
456196,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Our bed was 2 beds pushed together, How helpful the girl at reception was when we checked in The style and cleanlyness of the hotel The breakfast was very nice
456197,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars,No Negative, We stayed in the hotel at the end of August beginning September 2015 in 2 different kind of rooms a double room and a suit borth of them were excellent have a new design and let me presume they are innovative as a lot of things you could find in the Netherlands Easy to reach the hotel as from Schiphol as from the Centraal Station People who are working at the reception are attentive and know their work the same I could say about the persons who are cleaning the rooms everyday new towels and linens And linens are of best quality good to touch and to sleep Though we didn t take breakfast we could say that this is well done a pleasant smell near the breakfast area every morning And finally but not the last all what we have seen and experienced while our staying in West Cord Art Hotel this is in the main part thank to a professional work of General manager and stuff a very friendly hotel 
456198,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Location was far from central Amsterdam and required bus taxi or a long walk to the area where all the actions is, Clean and modern hotel with friendly staff

456200,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Getting out of the underground car park up steep ramp with bike rack on back was a bit hair raising, Large room with separate room for the kids nicely decorated lovely bathroom You can buy tickets for the bus into Amsterdam from the hotel reception its 5 minutes into the city centre and we could leave our car in the car park for free even after the check out time 
456201,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, SORRY PUT DISLIKE IN THE WRONG BOX SEE OPPOSITE BOX LIKED THE STAFF AND FOOD , GOOD HOTEL THOUGH NOT VERY CENTRAL HAD TO TAKE A BUS EVERY DAY TO GO TO AMSTERDAM CENTRAL THE HOTEL SHOULD PROVIDE A SHUTTLE SERVICE FREE OF CHARGE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GO TO THE TOWN

456204,WestCord Art Hotel Amsterdam 4 stars, Slightly further away from Amsterdam centre than expected Room slightly hazardous due to a step halfway down the bed This is lit from one side but is hard to spot when getting up in the night Also it can be a little hard to keep the light out of the room , I found the hotel and rooms to be modern and well decorated with good facilities They were also well sound insulated Staff pleasant on arrival Outdoor pool well maintained and a good size In general a pleasant experience
