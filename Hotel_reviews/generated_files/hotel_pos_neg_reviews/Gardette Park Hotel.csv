12921,Gardette Park Hotel, The room is so small It is not like in the picture However we are used with rooms in Paris The elevator stops at the middle of 2 floors so you have to walk up or down to access your room It is quite strange with us , This hotel is a boutique hotel so everything look old but it works as normal The location is very nice easy go to Louvre Museum Many restaurants nearby and you can find some local coffee shop in the morning The staff is really helpful and friendly
12922,Gardette Park Hotel, Mini fridge was missing shower is a bit tired and room had absolutely ugly color , Very nice location the district is clean and quite close to the metro 10 min walk Bed was comfortable and cozy 
12923,Gardette Park Hotel, The elevator stops at strange half floors So no matter which floor you re getting off at you have to take a few steps up down on a narrow staircase to get to your room , The location is close to 3 nearby metros that can get you pretty much anywhere withing 20 30 mins Not the most central but its a quiet and safe neighborhood There s a really good cafe down the street called Beans on Fire 
12924,Gardette Park Hotel, Expensive breakfast Buy it on the coffee roastery at the corner of the park instead , Great nearby restaurants Very popular so make sure to book at least Fri Sat Super cosy area 
12925,Gardette Park Hotel, Small room and the chairs made it smaller Fact were no hooks in bathroom no herbal tea and no tea cups or mugs , Clean Towelling gown and slippers provided Balcony that overlooked the park Helpful and friendly staff Having tea and coffee making facilites in the room Very comfortable bed 
12926,Gardette Park Hotel, Frankly we don t understand how this hotel has a 4 star label This should be 3 at most Rooms are very small the hotel itself is a bit old the elevator stops between floors so you still have to take a few steps and it is also ridiculously small we could not fit 2 people with our two suitcases and we are small Oh and WiFi was terribly slow as well , It s located in a quiet and safe area the staff is very nice 
12927,Gardette Park Hotel, reception staff grumpy very poor breakfast not at all a 4 star level hotel, the hotel is located in a wonderful square and some rooms have a balkony overlooking the park
12928,Gardette Park Hotel, it s probably the Paris standard but the triple room was incredibly small overpriced like hell, nice location near a park but we couldn t open the window because there was no space 
12929,Gardette Park Hotel, The small size of lift And the lift stops in the middle of 2 floors needing to take stairs some heavy luggages , All good except for teo things Very near Gare de Lyon 
12930,Gardette Park Hotel, dark in corridors and small stairs Very small room selected and paid for a double room but got a single room No security chain on inside bedroom Some of the Staff at reception or breakfast staff almost inexistant Disappointing for a 4 star hotel It is a good 3 but not 4, Great location room with balcony with view on the park
12931,Gardette Park Hotel, Breakfast was ridiculous If staying at the hotel please don t pay for breakfast as you WILL be disappointed There is a fabulous restaurant around the corner from the hotel two minute walk it s called Vertigo The food was great , Staff were friendly The hotel was very clean The hotel is in a good location and very easy to find Overall it s a nice hotel but be aware of the very small bedrooms and bathroom 
12932,Gardette Park Hotel, I called down for a charger and iron the man on reception asked me to come collect it i explained I was in PJ s and he said what do you want me to do Then another man walked into my room at the crack of dawn Used a key so presumed must have been staff but this woke me up and obviously was quite frightening I told reception the next day and she seemed particularly unmoved by this simply said he must of been staff Finally as we left the staff were standing right outside the hotel entrance smoking Generally unprofessional quite rude and would NOT recommend ,No Positive
12933,Gardette Park Hotel, No negative comments , Location was perfect right in the center but near a lovely park and in a quiet neighbourhood One sunny morning we even had croissants with coffee on our little terrace 
12934,Gardette Park Hotel, The room was extremely small It would have been acceptable as a single room but not as a double room The bed was extremely small and it was attached to the wall on one side and a small passage on the other side I am not sure how it can be called a double room , Nothing
12935,Gardette Park Hotel, Breakfast was a little chaotic got down 35 minutes before it finished but we had to ask for all the basics as it was v poorly replenished Airco didnt work so bed room was really very hot The bathroom was tiny which is to be expected in Paris but was just one more thing , Close to the metro adorable staff our doggie stayed for free coffee in room good toiletries 
12936,Gardette Park Hotel, For the price I could not find fault , The rooms were small but excellent bathrooms nice powerful shower big towels and robes and even slippers Tea and coffee making available as well as a tiny balcony to take the morning air

12938,Gardette Park Hotel, The rooms were small but functional If you are looking for lots of room to spread out this hotel is probably not the best choice If you are going to see the sights and just need a clean comfortable place to sleep this is a great option Since we had a toddler it was slightly cramped but that is my only complaint , The staff was friendly and very helpful We requested a crib for our toddler and it was in our room with nice linens and a toddler pillow when we checked in which was nice 
12939,Gardette Park Hotel, The Room we took was a bit small for 2 people but was big enough all the same , The staff were very helpful at all times There are also about 4 good restaurants within 5 minutes walk from the hotel Cleanliness I must say Is about 99 super clean toilets shower etc
12940,Gardette Park Hotel, The pictures I got in my reservation do not belong to the room I got I reserved a superior room and it was quite small I asked the receptionist what is superior in my room and she told me that is the view to the park that makes it superior I felt disappointed It took hours to the staff to prepare scrumble eggs , Location 
12941,Gardette Park Hotel,No Negative, There are many restaurants and markets nearby staff is really kind and helpfull If you have A baby and stroller choosing bus 69 instead of metro is easier to travel around 
12942,Gardette Park Hotel, Not conveniently located from the airport or in to central Paris It is eother 20 in a taxi to central Paris or a 90 min walk The room was unbelievably small and It comfortable for three people in the family room I paid 150 for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located The fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine We were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off From then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive Overall I was very disappointed with the hotel Please don t stay here , The ensuite shower was lovely and had a decent shower

12946,Gardette Park Hotel,No Negative, Everything about this boutique hotel was wonderful the breakfast was delicious and fresh each morning all staff incredibly friendly and helpful Also very welcoming and sweet with our daughter Within about 30 minutes of arriving I already wanted to extend our stay The beds were so comfortable and the area so calm it felt like we got a genuine insight into Parisian day to day life Also there are so many off the beaten track sights to see close by definitely recommend looking into those We also walked to the Baticlan area which was really great Also there s a bakery very close by with delicious in house made produce and a great Pizza restaurant just 5 minutes walk from the hotel the owner so lovely and fantastic food too Can t wait to return 
12947,Gardette Park Hotel, The pillows are very soft which I don t like and there isn t any milk in the room if you have a craving for a cuppa after a long day , The location is good Rue Saint Maur is a nice neighbourhood quite chilled out so you get a decent night s sleep but there are a couple of nice bars and places to eat very closeby not too touristy area but also easy to hop on the metro to get to those areas quickly Would stay in this area again 
12948,Gardette Park Hotel, The room was small with a disappointment view it was on the 1st floor but it felt like a basement We had the view of a wall and all the air air conditioners outside In the silence at night we could only hear that annoying sound of them working , Cleanness friendly staff
