122505,H tel Vernet, Bathroom was very small , The room was a little small but very clean and comfortable Breakfast was included and was very good The location was walking distance to the Arc de Triumph and Eiffel Tower 
122506,H tel Vernet,No Negative, The employers are super nice Breakfast is delicious and good priced compared to other Hotels in Paris I love this HOTEL THE BUIlDING IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE ROOMS ARE COMFORTABLE AND BIG ENOUGH beds and pillows are comfy the bathroom has everything you need and the shower has enough room the sink was a little too small though For sure i will stay next time again and will suggest to everyone thank you
122507,H tel Vernet, The images for the toiletries provided are deceiving only the suites have the Hermes toiletries The toiletries provided in the other rooms is more than fine but I prefer not to use 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner in my hair , We loved this hotel The staff was very sweet and the rooms were gorgeous Nice quiet hotel 
122508,H tel Vernet, Dining options are limited in hotel facility and lift is slow and small , the Hotel is a Boutique style small and great location staff were friendly and helpful 
122509,H tel Vernet, Bed a bit hard, Hotel is beautiful and staff were helpful friendly polite Angelo arranged so many things for us which made our time in Paris run smoothly he was amazing 
122510,H tel Vernet, We loved everything change nothing , Everything the staff in this hotel could not do enough for us Excellent Room is perfect There was a small problem with the plumbing but as soon as it was reported it was fixed immediately We can t speak highly enough of this hotel and especially the staff Location is 100 meters from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs lys es 
122511,H tel Vernet, Didnt like the idea of having to add money for the american breackfast 10 pp even when having room with breackfast, Liked the new luxury design and the whole fabtastic atmosphere enjoyed evrey minute really great hotel with great details and really comfy beds the bathroom is well designed
122512,H tel Vernet, My wife lost something in the room and the hotel staffs don t seems to care about it Absolutely disappointed with the service and it should no rate as a 5 star hotel , Clean Good location
122513,H tel Vernet, Breakfast is not as it should be for 5 star hotel is not open buffet only continental breakfast is included which is bread and coffee or juice only , Excellent location so friendly staff
122514,H tel Vernet, Only the door of the bathroom was very hard to push and close it was not close properly The breakfast was only continental only any extra will be charged I would like to have tea and coffee facility making in the room, Every thing was excellent I love this hotel
122515,H tel Vernet, The money deposit that we should to put it each time of staying in the hotel as far as we stay in the hotel more days we have to put more money deposit in the reception as some other 5 starts hotels in the same area are not requested this money deposit which is be more comfortable for me, Staff are very welcome really I appreciate them
122516,H tel Vernet, the breakfast was poor my entire stay i have seen dust on the floor of my room and the table , The staff was very friendly the smell of the hotel is WOWWW the location was perfect my room was fantastic 
122517,H tel Vernet,No Negative, A truly five star hotel Super clean Nice courteous staff Rooms are big compare to other hotels in the same price stars around Champs Elsyees Location is great Just meters away from Champs Elsyees Arc Tromphe Break fast very nice I will definitely stay again there 
122518,H tel Vernet, The door to the bathroom was odd and took up space in the bedroom because it couldn t be fully opened without closing the door to the front entrance which was also odd to have at all , room was spacious I think we got upgraded bed was comfortable and location was great 
122519,H tel Vernet, The rooms are a bit too small I like spacious rooms with big windows but thats just a personal preference , It was really clean and cosy The staff were very sweet and helpful The breakfast was delicious And great location 
122520,H tel Vernet, The rooms are a bit small but that is common in Paris , The staff was so helpful and went out of their way to be of support The food was very good and the service in the restaurant was wonderful 
122521,H tel Vernet, I could hear in the hallway at night and was scared that someone was trying to come in to my room Someone was moving in at 1 am but I only realized that after all the noise happened and no one burst into my room , Loved the close proximity to Champs lys es and the room was small but soooo luxurious Loved my Parisian view to the other buildings 
122522,H tel Vernet, Bad air conditioners we had to Chang the room Didn t bring iron when I asked for, When there were aproblem with the air condition they Chang my room to a better one 
122523,H tel Vernet,No Negative, Location Suite was good for a family with 2 children Staff friendly The hotel and rooms smell fantastic Interior very new and Coffe machine is a plus 
122524,H tel Vernet, Everything Staff are extremely rude especially front desk never seen something like that before ever Check in process is messy and not organized at all Rooms are extremely small i mean small to the point we struggled with our baby cot and 2 pieces of luggage You can t imagine how miserable our stay was An finally the famous Elevator with the lowest IQ on earth and slower than a turtle and smaller than match box Stay away from this hotel if you want to enjoy Paris , Only location Nothing else whatsoever
122525,H tel Vernet, Cappucinos we had at breakfast were slightly over priced and only other thing that wouldve made it even better is if there were some sort of gym spa facilities , Everything from the service cleanliness and visuals of the hotel were excellent 
122526,H tel Vernet,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff comfy beds spacious bathroom with powerful shower spotless rooms quiet and relaxing atmosphere Excellent for tourists on a street parallel to Champs Elysees and close to the Arc de Triomphe Elegant building typical of the Haussmann era with a glass dome over the dining room designed by Gustave Eiffel Feels fresh with modern furnishings and contemporary art adorning walls and ceilings We would go again 
122527,H tel Vernet, The room was a little on the small size and insufficient room in the wardrobe for a long coat Poor lighting in the bathroom for applying make up , The excellent location for central Paris most areas within walking distance The hotel was welcoming with a good bar and restaurant service 
122528,H tel Vernet, Although we kept clean the room sign since early morning we came back in the afternoon and the room was still not cleaned , The location is superb and the room is very beautiful and elegant
122529,H tel Vernet, I think the staff was a bit rude One of the staff was helping me to check in while a guests came and asked questions he stopped the check in process with me and I was standing there for 3 mins and waiting for them to finish their conversation until I asked him about my luggage and his reaction was a bit rude as well I went at 11 and their check in time at 3 therefore the staff suggested me to leave my stuff at the hotel but I think he forgot it after he took care of the other guests , the location was very nice it was only 1 min away from Champs Elysees 
122530,H tel Vernet, I made a genuine mistake when booking this hotel and accidentally booked it for a day earlier than required Arrived in Paris phoned the hotel who were extremely unhelpful and despite having available rooms for the night I needed and having taken the not so cheap room rate for the no show the night before they would not allow me to stay without repaying Apparently there is no such thing as customer goodwill anymore It might be a nice enough hotel but it s not cheap and in my experience the staff were rude and unhelpful Shame because I was really looking forward to staying there , I wouldn t know I didn t get the chance to stay there 
122531,H tel Vernet, They checked the mini bar a few times while we were in the room For the price we expected a level of class , It was located in a very touristy part of town 
122532,H tel Vernet, Check out process could be slightly quicker , Hotel is very modern and clean staffs are friendly attentive and helpful super comfortable bed paired with very nice pillows 
122533,H tel Vernet, Frequent billing mistakes with me and other customers However they solved it in a few days Better accounting will make this hotel awesome, Location staff
122534,H tel Vernet, On our arrival the concierge told us that the room we had booked which by the Booking was given to us for 2 adults and a child could only fit 2 persons because the policy of the hotel had changed from the time we booked 4 months before until the time we arrived this is inadmissible to happen as we could have stayed with a child without a room if the vacancy was full In any case after our complaints they arranged us of course with the price we had booked According to my opinion this was a problem of the hotel as the booking com gives me the oppportunity to book as early as I want, Very quiet Hotel extremely elegant facilities unique
122535,H tel Vernet, Nothing , Really perfect place You can feel that you are at your home Warmly welcome thanks mr lionel amazing smile thank you marina thanks for everyone Hope to stay again at here In next trip 
122536,H tel Vernet, Sad that they could not have connecting rooms because we was a group 4 girls but they Helped us to have the rooms very close together , Top service location lovely rooms Worth to visit The staff helped us a lot There s attention about change room etc was very good 
122537,H tel Vernet, some of the staff had attitude and were not responsive at all they were understaffed at the bar, the hotel design and deco comfortable rooms some of the staff really helpfull and attention to details
122538,H tel Vernet, A lot of things the service was horrendous I booked for 2 adults 2 children but was not allowed to open a sofa bed even after paying a supplement for a room upgrade because for some reason the room I booked was only for 2 peoples, The hotel is in a good location very central
122539,H tel Vernet,No Negative, The location of the Hotel Vernet is excellent within minutes walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Des Champs Elysees The hotel itself is very French charming small but very well designed staff was kind and extremely helpful Our room was small but very comfortable and excellent finishes Bathroom is beautiful We will definitely stay there on our next visit to the beautiful City of Lights 
122540,H tel Vernet, There were two of us sharing a room but the room really provide service for one I would say , Smart room bathroom hotel room provided adaptor for our devices so we didn t need to buy it comfy bed polite friendly helpful staff attentions to details Close to Most of the famous places We want to go back again 
122541,H tel Vernet, Everything the staff or rude the service was rude the facilities are poor there is no customer service there is no mutual respect for you human reality of human race it is appalling that this is on your website with such a high rating, There was nothing to like about this place except for location
122542,H tel Vernet, The service in the hotel is very bad The staff are not helpful at all and make you feel uncomfortable In the rooms there are no power points for computers or phone chargers and in the bathroom there are no power points for hairdryers or shavers The room service food is below par for a so called 5 star hotel When I asked for a late check out until 5pm they wanted to charge a full one night rate , The Location was good
