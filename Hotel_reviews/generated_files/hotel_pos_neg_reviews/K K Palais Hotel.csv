437583,K K Palais Hotel, Outside you see beautiful imperial building of the hotel Unfortunately inside it s a feeling that you are staying in one of a cheap network hotels Staff is friendly and helpful they re doing all their best but anyway you ve got an impression that it isn t a high level service This hotel has a great potential for development in future and we wish them big success , Great location Very quiet place in the city center 
437584,K K Palais Hotel, Nothing that we didn t like would recommend this hotel to anyone, location in a quiet area was great and a short stroll into the city centre and five minute walk to the underground staff were excellent with nothing too much trouble Breakfast had everything you could wish for and a very comfortable bed followed a long day 
437585,K K Palais Hotel, The pillows were way to soft and offered no support, The staff were helpful and friendly The breakfast was good and the setting of the hotel in a square was nice 
437586,K K Palais Hotel, Initial room at check in was occupied by another guest , Very convenient location for walking to shopping St Stephens Hofburg Palace and innerring sites 
437587,K K Palais Hotel, The amenities breakfast cleanliness of the the room were not up to par with the price we paid per night , Very good location at a 10 minute ride from the city center and all the hotspots 
437588,K K Palais Hotel, The ceiling over the bed was a little low and because my husband is tall he bumped his head a couple of times, The reception staff and bar staff were very helpful
437589,K K Palais Hotel, My room was a little small and offered no view but was still comfortable Some music in the breakfast room would help provide some atmosphere, Location was lovely a little out of the bustle but in a good way Across from a cute park and in a quiet neighbourhood except for the bells chiming The staff were attentive and polite breakfasts were generous and the bed was comfy Would definitely stay again
437590,K K Palais Hotel, Couldn t fault the hotel , Very well located on a quiet tree lined square within 10 minutes walk of all the attractions of the inner stadt Attentive knowledgeable staff very comfortable beds All necessary facilities provided Executive rooms on the front facing the square are larger with great walk in shower Good value for city centre hotel Excellent breakfast 
437591,K K Palais Hotel, Bed was too soft Air conditioning not effective on 1st night but better for other two nights we stayed we were told that maintenance had been undertaken , Good location on a quiet square Friendy efficient staff Smart hotel
437592,K K Palais Hotel, All good, Great location short walk to from airport bus facing pleasant green park quiet in the evening night Short walk to trams underground bus and nearby is an inexpensive Viennese restaurant Caf Theo 
437593,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Great selection for breakfast Room comfortable and quiet Great restaurant across the square Short walk to the metro tram station seniors get 2 rides for 1 
437594,K K Palais Hotel, An expensive hotel that became too expensive with the addition of 14 euros for breakfast should have been included in the price as it is in most other hotels , breakfasts excellent and nice to have good editions of English newspapers unusual and welcomed Staff was very professional and friendly and accommodating I wanted a quiet room to work and sleep off jet lag in and got the quietest room I ve ever had The cleaning staff was very accommodating and quiet Lovely location next to the tree filled square unusual for Vienna Close to the canal for walks and transportation loved the location 
437595,K K Palais Hotel, The rooms are a bit outdated and could use some help but overall a great size , The staff was a joy so friendly helpful and overall cheerful it was wonderful 
437596,K K Palais Hotel, This isn t really too bad but as with many hotels in around old town areas parking is a little tricky It s close enough but you have to go around the world in a series of 1 way streets I recommend dropping off your luggage directly in front of the hotel and getting instructions from the reception They have a map that will help you get to the parking , Hotel is within walking distance of old town about 10 min or so Also very close to Schottenring station for any Ubahn trips 
437597,K K Palais Hotel, The dysfunctional electronic key card to the room every single time it took several attempts to open the door , Excellent location in a quiet neighbourhood yet close to public transport restaurants and the city centre Comfortable beds friendly staff 
437598,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location in peaceful and pleasant area yet with city centre only a short walk away Also close to airport bus stop and an underground station Room was very comfortable and well equipped safe kettle flat screen TV and excellent free WiFi Delicious breakfast with choice of hot and cold foods Friendly and pleasant staff particularly John on reception who was most helpful Good restaurants bars located in the same square and a small supermarket 
437599,K K Palais Hotel, Room was rather warm but the hotel location was quite enough to open the window our preference to air conditioning Pillows were too soft for us personally ,No Positive
437600,K K Palais Hotel, Biscuits were with Tea coffee facility It looked like they were free but we had to pay , Good location Breakfast staff were very friendly Tea coffee facility 
437601,K K Palais Hotel, On arrival the room we were given was 603 on top floor and part of the roof slope in the room a small window you needed to stand on a chair to see out But it was changed , The second room 406 was one of the best rooms we have stayed in Breakfast was good choices and plenty
437602,K K Palais Hotel, At first we didn t get the room we originally booked and we had to ask for the room we paid which was better and biger Wifi was terrible , Excellent breakfast and good location 
437603,K K Palais Hotel, We had a room which was directly above the bar and we could hear the bass of the music However we were able to call down and they turned the music off and if guests were being too loud the staff asked them to lower their voices The hotel staff offered us another room but we were happy with the room and didn t move The staff were so helpful and we were very grateful for their efforts , Location is excellent The staff are super helpful and if you have any problems with the room they will do whatever they can to make it right We celebrated our tenth anniversary and we are glad we stayed here because the hotel made us feel very special The staff are always friendly and gave good recommendations for romantic evening strolls The room does get warm but it s quite nice when you have been out in the cold and you can always turn the radiator down There is also an excellent vegan restaurant two minutes away You are close to supermarkets too Should we come back to Vienna we would return to this hotel 
437604,K K Palais Hotel, The wash basin tap was impossible to control no power or water every where very poor design for use but very nice to look at Also the stopper was useless in fact it did not work at all We were in room 310, Very nice quite location and not far from public transport and in walking distance from some places Good restaurants near by 
437605,K K Palais Hotel, The internet is a bit slow and the connection breaks at times which was the only major inconvenience , Great location Good price Nice personnel Good breakfast 
437606,K K Palais Hotel, Average very little amenities no gym bed was very soft, The location was great easy 5min walk to main part of city The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about Vienna s history
437607,K K Palais Hotel, 1 Need a better selection of English language TV stations 2 Need more plugs in bedroom 3 Need more pillows in bedroom 4 Changeover of staff from weekend to weekday was noticeable weekend staff far friendlier and more pleasant , 1 Central convenient location 2 Excellent breakfast 3 On basis of our positive experiences at K K Palais Hotel in Vienna we booked our stay in K K Hotel in Budapest 
437608,K K Palais Hotel, Credit card payment issues at the time of arrival Somehow the hotel s credit card company could not detect prepaid payments quickly , The cleanliness of the hotel was impeccable 
437609,K K Palais Hotel, The wifi connection was poor and like all hotels the room was a bit overheated Fortunately the window could be opened wide , Very friendly staff they lent us an umbrella 
437610,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Super comfortable beds a nice simple decor very friendly staff good wifi Nice view from the room Don t expect some sort of overdone luxury with a million pillows and accoutrements it s the understated elegance that they are going for here 
437611,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location beautiful building and clean rooms The bathroom seemed recently renovated also A nice bar with cocktails of the day at very good prices Special thanks to bartender Lukasz for his excellent service and advice 
437612,K K Palais Hotel, Toiletries a bit bland Not enough comfortable chairs in room One bedside light didn t work , Good choice of everything at breakfast welcome coffees New Year s bubbles Lovely to look out upon a green square 
437613,K K Palais Hotel, The staff at breakfast They were rude and bad organized Annoying and not nice energy, Changing of towels everyday and good breakfast Also the building from the outside is great and the bedroom windows I liked best beautiful and original from the Kaiserzeit The view is pretty good and calming
437614,K K Palais Hotel, The Bistro turned out to be the bar area and some of the few things on the menu weren t available Also some of the Rooms have only got a view of a yellow wall , The Rooms were very clean and the bathroom also we were very warm and the heating controllable all the time I really enjoyed the cocktails and the bar area was cheerful or was that due to the cocktails But seriously very pleasing 
437615,K K Palais Hotel, I asked for non allergenic pillow s when I arrived and discovered the pillows are goose or duck feathers Nothing ever came of my request they didn t get back to me and no pillows showed up Also the breakfast room is far too small for the size of the hotel and amount of guests The hotel seems to have quite a few rooms that have no view at all and look out into the center of the building but it was quiet so that makes up for it to some extent , The bed was the best part of this stay I liked the overall feel of cleanliness and clean lines of the room I felt like I was in Hong Kong actually or some other upscale hotel with wooden walls and lots of glass but any sense you were staying in an old building in Vienna was lost with these upgrades quite sad really since Vienna is such a classic city Basically if you need a room in Vienna and don t care about ambience this hotel has great beds and rooms at the back are quiet unusual in a busy city You will hear St Stephens bells ring Also the window opens wide which is great when everyone else is convinced they re freezing but you re overheated plus the staff does not automatically have the heat on which is also an excellent choice Let your guests decide how warm they want to be save money and energy The last hotel I stayed at the Astoria Wien felt like entering the gates of Hell itself they had the heat cranked up when I first entered the room Completely unnecessary and that has to be expensive for them 
437616,K K Palais Hotel, Bar service very slow Room too hot Not enough pillows in room, Very helpful Reception staff Excellent breakfast Great location within easy walking distance of attractions but in a quiet square
437617,K K Palais Hotel, Nothing much really a few more days in Vienna and the K K Palais would have been nice , The breakfast was awesome Small buffet but what s there is really tasty and high quality The croissants were superb as was the sausages 
437618,K K Palais Hotel, Staff never on the desk but have to be coxed out of the office for every inquiry Breakfast room quite small and feels crowded Coffee is issued like it s on ration , A very modern but comfortable hotel in a good location easily walk able to the center of the city and the main sights A nice bar 
437619,K K Palais Hotel, Third or fourth time I booked a hotel via booking com and again I got one of the worst rooms This time room was on the last floor no view sloped ceiling practicaly no window Perhaps hotels taking booking com customers for granted , Cleanliness location breakfast were pretty good 
437620,K K Palais Hotel, The wifi dropped in and out every few minutes We were floor 5 and I couldn t see any booster boxes It was dropped out a lot in the breakfast room which was about a metre or so from a router in reception , Location to the city centre was great about 15 minutes depending where you wanted to get to The hotel is situated on a quiet street with a lovely square in front The staff were very friendly and the hotel manager left chocolates in our room as it was my sister s birthday with a lovely note 
437621,K K Palais Hotel, Not good to come back to your room at 6pm and find it gas not been cleaned Told housekeeping staff left at 4pm and this had never happened before Not much comfort there and very little by way of apology Very pleasant and helpful bar staff tried his best to help by offering us a free drink 3 in our family group but was told by management that we were only allowed 2 free drinks That actually made us even angrier Could have so easily different with a proper apology and concern for what had happened , Good location Nice hotel Good breakfast
437622,K K Palais Hotel, Water in the shower is too weak no pressure at all , Staff are really helpful but they could do by adding an extra person at the reception as people sometimes waits for a while to be served 
437623,K K Palais Hotel, The room was not ready when we arrived We were used to have a specific K K breakfast It has changed several specialities were missing The new grila from the reception are not very friendly I will not come back Even if I was a client for a period longer than 15 years Now this hotel is like Any other , Changes in the general presentation of the rooms breakfast It is obvious there is a new manager Not very satisfied with the changes
437624,K K Palais Hotel, we reported that the extractor fan did not work in the bathroom but it was not fixed and no explanation We travelled in a group of 4 friends and the other couple were given a double bed their room was exchanged the next day for one with 2 single beds but were given a lower rated room, Good breakfast Comfortable beds efficient air conditioning friendly staff
437625,K K Palais Hotel, The breakfast was just terrible For me the breakfast is the most important meal of the day and yes there were a lot of choices but ALL OF THEM were bad Definitely not going back to that hotel when i m staying in Vienna ,No Positive

437627,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Despite outside temperatures in the 30s the aircon in the room was always set at a comfortable level not by us and made it a pleasure to come back to after a busy day 
437628,K K Palais Hotel, The staff especially those who supposedly attending to the bar seemed a little disgruntled when asked for something , The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom very spacious 
437629,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, One of the rare occassions I visit a hotel where everything is right Situated at a little park Beautifull old but well renovated building Close to all the good things to see in the city center Cheerful and nice staff Very comfertable room Good breakfast 
437630,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Great service and the reception team were more than happy to help For central Vienna it was quiet enough to get rest and close enough to walk everywhere 
437631,K K Palais Hotel, Breakfast spread could have been a bit more varied , Spotless room and bath Comfy bed Staff was very helpful Cloise to all the action in the inner stadt but away from the noise 
437632,K K Palais Hotel, A bit far from stephenplatz and main area with not much to do around the hotel , Eddy at reception was very friendly and helpful Located in a quiet area with not much city noise Breakfast was good with same menu everyday Serving ladies not so friendly We were given rooms with low ceiling but Eddy had them changed to proper ceiling room without much hassle 
437633,K K Palais Hotel, Booking com confirmed 2 double rooms but none were available The staff made some changes so that we could stay for the night thus in 2 singlerooms Price of a bottle of water 5 , The helpfull staff eager to sort out the mistake booking com made Free parking due to weekend 
437634,K K Palais Hotel, Breakfast was far from the standars of a 4 hotel Small room Not even close to the 25 square meters that are presented in the description Unfriendly staff Not that close from stephanplatz as presented Not the hotel you wanna pay 150 euros night Never gonna stay there again , Don t have anything nice to say about the hotel 
437635,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Nice quite hotel in a great location as we could walk to most places we were interested in seeing Staff couldn t be more friendly and helpful I would highly recommend this hotel 
437636,K K Palais Hotel, The key is large very old and only one key available for room Breakfast was average No iron available in the room , Good staff very helpful particularly reception people good location clean room quit room nice neighborhood 
437637,K K Palais Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work we could hear all the water pipes and drinks at breakfast very slow to be sorted but just our room as friends next door had no such issues , Location to underground and centre excellent 
437638,K K Palais Hotel, No English newspapers More tea and coffee in room Extra charges added after booking which were originally shown as included This should have been honoured, Clean friendly staff excellent buffet breakfast
437639,K K Palais Hotel, Room Heating needs further adjustment, Courteous and knowledgeable staff willing and able to Anticipate present and future needs delicious and varied breakfasts lovely location quiet but within walking distance of most major attractions 
437640,K K Palais Hotel, Room was small and too warm Luckily we were on the fifth floor facing the back of the hotel and were able to open the window The sink drain had an unpleasant smell at times , Bed was very comfortable shower efficient and complimentary toiletries a bonus All staff were cheerful and the breakfast was good 
437641,K K Palais Hotel, Just a minor point the pillows could be improved , We enjoyed our 5 day holiday in Vienna very much The location of the hotel was great It takes about 15 20 minutes to walk into the historic area You are also within walking distance of the Danube Canal The hotel was very good and the staff friendly and helpful There is a restaurant next door Das Heinz very convenient I would recommend the K K Palais and would go there again 
437642,K K Palais Hotel, Breakfast room can be crowded at weekends and food bar was a bit cramped , The location perfect for airport bus close to metro tram and bus stops 15 mins walk from most attractions Comfortable and quiet Lovely staff friendly helpful Bobby at front desk went out of his way to help breakfast staff always friendly and helpful
437643,K K Palais Hotel, It was a shame the hotel didn t have a restaurant for the evenings but staff recommended two within the square both of which were really good friendly staff great surroundings and excellent food , My mum I both seniors went for a short break in Vienna and chose the K K after reading all the reviews The reception staff were very friendly helpful advising us on appropriate transport etc We must especially mention Bobby Valerie Thankyou The room was immaculate if a little small It was comfortably furnished and well equipped The free WiFi was excellent The breakfast room staff were pleasant attentive I had read both excellent poor reviews about breakfast so wondered what we might find In our view it was standard The hotel was within walking distance of St Stephens Cathedral even for my mum who is 83 We used the glass topped hop on hop off buses to go everywhere else They have a tour description in many languages through headphones An excellent way to see the old part of the city The highlight of our visit was the Strauss Mozart concert at Kursalon at the city park Stadpark It was professional but informal entertaining There was a small orchestra a tenor a soprano and two ballet dancers Absolutely enthralling We had a wonderful break Thankyou 
437644,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Hotel was the usual KK high standard Perfect location close to all transport and the centre Bobby on reception was very helpful and took the trouble to show us where to get the airport bus which meant we did not have to rush breakfast on our last morning 
437645,K K Palais Hotel, The bathroom is small and there is no space to put your belongings I would also complain for the tap which is very much designed but totally useless Takes too long time to set it and in the meantime the hot water might flow to your hands Wifi is very poor The breakfast staff is not very nice They do their job but no smile no kindness , Check in out were very quick and easy The Receptionists are very friendly and helpful Room is not big but OK Clean and comfortable Very quiet but it was a week end Prices are reasonable and the additional requests were done immediately 
437646,K K Palais Hotel, At breakfast we had to ask for water as jug was empty We also had to ask for bread and butter as both empty Croissants were available one morning only out of three Although sparkling wine was on menu it was never available , Very comfortable room and bed Great shower Fabulous location quiet but central

437650,K K Palais Hotel, Only that the breakfast said in the book in the room that it closed at 1100 and when we went down at 1040 it was already closed Otherwise everything was perfect , Pretty much everything It was an outstanding hotel 
437651,K K Palais Hotel, Possibly a livelier bar area but not a problem as they are so many lovely bars and cafes nearby , The range of items available for breakfast was amazing The staff were incredible and kept fresh supplies flowing all the time The rooms were cleaned beautifully and if we saw staff on the corridors they always gave a friendly hello The reception staff were also extremely helpful 
437652,K K Palais Hotel,No Negative, Lovely quiet hotel good location Staff tried very hard to ensure I had a comfortable stay although I wish the receptionists had been a little more friendly The breakfast was good although limited for vegetarians my waitress was lovely and always served my coffee promptly and housekeeping was excellent Would happily stay again recommended

437654,K K Palais Hotel, The room was very small with no place to put a toiletry bag anywhere Also the bathroom smelled of stale urine mixed with cigarette smoke if it had not been for the smell of the room and the window it would have been a great hotel there were complimentary bottles of water which is always appreciated Our room on the 6th floor looked like it could have been an attic with a window that was one could not look out of as it was really high up in roof of the room very unpleasant Luckily I was there for only one night , Great location
437655,K K Palais Hotel, Nothing I liked everything about this hotel it deserves a 5 star grading, Good location short walk to many restaurants and into city centre but on a nice quiet square so a peaceful nights sleep the nice The size of the room good selection in minibar 
437656,K K Palais Hotel, The hotel itself is old without modern furnitures The room temperature is always high which makes the room without fresh air I booked executive room but there s no balcony comparing to other executive rooms Also the bathroom is so small that the water from the shower is easily flowing to the outside Overall it is not worthy to pay Euro170 for staying one night , Quite close to the airport bus stop The breakfast is amazing with plenty of choices The bed is comfortable enough for us to recover from the long flight 
437657,K K Palais Hotel, Breakfast is poor it seams as if you are always observed to take more than you deserve , The location near Danube Chanel perfect for river trips clean room bath is very clean water and chocolate as a copliment every day
