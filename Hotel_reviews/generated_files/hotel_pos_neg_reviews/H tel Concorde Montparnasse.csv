179767,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Hotel had no shower gel no soap no shampoo bath tube dirty view from the room was on patio and actually it was a view on huge ashtray cigaretes were all over Plus we had room where someone was smoking Because we were hungry for Paris we did not have time to make all the complains we did not want to waste time and personnel from the Hotel was rather not that enthusiastic to help They listen but that was it To conclude Hotel is in good location The metro station is close As a 4 star Hotel i would expect some more therefore i thing this price should be at least 10 less , The room was OK
179768,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The original agreement with the reservation was broken at check In We had an awful experience not a family friendly place We are a family of six two of our kids had to sleep in room alone although the original agreement was different they are both minors and we had sleepless nights going to their room many times at night and them calling us every couple of hours Let go having to unexpectedly pay for a third room , Breakfast was good rooms ok
179769,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I cannot think if anything , Cannot really comment on the restaurants in the area as I was not there for one night and made use of the room service I was upgraded and had a view of the Eiffel Tower although I did have to lean over a bit to see it Also was on the same side of the road as the station and only a 5 minute or so walk away 
179770,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, A little tired but clean and comfortable , Excellent location next to Gare Montparnasse Good access to Bastille Day fireworks at Eiffel Tower

179773,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, We have no complaints about this property at all , This is a great location for people having a short time in Paris and transferring between Charles de Gaulle airport and TGV trains Our room was clean and had a big desk in room espresso maker nice tub shower etc and a view of the Eiffel Tower It is not in the exact center of Paris but a moderate walk to a lot of great stuff and the Air France CDG Airport Bus and TGV trains stop 1 block from the hotel 
179774,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room price as usual in Paris a bit on the high side compared to what you get , Breakfast has been good with a nice variety and possibility to select own preferred choices Service staff all has been generally very friendly and customer minded 
179775,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Absence of a proper fridge what they call minibar is actually a vending machine no place for your own food or drink requirements , Very comfy beds friendly and efficient reception staff
179776,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, No electric kettle Tea drinkers not catered for , Good functional hotel located close to Montparnasse train station Very clean spacious room Nespresso machine in room Strong fast wi fi 
179777,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, breakfast is so so if you stay more than there days it will be quite boring every day breakfast is same , room is large compared to other same price level hotels in Paris easy to park shuttle bus to CDG airport close to Metro Lots of restaurants in walking distance 
179778,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There were only 2 outlets in the room amd one was buried behind a nightstand Our room on the 5th floor had ants and housekeeping woke us up early since they thought our room was vacated , Great location to the train station Top notch front desk staff 
179779,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There was no fridge available in the room Also there was no warning on the vending machine in the room stating that once you take a drink out to have a look at the label you can not put it back The wifi had to be re set often as it didn t work very well More when asked for the use of a microwave the staff in other hotels even offered a microwave in the kitchen but a staff at Concord Mont was not friendly Also the powerpoint for electricity was not near the bed side table ,No Positive
179780,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, We had to change room 3 times due to problems with the room then being sent to a room that was already occupied We only had 2 days in Paris and where meeting friends for a bday party later that day We spent in hours in the hotel before we had a room that was acceptable standard as agreed by Manager We arrived back a hotel 11 25pm that evening and were told there were no possibly for us to get any food at all No room service the Bar was also closed The staff seemed to find this amusing Very surprising service levels for one of the prominent World Capital Cities , Bed was comfy
179781,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Drinks and food on the expensive side The rooms are looking a bit worn out since I last stayed there Beds are a bit small, Good Location and Parking Good reception areas
179782,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, A pair of my trousers were lost I had washed them and hung them to dry but they had gone when we returned to the room Many enquiries solicited shrugs and sympathy but nothing I am not happy with their response at all, bed very comfortable and the surrounding area has plenty to see Metro just down the street Lots of Bistros just 300 metres from the door 
179783,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I had a terrible time connecting to the hotel s complimentary Wifi no password needed but my Ipad kept saying cannot be verified We had stayed at this hotel two years ago with no Wifi problems so I assumed my Ipad still had in its memory the hotel s Wifi but that the French police were monitoring all Wifi s now and since my connection was two years old and before the large terrorist activities I had to somehow verify myself and my Ipad with the authorities and I had no idea how to do that In the end it had more to do with the hotel wanting my cookies and I had to re register everyday to get a Wifi connection and agree to whatever this hotel s pop up screen wanted , Third time staying at this hotel Great location for train travel obviously Efficient and helpful staff Two years ago front desk gave us a room with perfect Eiffel Tower view This time front desk awarded us with a fabulous quiet courtyard facing second floor room that enabled us to sleep with the window ajar and hear the soothing sounds of the courtyard fountain late into the night very restful especially considering we were next to Gare Montparnasse Within walking distance of great restaurants and all that is wonderful about Paris 
179784,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, at the end of the stay you have to pay taxes on top of the price you payed on booking com its never mentioned not on the website not on booking com not when you check in only when you checkout be careful And don t order a taxi from the concierge Price is about 15 20 higher rated then normal ones, perfect breakfast nice room quiet

179787,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Unfriendly staff member and indifference in assisting us Would not recommend , Not much Unfortunately the staff member who booked us in had little interest in assisting not even a smile 
179788,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Horrible breakfast Scrambled eggs not cooked Coffee cold waited in queue five min then told room full took us another room downstairs After that never went back Had breakfast across the street and 1 2 the price and great food 
179789,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Some staff were a bit abrupt when we had a query The first room we were allocated was exceptionally warm and we requested and were given another room We were upgraded which was nice too I guess it was just the attitude of some of the people they were not welcoming a all it put us off , The breakfast selection was large Eggs extra creamy if you like them that way The bar on the side does quite a nice selection for dinner huge proportions 
179790,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Complete chaos at the reception I was given an occupied room twice and got stuck in the elevator in the meantime Light switches were very dirty and the room was small and noisy My colleague had the exact same experience Not worth the price , Good location 
179791,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, One of the Left where I need to insert my room card to select my floor isn t working , Staff are very friendly and helpful I like the smoking garden area 
179792,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room was too small stuffy and dark Furnitures were old and dark painted There was a door opening to the next room and all the noise was coming through the door There was no refrigerator in the room There were only two plug sockets and located in very useless spots It was a complete disappointment for its cost ,No Positive
179793,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, This place is only missing a pool to be a five star hotel, Hotel staff very welcoming for the whole stay great location to all attractions and food in the resturant was amazing 
179794,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There was nothing to dislike about the hotel or location , Lovely clean hotel in a wonderful location Went for our anniversary and would highly recommend it Would definitely go again 
179795,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, It was freezing cold Temp in my room was 18degrees which I could see on the aircon panel It was impossible to heat up the room After hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was 19 5 degrees This is unacceptable I complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room My colleagues had another room and it was the same I also got mail that I can t get breakfast and can pay 10eur for cereal and order it to my room What a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast I definitely do not recommend to anyone , Nothing special as for the high price 
179796,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Antipathetic stuff of the reception Cold figures with any desire to respond to our needs just asking for 2 more shampoo tubes , Great view to Eiffel Tower Perfect location Very close to Montparnasse Train Station 
179797,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, very compact rooms and in break fast omlete will charge you extra , Very near to Metro stations Gare Geite Montpernase cost per person 1 90 u can change any line as well as Airport shuttle bus service walkable distance will cost per person 17 from to CDG Airport and Orly Airport If you hire taxi will cost you 55 one way and Receiption Staff are very helpful and room service supervisor check the quality of cleaning daily with the guest 
179798,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Saturday was the very busiest day for breakfast not enough staff on duty meant long ques , Very good location and wonderful service from everyone on the front desk Breakfast must be the best in Paris
179799,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The lifts were a bit unpredictable and we had to keep getting our electronic key card re authorised at the desk, Beds were really comfy Room was large and just the right temperature
179800,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The staff I told the front desk it was my birthday which it was and no complimentary treats cake wine voucher for a dinner night or thank you s to me for choosing this place Then someone or housekeeping sole my diamond ring The front desk manager was less than helpful in resolving the situation and had no sense of urgency Oh did I mention that their security door equipment didn t work to modify who goes in and out of the room The interior of the room is soooooo out dated for what they charge per night The layout of the room didn t make sense either There s no outlets by the bed You have to lay at the foot of the bed to use the desk outlet or the T V s usb The view I had was horrible This hotel was the worse experience I d ever had in all my years of traveling I do not recommend you waste your time here nor spend your money for their terrible service Find another hotel You will be better off , It was a good location and I enjoyed their shower gel and bath salt 
179801,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Very nice hotel with comfortable rooms great breakfast and super professional staff a special thank you to Celestin in Front Desk he was vey welcoming and helpful sure we will come back again 
179802,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Carpets are quite old made me sneeze all the time, Great location It s very near the Metro Eifel Tower is less than 3km away very walkable you ll enjoy every step 
179803,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Temp in the Hotel warm but room had set temp so couldn t change it , Food excellent staff very friendly and helpful Room was large and bed comfy Had presser in room that was great for suits 
179804,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Had to wait in a queue for breakfast one morning In the bar they had no dry white wine apart from Chardonny, Plenty choice at breakfast Lovely view of Eiffel Tower from bedroom Hotel central for getting around Paris
179805,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, When I checke out the lady told me that I used the minibar twice But sure I didn t THen she said that I ordered at the restaurant 3 drinks and I have to pay and also I didn t so she asked me to sign on a paper to justify my signature then after she said will see Sure the result was I was right but I didn t like that , The hotel near the railway station very comfort and cleanliness Prices are affordable 
179806,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, putting a mini refrigerator in the room will give added points providing complimentary drinking water would improve the image does anyone don t brush their teeth everyday I think this is the least thing every guest would expect not to see in a hotel bathroom , the breakfast has a few good choices but complete in every range the hotel location is what i most appreciated about this hotel 
179807,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There s no fridge in the room Incredible for a hotel of that standard and price The so called minibar is actually a vending machine and prices are not even indicated Other negative point when leaving the reception offered to call a taxi without telling me that this would cost me an additional 4 EUR at the end of the ride If I had known I d just walked down the street , Nice stylish rooms and very comfy beds Kind and helpful reception staff Coffee and tea making facilities are provided I had requested a specific room and got one quite close to the one I wanted which I appreciated a lot 
179808,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Lacked character huge and not very Parisian Unfortunately despite very professional front desk being one branch of an homogeneous multi national hotel chain meant that we could have been anywhere , Very comfy bedding though would have been good to have top sheet Really good coffee machine 
179809,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, all the other things could have been better the most remarkable things was that the hotel staff is absolutely incompetent and made my check out a nightmare i would highly appreciate if immediate actions would be taken against the reception staff that worked on the 03 10 16 and a woman named Helena most of all , the location is great
179810,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, As always in Paris the price should have been lower , A pleasant if compact room in a good central location The fixtures and fittings seemed to be of a high quality 
179811,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Location is good very close to tour eiffel and lot of other attractions right next to a metro train station and a bus to CDG I would stay again 
179812,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Receptionist with an unpleasent attitude And a non smoking room that smelled like it had been smoked in , Great breakfast Good location for travellers arriving or departing from Montparnas train station
179813,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Nothing , The location to Montparnasse Station was important and you don t get much closer The staff were great and you can walk to many tourist spots even in an afternoon 
179814,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The name of the hotel has changed and the name on the hotel is different from the name on our confirmation We should have been made aware of that before traveling We spent some time wandering around trying to find a hotel that matched the name on our confirmation ,No Positive
179815,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I booked this hotel thinking it is the Lafayete Concorde Hotel which was way better than this one It should be 2 or 3 stars hotel only But not 4 stars hotel by any means No free water upon arrival Breakfast is less quantity quality than other 4 stars hotels , Location is close to Eiffel tower 
179816,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Location not fantastic but it was ok Was disappointed with service in the room Fridge terrible linen on bed a bit average and one morning we had to share a towel as the lady only replaced one towel in our room Even though we had used two the day prior , Nice place clean and modern Felt right at home when I walked in the room Staff good and breakfast quite good 
179817,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The Hotel Bar closes at 11 Not a major issue but could have been nice to chill for a bit longer There appears to be a waiting list 2 days worth for an iron and an ironing board , Staff were extremely friendly In addition staff were multilingual just a great bonus really Location was perfect as soon as you leave the hotel turn right and walk for 5 seconds around the hotel and you will be starring at the Eiffel Tower 30 40 minutes of picturesque walk towards it The Metro line was next door as well line number 4 which takes you to the sightseeings you require Les Halles is a very good shopping centre for some non expensive extras you may need which is also a 3 minute walk from the Louvre Back to the Hotel now rooms were nice and clean and staff are very keen on keeping them this way as during one of the days we had 5 visits from the cleaning staff this is a positive comment by the way Do put up a sign if you don t wanna be disturbed One other thing for those who like beer but might find the taste a bit offputting with each consumption do ask for order beer with grenadine you will not regret it either in hotel or any other place in Paris Overall experience was pleasant and enjoyable 
179818,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The organization of reception is not good It makes you wait to leave or to arrive In addition the lack of wait line organization creates tension and makes room for misunderstandings between guests of many nationalities I want to make clear that this is not a criticism of the staff who are quite good but of the organization management , The location 
179819,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The breakfast menu did not change over the course of a week and became very monotonous after 3 days , Mateo the front desk clerk was extremely helpfull and effiecient in dealing with our complaints and needs 
179820,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, I stayed here with my mum for a night as I was switching apartments The room was very clean the beds comfortable and the staff incredibly polite and helpful The hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood although a bit more modern not the classic Hausmann architecture if you care about that sort of thing well connected to some of the major tourist attraction by metro or just a walk It s great for its proximity to the Montparnasse tower where you can get a great view of Paris Eiffel tower included Overall we really enjoyed our stay We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet so if you can select a deal that has it included might not be a bad idea Bonus point s You get a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower just around the corner of the hotel And in front if you are a looking for a nice typical Parisian bistro dinner the Cafe Ernest is a good choice at a fairly reasonable price 
179821,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Receptionist very patronizing Such a shame after such a great impression from the night staff, After being stuck on a train for 12 hours the night staff room service team were superb
179822,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Rooms very dingy and old fashioned Breakfast average Staff miserable Very unhelpful in reception and don t know the basics of the area Would not stay again as in modern day hotels it is not up to general standards Beds hard as rocks, Location
179823,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Size of room but Paris is known for small rooms Position of safe is not practicable I didn t take some food breakfast in the Hotel so I cannot evaluate , We got a special offer and upgraded to a superior room View to Tour Eiffel Nice Room small but okay Beds very comfortable Location very well Direct busses from Airport starts ends in front of the house A lot of restaurants bars in 10min walking distance 
179824,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Not enough staff spoke English , Easy access for the willing traveller to public transport so prices from surrounding area cheaper than those closer to attractions 
179825,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, One guy at front desk was not helpful We were told that we booked twin room and not a double room and the option is to upgrade by paying 50 extra 10 minutes later the other person at reception said a double room is available as well as the upgrade option Transparency regarding the rates for upgrade was missing Upgraded room only has a better view and not much else The furniture etc in upgraded room is same and fittings were improper Minibar bottle container once opened cannot be closed and you have to buy drinks if you accidently push open the lid I think they give upgrade options to every guest just to make extra bucks Disappointed , Nice lobby good location 
179826,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room is very very small not even room to walk around Room is in bad shape You can not pay with Maestro I did need to go to the bank to get cash money Much better hotels in Paris than this one , Flat screen TV
179827,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, I drove to France to settle my daughter into University there Hotel was perfect Staff lovely room comfy esp in hot weather and car parking convenient No one minded my poor command of French everyone spoke good English 
179828,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room was very quiet once you turned off the air conditioning with good doubleglazing even though it looked over the Place Catalogne Except for the minibar which could not be turned off it appeared to be linked directly to some central system for recording what had been taken out of the fridge However the helpful staff at reception organised for it to be turned off even though this was not a normal request full marks to them Once it was turned off the room was very quiet Hotels seem to think that quiet room means no external noise but appear to ignore internal noises such as air con and minibars the noise from which can be just as intrusive , Great location for Gare Montparnasse 5 minutes walk away Very good fish restaurant nearby Very quiet room once the minibar had been turned off see my other comments Helpful staff Good choice of food for breakfast 
179829,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The coffee machine needed a degree in coffee making to work it out , Superb room we were upgraded from a classic to a classic deluxe on arrival at no extra charge Superb soundproofing we overlooked a very busy roundabout and heard nothing Clean tidy well staffed
179830,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, A bit noisy old fashion At almost 20 the breakfast is definitely not a good deal , Convenient if one arrives departs from the Montparnasse station
179831,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Having breakfast at 0730 on a Sunday morning with what appeared to be 3 coach loads of extremely loud and annoying people If this sort of arrangement is in place then reserve the breakfast room accordingly for a specific time so that normal guests can enjoy a relaxing peaceful breakfast Only one receptionist on duty when I arrived and had to wait 15 minutes to check in whilst she dealt with a man who had a big problem Get the reception area properly staffed Having paid for the hotel by credit card then having to pay an extra 5 for taxes Why can t this be taken at the time of payment , Convenient for Montparnasse station
179832,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Price the windows could not be opened the mini bar has some drawers in order to use it only with the drinks of the hotel , The staff the cleanliness position 
179833,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Hot and humid outside set room a c to 19C but it struggled to maintain temp at 22C Initially promised 2 adjacent rooms but it did not happen at check in , Breakfast was good multiple selections but the same every day Staff was friendly and tried to accommodate Close to major station for public transportation 
179834,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, They have 2 restorants one is from 8 00 to 12 30 The second is from 7 30 to 10 00 something like this One day we wake up 10 00 and we was want to eat in this first restorant And they say no Like this we was one day withiut breakfast The reception women was really good She say i will bring breakfast in the room But this is not good when they say for you you can go and after you can not , All most everything was good 
179835,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, No fridge in the room The minibar is actually a vending machine with direct billing but no prices mentioned Whereas food and drink in the hotel is expensive and of poor quality , Very comfy beds nice looking rooms classy dark wooden furniture and white walls sufficient space very friendly and helpful reception staff 
179836,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room smells weird and all the electricity switches are sticky I think the carpet has never been cleaned , The staff is really friendly and very good selection of breakfast 
179837,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Only one power point near the door to recharge my phone If I want to connect my personal computer I need to stay near the door Really crazy , The hotel is very close to the bus stop to the airport
179838,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There is no business centre therefore no access to a printer Also despite our request for a view room on a higher floor we were placed on the first floor overlooking the central courtyard The fridge cannot be used to store personal beverages , We stayed for 6 nights and were generally pleased with the overall experience The bed was comfortable the toiletries were top notch and there is ample storage for one s clothing footwear Also appreciated the kettle and daily teabags Our room was VERY quiet consequently we slept well The buffet breakfast both hot and cold selections was excellent and well worth the additional daily expense Lastly the metro and train station are close by which was very handy for accessing all of the sights 
179839,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Everything was good, Good facilities Meal was nice too And extraordinary kind staffs If you need something just ask Then they ll kindly help you 
179840,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, The location was excellent for access to the Gare Montparnasse train station and the Le Bus Direct buses to CDG airport Breakfast buffet was excellent Were able to check in very early 
179841,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Only got towels for 1 person but we didnt mind as the service staff was good , Free room upgrade great price gave me a deal on parking to only pay 24H Parking is good and cheap 20euro a day instead of the parking nextdoor 35euro Good location for city
179842,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Nothing I will stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Paris I have also recommended it to several friends , The staff was very helpful and the property was clean and comfortable Nice choice for dinning and excellent location 
179843,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, This is very expensive and small for a 4 hotel My expectation of room size was not met with it being a squeeze to get past the end of the bed so close was it to the sideboard This was despite the fact that I paid extra for a slightly larger room too There was no chair in the room Room was a little bit sticky i e could have been a little cleaner , Staff were very helpful knowledgeable and friendly The lobby was good and it is maybe 300m from the Metro There is an entire street full of crepe bars a little way past the Metro We did get a view of the Eiffel Tower over the street and the noise level for a second floor room over a large road was better than expected 
179844,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room and bathroom amenities I am quite sure the hotel could be a bit more generous in this area For instance they could supply ceramics China coffee tea cups and GLASS made drinking glasses instead of plastic or cardboard paper cups , Very professional helpful smiling friendly staff 
179845,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The wireless internet is not good at all Slow connection one gets bumped off a lot regardless of the system Android iOS , Good location metro station nearby 
179846,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Bath would not drain hair dryer did not work hot stuffy room The hotel needs an upgrade Can t use the room fridge for your own things , Close to the train station Good staff 
179847,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Can t really say I have any complaints right now didn t have much dealings with the personnel we know our way around Paris speak French fluently , The room was bigger than the average in similar locations The buffet breakfast was American Style very plentiful although on the pricey side with our low Canadian dollar 
179848,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, really really hot inside bad condition we called the staff twice and finally the came after 30mins but it still got the whole night bad bad , it was clean and provided the slippers 
179849,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Wake up call was 20 minutes late, Location very close to train station Lively quarter at Gaiete just a 10 minute walk View of Eiffel tower with supplement 
179850,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, 19 for breakfast when there a numerous cafes brasseries around and in the station at least half the price , Perfect for the early morning train from Montparnasse Better quality and larger rooms then some of the cheaper hotels in the area
179851,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Poor language capabilities among the non reception related staff extremely hard in conference business area Tried to order a tray with small food sandwiches I could as well have ordered a trip to planet Mars , Polite helpful reception 
179852,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The door to the bathroom cannot be closed and no one bothered to get them fixed during our 10 nites stay in Room 748 , Location accessibility to buses metro Great front desk staff ever willing to guide us on our daily route 
179853,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room could have been a bit better and also no gym facilities available, It was well situated with a great view of the eiffel tower Excellent staff with very a helpful attitude
179854,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, didn t feel very secure in the rooms Was laying in bed one evening watching Television and a male who did not work at the establishment entered the room realising we was in bed continued to walk back exiting the room View from the room was rail lines and the side of a building Over priced for what you was getting almost 20 for a pre made sandwich Didn t enjoy it at all Paris I feel after going was a huge waste of money Eiffel Tower is swarmed by beggars gentleman selling tat men that will walk over grab your hand and continue to tie bracelets around your hands without consent when asked what they are doing and how much is this going to cost they said don t worry hakuna matata after saying I have no notes they untied the bracelet and moved to the next couple and Taxi bikes that will ride I front of you almost running you down and continue to bug you when ignoring them will shout curses at you in French when walking away Rubbish piles stacked metres from the hotel cupboards boxes mattresses Tramps cover the streets around the hotel Some not very many beautiful buildings the rest is almost like council apartments Although France can be beautiful do not go to Paris It was pretty much a building site the sky line was filled with cranes and sheet metal fences Just wanted to pay leave and come home , The staff 
179855,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Not close enough to metro There s a great view of the eifel tower from the street but it s not as close as it appears so do not walk from the hotel because it s like 30 min away , It s a great place to stay Very friendly and helpful staff 
179856,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The breakfast was too expensive , the staff are excellent every question we had in regards to travel etc were all answered with great depth They were very helpful The location is great too the metro line and a tour bus are just at the end of the street 
179857,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The fridge in the room was automatic so you couldn t store your own products in it without being charged This was particularly unhelpful as I needed to store my insulin needles and a couple of fizzy drinks , A brilliant hotel in a brilliant location Very friendly staff and comfortable spacious room 
179858,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Reception desk was unhelpful and not the friendliest bunch Location was fine if catching public transport but if walking it is still some distance from most main attractions I m English speaking and appreciate it to be a French hotel but except BBC news all other programs are in French or German and not with English subtitles either , Room was a good size for Paris and kept very well by the house cleaning team and staff
179859,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, That we couldn t put our own drinks in the fridge or they would charge us , The staff We had never been to Paris before and they showed us where to go each day on the map 
179860,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Told we could buy tickets for sites went to buy two for the Eiffel Tower and was told we couldn t buy any Website said 10 mins from Eiffel Tower it was a 30 40 minute walk , Good location Very quiet 
179861,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The hotel was far too hot There was a fan heater in the room but it only blew out hot air even when the temperature control was reduced We complained and they said it would be sorted but it wasn t , The hotel was nice clean and in a good location The staff were friendly welcoming and spoke good English

180113,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Hotel had no shower gel no soap no shampoo bath tube dirty view from the room was on patio and actually it was a view on huge ashtray cigaretes were all over Plus we had room where someone was smoking Because we were hungry for Paris we did not have time to make all the complains we did not want to waste time and personnel from the Hotel was rather not that enthusiastic to help They listen but that was it To conclude Hotel is in good location The metro station is close As a 4 star Hotel i would expect some more therefore i thing this price should be at least 10 less , The room was OK
180114,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The original agreement with the reservation was broken at check In We had an awful experience not a family friendly place We are a family of six two of our kids had to sleep in room alone although the original agreement was different they are both minors and we had sleepless nights going to their room many times at night and them calling us every couple of hours Let go having to unexpectedly pay for a third room , Breakfast was good rooms ok
180115,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I cannot think if anything , Cannot really comment on the restaurants in the area as I was not there for one night and made use of the room service I was upgraded and had a view of the Eiffel Tower although I did have to lean over a bit to see it Also was on the same side of the road as the station and only a 5 minute or so walk away

180119,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, We have no complaints about this property at all , This is a great location for people having a short time in Paris and transferring between Charles de Gaulle airport and TGV trains Our room was clean and had a big desk in room espresso maker nice tub shower etc and a view of the Eiffel Tower It is not in the exact center of Paris but a moderate walk to a lot of great stuff and the Air France CDG Airport Bus and TGV trains stop 1 block from the hotel 
180120,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room price as usual in Paris a bit on the high side compared to what you get , Breakfast has been good with a nice variety and possibility to select own preferred choices Service staff all has been generally very friendly and customer minded

180123,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, breakfast is so so if you stay more than there days it will be quite boring every day breakfast is same , room is large compared to other same price level hotels in Paris easy to park shuttle bus to CDG airport close to Metro Lots of restaurants in walking distance 
180124,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There were only 2 outlets in the room amd one was buried behind a nightstand Our room on the 5th floor had ants and housekeeping woke us up early since they thought our room was vacated , Great location to the train station Top notch front desk staff 
180125,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There was no fridge available in the room Also there was no warning on the vending machine in the room stating that once you take a drink out to have a look at the label you can not put it back The wifi had to be re set often as it didn t work very well More when asked for the use of a microwave the staff in other hotels even offered a microwave in the kitchen but a staff at Concord Mont was not friendly Also the powerpoint for electricity was not near the bed side table ,No Positive
180126,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, We had to change room 3 times due to problems with the room then being sent to a room that was already occupied We only had 2 days in Paris and where meeting friends for a bday party later that day We spent in hours in the hotel before we had a room that was acceptable standard as agreed by Manager We arrived back a hotel 11 25pm that evening and were told there were no possibly for us to get any food at all No room service the Bar was also closed The staff seemed to find this amusing Very surprising service levels for one of the prominent World Capital Cities , Bed was comfy
180127,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Drinks and food on the expensive side The rooms are looking a bit worn out since I last stayed there Beds are a bit small, Good Location and Parking Good reception areas
180128,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, A pair of my trousers were lost I had washed them and hung them to dry but they had gone when we returned to the room Many enquiries solicited shrugs and sympathy but nothing I am not happy with their response at all, bed very comfortable and the surrounding area has plenty to see Metro just down the street Lots of Bistros just 300 metres from the door 
180129,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I had a terrible time connecting to the hotel s complimentary Wifi no password needed but my Ipad kept saying cannot be verified We had stayed at this hotel two years ago with no Wifi problems so I assumed my Ipad still had in its memory the hotel s Wifi but that the French police were monitoring all Wifi s now and since my connection was two years old and before the large terrorist activities I had to somehow verify myself and my Ipad with the authorities and I had no idea how to do that In the end it had more to do with the hotel wanting my cookies and I had to re register everyday to get a Wifi connection and agree to whatever this hotel s pop up screen wanted , Third time staying at this hotel Great location for train travel obviously Efficient and helpful staff Two years ago front desk gave us a room with perfect Eiffel Tower view This time front desk awarded us with a fabulous quiet courtyard facing second floor room that enabled us to sleep with the window ajar and hear the soothing sounds of the courtyard fountain late into the night very restful especially considering we were next to Gare Montparnasse Within walking distance of great restaurants and all that is wonderful about Paris 
180130,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, at the end of the stay you have to pay taxes on top of the price you payed on booking com its never mentioned not on the website not on booking com not when you check in only when you checkout be careful And don t order a taxi from the concierge Price is about 15 20 higher rated then normal ones, perfect breakfast nice room quiet
180131,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, twice spoken to staff to replace the coffee with tea kettle as my wife is alleregic to cofee they promised but nothing delivered, Tea making facilities not in the room only coffee maker
180132,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I didn t like the unfriendly staff that do not offer help to any of obstacles you face during your stay I couldn t even get room service to mix banana and milk for my baby I m hugely disappointed, None
180133,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Unfriendly staff member and indifference in assisting us Would not recommend , Not much Unfortunately the staff member who booked us in had little interest in assisting not even a smile 
180134,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Horrible breakfast Scrambled eggs not cooked Coffee cold waited in queue five min then told room full took us another room downstairs After that never went back Had breakfast across the street and 1 2 the price and great food 
180135,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Some staff were a bit abrupt when we had a query The first room we were allocated was exceptionally warm and we requested and were given another room We were upgraded which was nice too I guess it was just the attitude of some of the people they were not welcoming a all it put us off , The breakfast selection was large Eggs extra creamy if you like them that way The bar on the side does quite a nice selection for dinner huge proportions 
180136,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Complete chaos at the reception I was given an occupied room twice and got stuck in the elevator in the meantime Light switches were very dirty and the room was small and noisy My colleague had the exact same experience Not worth the price , Good location 
180137,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, One of the Left where I need to insert my room card to select my floor isn t working , Staff are very friendly and helpful I like the smoking garden area 
180138,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room was too small stuffy and dark Furnitures were old and dark painted There was a door opening to the next room and all the noise was coming through the door There was no refrigerator in the room There were only two plug sockets and located in very useless spots It was a complete disappointment for its cost ,No Positive
180139,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, This place is only missing a pool to be a five star hotel, Hotel staff very welcoming for the whole stay great location to all attractions and food in the resturant was amazing 
180140,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There was nothing to dislike about the hotel or location , Lovely clean hotel in a wonderful location Went for our anniversary and would highly recommend it Would definitely go again 
180141,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, It was freezing cold Temp in my room was 18degrees which I could see on the aircon panel It was impossible to heat up the room After hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was 19 5 degrees This is unacceptable I complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room My colleagues had another room and it was the same I also got mail that I can t get breakfast and can pay 10eur for cereal and order it to my room What a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast I definitely do not recommend to anyone , Nothing special as for the high price 
180142,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Antipathetic stuff of the reception Cold figures with any desire to respond to our needs just asking for 2 more shampoo tubes , Great view to Eiffel Tower Perfect location Very close to Montparnasse Train Station 
180143,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, very compact rooms and in break fast omlete will charge you extra , Very near to Metro stations Gare Geite Montpernase cost per person 1 90 u can change any line as well as Airport shuttle bus service walkable distance will cost per person 17 from to CDG Airport and Orly Airport If you hire taxi will cost you 55 one way and Receiption Staff are very helpful and room service supervisor check the quality of cleaning daily with the guest 
180144,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Saturday was the very busiest day for breakfast not enough staff on duty meant long ques , Very good location and wonderful service from everyone on the front desk Breakfast must be the best in Paris
180145,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The lifts were a bit unpredictable and we had to keep getting our electronic key card re authorised at the desk, Beds were really comfy Room was large and just the right temperature
180146,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The staff I told the front desk it was my birthday which it was and no complimentary treats cake wine voucher for a dinner night or thank you s to me for choosing this place Then someone or housekeeping sole my diamond ring The front desk manager was less than helpful in resolving the situation and had no sense of urgency Oh did I mention that their security door equipment didn t work to modify who goes in and out of the room The interior of the room is soooooo out dated for what they charge per night The layout of the room didn t make sense either There s no outlets by the bed You have to lay at the foot of the bed to use the desk outlet or the T V s usb The view I had was horrible This hotel was the worse experience I d ever had in all my years of traveling I do not recommend you waste your time here nor spend your money for their terrible service Find another hotel You will be better off , It was a good location and I enjoyed their shower gel and bath salt 
180147,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Very nice hotel with comfortable rooms great breakfast and super professional staff a special thank you to Celestin in Front Desk he was vey welcoming and helpful sure we will come back again 
180148,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Carpets are quite old made me sneeze all the time, Great location It s very near the Metro Eifel Tower is less than 3km away very walkable you ll enjoy every step 
180149,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Temp in the Hotel warm but room had set temp so couldn t change it , Food excellent staff very friendly and helpful Room was large and bed comfy Had presser in room that was great for suits 
180150,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Had to wait in a queue for breakfast one morning In the bar they had no dry white wine apart from Chardonny, Plenty choice at breakfast Lovely view of Eiffel Tower from bedroom Hotel central for getting around Paris
180151,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, When I checke out the lady told me that I used the minibar twice But sure I didn t THen she said that I ordered at the restaurant 3 drinks and I have to pay and also I didn t so she asked me to sign on a paper to justify my signature then after she said will see Sure the result was I was right but I didn t like that , The hotel near the railway station very comfort and cleanliness Prices are affordable 
180152,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, putting a mini refrigerator in the room will give added points providing complimentary drinking water would improve the image does anyone don t brush their teeth everyday I think this is the least thing every guest would expect not to see in a hotel bathroom , the breakfast has a few good choices but complete in every range the hotel location is what i most appreciated about this hotel 
180153,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There s no fridge in the room Incredible for a hotel of that standard and price The so called minibar is actually a vending machine and prices are not even indicated Other negative point when leaving the reception offered to call a taxi without telling me that this would cost me an additional 4 EUR at the end of the ride If I had known I d just walked down the street , Nice stylish rooms and very comfy beds Kind and helpful reception staff Coffee and tea making facilities are provided I had requested a specific room and got one quite close to the one I wanted which I appreciated a lot 
180154,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Lacked character huge and not very Parisian Unfortunately despite very professional front desk being one branch of an homogeneous multi national hotel chain meant that we could have been anywhere , Very comfy bedding though would have been good to have top sheet Really good coffee machine 
180155,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, all the other things could have been better the most remarkable things was that the hotel staff is absolutely incompetent and made my check out a nightmare i would highly appreciate if immediate actions would be taken against the reception staff that worked on the 03 10 16 and a woman named Helena most of all , the location is great
180156,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, As always in Paris the price should have been lower , A pleasant if compact room in a good central location The fixtures and fittings seemed to be of a high quality 
180157,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, Location is good very close to tour eiffel and lot of other attractions right next to a metro train station and a bus to CDG I would stay again 
180158,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Receptionist with an unpleasent attitude And a non smoking room that smelled like it had been smoked in , Great breakfast Good location for travellers arriving or departing from Montparnas train station
180159,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Nothing , The location to Montparnasse Station was important and you don t get much closer The staff were great and you can walk to many tourist spots even in an afternoon 
180160,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The name of the hotel has changed and the name on the hotel is different from the name on our confirmation We should have been made aware of that before traveling We spent some time wandering around trying to find a hotel that matched the name on our confirmation ,No Positive
180161,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, I booked this hotel thinking it is the Lafayete Concorde Hotel which was way better than this one It should be 2 or 3 stars hotel only But not 4 stars hotel by any means No free water upon arrival Breakfast is less quantity quality than other 4 stars hotels , Location is close to Eiffel tower 
180162,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Location not fantastic but it was ok Was disappointed with service in the room Fridge terrible linen on bed a bit average and one morning we had to share a towel as the lady only replaced one towel in our room Even though we had used two the day prior , Nice place clean and modern Felt right at home when I walked in the room Staff good and breakfast quite good 
180163,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The Hotel Bar closes at 11 Not a major issue but could have been nice to chill for a bit longer There appears to be a waiting list 2 days worth for an iron and an ironing board , Staff were extremely friendly In addition staff were multilingual just a great bonus really Location was perfect as soon as you leave the hotel turn right and walk for 5 seconds around the hotel and you will be starring at the Eiffel Tower 30 40 minutes of picturesque walk towards it The Metro line was next door as well line number 4 which takes you to the sightseeings you require Les Halles is a very good shopping centre for some non expensive extras you may need which is also a 3 minute walk from the Louvre Back to the Hotel now rooms were nice and clean and staff are very keen on keeping them this way as during one of the days we had 5 visits from the cleaning staff this is a positive comment by the way Do put up a sign if you don t wanna be disturbed One other thing for those who like beer but might find the taste a bit offputting with each consumption do ask for order beer with grenadine you will not regret it either in hotel or any other place in Paris Overall experience was pleasant and enjoyable 
180164,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The organization of reception is not good It makes you wait to leave or to arrive In addition the lack of wait line organization creates tension and makes room for misunderstandings between guests of many nationalities I want to make clear that this is not a criticism of the staff who are quite good but of the organization management , The location 
180165,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The breakfast menu did not change over the course of a week and became very monotonous after 3 days , Mateo the front desk clerk was extremely helpfull and effiecient in dealing with our complaints and needs 
180166,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, I stayed here with my mum for a night as I was switching apartments The room was very clean the beds comfortable and the staff incredibly polite and helpful The hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood although a bit more modern not the classic Hausmann architecture if you care about that sort of thing well connected to some of the major tourist attraction by metro or just a walk It s great for its proximity to the Montparnasse tower where you can get a great view of Paris Eiffel tower included Overall we really enjoyed our stay We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet so if you can select a deal that has it included might not be a bad idea Bonus point s You get a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower just around the corner of the hotel And in front if you are a looking for a nice typical Parisian bistro dinner the Cafe Ernest is a good choice at a fairly reasonable price 
180167,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Receptionist very patronizing Such a shame after such a great impression from the night staff, After being stuck on a train for 12 hours the night staff room service team were superb
180168,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Rooms very dingy and old fashioned Breakfast average Staff miserable Very unhelpful in reception and don t know the basics of the area Would not stay again as in modern day hotels it is not up to general standards Beds hard as rocks, Location
180169,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Size of room but Paris is known for small rooms Position of safe is not practicable I didn t take some food breakfast in the Hotel so I cannot evaluate , We got a special offer and upgraded to a superior room View to Tour Eiffel Nice Room small but okay Beds very comfortable Location very well Direct busses from Airport starts ends in front of the house A lot of restaurants bars in 10min walking distance 
180170,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Not enough staff spoke English , Easy access for the willing traveller to public transport so prices from surrounding area cheaper than those closer to attractions 
180171,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, One guy at front desk was not helpful We were told that we booked twin room and not a double room and the option is to upgrade by paying 50 extra 10 minutes later the other person at reception said a double room is available as well as the upgrade option Transparency regarding the rates for upgrade was missing Upgraded room only has a better view and not much else The furniture etc in upgraded room is same and fittings were improper Minibar bottle container once opened cannot be closed and you have to buy drinks if you accidently push open the lid I think they give upgrade options to every guest just to make extra bucks Disappointed , Nice lobby good location 
180172,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Room is very very small not even room to walk around Room is in bad shape You can not pay with Maestro I did need to go to the bank to get cash money Much better hotels in Paris than this one , Flat screen TV
180173,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, I drove to France to settle my daughter into University there Hotel was perfect Staff lovely room comfy esp in hot weather and car parking convenient No one minded my poor command of French everyone spoke good English 
180174,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room was very quiet once you turned off the air conditioning with good doubleglazing even though it looked over the Place Catalogne Except for the minibar which could not be turned off it appeared to be linked directly to some central system for recording what had been taken out of the fridge However the helpful staff at reception organised for it to be turned off even though this was not a normal request full marks to them Once it was turned off the room was very quiet Hotels seem to think that quiet room means no external noise but appear to ignore internal noises such as air con and minibars the noise from which can be just as intrusive , Great location for Gare Montparnasse 5 minutes walk away Very good fish restaurant nearby Very quiet room once the minibar had been turned off see my other comments Helpful staff Good choice of food for breakfast 
180175,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The coffee machine needed a degree in coffee making to work it out , Superb room we were upgraded from a classic to a classic deluxe on arrival at no extra charge Superb soundproofing we overlooked a very busy roundabout and heard nothing Clean tidy well staffed
180176,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, A bit noisy old fashion At almost 20 the breakfast is definitely not a good deal , Convenient if one arrives departs from the Montparnasse station
180177,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Having breakfast at 0730 on a Sunday morning with what appeared to be 3 coach loads of extremely loud and annoying people If this sort of arrangement is in place then reserve the breakfast room accordingly for a specific time so that normal guests can enjoy a relaxing peaceful breakfast Only one receptionist on duty when I arrived and had to wait 15 minutes to check in whilst she dealt with a man who had a big problem Get the reception area properly staffed Having paid for the hotel by credit card then having to pay an extra 5 for taxes Why can t this be taken at the time of payment , Convenient for Montparnasse station
180178,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Price the windows could not be opened the mini bar has some drawers in order to use it only with the drinks of the hotel , The staff the cleanliness position 
180179,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Hot and humid outside set room a c to 19C but it struggled to maintain temp at 22C Initially promised 2 adjacent rooms but it did not happen at check in , Breakfast was good multiple selections but the same every day Staff was friendly and tried to accommodate Close to major station for public transportation 
180180,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, They have 2 restorants one is from 8 00 to 12 30 The second is from 7 30 to 10 00 something like this One day we wake up 10 00 and we was want to eat in this first restorant And they say no Like this we was one day withiut breakfast The reception women was really good She say i will bring breakfast in the room But this is not good when they say for you you can go and after you can not , All most everything was good 
180181,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, No fridge in the room The minibar is actually a vending machine with direct billing but no prices mentioned Whereas food and drink in the hotel is expensive and of poor quality , Very comfy beds nice looking rooms classy dark wooden furniture and white walls sufficient space very friendly and helpful reception staff 
180182,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, The room smells weird and all the electricity switches are sticky I think the carpet has never been cleaned , The staff is really friendly and very good selection of breakfast 
180183,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Only one power point near the door to recharge my phone If I want to connect my personal computer I need to stay near the door Really crazy , The hotel is very close to the bus stop to the airport
180184,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, There is no business centre therefore no access to a printer Also despite our request for a view room on a higher floor we were placed on the first floor overlooking the central courtyard The fridge cannot be used to store personal beverages , We stayed for 6 nights and were generally pleased with the overall experience The bed was comfortable the toiletries were top notch and there is ample storage for one s clothing footwear Also appreciated the kettle and daily teabags Our room was VERY quiet consequently we slept well The buffet breakfast both hot and cold selections was excellent and well worth the additional daily expense Lastly the metro and train station are close by which was very handy for accessing all of the sights 
180185,H tel Concorde Montparnasse, Everything was good, Good facilities Meal was nice too And extraordinary kind staffs If you need something just ask Then they ll kindly help you 
180186,H tel Concorde Montparnasse,No Negative, The location was excellent for access to the Gare Montparnasse train station and the Le Bus Direct buses to CDG airport Breakfast buffet was excellent Were able to check in very early
