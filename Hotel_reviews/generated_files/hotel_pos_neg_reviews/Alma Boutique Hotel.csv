336647,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, I could check in a couple of hours earlier after an exhausting flight So what did I get a large sunny room and a jacuzzi in the middle of it You take a bath you have a nap you enjoy the city from the terrace on the roof and then go for a walk across Vienna which is magnificent Special thanks to Luca guy at the reception The next day I had breakfast which was quite alright although coffee is not just fine as in Italy you get fresh milk fruit cocktail that I ve never met before Highly recommended 
336648,Alma Boutique Hotel, Bread and croissants were old Coffee is mediocre Breakfast is not worth the money Douche needs repairs , Room was nice and spacious Staff is friendly 
336649,Alma Boutique Hotel, Nothing Will stay here again if I am fortunate enough to have money to travel to Vienna , This is a great location close to metro Stephen s Platz and all major attractions of Vienna Loved the nearby restaurants which the reception desk refers you to The front desk attendants are wonderful especially Luca and Alexandra Loved loved the breakfast And it had A C 
336650,Alma Boutique Hotel, I find the price a bit too high The room could use a big mirror and a trash bin in the bathroom The toilet paper supports were mounted wrong the reserve one that should be vertical and needs no stopper was mounted instead of the current one horizontally and the lack of a stopper made the toilet paper fall each time I tried to use it the current support that should be horizontal and had a stopper was mounted vertically instead of the reserve one so the stopper was useless anyway The cap of the shower switch was missing which confused me about its usage Considering the high price one would expect a flawless room but all big pluses compensated the minuses for me and I will be back for sure next time , The location is excellent very close to Schwedenplaz subway and airport bus station The staff was fabulous very helpful and polite I felt welcome and all my requests were dealt with professionally The wi fi was also very very good The room though small was very very optimal and functional had all that it needed and a very big bathroom almost the same size as the room itself 
336651,Alma Boutique Hotel, No easy chair in the room The only place to relax was the bed No easy chairs below as well Only two AC sockets One is one foot from the entry door opening I had to unplug my laptop to go in and out , Great location Right on Schwedenplatz trams and underground Very good breakfast 
336652,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great location Price is very good for this area of Vienna walking distance to all major attractions Room for two was comfortable and well equipped 
336653,Alma Boutique Hotel, Not much All in all no regrets Lack of non news English TV channels Bathroom color effect on mirror Otherwise didn t mind the color Would have preferred tiles to the painted walls not a deal breaker just wonder at tediousness of maintenance No view from MY room However because places are so accessible in this beautiful city I was rarely in the room when I was not sleeping Compare with your purpose of travel , In no particular order factors that make the Alma boutique hotel a good choice for a Vienna stay Location is Great really Accessibility to places of interest i e can walk to Opera House passing through shopping high street and some attractions Buy tickets for sightseeing bus at hotel reception and there s a stop close to the hotel to hop on or walk to the Marriott for another stop on the red line Boat cruise start point is also close by Easy access to places to eat Would seem expensive esp for late bookings like mine however value for money with breakfast included is derived from the location factor among other things e g eliminate most commute costs Excellent wifi Good breakfast Staff are welcoming and helpful Alexandra and the gentlemen suggesting things to do sightseeing providing directions to places etc Welcome gift pack very nice personal touch Room single not too big but just right for me Solo traveler Comfy bed with accessible charging points for my devices Liked the Bedside light 
336654,Alma Boutique Hotel, We would prefer the option of tea coffee making facilities in the room but there was a free coffee machine in the breakfast area until 9pm each day , Spacious room very clean Comfy bed Staff friendly and helpful Great location 
336655,Alma Boutique Hotel, My bed had no headboard and wasn t against a wall so I couldn t really read or watch TV in bed Also the shower was not enclosed in a room of its own and was close to the window even though I had the curtains closed people could still have seen me in the shower I ended up putting a bag against the wall and the curtain so nobody could see in , It was clean and cosy They offered free tea and coffee until 9pm in the breakfast room 
336656,Alma Boutique Hotel, The breakfast was not very good a bit monotonous The single room was a bit too small and in general uncomfortable In my humble opinion I do not understand why the hotel has 4 stars I have been in others with less stars and were much more comfortable bigger and nicer It s nice for short stays , Good WiFi connection too clean they were changing the towels every day even if I was not throwing them to the floor It s very close to the main attractions and walking distance to the metro 
336657,Alma Boutique Hotel, Decor a little tired The hairdryer was hopeless and cut out repeatedly , The small bag of Occitane toiletries was great Breakfast excellent great choice of hot and cold food The location just off Schwedensplatz in a quiet street was fabulous The view from the small roof terrace over the old town was lovely 
336658,Alma Boutique Hotel, Nothing , Very friendly staff Excellent service Comfortable room Very quiet yet central location near subway as well as city centre Good breakfast Rather small hotel with a homely atmosphere which I can only recommend
336659,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The position of the hotel was perfect for walking to key sights and also right by an underground on Line 1 and 4 so easy to get to Schonbrunn Palace and the Belvedere Quiet comfortable room and excellent helpful staff especially Luka on reception nothing was too much trouble 
336660,Alma Boutique Hotel, Only one key for the room , Fantastic location right near Scwedensplatz underground station in a quiet old town street Accommodation not luxurious but comfortable and really good buffet breakfast Very good value for money 
336661,Alma Boutique Hotel, Outside temperature was very low and the bedroom could have been a bit warmer but I did not request any temperature change , Great location with a Spanish restaurant a few steps away Stylish simple rooms that had everything you need Excellent breakfast choices Free evening refreshments Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful Good room rate for a late January visit 
336662,Alma Boutique Hotel, The rooms can be more cozy and a little more renewed Really expected more It s clean and everything but a little out of date , The location is just incredible 2 min around the corner is metro station everything is so close that you don t even need public transportation That s the best location you can have with all bars and restaurants just in 5 min walk I absolutely loved it Staff is extremely helpful special thanks to Luca he always did his best to us Hotel should keep him 
336663,Alma Boutique Hotel, The towels were small and mean Single rooms offer very little no where to put clothes no desk poor design The air conditioning did not respond when I tried to affect the temperature , The staff were great Friendly and willing to help The beds were comfortable and the shower fabulous The rooms are also pretty spacious and clean Overall I liked this hotel and would go back 
336664,Alma Boutique Hotel, The bedroom was not warm enough and no amount of adjustment to the heating controls improved it The door key took some getting used to , Breakfast lift location 
336665,Alma Boutique Hotel, Toilet and bathroon separate need to go to next room to wash hands no HD on the TV, Great location quiet rooms excellent Wi Fi signal not as common as it should be 
336666,Alma Boutique Hotel, The wifi was out for most of our 3 nights in the hotel which drove us crazy You could feel the gap between the single beds pushed together as a double , Great range of breakfast food Staff very helpful 
336667,Alma Boutique Hotel, There was no bar in hotel we expected one as it is 4 star Bathroom tiny no place for make up etc Lighting dreadful both in bedroom and bathroom , Staff very pleasant and helpful Location very good Breakfast good Tea and coffee available until late evening included in price 
336668,Alma Boutique Hotel, Stain on the carpet Picky I know my husband didn t even notice but bad form for 4 star, Picked for location and did not disappoint Walked to everything Great restaurants nearby as well Super friendly and helpful staff Really appreciated the access to 24 hour coffee 
336669,Alma Boutique Hotel, I cant really say anything can be classified as negative but we would have preferred if the bed wasn t two different single ones sticked together , We loved the free capuchino and tea provided also the staff was really helpful and made are staying very easy Moreover the wifi was great and the breakfast even though it wasn t big everything was fresh and with an amazing fruit smothie Lastly the location was close to the city center and near san Stephan church 
336670,Alma Boutique Hotel, nothing , Excellent location quiet restful rooms excellent bed I love the LED lamp and also the various places next to the bed for putting books odds and ends etc well designed hot water machine for tea 
336671,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, There is a small but wonderful roof terrace with a view of Vienna s 14th century rooftops Generous breakfast Were able to safely store our bikes and the hotel is close to the Donau Cycle Path Smart decor 
336672,Alma Boutique Hotel, The shower and toilet areas are separated which was fine with us but it was I ll be nicer if there is a good ventilation system so we feel more comfortable after shower of even bathroom business , We love the breakfast and especially appreciated the staffs at the front desk They were really to help and answer all my questions They also offered extra a information and printed them out for us We appreciated their hospitality Please keep up the good works 
336673,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is at great location to the VIC and the old town so that after working you could still have some time for shopping and sightseeing The staff were friendly and respond to requests effectively and positively The breakfast is also good and you could get hot water and free coffee and tea until 9 pm The only complain is that the bed is kind of narrow Would stay here again if next UN meeting calls me to Vienna 
336674,Alma Boutique Hotel, Nitpicking I know but the pillows could have been firmer , Outstanding position in Central Vienna all major attractions walkable Staff cheerful and extremely helpful Breakfasts as good as we have had on any European city break Great selection of free tea or coffee available to guests from 11 00 to 21 00 wonderful after a day out walking in this fabulous city 
336675,Alma Boutique Hotel, The hot food at breakfast needed to be hotter , This hotel was in a very good location staff were very friendly and helpful The bedroom was spacious and had every thing you need the bed was very comfortable The free tea and coffee was an extra bonus I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends 
336676,Alma Boutique Hotel, Curtains for privacy left gaps so that the shower could be seen from the building across the street Needed to change booking two months notice due to circumstances beyond control and they would not get back to me were inflexible so had to pay for a night that I did not use , small city hotel room suitable for short stay purposes 
336677,Alma Boutique Hotel, I walked past it the first time but once you know where it is easy to get around from very close to the station so an easy walk even with luggage , Breakfast was good rooms were decent price was awesome for location Would definitely recommend 
336678,Alma Boutique Hotel, The room is a little bit small , We had a wonderful stay at Alma hotel The room was very comfortable the breakfast was just perfect with good quality ingredients and a very efficient woman helping the breakfast customers They made our stay unforgettable 
336679,Alma Boutique Hotel, The wifi didn t work in the dining room as a business traveler I would have appreciated having breakfast available before 7AM , Nice large rooms quiet cute roof top patio wifi that actually works well in rooms 
336680,Alma Boutique Hotel, A little overpriced for a simple hotel that it is but I guess that s central Vienna for you , Great central location good breakfast nice staff excellent wifi and efficient air conditioning No luxury but all the basics are there plus the hotel is well located downtown Would definitely recommend it for a short city break 
336681,Alma Boutique Hotel, There seemed to be a lot of different people covering Reception They were all friendly though Other than the breakfast room and the v small roof terrace there was nowhere communal to sit or have a drink but then it is a v small hotel , The location was brilliant the cleaning team were excellent and the breakfast staff friendly 
336682,Alma Boutique Hotel, Body lotion would have been good Travellers with hand luggage have liquids constraints , Breakfast really good Free coffee during the day Friendly staff 
336683,Alma Boutique Hotel, nothing, Easy to check in get in out Comfortable smart and large room Satisfying breakfast free coffee for guests all day Great location Kind staff 
336684,Alma Boutique Hotel, Our two sticking points The pillows were horrible and the breakfast was just ok but with the WORST coffee we have ever had , Wonderful Boutique hotel in an EXCELLENT location We couldn t have picked a better spot if we tried This hotel is in the 1st district and was only a 2min walk from the metro station The hotel it self is lovely very clean and welcoming Pretty much everything a boutique hotel should be The internet was SUPER fast which is not always the case here in Europe when traveling To get to the main city centre on foot was about a 5 10min depending on your speed 
336685,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff wonderful room with a view of the oldest part of Vienna A busy area but 100 quiet in the room facing the old town Close to the airport bus 
336686,Alma Boutique Hotel, Pillows were too small I am used to Japanese style of cleaning oneself after using the toilet so not even a tap sink beside the toilet existed This was too bad Tap sink are with shower in different partition The bathroom has no real door It is just a glass partition and a curtain separating this area from the bedroom With my little toddler moving in the room all the time it was not funny when she sees me taking a shower , The staff in general are welcoming and helpful Location is great beside underground taxi station and cruise ferry 
336687,Alma Boutique Hotel, Minor complaint little bit strange separation of bathroom and toilet in the room , Excellent location 5 min from city center by foot Superb breakfast and polite and helpful stuff 
336688,Alma Boutique Hotel, The single room was indeed one person sized but since I basically only slept there I was willing to make the trade for the positives , Location location location And friendly staff And a good selection at breakfast 
336689,Alma Boutique Hotel, Sometimes the Wi Fi became slow or disconnected , Most of all staff are very friendly anytime Many choice of foods at breakfast buffet is good for long stay Close to U1 U4 station SPAR and many restaurants 
336690,Alma Boutique Hotel, Everything was very good Breakfast could be improved a little there was a bit of noise coming from neighbouring rooms in the morning running water , excellent service the bloke on reception was very proactive in highlighting good restaurants and how to get there room was very comfortable with modern fit out 
336691,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent although it was close to the metro and a busy street the hotel itself was in a quiet pedestrian only alley St Stephen s Cathedral was about three minutes walk away The staff were very friendly and helpful recommending a restaurant and then phoning ahead to ensure I got a seat as it was a Saturday night The hotel was well designed the decor was lovely and it was extremely clean The breakfast was delicious 
336692,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The staff is amazing They really do everything to satisfy their guests I arrived late night and got a list of great restaurants in the area that I can go and eat at that time I was offered a coffee while waiting for the payment and much more The breakfast was delicious all what you need in a cosy room Thank you very much 
336693,Alma Boutique Hotel, When I arrived the elevator was out of order and I had to carry my luggage to the 5th floor The only comment from the girl on the reception was I hope it s not too heavy , Position breakfast
336694,Alma Boutique Hotel, for me nothing could have been better , Location is perfect and everything from friendly staff to buffet breakfast to comfortable bed and good wifi when needed was first rate 
336695,Alma Boutique Hotel, The pillows were awful The variety of satellite T V Programs was sparse , The hotel was well located The breakfast had a good variety of food Luka one of the hotel receptionist was very helpful in arranging tours and providing tips on places to go and activities to do 
336696,Alma Boutique Hotel, breakfast limited but i have always problem since I dont eat meat or dairy Would love if hotels include more things for people with alergies or generaly more healthy choices but it is for hotels in general not specificly this hotel My room was a bit dark because it was facing inside of the building but it was single room so i know they had to use that space for a room , great location 3 minutes walk from the city center cosy room with desent bathroom fridge safe 
336697,Alma Boutique Hotel,No Negative, You could never expect such level of comfort and coziness from such a hectic 40 secs to Schewedenplatz location Staff is super friendly and helpful

336701,Alma Boutique Hotel, There was no kettle in the room although free tea coffee making facilities in the breakfast area available all day and instead of a double bed it was two singles pushed together with two single duvets , Perfect location and much cheaper when compared to other more luxurious central hotels

336706,Alma Boutique Hotel, The bathroom situation was a bit odd The toilet was separate from the bathroom which isn t completely odd and although the toilet had a door the bathroom did not have a door but a curtain which was ok for us once we got used to it but it might be odd for others , When we first arrived at this hotel I didn t know what to make of it but the longer we were there the more it grew on me The location was excellent just round the back of Schwedenplatz about 5 mins walk to the centre of Vienna but it was also really quiet The bed was very comfy and had perfect soft feather pillows The staff were extrememly helpful they booked a concert for us and gave us lots of information they would get 10 10 in my book Although the breafast bar was not very big which concerned us when we saw it the night before there was lots of choice and it was all really fresh Also there were no tea and coffee making facilities in our room which was quite surprising but free tea and coffee was available from the breakfast room all day which made up for it 
336707,Alma Boutique Hotel, Nothing, The staff is very nice polite and helpfull Hotel is in a centar of town but in a quite location Rooms are not very spacious and the furniture is nothing special for a 4 star hotel but rooms are very well equipped big screen tv safe fridge table with twoo chairs in bathroom everything you need Pillows are very comfortable and air condition is quiet an effectiv Very good breakfast I will definitely come again
