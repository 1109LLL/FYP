217108,New Linden Hotel, Room could do with a fix up as the wood work on window was Old and flaking no enough plugs in the room, Was good value for money room good been a little bigger
217109,New Linden Hotel, No refrigerator in room but this was accomodated very well Phenominal experience , Staff were extremely accomodating Emails were answered promptly prior to arrival staff arranged airport transport for us allowed us to checkin early and checkout late provided a refrigerator in the staff room where we could store milk for baby gave us food when we showed up late for breakfast and they were cleaning up The hotel was extremely clean the shower worked well as a bathtub for a toddler just plug the drain with a towel crib was provided as soon as we arrived unlike many places where you have to wait a day or continue to bug they helped us in and out of the entrance daily with the stroller and let us keep it in the lobby hallways and doorways are narrow compared to North American standard 36 openings Area was great we walked through Hyde Park into London there s lots of great restaurants nearby as well as a laundromat pubs etc all with great service 
217110,New Linden Hotel, The continental breakfast is pretty good but an expresso machine would make it even better, Great location near wonderful shops and restaurants Clean comfortable and extremely welcoming
217111,New Linden Hotel, Room seemed to be much smaller comparing to the pictures with a distinctive smell some of front of house staff were a bit rude , Brilliant staff at the breakfast bar great location
217112,New Linden Hotel, The 4 stars do fool you this is a good 3 star hotel but nothing more Simple accommodations with an ok breakfast in a great location The staff is friendly and helpful , Great location lovely neighborhood very close to the underground Breakfast included which is rather rare for London 
217113,New Linden Hotel, Tiny rooms unfortunately with no AC like most of london hotel rooms, Clean very well located attentive staff and very reactive wonderful location within walking distance from buses and underground and good value for money
217114,New Linden Hotel, The room bed were awfully small No air conditioner or refrigerator The breakfast was very poor , Just the location The Staff was quite friendly and helpful too but every other aspect was awful 
217115,New Linden Hotel, Room was really small but I was expecting that because of the rewiews It did nt bother us Also the room was a bit hot because there was no AC but the fan helped and we kept the window open when we were in so it was ok Mornings were a bit noisy as we could hear everything from the streets because of the open window So no sleeping in , Staff was very friendly and location was exellent Nice wiew from our room Also the phone you could take with you when you left the room was very nice suprise We used it as a guide 
217116,New Linden Hotel, Very small rooms if you can call them that No bar fridge or air conditioning just a fan No hand rails in bathroom Not what the pictures showed, Location was ok
217117,New Linden Hotel, The room was quite small but very comfortable , The location was quiet and there is a lovely pub on the corner that has great food The staff were so helpful and friendly 
217118,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was quite small There was a third bed in the room which was quite unnecessary and made it very cramped Our double bed was pushed up against the wall in one side which was also difficult The bathroom was okay but there was no bath mat or shower curtain so the floor got quite wet and was very slippery Continental Breakfast was good The hotel is in a quiet street so we could have the window open and sleep 
217119,New Linden Hotel, The first room we were put in was in the basement it was awful so they put us on floor 4 the room was so small a double bed was squeezed in there and the bathroom was tiny It was not clean the bed base had dirty marks on it and the room was so hot there was a fan but it was very noisy so you could not have it on at night We had a lovely view of the Grenfell Tower The breakfast was just awful and the staff serving were lazy and gossiping with their friends there was rubbish on the floor the whole time we were sat there and they just walked over it I paid cash on arrival and when I checked out the next morning they said I hadn t paid The manager came out and informed them that I had paid and showed him the cash in the draw Do not stay here its awful , Nothing
217120,New Linden Hotel, I would never have booked this hotel if I had known they were going to give me a room sad excuse for a room in the basement next to the breakfast area lots of noise Luckily I got another room for the second and third night The hotel was very noisy at all times as if the staff just did not want you to sleep because they wanted to start cleaning the rooms Poor quality rooms falling apart Expensive for what it was Not coming back ,No Positive
217121,New Linden Hotel, The room itself was small but equipped however with the warm weather the room was very hot at night even with the small fan provided the hotel is listed as 4 star but needs a refurbishment throughout to warrant that rating I think 2 star would be more realistic , The staff were happy to help the breakfast had an excellent choice of products and for London the value was good and location was spot on for the tube and getting around 
217122,New Linden Hotel, No air con but good fan, Quiet location yet very close to Hyde Park Very clean and smart looking without being minimalist Attractive wood decor in places Very good continental breakfast 
217123,New Linden Hotel, Although the room was clean and functional it was very small and with no air conditioning in the heat of the summer it was stifling to the point of being uncomfortable and difficult to sleep which is not what you want when you are out all day sightseeing etc It is a shame because the staff the location and the cleanliness of the place were all brilliant I would recommend the hotel because of all the positive attributes but on the proviso that a good sized room was requested , The staff were brilliant very helpful polite and friendly very keen to please with whatever help you were seeking The breakfasts were good with plenty of choice and everywhere was very clean The location was also good close to restaurants and the tube but quiet with very little street or traffic noisemail 
217124,New Linden Hotel, There was no AC in the room so it was hot even though there was a fan It was a bit awkward to open the window as it opened out into the courtyard sitting area The shuttle booked by the hotel was 3 hours late in picking us up from the airport The hotel was good with following up with this but I will not recommend the shuttle service I would recommend getting the Gatwick express from the airport to Victoria station and a taxi to the hotel about 15 or the tube to Bayswater then a short walk to the hotel , Breakfast was prepared well and tasty The room was clean and comfortable The staff was also quite helpful and pleasant at all times 
217125,New Linden Hotel, two single beds on castors on a wooden floor was like an ice skating rink no air conditioning never a 4 star hotel facilities very poor and breakfast was limited basic would be an understatement, very little
217126,New Linden Hotel, The hot breakfast was dismal Staff need to be trained to make an English breakfast For the money we paid we would expect one The wood floors squeaked really badly Need mats on the floor , Friendly staff great location between Bayswater and Notting Hill Our room was so QUIET great nights sleep Comfy beds luxury bathroom Great towels and linen 
217127,New Linden Hotel, Bathroom no plug in sink The back of the plug for the electric fan fell off and gave my daughter an electric shock No hooks in bathroom or on back of door to hang towels , Breakfast was excellent and the staff accommodated us with an early start Rooms comfortable but small 
217128,New Linden Hotel, Bed rock hard and tilted, Very odd set up really nice garden patio area but no where to buy a drink and had to take a coffee down two floors in a lift to get to the area
217129,New Linden Hotel, The room was very hot The bed was uncomfortable and the kettle could do with a descale which was disappointing Also room very tiny but adequate not worth paying any more though , Surprised to have the patio area from the large window Breakfast very good when asked to have a couple of glasses and an ice bucket this was no problem and arrived within minutes Excellent service
217130,New Linden Hotel, Very nice room but room 305 really should have been a single room The double bed was pushed against the wall and there was hardly any room for 2 people to move sitting on bed was only option Window opened but would not stay up and as hot evening had to put room cushions to stop it closing Shower head is very high up in the shower and for anyone around 5ft high little bit difficult if you did not want to get your hair wet Lovely breakfast and good choice nice strong coffee but spoilt a bit by staff member just stood at door chewing gum and did not welcome us into breakfast room with a good morning Other guests were standing later as no tables left but staff did not seem to care and just said you will have to wait to them no apologies or offer to try and rectify with extra chairs or offer lounge area upstairs to eat their breakfast in , Very clean rooms good location for Hyde Park Concert Good reception staff very polite and helpful Nice and quiet location good breakfast 
217131,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Excellent value for money Room was large and clean and the shower was excellent Breakfast was included too but we didnt have time to try it The area is very nice and its only 5 minutes was from the underground Lovely roof terrace at the back of the property 
217132,New Linden Hotel, The room we stopped in must surely be the smallest room we have ever encountered during our world wide travel The bed was pushed into the end of the L shaped room making it only accessible from one side Storage was pitiful only one very small single wardrobe and two people were unable to pass side by side in the only available space at the side of the bed The bathroom although very clean was so small you couldn t swing a bat in it and no shower screen The whole bathroom was awash every time the shower was used The towel rail was hung off the wall and the bathroom handle came off in my wife s hand so all in all with the high cost of the room we will never ever return , The staff were very polite and helpful and the cleanliness of the building was very good Lovely breakfast although the breakfast room could get very crowded due to the small room size relative to the size of the hotel 
217133,New Linden Hotel, There s nothing I would complain about but if you were being picky the breakfast room had trouble accommodating all guests couples were waiting for tables both mornings although usually not for long , We were a party of three and our son is a teenager family room accommodation was more than suitable for us The photo on website advertising a quadruple room showed all beds in line in one room so was very pleasantly surprised when we were greeted by a large lounge with two single beds at one end and a separate double bedroom all furnishings bespoke and stylish and good sized bathroom also bespoke All reception staff were friendly and helpful 
217134,New Linden Hotel, very squeaky floorboards couldnt get cold water tap to work in bath knob kept coming off Reported it but not repaired In fairness we were only there 1 night, bed linen and towels excellent tea coffee making facilites in room excellent receptionist
217135,New Linden Hotel, The shower had quite a high step into it and didn t feel that safe especially when getting out when wet there was no handle or anything to hold on to Also the waiting staff in the restaurant didn t even acknowledge us in the morning I had to ask where can we sit and do we help ourselves Never had that in any restaurant before Otherwise I would have given the hotel a better rating overall , Location great room was good beds very comfy Room was warm on arrival but fans were provided so that was good Reception staff very friendly and helpful 
217136,New Linden Hotel, couldnt really find anything to complain on if anything for a bit more money would have liked a bigger room but not moaning , the hotel is in a very nice area to access events such as wembley adele concert it was ideal for one night we did not have a lot of time to explore the rest but would return another time to do london staff are great reception very helpful 
217137,New Linden Hotel, I was very upset the fact that we couldn t get to sit down for breakfast the room was very full and we couldn t get to eat breakfast, The staff and hotel was very nice the staff was very helpful in giving us directions and the prices of the tubes ECT
217138,New Linden Hotel, Would have preferred hotel to have spent money on sound proofing than the phone type gizmo in room Minimal sleep due to dripping tap from upstairs very clear and loud snoring from next door as if no wall there at all generator from along the corridor and the slamming of doors early in the morning My basement room was cold and tiny no desk or space to work but well appointed Breakfast was functional Due to the noise I ll happily sacrifice some of the aesthetic touches for the opportunity of a better nights sleep , Great location and fitted in with price band of what was looking for 
217139,New Linden Hotel, Nothing to complain about , Warm welcome and helpful reception Room spotless beds comfy Breakfast excellent and well organised Well appointed and obviously recently refurbished Could not have hoped for better in an overnight stop in London particularly at the price asked 
217140,New Linden Hotel, We were assigned rooms in the basement with exterior windows but the hotel was lovely and changed room , The staff were very nice and very helpfull The Hotel is very clean The breakfast is complete and with quality 
217141,New Linden Hotel, Two much staff chatter and talking loud in non English during the night where staff were repremanded Downstairs is just a death trap with steep stairs and narrow steps fire doors continually proped open A hydraulic lift could be used instead of the stairs You had to be a mountain climber to get into the bath shower , Very quite area you could be mistaken to being in a park Breakfast was basic but good and clean area Our room was tight considering the large bed two singles together took up our bag room but ended up staying an extra two nights Lovely soft bed made up for the bad parts 
217142,New Linden Hotel, No air conditioner in the room with 30 degrees just a fan really small space Not acceptable we left the hotel after the first night paying for two nights , Nightmare
217143,New Linden Hotel, The rooms are rather small The breakfast while adequate is uninspiring and has never changed during the various times we have stayed at the hotel , Quiet hotel in a good location 
217144,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Everything was great The staff was really nice the breakfast was good and our room and hotel was really clean Yes as expected the room was a bit small but we went to explore London not just stay in our room so we were okay with that Good location with nearby stops for buses big bus tours restaurants and caf s Also if needed I recommend booking airport service with the hotel 
217145,New Linden Hotel, Nothing, The greeting was really positive and all staff were very helpfully Super location for restaurants Spoilt for choice WiFi the fastest I ve found in a hotel 70mps We ll be back 
217146,New Linden Hotel, The room it s bathroom There was NO decoration apart from mirror windows had NO lace curtains so restaurant kitchen staff across from us could see us The TV position unchangeable unclear picture from beds Shower had no screen so a lot of water on floor after using it Then all we could smell was the drains we had to sleep with window open Booking com needs to change the pictures description All rooms are oriental uniquely designed decorated Not in standard rooms For 125 BB not worth it This is 4 star boutique hotel we should have stayed in premier Inn This was meant to be a treat for me my best friend Our room was an embarrassment Secure luggage storage we were given the key to collect our bags ourselves from downstairs luggage room We made the most of it it was just a night stay so we didn t complain BUT I would not recommend their standard rooms to anyone Bed I Woke up to back pain , Very good location both bayswater Queensway tube stations close by lots of restaurants nearby Banana Tree Indochina restaurant hot spicy delicious unique loved it Staff were good friendly Nice big fluffy towels Oriental lounge was very nice 
217147,New Linden Hotel, I was 7 months pregnant and traveling alone because my husband s flight got canceled and they gave me an underground room which i had to pass through the breakfast area every time i had to reach my room and it had a very intense chlorine smell Not the best treatment , Location was great
217148,New Linden Hotel, The room was on the small side which I guess is standard for central London The bathroom was tiny we could barely get round the door to get to the toilet The miniature sink also proved challenging when trying to fill the kettle , Lovely hotel and the staff couldn t have been more helpful They helped us out with lots of queries and nothing was too much trouble The bed was really comfortable and the breakfast croissants were delicious Ideally located for the Albert Hall we strolled through the park about 20 min walk which was a lovely start to the evening 
217149,New Linden Hotel, Room was a bit squashed fine for me as I had single occupancy of a double room but it would have been very cramped for two As usual in an older building without air conditioning it was way to warm, Clean bright room with very comfortable bed 
217150,New Linden Hotel, I have stayed there 3 nights on the 1st night I have arrived at 21h as advised and I was given a room in the basement next to the housekeepers storage room and the luggage room the window was facing the hallway with the luggage room so we had to keep the blinds shut all the time the room itself it s really really small could barely squeeze to medium size luggages At 6 am the housekeepers came to work and we woke up as they were making a lot of noise probably they haven t realised the room was occupied At 6 30 someone dropped a luggage at around 7 someone smashed a plate the breakfast room was few stepd away everytime someone used the lift there was a terrible noise as the lift room was next to the storage room so for the 1st night we hadn t had a good sleep I have asked the receptionist at the arrival for a different room as I didn t wanted to stay in the basement but he advised that he has no power to do that and I should ask the receptionist that will come in the morning maybe he was there just to guard the hotel In the morning I have asked the receptionist for a different room as anyway everyone in the hotel was leaving They gave me the attic room which was even smaller it was not properly ventilated and it became really hot really soon they gave me a double bed although I have specified that I want a twin room I found the staff really unprofessional and unhappy I always said hello and goodbye and got some odd answers in return The ladies at breakfast seemed unhappy as well and in all my 3 mornings spent there I haven t seen them once smile I would not use the hotel again because of how incredibly small are the rooms stayed in London a lot of times and never had a room this small and because of the unfriendly staff , The area is really pretty and quiet close to Hyde park and Nottingham Hill close to restaurants underground and bus The hotel itself looks lovely from the outside and in the comunal areas really clean and the breakfast was delicious
217151,New Linden Hotel, Only downside was our second day Breakfast stops serving at 10am We were still eating and the staff turned all the lights off hint to leave haha but was a little rude , Lovely location close to tube station Very lovely and helpful staff Lots of restaurants coffee shops close by and at end of street is the entrance to st James park We were in room 304 which was nice and clean Great value for money Previous reviews had worried me with comments regarding small rooms and unclean however this wasn t our experience Modern and clean rooms Yes the rooms aren t the largest but it is central London Extremely good value for money 
217152,New Linden Hotel, The room was very very compact as was the en suite The flooring in the room had seen better days , The cleanliness of the hotel was good and the staff were very friendly The continental breakfast was of an expectable standard We particularly liked the close proximity of the hotel to the Royal Park just 2 minutes walk away It was great that we could leave our luggage securely stored before our booking in time and during the day of our departure 
217153,New Linden Hotel, The room was perfect for family with plenty of space however there were a few little annoying things The beds are on wheels which was a bit awkward The hairdryer did not work and the handle on the bathroom door was broken which was quite dangerous , The property was in a lovely location not on the same street as noisy pubs restaurants but very close by Everything went smoothly and we could even leave our luggage the following day the breakfast was satisfactory 
217154,New Linden Hotel, This is not 4 star hotel maybe 2 but only because location Bed is from last century room was in basement small even for UK standards Will not even think to come again , Location was ok
217155,New Linden Hotel, nothing I didn t like, The property is centrally located in a pleasant part of inner London close to public transport and in a retail area which provides most facilities anyone could ever need I have stayed at many similar properties in London over the years but this property consistently out ranks its competitors provides a higher level of service and is sensitive to the needs of its customers I rate it as exceptional value for money on every level 
217156,New Linden Hotel, No air conditioning our room on the 4th floor was impossibly hot A fan was provided but it was too noisy to keep it on all night The room was very tiny and the bathroom was not much bigger than the actual shower with very sharp angles so I kept accidentally hitting the walls , Lovely staff everything very clean good breakfast 
217157,New Linden Hotel, First of all the room is very small There was hardly place for a bed and the bathroom was very small as well Thereby it didn t look like the pictures on the site Furthermore the included breakfast is poor as well we expected at least a basic English breakfast but even that was not the case Also the room was quite noisy and the friendliness of the staff decreased when the night falls Overall the value for money is very poor For this price one may expect a lot better , The location was good 
217158,New Linden Hotel, Room was tiny and claustrophobic window sills unclean No room to open suitcase Luggage room was too full Lift took ages No other facilities , Staff were friendly 
217159,New Linden Hotel, The room was much smaller than I expected considering the price The bed was crammed into the corner of the room No A C The breakfast wasn t good I had in fact paid for breakfast to be included but the tea was from a big boiler and when I saw the limited selection of options in terms of cereal and the poor quality of baked goods croissants I left and got my own breakfast down the road , The location was convenient
217160,New Linden Hotel, The room has been behind the reception extremly small and very noisy and located on the ground floor with window to the backyard where people have been sitting and smoking When we arrived we had to wait 40 minutes because the receptionist was on his break The breakfast was kind of normal nothing really special I really cannot understand why the hotel is rated so highly , Not really so much The stuff beside the one that checked us in has been friendly 
217161,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was poor and very disorganised not enough seating for everyone, Nothing was a awful hotel the room was so hot and was no bigger than a standard double even though was meant to be a suite 
217162,New Linden Hotel, You could hear everything through the walls as other guests and the area was so quiet there wasn t a lot of noice anyway , We were very pleased with everything Very clean and tidy hotel and rooms comfortable beds and quiet surroundings We had a spacious enough room with a nice view We would definitely stay here again 
217163,New Linden Hotel, No normal table in my room Do not know how are others Single besd where on small wheels so when you sit they move a little King size bed was normal , More for holiday trips to feel the old days and for those who do not like modern but different it is very interesting and nice hotel Staff is wonderfull and pleasant to talk to 
217164,New Linden Hotel, Could do with the bedrooms having a lick of paint and more options for breakfast, The reception staff were very friendly and helpful We turned up early for our check in and they managed to give us a different room that was available
217165,New Linden Hotel, To room to small for 2 people and the breakfast was sparingly no scamble eggs and bacon in a hotel in London So to expensive pr night We had one day with rain all day would have been nice if we could have borrowed an umbrella , Very nice area and clean hotel close to Hyde park 
217166,New Linden Hotel, Rooms are on the small side and there was traffic noise but this is a London hotel , Location was ideal for our particular trip Hotel was clean and continental breakfast was extensive 
217167,New Linden Hotel, Size of the rooms Breakfast is limited , The staff is excellent They replaced the room we did not like and they did all the effort for it Internet wifi is good 
217168,New Linden Hotel, Room should have had cd player but thete was none and the sofa bed was uncomfortable for an adult to sleep in i expected 3 single beds and there was no mini bar in the room which was surprising as we had one in our previous stay at the hotel , Location was excellent to get around london and close to Bayswater tube station Lovely property clean and good size rooms 
217169,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Room was very nice small but you get what you pay for Had everything you could want from a room large double bed excellent en suite shower again small but adequate Check in was straightforward given a nice room 101 on the first floor found the overall standards excellent
217170,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast though good and including freshly made croissants and buns was continental type In my opinion a full English breakfast or a more varied buffet would have been appreciated But this does NOT put a damper in our stay , Excellent location very professional and kind staff cleanliness comfortable beds good internet they all make this property a very good choice for London stays It is true that rooms are on the small side but they are OK for London standards I would recommend it 
217171,New Linden Hotel, One room was incredibly tiny with no room for suitcase Due to a cleaning mix up we were moved to a bigger room however , Good price for the location and quality One room very good sized with new bathroom
217172,New Linden Hotel, Our room was close to reception so could hear people dealing with reception late at night and early morning The room was not carpeted and the shower although good leaked and quickly filled with water , Cooked breakfast was not offered but it was reasonable 
217173,New Linden Hotel, My jewellery bag was rubbed from our room and the staff were not helpful at all There is no CCTV on the floors Be careful Not recommended at all , Location
217174,New Linden Hotel, We had book a triple room but it was not The third bed was sort of sofa turned into a bed 1m70 long and not comfy at all The r ception lady said we could have another room but it was such a tiny one and the third bed was not like the two others either So we kept the first room It was next to the levator so we had the noise of it going up and down all the time And the noise of people talking in front of our doir while waiting for the lift The breakfast room in the bassement is just unbelievable for a four star hotel No decoration too small to host all the clients An uggly basement room and very cheap breakfast only the croissant were all right The two rooms i saw DID NOT look like the bedrooms on the picture at all It s smaller and not pretty at all Definitly not a four star hotel The safe didn t work I would not recommend this hotel, The room was very clean Nice bathroom with view Two beds were comfy but the third one was not even a bed The hotel is well situated
217175,New Linden Hotel, It would have been nice to have HOT tea and coffee at breakfast The flasks were always luke warm and the tea was not very nice I didn t try the coffee but it probably was also only warm The wooden floor in the bedroom was very squeaky , Continental breakfast was very good value for money Have stayed at this hotel on quite a few occasions and always enjoy the experience The rooms are always nice and clean Great area near to Kensington Gardens My favourite hotel 
217176,New Linden Hotel, Room was very cramped bed was quite a small double, Location perfect lots nice bars restuarants within easy access close to Nottinghill gate queensway tube stations bus service very good Staff friendly and helpful 
217177,New Linden Hotel, The room was very little and the bed was even small for one person it wasn t a double room and for sure not a king size bed Moreover the room was on the ground floor and near a downstairs access with the door closing noise all the time,No Positive
217178,New Linden Hotel, The bedroom was very very small we did not realise bedrooms rooms could be so small, Breakfast was good it was self service the staff very a attentive but the room was small
217179,New Linden Hotel, The room and hotel was dirty bedrooms had wood floor so you could hear every room around you room door was poor in terms of sound barriers so you can hear every single noise Reception staff were unfriendly and unwelcoming Not a great experience at all , Breakfast was good and the bed itself was a large comfortable bed Location was great 
217180,New Linden Hotel, The bathroom needs upgrading A shower curtain would prevent the floods in bathroom especially as the showerhead is attached to the wall and it is impossible to turn it so that one would not flood the floor Toiletbrush would be a very welcoming accessory as well Equally there is horrible chlore smell coming from the bathroom not sure the hotel itself could fix this issue but it did smell rather unpleasantly The smell from bathroom and the fact that either the room was distantly heated heating body in room was cold or isolated to prevent any oxygen flow we had the window open for the entire stay to have some fresh air and to be able to sleep over night Without the possibility to open the window it would have been a disaster smelly and way too warm Lastly and I really do not want to be a nag but one can hear neighbours too well Luckily we didn t have side neighbours but we could hear every move of our upstairs neighbours and when walking in the corridor one could hear every word from all the rooms when passing by Not really pleasant to overhear and not pleasant knowing that others can hear , For the average London price quality offer it is a good place The room is small but clean If they would remove the huge tea set from the table it would actually give space to put things on the table Equally unnecessary the beauty blanket on bed noone needs it and there is nowhere to put it away The staff is kind and friendly Check in fast and easy Breakfast for the fact that it is included a good one Enough choice to eat there during a city trip Coffee though could be better read stronger and have coffee taste sry For a short stay I would book it again as I refuse to pay the ridiculous prices London hotels ask 
217181,New Linden Hotel, The room was quite small and cramped the shower was awful no shower curtain that caused a total flood in the bathroom and a complete discomfort plus on one morning there was no hot water the TV didn t work properly the location was nice but a 10 min walk from the tube , The staff was super nice helpful and welcoming relaxing ambiance in the lobby and reception area the price was quite good for a London hotel and the area of the hotel was nice 
217182,New Linden Hotel, Had basement room very noisy because of lift shaft and outside terrace directly above All basement rooms would suffer from these problems Room very small ,No Positive
217183,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Great location close to metro line railway station Hyde Park staff was really friendly and helpful Breakfast was the same but plenty and good We ll return 
217184,New Linden Hotel, Room did NOT look like anything in the pictures they advertise on booking websites It was a tiny tiny shoebox room in the basement with a really smelly and dirty bathroom and there was dust everywhere like no one had stayed there in a long time and it hadn t been cleaned in awhile was super cold too down there , Fairly central and easy to get around to the tube stations and shopping malls near Notting hill too breakfast was average at best 
217185,New Linden Hotel, Quite a walk to a train station and room VERY small Also no shower curtain so bathroom flooded after shower, They held our bags for us for free once we checked out
217186,New Linden Hotel, The room was right behind reception It was a bit uncomfortable and noisy as we could everything going on in reception , The room itself was nicely decorated and cosy Lovely four poster bed 
217187,New Linden Hotel, Continental breakfast in the morning there s nothing better than a fresh pot of tea coffee brought to your table by the staff The tea and coffee was self service and in flasks which meant it was over brewed not appealing at all The tea in the room was of poor quality This is a pity as the accommodation was very good and value for money, Quiet location room spacious comfortable bed linen Fast wifi
217188,New Linden Hotel, Sleepless night before we got another room Very noisy One can hear guests on the floor above when they snore take shower walk etc I wanted to leave the hotel after 1st night Tiny room twin After we put bags into the room we couldnt walk in the room anymore Basic breakfast breakfast room looked like in a hostel not a 4 stars hotel low quality food door to kitchen were open all the times when i asked to close as i was seating next to the kitchen they disagreeed so i spent breakfast in aromas of washing liquid and noise of dishes being washed Staff not really helpful when asked to complete towels missing in our bathroom they ignored it Unsecure space to leave thebaggage and you have to carry it yourself As a whole compensation for a sleepless night we got chocolate Two stars would be my most rating I dont recomend this hotel Conparing to other 4 star boutique hotels I gave been to this is really much below the expected quality, Location in nice area Relatively close to tube station
217189,New Linden Hotel, The bed needs some non slip pads under the bed feet it slips away from the wall and from the head board It would have been great to have real spoons instead of those plastic stirring sticks Hot chocolate sachet would be great too , I loved the location and the view from our room over Leinster gardens The bathroom and shower was fantastic Lovely fluffy white towels and excellent bathroom products Loved the shower gel The bed was really comfy and bed linen was really high quality too 
217190,New Linden Hotel, I didn t like the double bed up against one wall I was expecting a bigger double bedroom Where u can walk round all sides of the bed , Liked the hotel in general But I was disappointed with our room 305 
217191,New Linden Hotel, Nothing, Wery polite staff someone is always present at reception All my requests were granted immediately Great room with balcony and view on green streets Very good facilities for tea in room powerful hairdryer Nice breakfast good coffee 
217192,New Linden Hotel, breakfast room very small I could not find a table and had to take my breakfast in a coffee shop despite of having paid my breakfast to New Linden Hotel , location
217193,New Linden Hotel, The first room we were allocated was room 1 in the basement It was uncomfortabley hot and we had the boiler noise which was awful , Hotel staff moved us to another room with no fuss at all 
217194,New Linden Hotel, No shower curtain door so bathroom floor gets very wet Door was located very close to stairwell so we could hear people going past Old building as well so could hear footsteps upstairs and cleaners in adjacent rooms , Room was as described reasonably well priced for London Bed was very comfortable and room was clean and tidy on arrival and throughout the stay Good location 10 minute walk from the tube station and Hyde Park and in a nice area 
217195,New Linden Hotel, You should state exactly where the hotel is It is actually on Hereford Rd I and another couple got lost trying to find it and I started to get quite anxious More specific directions would be immensely helpful ,No Positive
217196,New Linden Hotel, Room dated and not what was advertised on booking Bathroom was dirty shower came away from the wall on turning on the water bed uncomfy breakfast poor selection , Staff lovely
217197,New Linden Hotel, Vi hade bokat ett dubbelrum med tv s ngar f r fyra n tter Vid incheckning fick vi ett rum i k llaren bakom frukostmatsalen och utan dagsljus Det fanns ett f nster men med tv dm till en kompakt k llarmur i betong Vi klagade v nligt bad att f byta och sa att vi g rna kunde flytta mellan flera rum om det f renklade Det vi till slut fick var ett pyttelitet rum som saknade det mesta d r vi fick dela p en enda s ng p 1 35 cm F r att kunna r ra oss i rummet fick vi bokstavligt talat kl ttra ver varandra Rummet hade inga kl dkrokar inga krokar eller hyllor i badrummet inga avst llningsytor inga s ngbord eller s nglampor ingen h rtork och inget kypsk p Det fanns en enda stol men f r att kunna anv nda golvet m ste den st i v gen f r en liten garderob Golvet knakade v ldigt mycket och det var s lyh rt att vi h rde grannarnas golv knaka ocks Vi terv nder inte hit , L get r det enda positiva med detta hotell 
217198,New Linden Hotel, Rooms are small but I m solo on business so fine for me I can see that the wetroom style bathroom with no shower curtains might not be for everyone , Lovely comfy bed airy room quiet nice bathroom 
217199,New Linden Hotel, The room was cold and couldn t get the heater to work I found the pillows were very hard although the bed was comfy , The bed was comfy and the room was clean and modern I really liked the decor and good location 
217200,New Linden Hotel, The toilet did not flush properly Hot water ran out in the morning We could hear everything from the couple above us and they would arrive every night at 3am and loudly talk and bang things till 5 am which meant we were forced to complain to the reception and they said they would try to solve it nothing happened to solve it The breakfast we paid for consisted of croissants that were gross and the yogurt that was sick So we never had breakfast at the hotel again , The staff were friendly 
217201,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, We enjoyed the New Linden The lowest price room was very cramped as with so many similar London hotels We asked to upgrade for the rest of our stay and were given an excellent room Staff transferred our clothes while we were out and were generally very helpful Close by were several good restaurants so we could have a pre theatre meal there before heading for theatre land Much less stressful and better quality than the West End would recommend this plan to anybody in l London for a show 
217202,New Linden Hotel, The room we stayed in was tiny I mean seriously minute and directly opposite the lift which meant we were woken exceedingly early by people talking outside our room door as they waited for the lift Also on the first morning of our stay the staff decided that 8 30 was a reasonable time to start hammering a picture sign up outside our room The breakfast was minimal No hot food other than toast All continental cheeses meats cereal Disappointed , Great location friendly helpful staff 
217203,New Linden Hotel, they place the two of us mother and daughter on the street level room we can hear footsteps outside cars and any noise at all 2 nights of bad sleep Is it because we are Chinese guests We paid a lot of money for the room Breakfast is poor cleanliness and service bad We are frequent travellers and this is one of the worst hotel we stayed in Avoid at all cost , only the location
217204,New Linden Hotel, The room I stayed in the bathroom was freezing but that was easily resolved by continously adding hot water , I requested a room with a bath and they provided me with one

217206,New Linden Hotel, There are basement rooms which is a surprise a bit dingy down there Rooms are generally very small Don t expect much from the breakfast , A well located nice little hotel Clean beds are very comfortable Staff is very helpful Good value for money 
217207,New Linden Hotel, The shower didn t have a curtain and the design meant that every time the shower was used meant that the entire room got soaked, The breakfast was brilliant lots of food and a very relaxed atmosphere
217208,New Linden Hotel, The pictures I saw online was not what I got It was horrible I had a blood stained pillow the TV settings were in Spanish and the rooman seemed dusty, The bed was comfy and the lady at check in was very helpful and friendly

217212,New Linden Hotel, The coffee , All staff were friendly always smiling so helpful Hotel was set great location to pubs and resterauts Underground Station within walking distance
217213,New Linden Hotel, We stayed there twice before and found top floor room was worse than lower floor rooms which had big windows and good view to the square Top floor room had ceiling you had to bend your neck to walk under that s when you wanted to get to one side of the bed Tiny bathroom with tiny sink Other than that good hotel Would stay there again but not on top floor , Nice quiet hotel not far from metro station Good breakfast 
217214,New Linden Hotel, i got lost going to my hotel twice i got off the nottinghill gate station it would be better to go to bayswater station had to ask few people in the street how to get there, beautiful hotel i slept well and good shower good breakfast
217215,New Linden Hotel, The decor is a bit tired and our TV didn t work The photos on booking com make the hotel look much better than it actually does However all in all it s a budget hotel that is fine for a few days stay , The staff are the best thing about this hotel They were so helpful and friendly moving us to a suite when we weren t happy with our room Location is great within walking distance to 3 different tube stops 
217216,New Linden Hotel, Rooms have wooden floor boards no carpets They all creak Thought the guy in room above was actually in my room the creaks and footsteps were so loud ,No Positive
217217,New Linden Hotel, Very small room in the attic It had a slanting ceiling The bed was very small , Located in a quiet area but close to amenities and tube station Courteous staff good continental breakfast and wifi Good 3 star level hotel 
217218,New Linden Hotel, Room was really very small however it was functional cosy and with renovated modern bathroom Nice view from the window too , Quality price ratio unbeatable for expensive London Lovely area in Bayswater 5 min walk from Portobello Market k or Hyde Park Nice pub and grocery nearby Satisfying breakfast included in price Personnel polite and helpful Highly recommended 
217219,New Linden Hotel, The breakfast is a little limited and the Breakfast room is quite small but this in no way ruined our stay , Loved this hotel we booked mainly on price as just wanted a cheap cheerful getaway but seem to have uncovered an absolute Gem of a place We loved it so much that we actually extended our stay by an extra night The staff were absolutely lovely and so helpful and the location was perfect for us we will definitely be booking again for our next trip to town 
217220,New Linden Hotel, the hotel s interior feels worn out and the bathrooms needs renovation the breakfast room was so so the food quality could be better , The quietness and the attentiveness of the staff
217221,New Linden Hotel, nothing for our needs while the room was small it was fine for a short break , Good breakfast furniture and fittings were good quality and in good condition 
217222,New Linden Hotel, Very small room with a small bed In Sweden this would have been a small single room , Good location with ten minutes walk to Portobello market and five minutes walk to the subway station 
217223,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was poor cold coffee not much choice and bread rolls not very fresh I would stay again but would book room only basis as there are plenty of places to get a better breakfast near to the hotel , The reception staff were very welcoming The room was very clean although compact fine for a single traveller 
217224,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Great location Tucked away in a nice quiet part of london so you don t get lots of street noise but walk 5 mins in one direction and you re in the centre of it all 
217225,New Linden Hotel, There were not enough accessible sockets in the room to charge phones etc The rom was very stuffy and window difficult to open A lot of noise from rooms above below and opposite from 7am not appreciated after late night Breakfast totally self service not hot options , The staff were very friendly and attentive The location is superb and generally it is a pleasant hotel
217226,New Linden Hotel, Sound insulation could have been better , Great location for exploring this part of London The hotel is situated in a quiet square within walking distance of public transport and many attractions All was tastefully decorated clean and the staff were friendly and accommodating Whilst our room was not overly spacious it was very comfortable and had everything that we needed The facility to leave our luggage after checking out meant that we could make the most of our time in the area We would definitely consider staying here again 
217227,New Linden Hotel, Would have been better if there had been a bedside cabinet to place magazines or small articles on Very helpful staff People on reception were very pleasant to me , Nice comfortable bed and efficient shower Plenty of variety for breakfast 
217228,New Linden Hotel, The only negative comment would be that the wheels of the beds did not have the ability to keep the beds from moving and the locker in the room would not work despite the maintenance guy trying to fix it a few times The breakfast room was ok but when people went out to smoke the smoke travelled back into room which was a little off putting as I suffer from Asthma , The room wasamazing and the bed was so comfortable 
217229,New Linden Hotel, The bathroom needs a shower curtain It is an open shower meaning water splashes all over and I am of average figure The entire facility especially the bathroom as such isn t suited if you re of a large size meaning plus 38in waist size The room is very compact so if you re claustrophobic definitely avoid or book a larger room with more than one standard sized window But still who likes wet bathroom floors and wet toilet seats get a curtain dear New Linden It doesn t cost that much , The location is decent and quiet The Prince Andrew pub and kitchen is right around the corner and is a delightful place Average but decent room I was very happy to find a European power socket in the room Good thinking Very friendly staff Average breakfast B B type 
217230,New Linden Hotel, Old property small rooms Cannot control heat setting in room gets extremely warm at night had to leave window open, Location was brilliant Staff friendly
217231,New Linden Hotel, I requested a quite room on a high floor All the suites were located on the first ground floor which is okay but although the room was big the view was not nice I had the window blinds down all the time because I didn t feel comfortable with the possibility of people in the courtyard being able to see straight into my room The first night there also was a terrible noise like a giant vacuum cleaner Luckily I was so tired after my trip managed to fall asleep anyway However this was just the first night I also find it odd that in a 4 hotel no one showed me to my room and when I got to store my luggage after checkout the last day I had to take it to the storage room by myself I just got the key and directions to where to put it That felt really strange , I stayed here during an workaction in the end of january I stayed in a suite on the ground floor and the room was very spacious I would recommend to choose a suite instead of a standard room if you want more space There was a kettle so one could make tea coffee in the room The staff was very friendly The breakfast was ok not very much to choose from but there was bread ham cheese eggs yogurt etc The location is perfect and the neighborhood is lovely 3 different subways nearby Bayswater Notting Hill gate and Queensway which gives you access to almost all lines with maximum one change Very easy to get there from Victoria Station and Paddington Walking distance to Portobello Road and Kensington Gardens Nice restaurants in the area and a Sainsbury close by I will definitely consider this hotel for future stays and I also recommended it to friends With a few changes it will be perfect 
217232,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Staff were great and gave excellent recommendations of places to visit and eat First class service Room was perfect for all you need when visiting the big smoke Location was perfect with three stations close by A few minutes walk from Kensington gardens

217238,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Hotel was fantasic the room was big and clean breakfast was faboulous the staff were great and the location is ideal to get around London two nearby tube stations overall fantastic experience will definately be staying again 
217239,New Linden Hotel, The photos of the room and the hotel look much nicer than the reality My room was down in the basement so tiny I could not even open my suitcase The furnitures and the walls looked very old , Hot water heating wi fi in the room 
217240,New Linden Hotel, I was in a room downstars next to dining area Noise in the morning Couldnt open window Wifi not good due to lack of reception , Location and area is nice Reception stuff is nice and kind 
217241,New Linden Hotel, If I had to be picky then a little paint touch up on a few scuffed walls may brighten things up a bit , Room was very spacious and the reception staff were exceptionally helpful and cheerful 
217242,New Linden Hotel, the second night i was moved into a room in the basement it wasnt very nice it was very hot and you couldnt turn down the heating , the first room i stayed in was nice and the breakfast was very good the staff were very helpful 
217243,New Linden Hotel, The receptionist was no where to be seen when we returned to hotel late evening Another guest told us there had been no one present for some time and she had helped herself to her room key We did the same Where was the security Air vent was dripping on us when stood at sink Water from shower head sprayed in all directions , good selection for breakfast
217244,New Linden Hotel, Room did have queen bed On booking com it says that The room should have a large bed Breakfast could have more quality, Good location in London Clean room Good free wifi
217245,New Linden Hotel, Bed was to firm and was meant to be a double when in fact was just two singles pushed together only spend two nights so it sufficed, Location good near tube Staff friendly
217246,New Linden Hotel, The breakfast was basic and the bed was quite uncomfy a little bit too hard really , Very clean paid extra for bigger room and it s definitely worth it 
217247,New Linden Hotel, A little bit far away from the Bayswater underground station The breakfast room is too small that sometimes you can t find a seat , Spacious room Good hygiene 
217248,New Linden Hotel, The rooms are quite small and the walls very thin which contributed to some noise from the other rooms and the hallway , The staff were very friendly and helpful 
217249,New Linden Hotel, The room was very small maybe big enough for single travellers there was only bright ceiling light the bathroom was as small as possible and the rooms are very noisy to the neighbors We can t understand who gave 4 stars for this Hotel , The breakfast was ok The location is realy good and you have 2 tube stations 5min far away The personnal at the reception was very friendly and helpful 
217250,New Linden Hotel, Even by London standards an unceasingly small bathroom Bedroom was also incredibly hot and had no apparent way to turn heating down , Great location and very friendly staff 
217251,New Linden Hotel, Our room was extremely basic small it wasn t very clean There is no restaurant bar or comfy seating area it is not a luxury hotel more of a luxury hostel The sound transfer from the adjoining rooms was so loud it sounded like renovations were taking place our room could have used some Not at all suitable for a family stay as no out of room facilities , The staff were very nice
217252,New Linden Hotel, Very very small room in which the far too small bed in which we felt the springs hardly fitted This hotel was presented as a four stars hotel Three stars for the facilities and two at the most for room and bed would be more appropiate While booking this we had the impression we scored a fine 4 stars for a nice price This was very disappointing If we experience this one more time we will say goodbye to booking com, Good quiet location friendly staff good breakfast buffet however not typically English 
217253,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Receptionist very helpful and attentive Excellent location rooms comfortable and clean and excellent value for money We would have no hesitation in returning 
217254,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, provided fresh milk for tea in room hard working staff room downstairs was large airy and had bath plus shower nice and quiet Easy access to tube station
217255,New Linden Hotel, My room was an attic room and very small My husband is 6ft 6 and could not fit in the room without hitting his head on the ceiling shower was tiny too , The hotel is based in a fab area walking distance to a lot of places and also to 3 tube stops It was very clean and had a great breakfast 
217256,New Linden Hotel, Internet connection was not good and need more TV channels It would be nice to have air freshener in the room , It was very quiet and peaceful Lovely and friendly staff Loved the breakfast specially the freshly baked warm bread
217257,New Linden Hotel, Nothing really , A nice and clean accomodation in a very calm area but not far from the downtown There are lovely restaurants in the close streets like persian greek indian etc with more reasonable pricing than in the city centre They were open even on Dec 25th Good breakfast 
217258,New Linden Hotel, Rooms are a tad small but thats to be expected for London , Great hotel in a great location for a fantastic price Staff was excellent I will stay here again on my next visit 
217259,New Linden Hotel, The lighting in the room wasn t well conceived and the kettle didn t boil unless the switch was held down , The breakfast was delicious the staff were cheerful and friendly the bed was comfortable and there was a wide range of small reasonably priced restaurants on the nearby high street The tube was only a 5 minute walk away 
217260,New Linden Hotel, Really small room rude staff You have to leave your key at the reception when you go out And when you return they give back the key without checking ID which worried me a bit Gnerally speaking you get what you pay it is a fair place to take in London , The hotel is near to Notting Hill It takes 10 minutes of walking to Queensway Station 
217261,New Linden Hotel, The breakfast was basic and the breakfast room was too small for the amount of guests staying in the hotel we were always waiting for a table to become available and we weren t the only ones The hotel is in need of updating The front desk staff were polite but some of the other staff treated us like we were in their way just by staying there The lift is very slow and is often used by staff doing housekeeping The tv in the room was very small and had a fault The hotel had advertised that it was in Chelsea it s actual location is between Bayswater and Notting Hill Gate , The beds were comfortable rooms were clean and in a quiet location 
217262,New Linden Hotel, TV reception very bad Couldn t operate safe in room asked for help but it never arrived Also staff polite but managed to convey that they had no interest in you Breakfast was very limited and boring , the cleanliness and location
217263,New Linden Hotel, The wardrobe was very small and filled with a spare duvet that hid the hairdryer and books found underneath, Comfortable bed and largish bathroom for a small room Good use of mirrors to give illusion of a larger space and enhancing light in the room Friendly staff well organised refectory and I enjoyed the cold buffet spread included in the room rate All perfectly adequate for the price 
217264,New Linden Hotel, Floor boards very noisy shower temp was all over the place no option of cooked breakfast , Bed was Comfortable It was nicely decorated Staff were helpful 
217265,New Linden Hotel, Could do with marmalade and the floors need screwing down as when the next door guest woke up and paced around our floor creaked enough to keep us away, position staff nearness of tube and great restaurants
217266,New Linden Hotel, GOOD location, Receptionist arranged me an ILLEGAL taxi transport to AIRPORT driver had NO taxi sign on car did not accept credit cards stopped me on ATM to pick up cash issued No invoice As was 5 00 AM had no choice and was in a hurry Would definitely NOT recommend this to anybody
217267,New Linden Hotel, Bathroom only had shower and you couldn t adjust it Free view tv when room was supposed to be 1000 , Location was good room was decent size and staff friendly
217268,New Linden Hotel, The room was cold when we arrived as the radiator had been turned off It would have been nice to have arrived to a warm room as it was freezing outside But it soon warmed up , The location was excellent and the rooms although small were very comfortable 
217269,New Linden Hotel, We read the comments and got what was expected however the hotel did not have a Bar Would say a very good 3 Star but would fall short of a 4 Star, We had a suite and the room was lovely breakfast was continental so got what we expected good location to the underground buses and the hotel had friendly reception staff 
217270,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Staff really nice and helpful Very quiet rooms Convenient location Good value for money for once in London Keeping this address for future trips for sure o 
217271,New Linden Hotel, Hotel room was so small on the basement I was not warned during reservation and at the reception If I knew I would chose other option , Location friendly staff good breakfast and silence during night Clean and warm 
217272,New Linden Hotel, Room was not ready for 2pm one of the pillow was dirty and on breakfast i found a moldy bread I show that to member of staff and she did not even said sorry to me She just took a bread and replaced whole tray , Location
217273,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The location was very good and quiet Nice Moroccan restaurant very close Nice posh district with beautiful shops nearby but also Portobello road shops market a bit further Not too far from Hyde Park 
217274,New Linden Hotel, Its not a good idea to phrase this as what could have been better because frankly there is no room to make this better but the rooms are very very small I mean really small with barely room to put your computer anywhere and try to work The bed usually takes up almost the entire room so it is difficult to know where to put things I like it that the New Linden has made the most of what they have and after all this is London not Ottawa so not much space but still my niece who has yet to stay in a hotel in London even though she works in this city couldn t believe that I was paying what I was paying for the tiny room but in all honestly it was a very good price for London what can I say, I love the location for the New Linden Its easy to walk to really good restaurants both right near the hotel and a tiny bit further on Westbourne Grove It is also close to Portobello Road and Notting Hill I think the staff is great and the management does its best to accommodate All good The rooms and bathrooms are clean and downstairs the breakfast is well managed a pretty good The first time I stayed in the New Linden now I have stayed there 3 times I found the air a bit stuffy and smelled of some kind of air freshener but didn t notice this in my most recent stay 
217275,New Linden Hotel, As room was in the basement I had no phone or mobile internet reception The WiFi was patchy and the TV signal was poor at times There were cobwebs on the ceiling and dust around the room The shower had no grab rails and as the shower was up some steps it was a bit dangerous Also after returning back late in the evening I found that the cleaner hadn t locked the room door Thankfully nothing was taken but not impressed Also a lot of noise with doors banging at all hours not a restful night sleep , Friendly reception team and near Bayswater tube station Handy for Kensington Gardens 
217276,New Linden Hotel, Shower no bath no shower curtasin so floor soaked every shower a bit of a pain, V quiet location for a central London hotel with little traffic passing outside good location for exploring london
217277,New Linden Hotel, Basement room nr 5 you could hear the elevator machinery all the time consider Breakfast room is located on this floor so very big traffic of people from 7 30 onwards Door of the room was not perfectly fitting so it made noise slamming all the time people would open and close outer doors Breakfast is ok but depending on the time you might need to wait for some minutes before you get a seat we were lucky and did not wait any morning , Very good location 10mins walking from Hyde Park Close to Bayswater and Queensway metro stations Very confortable mattress Rooms are not enormous but fair enough for 2 people Everything was clean Personnel was very friendly and helpful 
217278,New Linden Hotel, Location wasn t great for tube but ok and room bit small Open shower meant bathroom got soaked every time shower was used , Room was clean staff helpful
217279,New Linden Hotel, Sheets weren t changed daily The floor was dirty Pillows were a bit hard , I loved the location The desk help was great The room was nice it just seemed to be a bit stark The breakfast was also good 
217280,New Linden Hotel, The age of the hotel building and the design of the rooms each en suite has been added after the fact means that the rooms are very small And when I say small I mean small There is literally no room around a double bed and at best a passage width between the remaining side of the bed and the next wall The bathrooms are also small don t expect a shelf on which to put your toiletries If you are only going to use the hotel as a place to sleep and nothing else then it is manageable for short stays , The hotel is very well situated and a ten minute walk from two underground stations which will take to you wherever you want in London The hotel itself is in a beautiful Georgian terraced setting and has all the facilities you might need for a short stay in London Everything was very clean and the breakfast was good Recommended for a short stay only for the reasons outlined in the what was not to like section 
217281,New Linden Hotel, Poor breakfast offering no gym a bit expensive for what it was , I like that it was very close to the park which made it easier to have some form of exercise The reception Lina I think her name was she was truly excellent and helpful 
217282,New Linden Hotel, The room was significantly smaller than shown on the images online as was the bath room The breakfast selection was minimal Very basic rooms totally not worth the price we paid Pay 10 extra for a modern room with space I would not recommend Tube station is about a 6 min walk so OK but would prefer to stay more central next time we visit London , The staff were pleasant 
217283,New Linden Hotel, It is an old hotel and has some small rooms I upgraded To a double I wouldn t like to see the size of the single room The double I was in had the bed against the wall which would not suit less able guests It should be sold as a single , The decor was plush with a lovely tiled bathroom There are some quality touches The place was spotlessly clean Breakfast was continental and quite basic but more than adequate Location was great The lady on the desk was very helpful
217284,New Linden Hotel, bathtub had some hair from previous guests when I came back to collect my luggage after leaving it at the front desk earlier at check out I had a minor panic attack as it wasn t in the luggage room and the staff on duty didn t know where it was turns out it was in the living area opposite the reception as the area was exposed I was a little appalled at the lack of care over my left luggage , Was close to the tube and located in a good neighbourhood check in was fuss free and breakfast was sufficient 
217285,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was somewhat limited vegetables not always fresh There was no hairdryer on the room For a luxury suite the space was quite small Windows were not tight so there was a cold draft of air at night Something like a washing machine nearby produced strange sounds throughout the night , Tea kettle and tea on the room Shopping center and many restaurants were nearby Overall a good starting point to explore London 
217286,New Linden Hotel, Would have been even nicer if a cooked buffet style breakfast had been available as an extra cost option , Quality feel in both rooms and public areas for an attractive price Good location in a nice part of Bayswater Quiet location for an urban area Close to the Underground and a good selection of restaurants 
217287,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was a fairly disapointing for the price It would be better to pay for breakfast outside , Very well located Nice place to be back after a full day visiting London Close to the Parks very good and numerous restaurants in the vicinity Charming neighbourhood 
217288,New Linden Hotel, The location was nice but a little out of the way for a sole traveller First time to London so I really wasn t very sure of location I ll know better next But if your travelling as a couple or family its a lovely location, The hotel was lovely even if my room was small and I left like I was in the basement Well you get what you pay for don t you so just know that if you book the cheapest room that s what you ll get 
217289,New Linden Hotel, The bed had wheels and it was continuously rolling all over the room Room was also quite small There was no hot breakfast , Pleasant staff willing to help
217290,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was not bad but a bit poor for the price of the room, Location staff and a perfect family room Room 109 Highly recommended Could have stayed one day more just for the room 
217291,New Linden Hotel, Room very small for 4 And quite scruffy in places Wiring for hairdryer would not pass any electrical inspection kept awake 3 nights out of 4 by people in the room above flushing toilet and walking about Sound deading poor somebody had badly fitted hardwood floor in our room no doubt to save money on carpets Breakfast basic to say the least boy do we need to learn from our continental neighbours I apologies to any one from abroad not all our hotels are as bad as this one No extractor fan in bathroom so damp and generally run down also the basins where plumbed the wrong way around which to me is a sign of poor workmanship How it gets AA four stars beats me a very poor 3 more like Will take th AA ratings with pinch of salt in future l have been all over Europe and this puts me off visiting my home capital My impression was because it s London and the demand is high the effort can be low , Nothing 
217292,New Linden Hotel, The breakfast could ve been better , The staff was so friendly I felt like I was living in a family home The room was big and comfortable but cosy 
217293,New Linden Hotel, Small room bathroom floor slippy Beds on wheels moved very easily even when locked My son reached up from bed to change tv channel as no tv remote the bed swung a full 90o away from him and he hit his head on the wooden floor which resulted in a real fright and quite a lump , Staff very nice great location with restaurants and supermarket nearby Park 10 min walk away 
217294,New Linden Hotel, Bit far from central town where shows were , Mohammed was truly magnificent and couldnt do enough for us He went out of his way time and time again A true gentlemen and wonderful host 
217295,New Linden Hotel, The flooring was clashing so i woke up in the middle of the night when somebody arrived home and passed in the corridor albeit I sleep bad My girlfrend and my parents in the next room did not recognised the noises , It is close to bayswater underground station so it is easy to get to anywhere in the city The room was small but enough for a three night stay and it was cleaned every day properly They did not skimp the heating so much so we had to turn it down in the middle of the night Breakfast was better than expected The neigbourhood is very nice and tidied 
217296,New Linden Hotel, Room size was very small Fine for one night stay but would be a problem for longer stays Distance from Tube stations , Location Good breakfast included in room rate Comfortable bed Nice decor Luggage room Great pub just along the road 
217297,New Linden Hotel, Not a problem, Location excellent for the sponsored walk we were doing so we needed the District Line Liked Bayswater hotel had lovely staff very friendly lady from Bulgaria on the desk when we arrived who s name I don t know but she is a credit to the hotel room cosy and breakfast good
217298,New Linden Hotel, My room looked as if deep cleaning needed was for hotel of this standard floor was dusty curtains very dusty at the top bathroom had watermarks mirrors and sink toilet wasn t cleaned properly I had huge bath tub but no bath plug or tub water running just shower that was in need of descaling tea spoons non existing why opt out for the cheapest plastic stirrers , friendly receptionist lovely decor high ceilings large bathroom lots of storage space 
217299,New Linden Hotel, Sheets were stained Bed was uncomfortable Pictures were not reflective of the space the space was too small even for one person Walls were dirty ,No Positive

217301,New Linden Hotel, The room was a bit small but we didnt spend much time there , This hotel was about 5 min walk from Bayswater st and 10 min from Queensway Quiet plase and nice beds It was also many god restaurants near by The personal was very friendly and nice 
217302,New Linden Hotel, I was in Room 4 in the basement There was no possibility of achieving a good nights sleep as machinery and plant in the basement area prevented that from happening to the point that I would say the room could not be reasonably used as a bedroom I advised the receptionist when I was checking out that the noise in the basement was unbearable and she said that if I stayed there in the future I should ask for a room on the upper levels Hotels shouldn t put people in these rooms if they know that they are problematic Had this have happened in a Premier Inn I would have received a full refund , The room was clean modern and tidy
217303,New Linden Hotel, Let s begin to say this is not a 4 star hotel not by a mile The bedroom was extremely small small bed small bathroom Dust everywhere No curtain in the shower , Good location The service at the breakfast 
217304,New Linden Hotel, The room was small difficult to get around the bed pillows were not comfortable The handle on the water valve were loose falling off The wooden floor made incredibly much noise when you walked on it , The breakfast was very nice the staff handling this everyday did a splendid job 
217305,New Linden Hotel, The photos on booking com are not representing at all the reality The hotel is really worn rooms are to small floor is creaking laudly , Location of the hotel is really good 
217306,New Linden Hotel, Third floor room facing main road Across road there is a youth hotel that has lots of youths God I fee old I m 29 which kept me awake at times The rooms are also very small , Ivan staff was grumpy helpful and fun all rolled into one Excellent price 75 night for a double room and continental breakfast for 2 Amazing
217307,New Linden Hotel, The single room is very small with no proper desk located on the underground floor with too much noise and lack of natural light , The location and the good attitude of the member of the staff
217308,New Linden Hotel, Only 1 small niggle one of the beds was on the slipperiest wheels it shot across the room when you tried to sit on it , We loved our split level room the fancy shower and I enjoyed being able to open the window next to my bed really wide 
217309,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Very elegant from the outside Quiet location Clean and comfortable on the inside Staff most helpful and very pleasant Excellent continental breakfast Thank you New Linden
217310,New Linden Hotel, Our room was small with a set of five steps off a small landing going down to the rest of the room There was nowhere to put our luggage and the bathroom was like a closet My husband has a bad hip which made things very difficult The staff in the breakfast room were very abrupt and started removing everything the minute 10am came A mother was three children was told she was too late when she arrived just on 10am We had stayed in this hotel five years ago and although it was tired we had a much better room The price we payed for this hotel was ridiculous for what we received I am normally a very positive reviewer but we would never stay here again , The position is good with easy access to the tube stations for the Central Line at Queensway and Nottinghill Gate Also Baysrwater on the District Line 
217311,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Staff at reception were friendly and helpful and breakfast room staff were efficient and polite Our 4th floor room was quiet Convenient location with a short walk to tube station choice of restaurants and shops 
217312,New Linden Hotel, It would be more comfortable to have an aircon and a mini refrigerator in the room , Staff was very friendly Rooms were clean and the location was good Within 10 minutes walk to Bayswater and Queensway underground stations Free wifi was sufficient 
217313,New Linden Hotel, The room was very small and there s no air conditioner in the room Unfortunately for us we ve got 2 very hot days in London , Location is great the neighborhood is really beautiful Breakfast is fine and the staff was good 
217314,New Linden Hotel, the breakfast time was quite strictly 7 30am onwards but due to my first meeting and need to travel by tube across London I needed to be on a tube for 7am so couldn t have breakfast appreciate that times can be challenging but to have an option of early breakfast even if just cereal and toast etc would be ideal , Everything was very good and good value for money other than 1 aspect see next answer 
217315,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The location Was perfect for us The room a little small but spotlessly clean and had all the required amenities All the staff were helpful and polite and we will definitely stay there again close to Portobello Rd market Bayswater tube station and great pubs and restaurants and if you get the chance eat in a little pizza place called Mullberry St pizza on Moscow Rd VFM 
217316,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful We arrived before our room was ready and they allowed us to leave our bags and they placed them in our room for when we returned 
217317,New Linden Hotel, Very small room right behind reception no air con so very hot and just far too small also floor boards very very creaky , Quite modern newly redecorated
217318,New Linden Hotel, The room was very small Pleasant but very small Due to the size of the bathroom the floor and toilet area was permanently wet if you had a shower no room for a shower curtain , The location in central london
217319,New Linden Hotel, The room got very hot and although there was a ceiling fan it didn t make much difference As a single female I didn t feel comfortable leaving the windows open as they are huge sash windows that have a balcony , The location was excellent for the underground and for restaurants
217320,New Linden Hotel, My credit card was pre authorized 10 pounds deducted It was not adjusted in my room rent paid when check in When I enquired during checkout I was told it will be credited in a day or two Hope it comes back , They helped us with an early breakfast on request when we have to leave early for a package trip 
217321,New Linden Hotel, Where do I start This hotel is definitely NOT 4 More like 2 Rooms were tiny no bar no iron in the room and when I asked for one I was asked to collect it from reception as the staff didn t start work till approx 9 00am No option for english breakfast and to top it off you could not eat in the rooms due to the expensive furnishings which I would say is questionable , The staff were very friendly and the continental breakfast was good 
217322,New Linden Hotel, Air conditioning for room would have made it more comfortable Bathroom very small only room for one at a time , Great staff Comfy bed and pillows Convenient location in nice area 
217323,New Linden Hotel, Room was a bit hot although a fan was available and bed could have been a bit softer , Friendly and very helpful staff at reception comfortable quiet room and good breakfast 
217324,New Linden Hotel, No secure car park , Very impressed with the staff no task was too much trouble we will be stopping again Breakfast was very enjoyable even though it was not a full English 
217325,New Linden Hotel, The maids knocking on our door from 9am trying to hurry us out of the room Extremely small bathroom too small to function rooms way too hot no air con No working TV, Location in beautiful Notting hill very quiet The best croissants 
217326,New Linden Hotel, We went to London during a particularly hot week and had an attic room It was boiling day and night even with the windows open To add to this there was only warm hot water coming out of the taps in the bathroom so that we couldn t even have a cold shower to cool off The room was very tidy but for me the attention to detail was missing There were little things that put me off e g broken light fittings broken loo roll holder no glasses in bathroom to store your toothbrushes and ripped towels The staff at breakfast were very loud speaking amongst themselves but wouldn t greet the guests , The staff were friendly the room was clean the breakfast was sufficient and the location was good Good value for the money we paid 
217327,New Linden Hotel, Though I didn t see it my sons room which was higher up was not as modern and not so comfortable , There was a wide variety of items for breakfast that would keep most happy Unfortunately being gluten and dairy free I could only have the fruit salad The room was modern and very comfortable We were in room 9 
217328,New Linden Hotel, Room wasn t very spacious no desk thin walls Noise from other occupants could be heard very easily , Friendly staff breakfast with good selection nice bathroom and comfortable bed Good for short stay 
217329,New Linden Hotel, Rooms very small No air con Breakfast was continental and no option for an English breakfast We helped our self to Toast and butter but the better was off , We were upgraded to a exec sweet as it was our anniversary check in was quick and easy Reception helpful
217330,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast time starts at 730am should be 7am like everyone else If you are going on a bus trip and need to leave early u miss out on breakfast, Good location in Bayswater 5min from tube surrounded by restaurants and supermarkets at end of street or two near the tube Excellent breakfast for London and friendly helpful staff throughout
217331,New Linden Hotel, The basement rooms windows that people can easily look in from the outside a lot of noise from the corridor with zero soundproofing made worse from tile floors The upper floors looked much nicer , The location was perfect a beautiful building staff very friendly 
217332,New Linden Hotel, They tried to put me in a dismal room in the basement Totally unacceptable I know that you can t expect a lot for your money in London but that room was just too awful Breakfast was also in a dreary basement room and the quality of the food was mediocre at best , The staff was very nice in helping me resolve a major problem as I would not accept the first room they tried to give me The person at the desk was very sympathetic and contacted the manager who authorized a room change 
217333,New Linden Hotel, While it appears on the web with four stars it is only a glorified bed and breakfast with no cooked breakfast Never offered the facility to use a leisure centre by arrangement The place was grand only, staff friendly
217334,New Linden Hotel, Full at breakfast and no possibility to get a tray to take breakfast somewhere else needed to stay and wait in breakfast restaurant Small room for three persons and beds where on wheels which was a bit annoying No hangers in bathroom for towels etc No shower curtain so after shower the whole bathroom floor was wet, Staff in reception was very nice and helpful
217335,New Linden Hotel, I lost my luggage in this hotel after checking out It s a really horrible effect for my rest of trip I am still waiting for further action , After losing luggage the stuff attitude is good 
217336,New Linden Hotel, we had to check out from the hotel early due to a family emergency however the management refused to refund us the days not used i find this very unprofessional to charge someone for a service not offered and the little extra gesture would have made us come back the next time for sure rooms were very small and the bathroom tiny, The staff was very helpful very well located hotel close to the metro station our first room was not suiting us and we had a new one the next day 
217337,New Linden Hotel, The beds moved very easily because of the wooden floors For people who have mobility problems this would be a hazard, There was good choice at breakfast Very fresh and well presented The staff were lovely and helpful 
217338,New Linden Hotel, No door on the shower but loads of hotels do this in small bathrooms so it s not a criticism of this specific hotel just a general gripe , Decent hotel single room was quite small but it was a large bed and I don t need much room anyway it was value for money and I have no complaints at all about my stay Nice to be able to run 400 metres down the road and be at Hyde Park If I need to stay over for work again I will be looking out for this hotel 
217339,New Linden Hotel, Cold meat platter at breakfast very strange meats on offer , Quiet and ideal with a young family Early check in and held luggage for me until we were ready to travel home
217340,New Linden Hotel, We stayed in room 103 The flush doesn t work well and the shower needs a curtain The hardwood floors were extremely squeaky and woke up every one if you walked on them The locks need to be upgraded to 21st century electronic ones The single beds were on wheel and kept moving , the location is very good and quiet 5min walk to underground with tons of restaurant and stores of all kinds nearby The beds were comfortable every things was clean wifi was good and the staff were extra nice 
217341,New Linden Hotel, The standard twin room is really small , We stayed in two different rooms because we we had another person join us later in our trip The first room was a basic room with two twin beds put together It was small as expected in Europe The second room was a family suite room and it was amazing I loved it Spacious and beautiful I wanted to stay there much longer just to enjoy the room Staff was very friendly and so helpful with all kinds of information to make our stay in London wonderful 
217342,New Linden Hotel, I was offered a genius luxury offer and I spent three nights in a double room I must report that this is far from being a 4 hotel as many things for improving must be done except for the very small rooms most of them are very small but as usual in London Curtains for showers are missing thus making the tiny toilet a lake every time there are no minirefrigerators in the rooms expected in any 3 no air conditioning thus making the room a hell after dusk the breakfast is very standard and unsatisfactory , The staff is helpful and nice Location is awesome I will come back here 
217343,New Linden Hotel, Greeting from staff sloppy Noisy room very small room and needs updating Bathroom smelt damp Poor Could have got a Hilton on offer for the same price Will never stay again , The breakfast and location was good 
217344,New Linden Hotel, The wooden floor in my room was making noise whenever I was walking I could also hear that sound from the next room Please provide some milk for tea coffee in the room next time , All the staff at the reception had very nice smiles and pleasant My bathroom basin was blocked but they immediately sorted out for me The room was quite decent size for the single room in London Proper space to open my suitcase as there are many hotels you can t do so I stayed on rather humid day so the electric fan in the room was great After checking out they looked after my suitcase for almost 8hours which was very helpful 
217345,New Linden Hotel, The room was small for two people only one person could move around at a time but it s a good price if you simply want it as a base for moving around London , Very easy access to the tube and Bayswater High Street has excellent restaurants 
217346,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, We couldn t fault the place The staff were friendly and very helpful We had room 8 which was on the lower ground level Although compact it had everything we needed for our 3 day stay The beds were comfortable and the bedding was immaculate We had our own bathroom with shower which was modern and clean We had fresh towels each day and the room was cleaned each day too The Wi Fi connection was excellent We had breakfast which was continental there was plenty of choice and the dinning room again on the lower ground was modern and pleasant The hotel is situated in a great location and only minutes from the tube or bus stop We would definitely stay here again 
217347,New Linden Hotel, The room was small and cramped and very hot with no air con Very noisy outside with the window open The portable fan in the room didn t work and the very old replacement I was given fell apart during the night A used an iron which I collected from the reception but that was also broken Bed very creaky The hotel needs some TLC , Were greeted by a friendly and helpful receptionist she told us she had only been there 2 or 3 weeks and she made us feel very welcome which made up for many of the hotels short comings Manager please note Generally clean and tidy though the cleaner had missed cleaning the toilet bowl and handy for restaurants Good value for money though so if you re on a tight budget I d recommend 
217348,New Linden Hotel, Paid for a double room got two single beds pushed together dressed up as a double Singles didn t even stay together when moved they literally came apart with a gap in the middle Shower had no curtain so water literally went everywhere tower fan in room was insufficient as room was boiling overnight we had to wedge open our window with a chair precariously balance tower fan on it Towels didn t smell fresh either , Liked the location Notting Hill is excellent
217349,New Linden Hotel, The size of the double room was very small and the bed was slightly collapsed on the one side in the middle due to a wheel that seemed a bit broken , The croissants are breakfast were the best I ve ever tasted I liked the close proximity of the hotel to two different underground stations about a 10 minute walk to either Furthermore the staff were very friendly and helpful Very convenient location I would definitely return in future 
217350,New Linden Hotel, This is not a 4 star hotel by any means The breakfast had literally no choices No options for vegetarians Staff was not so co operative , The receptionist we met on the first day was trying to be helpful 
217351,New Linden Hotel, Loved it all , Breakfast was great Lots of room in our triple room Nice and clean Staff were very helpful in booking tickets for theatre Couldn t have been any better 
217352,New Linden Hotel, The shower was so small it was hard to get in through the door The outside door in corridor slams shut after a guest opens it and it so loud it woke me from my sleep ,No Positive
217353,New Linden Hotel, Room was roasting hot at all times Hotel did provide a fan but still very hot and stuffy Mattress was faulty slanted at one side making sleeping difficult on that side , Location In a nice quiet area ideal as got two tube stations on different lines so easy to get about Staff very friendly and helpful 
217354,New Linden Hotel, Bathroom was a joke, The bathroom is so tiny I could not use the toilet and close the bathroom door because my shoulders would not fit the shower access is idiot And the shower was tiny Of my trip it was the most expensive hotel and the room would be best for a hobbit 
217355,New Linden Hotel, Room not as described on website Sold an executive double room probably about the same size as a university dormatory Satalite TV was free view with dodgy signal I ve seen airing cupboards bigger than the bathroom If I had a little bit more body weight there would be no way I could fit through the door We were on the top floor 403 so as the heat rose the room became unbearably hot Sold a room with Victorian Windows which were actually double glazed so not sure when those were invented A let down for what was meant to be a special trip to London Shame , Not too far from tube station very friendly staff 
217356,New Linden Hotel, No air conditioning small room no shower curtain breakfast room was crowded and warm , Great location on a quiet street close to Hyde Park Staff was very friendly and helpful Linens and towels were nice Room was clean Breakfast was good we enjoyed fresh fruit cheeses and breads 
217357,New Linden Hotel, No air conditioner but they did have oscillating fans If it had been warm outside and not in the 60 s it could have been uncomfortable Also the beds were on wheels and rolled a little too easily on wood floors Sitting in bed with back against headrest bed rolled forward , The room was large and bathroom was very nice 
217358,New Linden Hotel, The decor is a little shabby and could do with updating as things were a little scruffy No air conditioning and since it was summer the rooms got quite hot , Great location and excellent staff Short walk from Bayswater tube station with plenty of amenities close by Really friendly knowledgeable staff who were always on hand to help 
217359,New Linden Hotel, The staff at breakfast stood around leaning on wall staring at you eating It was a small room Felt uncomfortable The shower gel had been topped up with water from previous guests The gel was on bottom water on top Bathroom too small no shower curtain everything got wet Television badly positioned couldnt see anything unless you stood up luggage room unsafe was given key to take it down ourselves and had access to anyone s case that was in there On returning it was a different person who without question just handed us the key to get our luggage Not very security conscious Cleaning staff bringing the new towels etc outside rooms ready for later from 7 am not quiet bags of sheets towels etc left opened on stairs for anyone to trip on There was a note in room not to eat in room due to expensive furnishings getting ruined It was cheap mdf flat pack and wooden floor White sheets and a thick throw I ve stayed in 5 hotels that have never asked this If anything it s encouraged in room service there missing a trick ,No Positive
217360,New Linden Hotel, A four poster bed in a small room was not a very good idea it made it seem very crowded The wash basin plug didn t work The duvet was very lumpy , The mattress was comfortable
217361,New Linden Hotel, Slightly smaller rooms than I expected, Wonderful staff at the front desk Always willing to help with any questions I had Great location 20 minute walk to Oxford street and Knightsbridge The rooms were very clean and the beds and linen were great Breakfast was also great Lots of food and they even catered for Gluten Free I will definitely stay here again We really enjoyed our stay 
217362,New Linden Hotel, I didnt like that I could stay longer , OMG So What a stay We had a medical emergency while we where there and they where more than helpful and understanding THANK YOU Nothing is more important than that 
217363,New Linden Hotel, Booked 2 costly rooms for 2 nights and ended up with rooms in the basement adjacent to the breakfast room Rooms didn t look anything like the photos disappointed Wifi didn t work in the rooms either , Location
217364,New Linden Hotel, The rooms were much smaller than anticipated which made it difficult for travelling in a couple , The location was in a quiet part of London The bathroom was modern and clean 
217365,New Linden Hotel, As a solo female I was put in a room on the ground floor Many other hotels tend to put women on a higher floor to make people feel safer I asked to move rooms but wasn t allowed Phone was broken so couldn t ring reception Room was actually in the basement and the corridors leading to it were awful there was a dirty towel lying outside a doorway Also my room was right next to the lift shaft and rooms werent very soundproof very noisy take earplugs , Good location Whilst the evening staff weren t very helpful there was a lovely gentleman in the morning who very efficiently booked me a taxi 
217366,New Linden Hotel, My first room think it was no 7 However I think the hotel is being gradually refurbished so hopefully it will be improved soon The second room I was given was perfectly fine , Location was fabulous The staff were very pleasant and helpful The room I was allocated was not up to scratch but the receptionist arranged for me to move the next morning without any hesitation 
217367,New Linden Hotel, Floors were poor both in and out of room You could hear all conversations from rooms to outside Toilet seat was not in its place pillow case was broaken and staff in it did look really old So deatails and maybe more stable staff now it was new person every time Small room but was ok for me Coffe at breakfast was not good , It is not bad at all everything ordinary Some of staff was even exelent breakfast was included and was ok Location ok Relativly modern good materials used and for example modern toilet shower No aircondition but cooling fan in room I would say nice 3 star in London could use again There was an exelent staff in Saturday morningsift 25 6 that guy was 10 10 
217368,New Linden Hotel, First of all this is NOT a 4 star hotel Whoever said it is was a big liar I ve been in 4 star hotels and I know how they should look like This is a maximum 3 stars Therefore do not expect 4 star value for money and comfort Also we were not allowed to take the room key with us which I found weird Also they changed our shower gel by filling the remaining half full bottle with water Shower and sink pressure was constantly fluctuating and so was the water temperature , Location was good close to the tube Also a lot of restaurants around Friendly staff 
217369,New Linden Hotel, The room space is too small, The food the staff were so helpful especially the receptionist young man who worked morning shift the Internet connection is top of the range 
217370,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast is the same every day More variety is needed Also cups for coffee and tea are too small as contents get cold fast plus you need to keep getting up for refills , Staff are very efficient and friendly They make you feel at home right away 
217371,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was a little disappointing as choices were limited No hot items offered Could be improved , I stayed in a suite on the ground floor Room size is decent The room is bright and clean It is also quiet Bathroom immaculate Staff friendly and helpful Hotel close to tube station and within walking distance to Bayswater and Nottinghill Gate Very convenient 
217372,New Linden Hotel, When you had a shower the whole bathroom turned into a steamroom within seconds AND the Italian shower style made it impossible not to pour water all over the bathroom floor very slippery Unfortunately the mattresses are not too comfy the bed too short for taller people and the walls are very thin , Really nice staff helpful and welcoming Superb location close to central London New bathroom facilities were great to look at but 
217373,New Linden Hotel, Room was small especially for the price and there were a few maintenance issues , Room was clean and smart Location was good Staff were helpful Fair choice for a continental breakfast 
217374,New Linden Hotel, Small room not suitable if spending a lot of time in the hotel Room also got quite hot even with window open although a fan was provided Would have liked full English breakfast, Reception staff very helpful nothing was too much trouble Handy location 5 minutes walk to Bayswater tube station 
217375,New Linden Hotel, Room description of luxury suite is over optimistic A blocked shower plug hole broken monsoon shower head frayed shower hose Silly and avoidable things that make the difference between recommending friends to stay here or wanting to return ourselves Come on New Linden Attention to Detail , Lovely staff clean hotel room good location for the sights of Nottinghill Tube and bus a short pleasant walk 
217376,New Linden Hotel, Basement area and dining room a little tired and neglected Poor breakfast Mouldy bread dusty cereals and Luke warm tea and coffee , Very comfy bed but room not a suite as marketed Reception staff really helpful and friendly really quiet overnight as on side street Great location for Notting Hill restaurants and shopping 
217377,New Linden Hotel, Room was quite hot would have liked to be able to open the window but probably not practical for security reasons , Comfortable bed and spacious room Excellent range for breakfast friendly helpful staff Fan in the room 
217378,New Linden Hotel, The room was to small for a couple but would be okay for a single if you don t mind sleeping in a basement, The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly
217379,New Linden Hotel, No air conditioning , The location is very good close to good bus routes The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful The rooms were small but comfortable 
217380,New Linden Hotel, The showers need a door or curtain in each room as the water goes all over the bathroom We heard this from numerous guests Small rooms and squeaky floors , Good location
217381,New Linden Hotel, For 200 a night this really isn t great Toilet roll holder span round not on the wall properly doors were very dated sink units coming away from the wall laminate flooring creaked everytime you walked on it and as you walked in dipped when walked on Paid for a luxury suite got a bed sofa and bathroom pretty standard in my opinion these days tea and coffee making facilities looked like they were from the 80 s as did the phone All round pretty shabby and dated , Location was good staff were friendly
217382,New Linden Hotel, The size of the room Location quite far from shopping centres bars and attractions Breakfast continental offered cooked breakfast not , Cleanliness of the room Free toiletries very lovely Very polite staff 
217383,New Linden Hotel, The standard double should not of been sold as a double The room is very cramped so cramped the double bed was pushed up against the wall meaning my husband had to climb over me to get in or out of the bed This is not good when needing to use the loo in the night The room was most definitely only big enough for a single bed , Friendly staff very clean room and hotel and the breakfast had a good enough choice 
217384,New Linden Hotel, Room was small but reflected well in the price, Excellent location close to shops and restaurants Walking distance to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park Loved the little outdoor terrace accessed through the window quirky Breakfast was excellent for a continental style and plenty to eat
217385,New Linden Hotel, Small rooms A bit pricey for what you get Not licensed to sell alcohol, Convenient location Easy transport links Close to a number of good restaurants
217386,New Linden Hotel, I was disappointed with the breakfast and service Was expecting a hot breakfast and the staff at the kitchen didn t seem friendly Well smile at all times makes a big difference The food choices were limited and was average , I walked into the reception and I was received by a fantastic lady at the reception She was extremely kind and helpful The room was small but it was extremely comfortable and had everything I required I was amazed at the view it was a street view but I could watch the sunrise from my bed Fantastic location ten minutes walk to Bayswater tube station Had good restaurants cafes and stores close by Extremely pleased with my stay except for the breakfast 
217387,New Linden Hotel, Everything was dirt and poor quality Not a 4star quality, It was the worst sleep ever every time I moved the bed moved as was on wheel on a wooden floor side bed lamps didn t work on both sides so had to turn on main light when needed to go to bathroom no nets so people could see in no privacy unless you closed the heavy duty curtains room was suppose to be an executive room had no fridge or mini bar just tea and coffee room was not clean would never stay there again 
217388,New Linden Hotel, Very Dissapointed with this hotel actually The bed was very poor and had wheels underneath It moved about during the night and that s pretty dangerous in my opinion I woke up one morning and the bed had moved from the wall with my head hanging at the edge all because the bed was not secure Also the quality of the mattress was poor Secondly the floor was not very stable I felt like I was going to fall through the floor I know it sounds stupid but these things are important when stopping in a hotel of a standard like this 4 star No way is this up to the srandard of a 4 star In terms of health and safety this hotel is a little risky and I wouldn t recommend it to anyone , The receptionist but that was about it Location not too bad 
217389,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast room a bit small when everyone arrives at same time , Breakfast good tho busy at certain times so a bit cramped room obviously been upgradred recently so nice if small quite at night but a bit noisy once breakfast starts overall would definately stay again 
217390,New Linden Hotel, The room was quite small but functional Because the bed was on caster s every time I turned the bed started to slide across the floor The shower could have a non slip mat , The breakfast was better than I thought it would be 
217391,New Linden Hotel, No Mini Bar or water in the room , Fantastic stay at the hotel Excellent friendly and efficient staff check in in less than 3 minutes Very comfortable beds 
217392,New Linden Hotel, There was alot of stuff left in corridors bikes hoovers and timber There was a garden which would of been lovely to sit out in the evening sun but hadn t been cleaned for a while rubbish on floor tables hadn t been cleaned in a while Didn t appreciate the maids just walking in our room in morning without even knocking Would of been nice if there was a bar in hotel but pub 2 min walk away , The room was lovely and clean really spacious and comfortable 
217393,New Linden Hotel, Not so much luxery over the room called Luxury room besides 2 sincks in the bathroom Room located in ground floor so don t think this is luxery when everybody passing can see into the room , Nice and kindly staff Good location 
217394,New Linden Hotel, Rooms are ridiculously small our bed was not even long enough for me I m only 1 67cm tall and you could only enter from one side It s nearly impossible to shower without flooding the bathroom The walls are SO thin you can hear every word said outside of the room or even in rooms nearby and every door slammed every person walking past making it nearly impossible to sleep It didn t help that cleaning starts at 8 30 and staff knock on your door at 9am on a Sunday asking to clean the room Breakfast only has a very limited choice ham is cut into 1cm thick pieces nothing warm except hard boiled eggs When in the UK I would ve loved a British breakfast with baked beans and bacon but I guess for the price it s just not what you get , Location is good especially for the price nice neighbourhood and great Indian restaurant in the street Our room had a little balcony which was a nice surprise Staff at breakfast is really helpful and friendly 
217395,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was quite limited and the staff in the breakfast room were not as nice as the staff on reception Few pieces in the room a little out dated, Room size was good and location easy to get around Staff helpful and cheery Hotel very quiet 
217396,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, It met my requirements for an inexpensive safe and clean night away from home between business meetings in London There are plenty of eateries a few yards away and Notting Hill Gate tube is a pleasant 5 minute walk
217397,New Linden Hotel, Was a little tricky to find once you got off the bus all surrounding streets looked the same, Nice quiet hotel very clean comfortable and nice selection for breakfast
217398,New Linden Hotel, Room was very small standard double shower floor drain was not working Soundproofing was poor between the rooms , Location was good Gluten free bread at breakfast 
217399,New Linden Hotel, Very small room for an executive double and being on the top floor with low slanted ceiling meant a lot head collisions Lots of banging around in the early morning , Location was great and value for money Clean room 
217400,New Linden Hotel, Price has always to reflect quality The room was very small at the back side on the ground floor My room was supposed to have a bath besides this was the reason that I finally booked at New Lindens but there was only a shower canine This room can t cost 100 , Friendly staff
217401,New Linden Hotel, Not typical English breakfast , Perfect location Beautiful neighborhood 5mn walking to Bayswater station 20 mn commution from King s Cross Kindness and availability of the staff Highly recommended place 
217402,New Linden Hotel, no sound isolation at all people on the outside can here literary everything you re doing in the room i bit too far from the nearest tube station , nice and clean friendly staff good wifi a nice nearby pub
217403,New Linden Hotel, Advertised as a 4 star hotel This may have been the case in the 80s but not now Very disappointing breakfast very little choice and green tea not an option Suitcase left at end of stay to be picked up later was just left in a communal room and could have been taken by anyone Would not recommend this hotel , The beds were very comfortable and bed linen clean and crisp
217404,New Linden Hotel, Room was very small but then it is London , Good location 5 mins from Tube Friendly staff who offered maps and directions to the tube Restaurants etc 
217405,New Linden Hotel, The only window wouldn t remain open and with the sun shining directly into the room made it very warm a little fresh air would be a welcome I inadvertently left a charger in the room On asking if they would return by post they wanted a fee of 5 00 plus postage costs which I thought was unreasonable Would have been happy to pay postage and reasonable package but 5 is not reasonable for a small package, Staff very friendly and accommodating Good breakfast All in all good value
217406,New Linden Hotel, The room was far too small for a double bed I had to climb down to get out or climb over my husband and we had no where to put our clothes no chest or shelves in a tiny wardrobe with few hangers we had to live out of the suitcase was a bit odd not having a shower curtain so water splashes all over floor , We liked the area staff were very good and friendly breakfast was very good for a continental breakfast 
217407,New Linden Hotel, Noises from corridor and room facing our room door were really clearly heard into our room Fortunately there are not so many rooms per floor and our neighbours were noisy only few times but basically you could hear people talk with normal voice from the room facing your room doors were just opposite Still got good night sleep even I am a light sleeper since there was no other noise e g traffic noise even the hotel is facing the street , Good location quiet neighborhood furnishings newish bathroom even larger that we have normally seen in London hotels breakfast also better than expected compared to others very friendly service Definetely could come again 
217408,New Linden Hotel, Do not let the hotel call you a cab Its twice as expensive as taking a black cab on the street The room was freezing and no way to turn up the heat Breakfast really poor, The price was good
217409,New Linden Hotel, Very thin walls watery coffee absolutely no hot water in the shower , Very comfy bed Good size room for the price Nice scents throughout corridors Standard buffet weak coffee
217410,New Linden Hotel, Standard room limited in size but not unusual for central London , Generous continental breakfast replenished quickly Boutique feel non standard room layouts 
217411,New Linden Hotel, Our beds slid across the floor when we sat up and the floor creaked terribly whenever we walked on it This made for very noisy trips to the loo waking up my wife and daughter Not sure if we were just unlucky with room 209 , Good bathroom with nice shower 
217412,New Linden Hotel, Our room was poor it was situated so that you had to walk through the breakfast area to access it The corridor to our room was also where the cleaners cupboard was so was regularly blocked with washing products etc making it hard to get to the room , The location was good and was near the underground
217413,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Staff was very friendly and helpfull Room was clean and comfy Neighborhood is calm and fancy Modern elevator Continental breakfast with enough diversified choices 
217414,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The location absolutely perfect for central London beautiful small friendly hotel excellent reception staff miles better than the big chain hotel groups cheaper with breakfast included 
217415,New Linden Hotel, The double bed consisted of two beds pushed together which slid apart the whole night The room was cold and tiny and the shower had no curtain so the bathroom became soaked when one tried to have a shower It was also a lovely day and we weren t allowed out onto the balcony because they were re oiling the decking Only good points were that staff were friendly and breakfast was included ,No Positive
217416,New Linden Hotel, Soundproofing notable for its absence room rather small shower water seemed to stay at a temperature independent of the controls the water drained very slowly from the wash hand basin , Obliging staff with 24 hour reception Good location close to tube stations and shops The continental breakfast was more than adequate There was even a balcony and the bed was very comfortable 
217417,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Great Hotel in a convenient location Staff very friendly and helpful Room was spacious and very comfortable Breakfast was great considering it was included in the price Excellent value for money Would stay again 
217418,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Great location very clean room with toiletries beautiful balcony and the staff was kind and willing to help us in any inquiry that we had Breakfast was satisfying I will visit this hotel again 
217419,New Linden Hotel, Lots of laundry bags by the stairs made it look a bit messy although it was generally clean and tidy And it s probably not appropriate for whoever to hang up cycling gear to dry in the lounge , The bed was really comfy Very nice large bathroom with large bath in the executive room And very clean With breakfast included made this really good value for money and there was a very good choice of breakfast food 
217420,New Linden Hotel, Very small rooms and en suite not even enough room to walk around the bed to get in had to climb over Shower very small too Experienced other difficulties but not fair to say more if proven that the blame lies elsewhere Would rather pay more for decent size room, Location
217421,New Linden Hotel, Took a bit of finding, Lovely hotel clean room with nice decoration Location good near shops took a bit of finding but neighbood friendly Breakfast very good and staff Would stop again
217422,New Linden Hotel, Small rooms difficult to use the shower as there is no screen or curtain and impossible to have a shower without getting hair wet Water everywhere Rooms were warm in March Very noisy could hear people in hallway lift and other rooms , Clean good location friendly staff
217423,New Linden Hotel, 10 30 check out The beds had wheels on them so you could find yourselves half way cross the room , Location lovely hotel Breakfast was nice
217424,New Linden Hotel, Main problem was the size of the room it was all a bit cramped Additionally there was no lamp or ambient lighting in the room a bit of a mood killer and the temperature kept getting a little high, The area is very safe and not too far from some decent restaurants The breakfast was a solid continental and the shower and bathroom were of excellent quality Sounds strange but the complimentary toiletries were really nice too a bespoke brand I ve not seen before I came out smelling much better than when I came in 
217425,New Linden Hotel, this hotel doesnt deserve to be 4 stars my double room bed was so bad 2 twin be put together with gap in the middle the room is very small tv doesnt work the room light are the worst light ive met i couldnt sleep for 4 nights walls were very thin can hear everyone footsteps this should be 1 or 2 stars hotel , only thing i like about hotel was the location was close to central london the staff were friendly
217426,New Linden Hotel, The room was very very small no shower curtain in the bathroom so water spreads all over the place , Located in a nice area with some pubs and shops Only 5 minutes walk to Bayswater underground station Hyde Park and Portobello Road also close Clean room ok breakfast friendly and helpful receptionist lady 
217427,New Linden Hotel, There is nothing I didn t like , The Linden Hotel is great value for money Very friendly staff very clean and just refurbished to a high standard I couldn t believe the continental breakfast was included in the cost We will definitely book there again 
217428,New Linden Hotel, My room was a Standard Double Room and I although it s the cheapest option and I understand that is not the best room type the fact that is immediately in the next door of the breakfast room is terrible A lot of noise from 06 30am , The location was great Close to the subway 5 minutes walking and the Portobello market 
217429,New Linden Hotel, Shower area is so small wet floor after each shower , Breakfast is reasonable nice personal whole hotel Quiet and nice area with lots of restaurant around Easy to access by public transport
217430,New Linden Hotel, The room although was good and confortable it was in the basement with a very small window facing a wall in the level of the floor , The room was good the bed confortable there was absolutly no noise during all night what was great Breakfast is OK The best about this hotel is the location super central and in a pretty and safe area 
217431,New Linden Hotel, Bathroom could have been a little cleaner tiles needed a bit of a scrub , Friendly check in and a place to leave your luggage 2 minutes from bus stop or 8 minutes to tube 
217432,New Linden Hotel, No Full English breakfast Staff cleared up breakfast things before we had chance to finish Although they did apologise, Very nice stay Most things perfect 
217433,New Linden Hotel, The room is a little bit small but clean , Dimitri is The best person inside the hotel He gives us all the information that we need I can say Dimitri for president of The hotel please Seriously Dimitri if you read this you are AMAZING 
217434,New Linden Hotel, I got a room in Basment 1 room 09 in same time next room 10 has some mantance work which made a noise early morning also it is not fair the check out at 10 30 am where there some hotel next to them has normal check out at 12, it was good location but not close to main street or metro station Also the reception staff keep Changing and not look so professional in deal with guest cleaning is ok and the Breakfast is good 
217435,New Linden Hotel, A shower curtain would stop the rest of the bathroom from getting damp whilst the shower is in use , Excellent value for money The bedroom was reasonably sized for our need The heating was good as well
217436,New Linden Hotel, The way the breakfast staff spoke to a lady who s child was crying they told her to shut it up , The reception staff were extremely helpful and very nice The bed was a fantastic size and very comfy 
217437,New Linden Hotel, Sound proofing not good 3pm argument next door , Situation close to city centre good sized room friendly staff reasonable breakfast and value 
217438,New Linden Hotel, The rooms were quite small and the breakfast was quite basic When I entered the hotel to check in the person at the front desk was chatting with his friend and was swearing and joking even when i was standing there waiting Unbelievable , The bed was very comfortable and it was near the underground station Bayswater and Queensway and had many restaurants near by It was also walking distance from Hyde Park Wifi was included and was quite fast 
217439,New Linden Hotel, Soft bed no curtain at the shower Could do with a better breakfast Noise from the other rooms Poor room equipment , I got a good price for one night and staff at the reception was really nice and helpfull Hard to say basing on one night but I doubt I would like to stay here for a longer period Not really a 4 hotel 
217440,New Linden Hotel, Decor and fittings in luxury suite looking a bit tired particularly in bathroom I have stayed a few times in the past but would not upgrade to luxury in future , Reception staff v friendly and the restaurant staff kept the dinning room clear and well stocked Baggage store great idea Great location would recommend and will be returning 
217441,New Linden Hotel, Dear Sir madam I am writing to complain about my stay in your hotel on the 22nd and 23rd of February room 14 It was an implied term of our contract that the accommodation provided would be of a good standard and reasonable quality However there was no warm water and I stayed without a shower over my stay in your hotel Although I have complained to the reception but nothing was done As such I would like to be compensited for the above reason mentioned above I will require a response at your earliest convenience please Yours sincerely Salah,No Positive
217442,New Linden Hotel, Unfortunately couldn t get a phone signal in the basement room a minor gripe , Excellent rooms and great location hard to beat in the area Continental breakfast very good

217444,New Linden Hotel, First room number 14 on ground floor near lift very noisy changed to second room 403 had a shower room like a dolls house , Location good walking distance to three tube stations plenty of nearby pubs and reastaurants Breakfast lovely 
217445,New Linden Hotel, The kitchen staff were not very polite or friendly didn t help with what we needed talking about people while others could hear them dirty looks passed from them overall not very pleasant which is a shame as the rest of the staff were lovely , The reception staff were really friendly and helped with whatever we needed 
217446,New Linden Hotel, Bed was very short for people 1 75m Rooms are a bit noisy Breakfast room could use an upgrade to make you feel more at home , Cosy and clean rooms very friendly and helpful staff perfect location near Notting Hill and Kensington Gardens 
217447,New Linden Hotel, Had to have the window opened all night due to heating that would not go off Despite telling staff no solution to this , Good location reasonable price
217448,New Linden Hotel, The room was incredibly warm We opened the window on arrival but had to close when it was time to sleep It made sleeping quite difficult , The breakfast was really lovely and there was a lot of it 
217449,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast could be slightly improved in variety , Great location very friendly staff and pretty new rooms with nice bathrooms They also have cosy single rooms which are perfect for business stays 
217450,New Linden Hotel, Room was on the small side but considering the price i cant really moan and it did have a balcony , The staff were excellent we saw three diffrent staff and each of them knew London extremely well in every aspect The feel of the hotel is very cosy and welcoming 
217451,New Linden Hotel, Situated a little bit far from the underground no bars or restaurants in the neighborhood the rooms their equipment are quite old no hot water in the morning, Staff is very friendly historical neighborhood 
217452,New Linden Hotel, Floors were too noisy , Staff were really nice and polite Location perfect in a quite neighborhood near Nottingham hill and Hyde park Rooms and breakfast just nice but at least it has breakfast in room price 
217453,New Linden Hotel, Breakast without anything warm and everyday the same menu , Excellent localisation very helpfull and friendly staff As for this price really nice place 
217454,New Linden Hotel, The luggage storage room was literally Harry Potter s cupboard under the stairs it was self service The lift was a little quirky in not serving levels based on first come first serve Location to Bayswater and Notting Hill stations not as short a stroll as advertised , Breakfast had limited spread but the croissants were awesome Staff was friendly in general Bed linens and towels were clean Housekeeping does a good job 
217455,New Linden Hotel, It would have been good to have more facilities such as a bar or mini bar in the room The ceiling was thin and I could hear the noise from the upstairs room guest walking around which was quite loud But it wasn t a real problem at all , Friendly staff clean room clean sheets 
217456,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast personal No good morning no smile , Location Very close everything Breakfast is good Room are a little bit small but was enought space very comfortable bed
217457,New Linden Hotel, Walls were a little thin so you could hear a lot but it didn t really matter to us could just hear chatting and footsteps , The room was simple but great value for money the location was great and staff were very helpful 
217458,New Linden Hotel, Room was small but as it was only myself ot wasnt a problem also the water in the shower was incredibly hot and very difficult to get a happy medium but that is being very picky, Great location but I do know the area well so that was ok for me Staff very accomadating when I got back past midnight I asked if it was possible to have a late check out and was told no problem 
217459,New Linden Hotel, I had a double with single occupancy Would be way too tight for two people small room with double bed even if comfortable , Bed was comfortable Really appreciated the generous supplies of tea coffee and milk in the room 
217460,New Linden Hotel, Last time I stayed I was given a room at the top Very small but had a table to put mt laptop and do some work This time they gave me a smaller room on the ground floor without table and chair and noisy with a boiler pump I complained and they only available space with a table was in the basement without being able to open a window for fresh air , Its convenient and reasonable overall Certainly Not for a 4 star hotel as advertised 
217461,New Linden Hotel, The room was poorly ventilated and warm And the shower was so small the whole bathroom turned into a wet mess when taking a shower Very slippery and dangerous I found this very dissapointing When I called the reception about this I got the answer Yes we know this happens Well this is how the building is structured Not customer friendly if you ask me Also the breakfast was too basic for a 4 star hotel , I liked the cleanliness and location the most and the croissants at breakfast
217462,New Linden Hotel, We felt that the rooms were over heated otherwise no other disappointments, Comfort and clean room with clean towels every day Also the staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay 
217463,New Linden Hotel, TV was at a funny angle so difficult to view from in bed The shower cubicle was quite high up with a step There was a shelf at the top of the bed on the wall which I kept worrying I would hit my head on while walking round the room Room was compact which some might not like I was travelling solo so it suited me very well , The view from my room on the third floor was great The quality of bedding lovely thick egyptian cotton sheets Bathroom nice and modern The price of the room was fantastic for the area The location was fantastic lots of restaurants nearby Portobello Road about ten mins walk Bayswater tube nearby Very quiet square so good night s sleep guaranteed Nice and warm Cosy room felt secure and well decorated Breakfast was great lots of choice of continental breads pastries croissants boiled eggs ham cheese fresh fruit salad dates three choices of cereal three fruit juices coffee and tea
217464,New Linden Hotel, Nothing at all, Staff were great check in hungarian lady was so nice and helpful went above and beyond Breakfast was great boiled eggs loved it Hotel was good will stay again
217465,New Linden Hotel, We could here the neighbors talk or cough in the attenant room , The team was very friendly with a special mention to Dimitri that was extremely helful and nice to us The hotel is very well situated with different bus or tube stations nearby It is really near Nottinghill Gate and Portobello Road but not in a touristic street There s a bar nearby full of local people very appreciable The beds were very comfortable the shower was huge with many jets of water The breakfast was good with fresh fruits and fresh orange juice 
217466,New Linden Hotel, Very very small room Breakfast was not spectacular Good value for money, Very good location Very clean Quiet Breakfast included Very friendly and helpful staff
217467,New Linden Hotel, Sound insulation is a little bad I could hear my neighbors well into the middle of the night even though they weren t really speaking loudly But overall it was a great hotel would love to go back , Beautiful and clean hotel with very friendly staff 
217468,New Linden Hotel, We had twin beds it would have been useful to have a bedside table , A hassle free experience very helpful reception Comfy beds and decent size room Excellent shower very warm room Free access to the Internet 
217469,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a lovely area with Notting Hill Gate Tube Station only a short walk away The inclusive breakfast was wonderful and top marks for the way in which it was presented 
217470,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Pleasant surprise when in london we always stay in bayswater area first time staying at this hotel and definitely a great choice we made The ambience the friendly staff and location made our stay really enjoyable 
217471,New Linden Hotel, There is no chance to sleep You can hear everything from the next room and they were cleaning the rooms at 9 am Very noisy If you want to relax don t stay there , Good location Nice staff 
217472,New Linden Hotel, Cramped room twin bed as double Lacking space in breakfast room , Breakfast was very good location was great lots of shops and restaurants nearby Clean room 
217473,New Linden Hotel, We booked a double but what we got instead was two single beds pushed together There were no fastenings on the bed s base so they moved a lot which created a large gap in the middle In our opinion the room was far too small to even be used as a double anyway and technically with two singles pushed badly together it was NOT the double room we thought we were getting or what we paid for The shower had no curtain or door and so water just flooded the entire floor which meant the mat was continusously sopping wet , Very helpful staff one young man on the desk was particularly helpful when we had to print some tickets We were able to leave our bags for the day when we checked in early and when we checked out which was very useful Our room and bathroom were both clean Location very convenient 
217474,New Linden Hotel, Room had a strange smell to it and wasn t very comfortable Bathroom sink not clean Very noisy cleaners other guests creaking floor boards Breakfast not too appealing but it is included in the room rate, Excellent location friendly staff
217475,New Linden Hotel, Extremely small the double room was small and I was travelling solo Cleanliness could be greatly improved as it could the breakfast room and selection , Recently refurbished modern hotel Nice location 
217476,New Linden Hotel, The walls are very thin and unfortunately I had noisy neighbours that kept me up until 2am then woke me again at 4am when they were checking out I m guessing You could also hear every door shutting , Not too far away from tube stations Small but nice room
217477,New Linden Hotel, The room 110 was extremely small Also there was no shower curtain hence water flooded onto the bathroom floor , Friendly staff acceptable standard breakfast with plenty of food Within easy 6 7 minute walk from Bayswater tube station 
217478,New Linden Hotel, No toiletries in room Room very small despite booking suite we were given a double Extremely creaky floor in our room one above ours which kept us awake as guests above arrived very late could be heard chatting unpacking Lots of noise from housekeeping staff early in morning, Good location comfy bed
217479,New Linden Hotel, Nothing, Excellent location great choice for breakfast very tastefully furnished and above all brilliant value for money Will go again and recommend to friends 
217480,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was very disappointing check out time a bit early 10 30 , Great location Room was a bit small but fine staff was friendly and good wifi Also great bed and towels 
217481,New Linden Hotel, The rooms will either be facing a noisy road in the front or a building site in the rear Windows are leaking and therefore very cold during the night Breakfast served in the basement is just terrible, The room had a good size The hotel is near to Notting Hill
217482,New Linden Hotel, Only thing was there was some kind of fan or vent going on and off all the time Not too noisy but a little vexing , Lovely quiet location but very convenient for shops and restaurants Staff were friendly and helpful Room was excellent value for money spacious clean and comfortable Huge towels too 
217483,New Linden Hotel, We have booked for 2 nights When we arrive around 20 00 they have gave us a room which was 1 floor under The heating was not working as also the TV When we told them about the problems the receptionist who was in the afternoon shift has replied that he will take care of it When we came back after 3 hours nothing was working too When I call the reception again the afternoon shift had left and the night shift came and fix the problems The only point which measure to my opinion to rate the hotel with a better rate than zero was this guy who was very helpful After our complaints they moved us to a higher level 1st floor next day but a very smaller room Thank god next day we left early in the morning The fotos in booking com are not even close to the reality , Cleanliness
217484,New Linden Hotel, I d suggest to introduce more variety as for the breakfast some warm food would be nice , I can recommend this hotel because of its good location helpful and kind staff and also due to the fact it was always clean and warm 
217485,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, Room was very clean and neat it was little bit small but it was exactly what we needed as we were only sleeping there and wandering the town the whole day It was great that we could leave our luggage in the special room after check out and use the last day for visiting London withoutc carying all the stuff 
217486,New Linden Hotel, Failed to change soiled bed linen even put soiled sheets back onto wrong bed Breakfast staff couldn t understand English No hot water in restaurant or means to make fresh tea tea from urn was undrinkable Asked for hairdryer on first morning nothing arrived Asked again same day at reception and was assured one would be in room on our return but nothing arrived Asked again on 2nd morning Reception came to room to look in wardrobe Then handyman finally arrived with hair dyer at 9 30 and asked to look in wardrobe again No bar, Comfortable bed and no noise Helpful front of house Location
217487,New Linden Hotel, Mattress not comfortable but rest of room lovely Also toilet bowl not completely clean , Nice attractive room was upgraded for free to executive breakfast very nice 
217488,New Linden Hotel, The bed was at an angle going up a slope in a tiny room You could put a marble on the floor and it would roll to the other side of the room Also the breakfast is awful Its not an English breakfast , Nothing really
217489,New Linden Hotel, Sister in law who was with us had overheated room on basement with no ventilation and where wifi only worked if the door was open I really think basement rooms should be a thing of the past , Great location not far from Paddington lots of good restaurants and places to walk Comfortable room with windows that open Very responsive staff 
217490,New Linden Hotel, A small complaint the bathroom is very small and the shower doesn t have a curtain a tiled corner unit maximising space which means that everything in the bathroom gets soaked when you take a shower , Great location in an interesting area staff were very friendly and offered help with sightseeing etc The room was small but quite comfortable 
217491,New Linden Hotel, Would have liked to have been a bit nearer to tube station s , Very handy for Portobello road Kensington gardens etc Room small but clean and well presented Good continental breakfast 
217492,New Linden Hotel, A tiny tiny bathroom in a very hot room with no temperature control The bed was two twins together that weren t fixed and kept moving apart The room was so noisy as it was at the front and single glazed I didn t sleep at all, The staff are great
217493,New Linden Hotel, My only gripe was no cooked breakfast , Booked a last minute 1 night stay Great location stylish cosy room V comfortable bed Staff were friendly helpful 
217494,New Linden Hotel, Small Basement Room did not reflect grandeur portrayed on photos Was offered 2 others all of similar appearance, Relatively convenient to Central London Short discuss by public transport
217495,New Linden Hotel, There was noisy building work going on outside but to be fair that was outside of the hotel s control and the noise didn t start until 9am , Quiet location but only 10 minutes walk from the tube station Very friendly helpful staff Very clean and comfortable 
217496,New Linden Hotel, The executive room is large and nicely equipped but extremely noisy as it is facing the road and you can hear cars as well as people , Located within 10 minutes of leisure walk from the metro Bayswater 
217497,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is situated in a quiet area but only a few streets away there is an array of public houses restaurants and shops and close to a tube station the hotel maintains a high standard of cleanliness and my husband and I enjoyed the continental breakfast on offer the only down side was we did not get chance to chill out on the lovely decking area at the rear of the hotel perhaps next time 
217498,New Linden Hotel, I would not recommend the breakfast The dining room is very small Continental breakfast on offer is not worth 10 Better value for money to go out and purchase full English for less money at many local eateries , Excellent location in Notting Hill Tube Kensington and Buckingham Palaces within walking distance Restaurants and shops close by Staff very helpful and pleasant We had noise from upstairs room and were moved the next day no quibbling whatsoever Lovely small bijou hotel clean and comfortable room 
217499,New Linden Hotel, The room was too small not the cleanest The first night we found the window wide open It was extremely cold in the room and there were 3 or 4 flies in the room , I liked the location and the furniture in our room Also the breakfast was pretty good 
217500,New Linden Hotel, The room size is too small and slim and the hardwood floor was very annoying No work are Just a small table to barely hold the coffee tray Bathroom design was very inappropriate , Location was not far from attractions and shopping areas Availability of shuttle bus to airport Quite and comfortable sleep 
217501,New Linden Hotel, Extremely noisy at night woken up at midnight by laundry collection staff all shouting to each other When I rang Reception they just said oh that s the laundry collection as though shouting at midnight just outside the rooms was acceptable ,No Positive
217502,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was poor Staff at breakfast was awe full others were fine My room was next to reception so it was a bit noisy I was never able to shower It was either boiling or freezing, No pork items on breakfast which is almost a must for visitors into the UK
217503,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast team was not particularly welcoming Did not even say hello and carried on with their own breakfast , Very friendly welcome at reception Was upgraded from a single room to a very small but well appointed king size bed room which I really appreciated 
217504,New Linden Hotel, Beds are on wheels Bed sheets were uncomfortable don t think it was worth 108, Beds are on wheels Bed sheets were uncomfortable don t think it was worth 108
217505,New Linden Hotel, Bathroom a little small a tall person would have a problem in shower , Staff helpful friendly welcoming and good local knowledge about tube service and bus numbers Always had a smile and to be honest could not do enough to help 
217506,New Linden Hotel, Tiny room No iron facilities in room, Room was a bit of a disaster initially Couldn t swing a cat in it Got changed to nicer room but still limited Great location tho for exploring Very comfy bed too 
217507,New Linden Hotel, I was in a room on the lower floor and it was horrible During the day the room smelled like cigarette smoke from the builders working in the hotel They used the fire escape next to my room 4 to have their smoke breaks During the night there was a lot of noise from what sounded like an ice machine , The staff is very friendly and helpful 
217508,New Linden Hotel, Room was in the basement of the hotel It was extremely noisy above the room at times In the morning there was a staff member being given a dressing down outside my door , Staff were friendly and answered questions about the area and facilities 
217509,New Linden Hotel, Nothing to complain about We got a room on the bottom so we had no view at all but we only stayed at the hotel for sleeping, Good location Near underground Small room but clean and very comfortable beds Breakfast ok
217510,New Linden Hotel, The shower in room 110 was impossible to use without flooding the bathroom floor and soaking the toilet poor design, Convenient location within walking distance of Paddington close to hyde park and museums and Bayswater tube Staff very helpful 
217511,New Linden Hotel, only issue we had was breakfast we went down to eat and there were no tables more like a canteen atmosphere and we didn t have time to wait for a table so we left, staff very friendly and room was lovely
217512,New Linden Hotel, The first night we had a very small room but was changed a the day after , Free Wi Fi and the quality of the Wi Fi was superb Breakfast was very good and the housekeepers cleaned well everyday Location was very close to oxford street and the staff were great receptionists were very nice

217515,New Linden Hotel, Nothing, This was our second stay here and we were upgraded to a lovely modernised room still with all the best features of an older property big windows high ceilings etc but with a new bathroom with rain shower etc Before we left we relaxed in the glamorous lounge and were offered a cup of tea by the marvellous staff 
217516,New Linden Hotel, The television did not work The rooms need updating General cleanliness and presentation was not up to the expected standard , The location was excellent
217517,New Linden Hotel, Shower cubicle was dirty and moldy didn t like being in a basement room with a brick wall for a view, Good location front desk staff friendly helpful
217518,New Linden Hotel, The room we got was sooo tiny Standard double room literally have only bed and some space to move between the window and bathroom I though people were exaggerating here but they are not Beds are on the wheels If you are small it will not affect you but if you weight 80kgs the bed will move every time you turn around The shower is also very small I struggled to move there and I am tiny person The standard rooms are nothing like on the pictures we felt claustrophobic in the room and you cannot call it 4 never met as small rooms and I travel a lot The balcony was nice however we shared it with our neighbours and because we had table and chairs in front of our window they just sat there making us feel really uncomfortable No privacy To be truthful I expected much more for that price and from the hotel that is classified as 4 Luckily we were staying there only 2 nights in other case we would have gone to another hotel as for this price I am sure we could get a room in some 3 hotels and the standard of the rooms would ve been higher and we wouldn t feel like caged animals Overall very average for standard double room , The staff was really nice and the location was good A lot of pubs and restaurant around
217519,New Linden Hotel, I do not have a bad word to say except it is a bit out of the way The train station was a bit of a walk away , We booked this hotel for carnival but had booked the room accidentally for the day ahead the receptionist was very helpful and changed the dates for us as we checked in she even upgraded the room and put us in the honeymoon suite for no additional cost Room was very nice had a jacuzzi bath with sexy lightening and a balcony Large variety of food for breakfast it is a continental breakfast though Bed felt like heaven I would definitely come back if I am back in London again 
217520,New Linden Hotel, Floor was so squeaky you were afraid to walk on it and it didn t look clean The bed moved when you sat on it and the taxi they ordered was very overpriced , The staff were friendly 
217521,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, This hotel was a real delight Some unexpected and lovely touches made even my quite small room comfortable and everything I needed for my stay Well done 
217522,New Linden Hotel, Room 303 is very small no workspace storage in the bathroom and due to construction very noisy during the day starting at 8 am , Great location many restaurants cafe s and shops Close to Hyde Park Buckingham Palace Oxford Street Kensington High Street Portabello Market and Notting Hill Gate 
217523,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, This hotel is very good value for London It s in a great location The staff were super friendly especially Ben who was on reception when we came in after a late night I would recommend staying here 
217524,New Linden Hotel, Tiny room Water came from room above through lights which is dangerous Windows falling apart , Wifi good and continental breakfast fair Cheap for London 
217525,New Linden Hotel, Bed was dreadful The idea of joining two single mattresses in simply wrong Bed was very uncomfortable, Perfect location internet worked very well and staff were very helpful whenever anything was needed Yes I would stay again 
217526,New Linden Hotel, Squeezing a double bedroom into a space better suited to a single made the bathroom really tiny and the bathroom basin was so ridiculously small it was unusable without spilling water all over the floor, Clean great price for London good location and very helpful and friendly staff
217527,New Linden Hotel, Room in the basement Window facing wall and technicians or other prople getting in and out the room outside my window Not much space between bed and walls, Extremely polite and helpfull staff very tasty and well served breakfast nice and well equipped bathroom comfortable bed quiet good location
217528,New Linden Hotel, Room 10 Smoking area directly outside window Stinks Was woken up by staff coming to work at 3 45 am until about 4 30am Couldn t get back to sleep This room is on the basement floor Really do not recommend a basement room although I would definitely stay at the hotel again if I was guaranteed a room on a higher floor away from the lifts , Great decor Excellent location walking distance to tube The place looked very clean and welcoming 
217529,New Linden Hotel, Doesn t really have a lounge and there s no bar but the Greek Taverna down the road was excellent , Had quite a funky room on the first floor Nice big bed tall ceilings and a nice big full length window that opened onto a little terrace 
217530,New Linden Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel is very nice even if the nearest tube station is a circle line which needs more than one change to reach central zones The rooms are very small as usual in London but the bathroom is comfortable The atmosphere is slightly oriental The staff is very professional and polite Breakfast is continental and good quality
217531,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was ok but not the best I have eaten worse before , very nice staff they gave us a map and helped with useful tips We had a triple room which was absolutely perfect Not to small enough space for 3 people 
217532,New Linden Hotel, Hotel rooms are very small We booked a luxury suite but it was right next to the reception with look from the street We were moved the day after but the room was very small They told us that it was a luxury suite Our big boys had room in the basement next to the restaurant standard room Not nice Forget about eating breakfast at the hotel The staff is acidic when asking about something and there is not much choice The restaurant is also in the basement The fine roof terrace with wicker furniture as seen from booking com site exists but is not particularly cozy, Great service from the reception staff The staff told us immediately then we arrived how we could find the road from the hotel to the subway and the attractions we wanted to see etc 
217533,New Linden Hotel, Very small triple room Floor was so squeaky noisy in the room if one of us moved we all woke up Also an alarm had been set by previous occupiers so we also got woken up at midnight and again at 7 am When we told manager in the morning he was aware of the floor issue so why give us that room , The location was great for travelling around London Very quiet at night Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby Very nice breakfast provided 
217534,New Linden Hotel, Room was extremely small it was hard to fit my bags in the room Floor was dirty and sticky with dark black hairs on the floor in the bathroom Early morning builders making a lot of noise , Reception staff extremely helpful with travel advice maps and assistance Great location close to transport eating venues shops Shower head was amazing 
217535,New Linden Hotel, stayed in quad room a bit small for 4 people No air condition and it was very hot in August but there were 3 fans and not enough sockets, good location very friendly and helpful stuff
217536,New Linden Hotel, A no smoking room filled with cigratte smoke Attitude of the staff was appalling Someone just entered my room even when I replied to the door saying that I am changing My door was being knocked thrice since morning I was just too tired after flying for 9 hours and wanted to sleep but couldn t The blinds of the windows did not shut So everyone passing by my room could see me sleeping inside As I was half dead I just did not bother but it was the worst experience ever , Location
217537,New Linden Hotel, Room was in the basement so no view Was a bit stuffy fan provided but no air con But otherwise pleasant clean nice furnishings Definitely value for money Cooked breakfast would have been nice also my partner is allergic to pork and all the cold meats seemed to be pork based , Nice hotel decent location Friendly staff continental breakfast Quiet

217539,New Linden Hotel, Was very unimpressed with this hotel The room for us and the kids felt small when booking the photographer had used clever angles to suggest something much larger Very overpriced in my opinion but thats London i guess Room service was only available from 5pm to 1pm and had to pay upfront which to me is unusual Could not order fresh tea or coffee , It was clean
217540,New Linden Hotel, The view from my room was really bad I had to see construction area while I was staying at the hotel Everyone expect a certain level of service when you pay the cost However this hotel is really disappointing to my family even though i paid a lot , Only staff is good 
217541,New Linden Hotel, The double bed was two single beds on wheels which meant that it moved when we tried to sleep on it , I liked the location which was excellent right in the centre of everything
217542,New Linden Hotel, The basic double looked an ok size on the pictures but was absolutely tiny so we upgraded to a bigger room for more money which in my opinion should of been a standard one The shower was terrible you could hardly use it as it hit the wall rather than any part of you Also the breakfast was ok but there was always a wait for a table, The hotel was in a nice quiet location
217543,New Linden Hotel, Breakfast was fairly poor I would have liked the option not to pay for breakfast and get it at a local cafe , Gorgeously comfy bed and great location for me Fantastic that I could leave my luggage there during the day as check out was 10 30 am and I was spending whole day in london
217544,New Linden Hotel, Room was exceedingly small Literally a bed pushed to the wall and just enough room for a tiny desk No shower door or curtain meant water covered the bathroom floor Thin walls meant I heard the people in the next room whenever they moved , Free wifi friendly and helpful staff decent breakfast 
217545,New Linden Hotel, Really thick heavy curtains which didn t meet in the middle and didn t allow air to circulate through open windows no a c but had to be drawn for privacy Very mediocre breakfast , Good quiet location Room very clean
