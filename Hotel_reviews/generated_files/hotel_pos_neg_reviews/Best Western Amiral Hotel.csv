265062,Best Western Amiral Hotel, We had a short stay so can t make any bad comment , As soon as we arrived I explained to Antoine at the reception that I had read a ladies comments of a room with a balcony Immediately we were upgraded Very impressed with this Very clean room although we were missing a robe and slippers to get to the pool But all was not lost We didn t have breakfast as it was a little expensive for what you got We did have a bakery next door which made it easy to get croissants Would most definitely go back again The hotel was clean with easy access to other areas with the metro 2 mins away The maid we had cleaning the 5th floor was lovely even though there was a language barrier she was most helpful On our final morning the reception lady and I had a lovely chat about health in general very lovely young lady 
265063,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The breakfast hot food was cold Even with the heaters underneath Really wasn t nice and was 12 which was too expensive This should be included in the price, Reception staff were very helpfull room was comfortable
265064,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Room was robbed on the last night and the staff were not very helpful They wouldn t allow us to watch the CCTV footage from outside the room They are quite strict on who they let in so seems like the person who robbed us could have still been in the hotel But they didn t seem to care Seemed slightly suspicious Good access to trains and pool was nice at least ,No Positive
265065,Best Western Amiral Hotel,No Negative, We chose the property because of the parking We loved the location It was half a block from the metro that goes straight to the Louvre near lots of restaurants a nice wide street and best of all the front desk staff was always so nice and helpful There is also a street market right in front of the hotel two days a week Thursdays and Saturdays It s really a great place and I would stay there again We came back two more times and it was our favorite hotel 
265066,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The room phone did not work The shower head would not remain in place which made it difficult for my 6 2 husband to shower The hotel bar was not staffed and lacked a variety a beer wine ice etc for purchase Nor did they have ice There is a pool on site but towels were unavailable so you had to use your room towel Parking is available but it is tight , Breakfast was very good for a continental European breakfast They got their pastries fresh from the bakery next store On Sunday morning there was a lovely farmer s market 
265067,Best Western Amiral Hotel, They need a plumber The pop up in the bathroom sink didn t work in the room they assigned us and the desk person said they couldn t find anyone to fix it so they gave us another room However that one didn t drain again bathroom sink They just put some stuff down the drain and it worked for half a day , Friendly and knowlegeable staff except for one may be knew or part time Indoor pool and quiet garden in rear where our room was located Also Thursdays and Sundays is market time right in front of the hotel We bought fresh fruit and tomatoes Bakery and Metro stop nearby 
265068,Best Western Amiral Hotel,No Negative, I really appreciated the friendly and very helpful attitude of every member of staff The hotel is very clean and well presented and left a positive impression that will surely get me to book again with Best Admiral Hotels 
265069,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Getting in and out parking logistics are not ideal You need to park your car on the main street go check in and then you get the keys to the parking lot with a very tight entrance, Very good internet A lot of things at walking distance restaurants supermarket pharmacy cash machines etc 
265070,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Single rooms could ve been a bit cheaper, The swimming pool is big enough to swim In the breakfast staff a woman was lovely great breakfast not the typical one croissant thing that leaves you hungry
265071,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The parking is NOT free But on booking com its mentioned parking The Pool is also not with warm water and not clean so couldnt use the pool I would not go to this hotel again,No Positive
265072,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The reception was too small Wifi didn t always work in our bedrooms The breakfast was not adequate in variety and quantity There was not enough crockery The waiter had to wash our existing cutlery one morning We were at breakfast for 10 15am Breakfast finishes at 10 30am There were no crossionts no bread no eggs The waiter went to make some and bought back raw dough croissants The hotel is more like a 2 3 star , The bed was comfortable 
265073,Best Western Amiral Hotel, When I was booking online the hotel stated it has air conditioning however on arrival I was saddened to find out that the air conditioning in fact is seasonal which was not stated on booking com as I suffer from severe medical conditions which is terminal it s partial for me to have a room which has air conditioning if the weather is too hot I immediately wanted to leave the hotel and stay in alternative hotel which has air conditioning however I was unable to obtain a refund at the time because the manager was on holiday and would not be returning till Monday 10th of April This was extremely inconvenient as I had to share a room with two other adults and had a balcony so that I can remain cool and not get sick , The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful
265074,Best Western Amiral Hotel, more information on the parking the entrance to the car park is very tight and i couldnt get my car in there i drive a porsche cayenne and is no good i dont recommend it to guests with 4x4 cars , only the swimming pool
265075,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Evrth was great , I loved the location metro is very close nice neighborhood supermarket just next to the hotel Very cute swimming pool and quite a big room for Paris standards Good value for money 
265076,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Connecting rooms are not really child friendly had to keep the doors open by stuffing a towel underneath Noisy when you have a room next to the street One of the rooms smelt of cigarettes , Good for a weekend stay Close connection to subway and the swimming pool is great for the kids when its raining cats dogs Staff was very polite 
265077,Best Western Amiral Hotel, On the first day at breakfast they had run out of hot food and didn t replace it The room was not as we had ordered it I had trouble when I went to pay and check out at reception They had no cash and the guy couldn t add up We also booked a taxi with reception explaining our needs but the reception messed it up badly which resulted in a double fare and delays getting to the airport for our flight home We ended up flagging a taxi down in the street This made things stressful and spoilt the end of our break , We liked having the pool facility and although the room was small there was everything you needed Most staff were friendly and helpful 
265078,Best Western Amiral Hotel, To go to the pool we take a lift to 1 and that area is very dark with no lights at all That makes going to the pool abit scary at first Just some lights will be brilliant please , The staffs are excellent Very helpful Swimming pool is clean as well Thanks Didn t realised the hotel is close to Vietnamese town in Paris with lots of delicious pho Only found it on the last night of our stay 
265079,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Minor niggles with the room no plug in the sink and the room safe was locked shut when we arrived , The pool the bakery next door one side and the bar brasserie the other side Convenient for the Halle Georges Carpentier where we were competing in a fencing competition Close to the Metro
265080,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The location of the safe was in the toilet and it was just not convenient at all , The location is excellent as the metro station is only 2 minutes walk away so we were on and about Par s with no difficulty
265081,Best Western Amiral Hotel, I think the room and the balcony will need some reparations at some point nothing that could make your stay super uncomfortable though , The kindest and friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered Always quick to help and with big smiles on their faces My room was on the top floor and I had a cute balcony with an amazing view I had to sneak a peak on the other side of the floor for the Eiffel Tower though The swimming pool was a big plus 
265082,Best Western Amiral Hotel, towels werent regularly changed as requested the room service was poor the cleanliness level was poor as well ustensils used were left unchanged very bad for a 4 stars hotel so value for the price was not good at all i won t repeat my experience there , the receptionist was excellent named Nilse very professional knowing how to help travelers good in both french english very friendly helping very good location 100 m next to tolbiac station
265083,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Bed is not comfort and was makingnouce when turning Breakfast was not worth the money Hotel not 4 stats worth more 3 stars , Easy to get everywhere in Paris by metro Close to China town asian mistly Vietnamees 
265084,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Poor breakfast for 13 more Doesn t reach the Best Western standings to me , Close to the subway Parking 20 though Swimming pool 
265085,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Its a bit cheerless But ultimately good value My room was better for business than romance , They gave me a quiet room It was super quiet as if I was the only person in the hotel The staff were really helpful 
265086,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Very close to the underground Metro but not as close to the city centre as I thought However it was still in zone 2 and the trains were regular , The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and it was within a minutes walk from the Metro 
265087,Best Western Amiral Hotel, In the guest room one lamp was not in function and toilet seat broken Why no repair Breakfast was very simple for a Hotel of that category Not even a coffee machine Cheap orange Juice Staff left a cleaning brush on a guest table which Looks dirty Kitchen always open and that s not a nice view Staff listening to Music when working there This makes the Impression not professional Parking very expensive and must be ordered beforehand Ones pay for two days if sleeping one night although it is less than 24 hrs 2x20 , The pool A C very effective Room nicely decorated Metro Station very near subway 
265088,Best Western Amiral Hotel,No Negative, The room was a good size for Paris The staff were excellent The area is residential rather than touristy and has a village atmosphere There are Chinese and Thai restaurants nearby 
265089,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Even if I know this is Paris price feels a bit steep for a hotel in the 13th district which isn t exactly central , Rooms and hotel was very nice compared to other Paris hotels I ve been to nice entrance hall big swimming pool parking clean and modern rooms 
265090,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The location parking Everything The parking is crazy They hv a hole they call a parking lot that is just ridiculous Just don t go to this hotel I tell ya , We chose this hotel because it was one of the few with a pool However don t be fooled The pictures on the website are so old and does not give a true reflection I was miserable for the entire 3 days It s a 30 mins drive or more to the Center 
265091,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Internet went out ten minutes after arriving Two days of asking for it to be fixed led to being told I will tell the manager Was never fixed We used a cart to unload all of our luggage group of 7 and when we were leaving we were told there was no cart To top it off they tried to double bill me , Well it was a place to sleep surrounded by nice restaurants 
265092,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The staff missed one out of 8 wakeup calls The Metro was very close and we used it every day to go to the French Open or to the city center , The bed slept very well The hotel was located close enough to good and various choices of eating The staff was polite and helpful 
265093,Best Western Amiral Hotel, I don t like my room because it s a bit small If you travel with a young baby with pushchair like us please avoid the room 301 302 because those rooms share the same door It s so inconvenient when you have to open 2 heavy doors to get into your room In general I think the hotel doesn t deserve its 4 star grading , The location is very good since it is nearby Tobiac station and China town The swimming pool is great clean and nice The facilities are old but clean and enough for a 4 star hotel 
265094,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Breakfast wasn t worth the money of 15 per person , Overall the hotel was OK The bed was comfortable and our room had a balcony and the swimming pool although cold added a bit of luxury Breakfast was not great often ran out of food We had to pay extra for parking which increased our hotel expenses a great deal but the location was convenient as it was close to a metro 
265095,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Pool needs to be supervised better My wife slipped quite badly on the wet tiles , Good location a short walk from the tolbiac metro station Clean and reasonably good value for money Rooms wasn t the largest but had a nice private terrace at the rear of the room and the neighbours were playing piano quite well Good bar on the corner and Chinatown is only a 5 minute walk 
265096,Best Western Amiral Hotel, First we were offered a small room with a strong smell from smoking Only after complaint we were offered a much nicer room The pool is very nice but the fitness machines pictured in the hotel photos were not available Area around hotel is a bit run down with many beggars on the street , Pool was nice room was large and quiet Breakfast has very good choice and is recommended strongly Atmosphere of the hotel is very relaxed 
265097,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Very unfriendly women at the desk when we arrived to check in on Saturday afternoon First she made us wait before coming to the desk Is it so difficult to smile and just say welcome The rest of the staff was very nice and polite with us Not a 4 stars hotel many details and cleanliness could really be improved , The location and the swimming pool Good and comfortable bed We didn t try the breakfast 
265098,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The room is dirty the staff not speaking English most of the staff not helpful specially the young girl young black girl even doesn t want to smile, Location is great
265099,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Parking full had to park miles away and walk around Bed was noisy room quite small night reception staff was not really helpful I dont believe this is a 4 stars , The location is ok Late check in was appreciated Balcony in the room 
265100,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Female concierge was adequate but not as helpful as the male There was no explanation on how to exit hotel when desk was not being manned There was no iron or hairdryer when room description stated there would be Only one bath robe in a double room which was booked for two people , Male concierge was very friendly and helpful the free toiletries and sewing kit came in very useful Coffee station was pleasant with very nice coffee considering it was instant 
265101,Best Western Amiral Hotel,No Negative, Efficient staff very friendly and helpful Rooms cleaned to a high standard Adequate facilities swimming pool was great comfortable bed Good transport links Yummy breakfast
265102,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The elevator was sometimes slow and once it was out of order for a few hours The safe in our room couldn t be opened Maintenance staff was not able to fix it , The friendly staff at the desk and the breakfast room The view from the 7th floor where the rooms are larger than the standard rooms Our room had enough closet space for a two week stay The water was hot enough at any hour of the day 
265103,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Parking access too small for our car The pool could be a bit warmer to be enjoyable , No fuss elegant decor and functional room Big and comfortable bed Beautiful small swimming pool but a bit too chilly to hang around Clean overall Very close to transports and shops 
265104,Best Western Amiral Hotel, absolutely all was ok, i was in this hotel in May and it was for me travelling so often to Paris a real discovery thats why i have chosen it again i liked it very much staff spacious room with terrace i could look sunshine taking a cup of tea a swimming pool refreshing after dusty day superb breakfast i recommend again and again 
265105,Best Western Amiral Hotel, I did not like the location The hotel furnishing in both the common areas and the rooms were very dated and a little grim looking Fortunately I only stayed one night or it would have been depressing , There was a balcony off my room It was communal for smokers but nobody used it so it ended up being a nice perk If it had been heavily used by smoking guests it would not have been a bonus 
265106,Best Western Amiral Hotel, We are frequent travelers and experienced in several countries the Best Western chain This particular hotel was the worse of them all the staff was very unhelpful and even impolite the hotel room was very small and the facilities inside do not at all respect the standards of Best Western toilet seat was broken hairdryer was about to come undone the hotel room was dirty and had a strong smoking air very bad price quality ratio, the location access to a metro line connected to the centre of paris several facilities nearby lively area 
265107,Best Western Amiral Hotel, AC wasn t working for the first day and the safe needed a battery change and beeped all night because the night manager didn t realize what the problem was But we were upgraded the next day and the staff was very accommodating , Staff was great safe location clean rooms 
265108,Best Western Amiral Hotel, The swimming pool was too cold for us which was the main reason we booked so a little disappointing but we still had a lovely time , Lovely room helpful staff late check in and check out We really enjoyed our stay 
265109,Best Western Amiral Hotel, TV doesn t work City tax was not informed and should be included Swimming pool water is Cold Bed is hard , Staff are proff and helpful High class of service Nils is the best We will be back 
265110,Best Western Amiral Hotel, air con in our room was not working Hotel had no water at all in the taps showers or toilets when we woke up after our first nights sleep Did not get water back till approx midday Very inconvienant as we wanted to head into Paris city centre Hotel gave us complimentary breakfast which was good On departure I had to pay an additional 10euro for Paris city tax This was outlined in very small print on our booking Felt it should have been included in full booking fee , Good location and very near Tolbiac Metro Station Swimming pool in hotel very nice Rooms a good size Buffet breakfast excellent but expensive at 15e per person 
265111,Best Western Amiral Hotel, wifi didn t work well in my room and I needed to work in the lobby , the property was Very comfortable and stylish Nice bath great bed nice room overall 
265112,Best Western Amiral Hotel, no curtain in bathroom run down shower, Very friendly staff excellent location good breakfast that wll keep you going for quite a while better cofee please 
265113,Best Western Amiral Hotel, Reception recommendation of adjacent Cafe de Canon was inaccurate This restaurant bar was very expensive and food quality was poor , Conveniently located very closely to Tolbiac Place d Italie Metro stations bus stop Reception staff were extremely helpful 24 7 with Metro and tourist site advice Hotel room very clean and hotel facilities were good
