410636,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Included breakfast was fantastic more types of food than I could describe and really good too The hotel is right on the metro tram so you can go all over Amsterdam using a day pass which you can get at the hotel The hotel is a very short walk from the river boat docking area The room was huge by European standards and very big by US standards The internet was FAST but most of the TV channels were in German some in English 
410637,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Our flight leaving Amsterdam for Dubai did not leave till 8 00pm So we checked out as per the required time earlier in the last day We sat around for almost 5 hours waiting for our car to take us to the airport For people leaving the city a late checkout would be appreciated , The concierge was really helpful Made our stay very comfortable He knew what the recommended ways of travel and explained the ticket procedures for trams and trains for all the sites we tried to see We had earlier been advised to not use taxis because of their gross charges This was our first time in Amsterdam and Holland The restaurant on the first floor was also very good Excellent meals and service 
410638,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There is nothing to dislike about this outstanding location and property , Our upgraded room on the 19th floor had a spectacular view of the harbor and city We have stayed here before so expected superb room amenities and were not disappointed 
410639,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, The accessibility to the cruise terminal The ice creams The staff in the dining areas were very efficient We paid the extra to have an executive suite and access to the executive lounge which was fantastic 
410640,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, This is a First Class Hotel to join Cruises as it is Next to Passenger Terminal for Ocean Cruises and Just along from the River Boat Moorings The Staff are Super and Rooms are Superb with Complementary Mini Bar 
410641,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We had problems with both the initial booking credit card fully charged months early at time of booking when terms were to pay at property and with the initial allocated room due to excess elevator noise room was adjacent to elevator shaft with motor room above In fairness both problems were sorted promptly and appropriately as soon as hotel was notified Like so many hotels why provide expensive black out curtains and then have so many lights on electrical equipment in the room TV AV AC controls etc so that it is like having the Blackpool illuminations on in the room throughout the night Nothing better designed to rob the guest of a good sleep , Breakfast choice and quality excellent Location good outside immediate centre of Amsterdam but centre easily accessible by 15 20 minute walk or frequent tram to Central Station Hotel adjacent to Cruise Ship Passenger Terminal and very convenient for pre or post cruise stays but rooms priced accordingly 
410642,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Air conditioning was working all the time Even when I was turning it off after some time it was starting to work , Great hotel in good location away from noisy city center Breakfast was really good Staff very helpfull and friendly I love pillows and bed really comfortable Hotel is eco friendly Nice view from window 
410643,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, They offered a shuttle service to the airport but we weren t able to use it because our flight was too early It would have been nice to be able to take it instead of taking a taxi but it all worked out fine , We ate at the restaurant for dinner and the food was excellent I ordered the Pad Thai and it was the best I ve ever had and I order this at every Thai restaurant we go to The presentation of the food was amazing We had just come off a cruise and the hotel is right at the cruise port which was extremely convenient plus it was just a 10 minute walk into the city center 
410644,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Cost was a little high but not unusual by European standards , Great location if you are boarding a cruise ship boat Location is also very close to the central station 
410645,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Rooms could look better Furniture such as chair and sofa looked shabby Didn t like the curtains Furnitures looked liked they were nt cleaned properly Less drinks in mini bar Breakfast too expensive and was not included in our superior room upgrade Would not rate this room hotel luxury , The AC was great and so was size of the room although it was an upgraded room which I requested and paid a very small fee Mini bar soft drinks free tea coffee facilities in room Bathroom was quite spacious Door of bathroom was fine Staff was friendly Lot of tv channels to flick through 
410646,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Everything was very expensive on site eating was unaffordable, proximity to train station Easy to walk around lots to look at Hop on Hop off expensive but convenient
410647,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Getting to and from it by foot involves a lot of walking one way and then the other just to get to the street in front Once on the street a quick cross over to tram stop with very frequent service Not cheap but a lot of Amsterdam is expensive , Arrived by River cruise boat Hotel is located in front of Ocean Cruise terminal Easy to see but foot access involves a long way around route to get to it Tram stop opposite was handy for getting to city train station etc Use a one or two day tripper available from the hotel Almost new hotel with large room etc All the usual expectations Air conditioned We arrived in May but it was hot A lot of European hotels do not have air con which should have been ok for May but this time it would not have been so Short trip to railways station for local airport intercity eg Rotterdam for ferries and inter country trains eg Thalys ICE Hotel provided free shuttle to train station pre book 
410648,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The limited English has been a huge problem at the front desk Most receptionist are not capable of communicating accurately and effectively in a slightly more complex situation For example explaining about room deposit sounds like demanding for extra charge from your debit card These have made check in out unnecessarily long and stressful More senior staff at the front desk has better English but not everyone was received by him her Our room hasn t been cleaned when we were back around 4pm The cleaner came in when we were still in our bed surprise The TV didn t work which was resolved quickly after we reported it but the same problem happened again later so my husband fixed the cable at the back because we just couldn t be bothered to call again The shower head was leaking but we could shower just okay These issues were not taken any notice when we checked out , It is about 25 minutes to hit some real destinations in the traditional town centre but it is only 10 minutes from the central station If you are not bother walk into the old centre there re many cool places nearby to grab a beer It was delightful to find a proper coffee machine and free coffee in the room The view from our window is rather pleasant 
410649,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Breakfast was a bit pricey for someone who doesn t want a full blown feast , Top class facilities with great location especially for cruise adventurers and fantastic views Restaurant was also extremely good 
410650,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I requested an early check in to the hotel The hotel didn t accommodate my request My husband requested a wake up call each morning He didn t receive his wake up calls , The concierge was extremely helpful 
410651,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We were informed on arrival that our room had been downgraded from what we had booked The hotel had overbooked their suites and we were put in a smaller standard room with an extra bed instead This was done with no communication to us before check in We had had a long journey and this was extra stress we did not need late at night , Breakfast was Excellent beds were comfortable
410652,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, breakfast eggs sausages a bit salty checkout counter employee a bit cold, Hotel location hotel hall confort of the room vast range of products for breakfast
410653,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The bathroom was very dangerous 1 There is a 24 inch step into and out of the bath shower only one safety bar 2 The tub was very very slippery 3 The half shower door allows a lot of water to accumulate on the tile floor creating another slip hazard 4 Not enough safety bars none at all at the toilet 5 Terrible location ,No Positive
410654,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I don t think it is right policy for a 4 star hotel to take deposit for each night which leads to some 100 200 euro blocked on your card It s a terrible mistrust,No Positive
410655,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Checked in around ten we came from the ship Viking cruises We checked in with a lady at the desk gave my credit card for the 150 00 deposit and she mentioned room was not ready yet We waited for a few hours and I went to the desk to see if our room might be ready That same lady that checked us in was helping others and I heard her say to all of them that checked in HOURS after us their rooms were ready so why was ours not ready A nice gentleman to the right side of the desk helped me he said room HAS and HAD been ready and he went to get the paperwork there was none He did ask the lady that had checked us in and she had no idea where it went Thank the lord for him or we would still be sitting there waiting Rooms were not cleaned did talk to the head of housekeeping and she in turn told the room people to clean our room was not done One day the beds were made bathroom not cleaned trash can full Called front desk lady came up to clean and empty trash Had to ask for clean towels wash cloths no soap two empty boxes on little shelf in bathroom gave them to house keeper Talked to cleaning people while they were in the hall in regards to our room seems no one cared Cleaning people were across from our room two woman and I asked if they would clean our room again not cleaned Did see another cleaning person a man and he made our beds that was late in the afternoon He left right after he made our beds again nothing was cleaned , Yes to the food all was alright Down stairs the service not that great due to the waiters were way too busy with all they had to do and not enough help to do so felt sorry for them 
410656,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Charging 50euros per night for a 3rd person in the room but not having enough towels cups toiletries for 3 people despite asking each day On check out it was clear we weren t the only people to have the same issues, The area and proximity to the centre tram and park and ride
410657,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Its on one side of the train station and the town is on the other side at least a 40 minute walk Its also not very safe to walk back There is a shuttle bus but it only runs until 7 I had ti pay 100 euros on my debit card upon arrival as I didnt have a credit card I got this back at the end of the trip in cash in euros which was pointless as I was leaving The hotel was huge but the restaurant tiny Breakfast was 25 euros per person per night so we didnt bother , The room was very clean and comfortable 
410658,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Very overpriced for the room The location is very good but the room was underwhelming Staff did not tell us that they only stock the mini bar by request only We only found out later when we opened the fridge which forced us to order room service and pay the extra fee of having it be brought up to the room Same goes for the robes only on request For the price 250 per night it is not great value for money The bed was not very comfortable and even though we checked in for 3 adults we only got 1 set of shower gel shampoo The staff also did not respond understanding to our complaints ,No Positive
410659,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The room was not vacumed since the previous visitor with some beads all over carpet that I removed my self No plastic bottles recycling , They had the best cherries jam The check in staff were great 
410660,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, No water in any vending machine Got stuck in lift on fifteenth flour card would not scan to open door Payment for hotel had been taken out of my card before our arrival and yet the card was only supposed to be used to secure the booking, The view and room size Comfort of the beds Location Free shuttle bus to and from city
410661,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Far too expensive for a basic room without breakfast 370 euro There are much better hotels for less This hotel does not offer much more then an average hotel , Good location easy to get to
410662,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The bed was so bad i had to ask for a mattress topper and they came to put in mattress cover which didn t make the mattress feel better The cleaning services didn t do a good job I had breadcrumbs on the floor for 3 days and the cleaners didn t even think of vacuuming the room as they knew that i was there for 7 days The pathetic minibar had couple of fisi drinks such as coke and some apple and beer which i don t drink they didn t even offer fresh juice so you basically pay for something you don t even use as the minibar is paid for already with this type of room The nespresso coffee machine was nice to have in the room but what i didn t like is the capsules they offered their own cheap version of capsules It would have been better if they just offered nespresso own capsules which is the best They also were very stingy with water bottles i received only 2 small bottles each day one would think if you get an executive room there would be 2 bottles in the bathroom and 2 in the room at least yet that was another disappointment I would not recommend this hotel to anyone , The main reason why i chose to stay at this hotel was mainly because it was the selected venue for our conference so it made sense to stay at the same hotel What i realised later on is that it was a waste of Money This hotel is rated 4 stars where i would personally rate them 2 5 or at most 3 stars I honestly wish i have gone with another hotel that is closer to city than this hotel The swiss brand is not reflected on this hotel at all I had the executive double room which was on the top floors 19th yet it was so small and normal it didn t reflect any executive feeling at all I ve checked out the other rooms and they are the exact same except the other room doesn t have access to what they call the executive lounge which to be honest is not worth it as they have nothing to offer in that lounge they had 3 kind of belgium wine on the happy hour and some nibbles finger food which is not that good at all The service at the lounge is so bad you feel like it s some kind of scam if you think of the amount of money you are paying for such service room when it comes to the room again the room decore is very basic and looks like they had that formica covered fake wood which made things look so cheap and very ugly The bedside tables had no drawers there is just no enough storage space in that room which is ironic as the swiss are known to have very good designs that is functional and smart yet this hotel represent the opposite The bathroom was not smart either the shower water pressure is very low you feel like you are in a 3rd world country They only provide shower gel and shampoo nothing more than that which is strange for an executive room i would have expected they would provide a toothbrush and some more toiletries such as little perfume or even proper organic hand wash or even s loofah or a shaving kit like any 4 normal start At the end you feel like you are not getting your money s worth 
410663,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I said to the hotel that we are honeymooners But they didn t even congratulate us and didn t do anything nice special for us The variety of drinks in the minibar is very limited , The view was fantastic very nice snacks in the executive lounge very good breakfast I liked comfortable beds 
410664,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We thought that it was over priced for what it was Staff was not super friendly Only one option for breakfast 25 Euro buffet even if you just wanted some fruit Their ATM charged 10 The feeling was that they were trying to get money from us in as many ways as possible We ate at other restaurants in the area ,No Positive
410665,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I was slightly disappointed that having booked a superior room with a city view we were on the side of the hotel that faced towards the airport as opposed to Amsterdam itself But still we had a view and it didn t take away from our time there That combined with the fact breakfast is not included meant we found the rates for a 2 night stay here very high , Superb location really nice walk into the center Good facilities spa sauna gym which we made use of one morning Nice little bar in the lobby staff were very friendly and attentive there in particular Tea coffee making facilities in the room Very comfy bed Decent shower 
410666,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Slight problem with check in due to specific special business travel arangements we had made not hotel s fault and was sorted in the end but could have been avoided , Location views It s about five mins walk to NEMO six or seven to Central Station and into the city Room very comfortable quiet staff very helpful amazing view pic is from room window 
410667,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The WIFI connection is bad in the room get connected and disconnected all the times , Overall is really good hotel Room is spacious and comfortable Closed to central station a station away by tram 
410668,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing I can think of Okay if you want it to use the excellent wellness we first went downstairs to check if we had to take the bathrobes from the room or if bathrobes were provided in the wellness If the hotel info would include Just head down with your bathrobe from the room and pick up towell in our separated dressing rooms that would have saved a ride up the elevator Minor detail but I couldn t think of anything else to improve that s how perfect the hotel is organised , I have experienced many 5 star hotels in many countries I can honestly say that M venpick Amsterdam is one of the top hotels in which I have stayed For once I was not on a business trip but on a citytrip with my wife The room was great the location is fabulous and the restaurant is very nice But above all the staff and atmosphere in the hotel give you a warm welcoming feeling almost like coming home This is something I have not exeperienced in many hotels except for the W hotel chain M venpick is up there right with the best of the best 
410669,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Location overpriced and no cooperation with the guest as I asked for a two hour late check out but my request was declined by the front desk staff so disappointing, The restaurant
410670,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, One receptionist when I first walked in a bit moody but must be having a bad day as everyone was so lovely the rest of the trip Trains can be a bit noisy when the window is open but I slept through this Not a peep when they are shut , 10 minute walk away from central but far enough away so not noisy Lovely hotel in general Breakfasts were amazing and views from the hotel We were able to hire bikes outside the hotel and tram 5 minute walk away Bed very comfortable and great pillows 
410671,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Shower temperature changed every 2 seconds and they didn t allow us to check in early or check out later, Good security and easy to get to from Central station
410672,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Our stay was for just over a week The breakfast was a little bit repetitive and to be honest while there was a relatively wide choice it depended on when you arrived as to the quality of the cooked items and we did find it to be a bit lacklustre even when not too bad , As expected from a Swiss entity very well run clean and good attention to detail While not immediately central the 10 minute walk into the canal area was relatively pleasant and my wife and I always enjoy Amsterdam 
410673,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The Hotel is at least ten minutes away from center by foot That won t matter in summer but the road is really windy at winter as there are no buildings on the road to hotel The hot water was very unstable which burned my back and sometimes made me freeze A hotel at this quality must provide a stable water , The room was very luxurious and had a great view It was quite large and comfortable The bed was comfortable Stuff was very friendly There is a shuttle going to Centraal Station and coming back every 30 minutes It stops operating at evening So you can t use it if you plan to go out at night 
410674,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I didn t like the way that they encourage environmental initiatives ie towels left hanging on bathroom rail which means don t replace and the staff replaced daily anyway Our safe was broken in the room and not enough coat hangers available had to ask for more Stairs to entrance of Hotel were blocked off from the canal which ment walking all the way around , Great location next to Music Concert Hall Excellent walking distance to train station and town centre Comfortable bed good wifi 
410675,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The breakfast area was super crowded and smelled with the burnt frying oil like a cheap canteen I couldn t wait to get out of that space where people had to cram at the few tables available , We were lucky to get the room on one of the top floors The view was overwhelming Actually that was the main reason I booked this hotel in the first place the splendid water sight you can see from the room window The room was super clean and everything looked new The unlimited room bar was a pleasant bonus 
410676,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, airport shuttle would have been perfect , Very central location a ten minute walk from Centraal great value for money offer shuttle service to the station if you don t want to walk comfortable bed clean bathroom nice large windows overlooking the waterfront
410677,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Staff unhelpful Wanted to charge an additional 50 Euros for 2 people to have breakfast on an already inflated rate We had very little option but to stay there as our connecting flight from Amsterdam was cancelled due to storm Doris and all hotels booked up fast Very basic toiletries in room of course we had no luggage, The view from the room
410678,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Everything was great The location is good although not super central but it s located at a walking distance from Central Station and there is also a tram that runs in front of the hotel and goes to Central Station We founded very convenient Also we took a cab from Central Station back to the hotel one night and it was only 11 Euro 
410679,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, 3 bed room turned out to be a 2 bed room with a large sofa bed Although comfy not what we were expecting , Excellent facilities including gym sauna relaxation area Friendly and helpful staff and all round good experience 
410680,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The luggage locker keeper was morose Air conditioner was not enough It was very weak to climate and didn t heat us , Our room at 14th floor was perfect wifi was super 
410681,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Staff not friendly or helpfull at all Receptionist hiding in the office and playing with smartphone letting people at the counter wait Breakfast gets removed to the minute even though the restaurant is still well patronized Because of our early morning flight we had to leave the hotel before breakfast To save time in the morning we wanted to settle the bill on the evening before leaving but receptinist refused and argued that this is impossible because of some technical reason with their billing system For a hotel that claims to provide a high swiss service standard I would have expected to get a care package if due to early departure the paid breakfast cannot be attended ,No Positive
410682,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, its far from center i left somthing on the fridge but it was taken by staff also the management were not flixable about refunding my booking, the shuttel service
410683,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, cleaners coming in without give you a chance to open and they walked in twice on my brother and his mrs in the other room too, The view from the 10th floor was lovely staff are very helpful

410691,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, very rude staff right from the check in lady and the manager Mostly lip service room was extremely bland and old The pillows gave me a pain in the neck And as far as value for money is concerned I paid twice as much as a colleague without any breakfast for the same night My first and last time at this hotel Truly my worst experience in a decade of travel ,No Positive
410692,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Excellent welcome The lady who checked us in found us a lovely high room with a beautiful view The bar staff are fun and friendly food was excellent also It s our 2nd time at your hotel and can t wait to come again 
410693,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, breakfast at cost of 25EUR should improve significantly I booked the hotel mainly because fantastic memories from couple years ago and the offer deteriorated significantly since then Our family is vegetarian and we missed high quality fresh veggies by the way cheapest to get such as lettuce cucumbers peppers kale etc There were only carrots and tomatoes Same applies to fresh fruits For this price we missed organic food at all I recall it was there 4 years ago , good location close to the railway station nice view to the sea or city on higher floors clean toilets including high quality toilettries I was staying with my wife and 12 year old boy and room was spacious enough to accomodate 3 of us wifi working everywhere at good speed friendly staff

410702,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Front desk staff were not helpful Concierge handed me 6 bags from storage and walked away never offering to find help Returned from sightseeing Somewhat tired needed a rest before dinner at 3 30 to a dirty room Some friends rooms not cleaned till after 5 00 High level of checkouts was the excuse Management obviously knew in advance of this and took no action for more staff , Cafe staff were pleasant and helpful

410712,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The pillows are very uncomfortable square flat and strange material Might be memory foam but so not comfortable , Location is fantastic for pre or post cruise as its next door to the terminal Only a 5 minute walk into the centre

410719,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Need somewhere to sit when jet lagged and waiting for room for international travelers A guest lunge with cold drinks and coffee would be great and make arrival very nice it would also clearly your lobby so it looks more organized Bathroom doors do not lock this would be nice with several kids in the room , Breakfast and privacy of rooms 
410720,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Food was very expensive in dining room, Proximity to central city whilst still overlooking the river Room service breakfasts were huge one would have been enough for 2 people
410721,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The staff was quite rude and very obviously did not like Americans I was not informed about the executive floor the complimentary breakfast nor did I receive assistance with airport transportation My room was not clean and I was placed 10 floors away from my son despite the fact that I booked both suites 5 months in advance, The location was fair and the Executive floor service was excellent
410722,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Staff at breakfast were too keen to finish service before time resulting in very poor value for money for breakfast, Staff and service in bar restaurant and help by concierge staff was excellent

410725,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, We enjoyed the evening meal and croissant breakfast deal in the bar The location to the cruise port Free shuttle bus service from the railway station 
410726,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing other than a more reasonable price for breakfast which we opted out of , We booked the hotel because of the convenience of location to the cruise ship terminal We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was helpfulness of staff and closeness to the center of the city as well 
410727,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, location a bit of a walk to central station however it would have been nice to know there was a tram station across the street but no one tells you that , nice comfortable hotel

410732,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Two chambermaids one being male barged into our room after I had just got out of the shower and not yet dressed Room and particularly the bathroom was not cleaned anywhere close to what you expect from a hotel of this nature On one of the days our room was not even touched We had to ask to have it cleaned at 6pm , Our issues were attended to swiftly but the problem not resolved Bathroom cleanliness was shocking Reception staff were very efficient 
410733,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, It s a little way out from the sights but walkable in about 15 minutes , Its very convenient for the cruise port being literally next door We awoke to see our cruise ship moored outside our bedroom window Excellent buffet breakfast

410737,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The security could not have been less helpful and was in fact outright rude when we were faced with the dilemma of having no secure parking for our bikes We were assured secure parking prior to our trip which was an underground car park with no security guard More frustrating was that the first of our party who arrived was allowed to take his bike to his room , I booked 6 rooms following a 300mile charity bike ride from London The consierge was helpful and organised a morning of massages for our sore legs which was amazing They also provided a discount in honour of our charity 
410738,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Breakfast was pricey , Very contemporary Staff friendly and helpful Room large and comfortable 14th floor with harbor inlet view was great Perfect location for Rhine River Cruise leaving from Amsterdam Close to central station Canal touring boats nearby

410740,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, No complaints whatever Lovely views spacious clean new looking comfortable room adequate lighting great breakfast buffet There is a free hotel shuttle to Central Station but there is also a tram stop right across from the hotel 5 min walk enabling more flexibility and later return times The hotel is not actually in the center of things but with an unlimited ticket for public transportation highly recommended it is incredibly easy to get to wherever you want to go in minutes and without any confusion 
410741,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, We had a wonderful two day stay at this hotel before a Celebrity Baltic cruise We were able to walk our luggage down the block and drop it off at the cruise terminal the morning of our departure The hotel was beautiful and clean Our room was very nice with a comfy bed and stunning water views We had dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night since we were tired from traveling and that was very nice too 
410742,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I would have expected better facilities for the money bar staff were mixed city tax on check out at no warning which was very sly Loads of old people, Bag storage pre check in clean smart looking
410743,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The shower had no pressure , It was a short distance to central station the city centre and the cruise ship terminal Breakfast was good We stayed in an executive room which had great views of the canal Towels big and fluffy 
410744,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Some Staff at front desk were not helpful Room cleanliness not good We arrived to find dirty glasses in our bathroom and the toilet brush still standing up in the toilet , location was good particularly if you arrive by train or intend embarking on a river or ocean cruise
410745,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I did not like the 3 p m check in When you arrive at the hotel at 9 45 a m after a long transatlantic flight it is annoying and very inconvenient not to be able to get into your room for another 5 hours particularly after I had requested earlier check in , Everything was as I expected except the check in 
410746,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The breakfast is rather expensive if not already included in your room and while very good is hard to justify in terms of price , Rooms have a great view good space and are always clean Breakfast is excellent 
410747,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Some Reception and concierge Staff seemed unsure of their jobs Had to take bags to room by myself my partner had recently had emergency medical procedure in Germany and was unable to help , Convenient to transport Clean neat and tidy Some very nice staff Would go back next trip 
410748,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I could have used a lesson on the coffee maker Should have been easier and we did get it figured out crushed a couple of pods , excellent concierge staff and the shuttle is a wonderful service
410749,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Location for our Celebrity cruise was excellent we walked out the front door of the hotel and the passenger terminal is next door It s an easy walk 7min to all the city centre sights If you arrive early you can store your luggage and walk to the city centre until your room is ready and put your valuables in the hotel safe custody box 
410750,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Without the upgrade the price of breakfast is prohibitive For many people the location may not be ideal a 10 15 minute walk to the central train station Also there are very few restaurant alternatives in the immediate area , Nice room and excellent breakfast which was included since we upgraded to an executive room There was also a complementary happy hour with beer wine and snacks The location was ideal for us since we were taking a cruise and the ship was docked behind the hotel 
410751,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Cleanliness of the room On arrival found used bottles of water and a half eaten chocolate bar in the fridge We put them on the side and told the reception They still sat there when we left 4 days later The room carpet was always dirty Price tags from clothes and bits of paper from previous guests never moved it the 4 days we stayed , Great staff good location away from the hustle and bustle but close to everything
410752,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Hotel was very busy and crowded It took a long time to check in a long time to check out a long time to get food in the bar where we ate because the restaurant had no space for us to eat for 45 minutes The breakfast buffet was a zoo and there were no provisions for a handicapped person to get food The elevators were almost too small for my husband and two bags and me on the scooter We had trouble getting an elevator to get to and from breakfast just one floor below There were no other options nearby to eat that I could get to easily on the scooter It was not a good hotel for anyone taking an Amawaterways cruise it was too far to walk with luggage to the regular river cruise docks if you were not taking a Viking cruise , Handicapped room was set up very well There was enough room for the scooter to turn around Beds were comfortable There was a fridge and a TV The internet was good although they tried to tell us that we would have faster service if we paid for the internet implying that it would be slow if we didn t I found the free internet plenty fast enough This would be a good hotel for people taking a Viking or AIDA cruise which we were not 
410753,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, The hotel was excellent While not in the very center of Amsterdam we found this to be an advantage because we didn t have to be in constant crowds It s only one tram stop away from Central Station and also an easy 10 minute walk The staff was wonderful and the included breakfast buffet well worth the money The concierge very helpful with tours tickets vouchers etc Also near the library where my husband wanted to do some research We booked a junior suite with a stunning view 
410754,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Our stay was perfect We can t think of anything that could have been better except the price was a bit steep for us Oh well the splurge was well worth it , Our room s view of the busy harbor was to die for We spent an enjoyable afternoon simply watching the various boats and water traffic 
410755,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, No 110 outlets for American appliances but they do provide an adapter to charge your phone, Location excellent for anyone from there going on a Viking river cruise since they take off right from behind the hotel They also provide shuttle service to and from central station
410756,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Bar prices quite expensive 10 minute walk to city centre Office building facing room We were just above height of the building but if any lower would have been able to see inside offices Privacy issue , Rooms very comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast very good

410759,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Would prefer a lock on the bathroom door, Happy hour is a nice bonus central location shuttle comes handy to reach to central station specially in bad weather
410760,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, It s a little out of the way from central Amsterdam but the free shuttle is well worth it and it is only a short walk into the centre Shower bath can be a little dangerous and is quite small and the bathroom doors are just vanity covers so the bathroom can t be fully closed off , Bed was amazing Very comfy pillows and plenty of room Didn t crowd the room as well which was nice Buffet breakfast is to a high standard and staff are welcoming and friendly at all times Room service is good value and very quick 
410761,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Every hotel should provide drinking water in rooms There was a shop downstairs but not always open Really think drinking water should be a basic provision in a hotel of this standard , Huge bed very comfortable Amazing view of Amsterdam Excellent facilities Tram into central station just a cross the road with very frequent service

410763,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The breakfast costs 25 for each person and that is too much money infact , I like everythinh there Good location and out a little bit of the center 8 minutee walking so you can have a quite night Also the tram 26 stop is only 1 or 2 minutes walking
410764,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The hotter sauna cabin was not working on two nights of our stay purely a staff error , The staff were very attentive The view from our room was superb The location was a little way from the centre of the city biut no great problem
410765,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, opening hours of spa area on Sundays we wanted to use the area during the day before we needed to head to the airport , The staff the value of money the breakfast and our incredible view Definitely I will book again 
410766,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Rock hard pillows made it difficult to sleep and I woke with a crick in my neck No shampoo or conditioner very shocking It s been years since I was in a hotel without them Most important I found it VERY hard to find out how to enter the hotel from the 26 Bus platform I had a very heavy suitcase First I went to the concert hall but couldn t find a way to descend two stories the the entrance to the hotel Finally I took an elevator from the concert hall lobby to the indoor parking lot terrified I d be locked in Fortunately I was able to walk out on the road for the exiting cars and was now on the street level but exhausted after hauling my suitcase hither and yon Getting to the front desk was a NIGHTMARE , Loved the views and the nice staff 
410767,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, We had a clean and comfortable room with nice modern interior Breakfast buffet was very rich and tasty We would have wished for a higher floor better view but apart of that everything was really good 
410768,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Didn t have breakfast as it was too expensive The shuttle bus wasn t clear so walked from the station with suitcases , Lovely views over the water Very helpful reception staff
410769,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Everything is excellent Wi fi worked well we had a mini fridge in the room Beds are very comfortable Location is only 7 min walk to central station and can easily reach Dam square Parking at a nearby location called Oosterdok is only 3 min walk from the hotel It is cheap also I stayed 48 hours and paid only 24 Euro for parking Staff is very friendly and the rooms are spacious 
410770,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Had problem with the air conditioning kept blowing cool cold air especially when it was cold outside and you want to come into a nice cosy room We mentioned it to staff but nothing was really resolved apart from being asked do we need extra blankets wasn t happy , Location was fine for me with lovely views away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotspots Lovely comfy bed to kick back into and relax 
410771,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, It s a little difficult to get to although it is close to the railway station , Great views from most rooms excellent food and generally very clean and comfortable 
410772,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, One morning the internet connection was down which was unfortunate as I really needed to work the connection came back again in about 90 minutes , Usually I don t have high expectations for these fancy hotels but Moevenpick was very good We had an amazing room view the staff was genuinely polite and the restaurant food was really tasty I had the leftovers from my lunch at night and even though the food was cold it still tasted great 
410773,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Hot water was very weak pressure and limited No massage service in the hotel it is outsourced and when I ask for an appointment it was not available Location is average you need to walk 10 minutes at least to get to anything , Breakfast was nice 
410774,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, To go by foot there from Amsterdam Central Station is a bit too far especially in bad weather but by taxi it cost 10 12 euro This is a real inconvenience you should take in consideration, Very nice hotel not too far from the centre good room perfect views from the window on the river 
410775,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Clean modern hotel with spacious rooms and a beautiful view on Amsterdam and the river Not too far from Central Station 15min by foot The free shuttle from to the station is a plus free wifi is a must 
410776,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, If the inclusion or exclusion of the city tax was advised befor checking in, Although my booking includes the city tax However I paid agin the city tax
410777,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Car parking It is a great underground car park However the hotel staff and booking com s information on car parking is woefully short and not fit for consumer s It is lacking in detail and needs changing The staff at the hotel did not have a clue and gave me misleading information A small gripe but when you are using the hotel as a base to visit clients all over Holland it is good to know what you will pay , Amazing upgrade to excecutive room great views of Amsterdam to wake up to every morning from the 47th floor Breakfast is very very good for this type of business hotel 
410778,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The way the whole superior room view hidden costs were not explained properly at check in or online Have never yet had to pay a deposit on a hotel room 100 euros and city taxes taken off that on departure Nearly 20 euros paid for absolutely nothing Superior room 30 euros seemed on y to pay for wifi and a poorly stocked mini bar not restocked on the second day Not worth the extra Snippy unpleasant attitude of the receptionist when I questioned the pricing not appreciated A lovely hotel which despite the above we shall return to , The view in particular from the 17th floor over the city was spectacular However having already upgraded to a superior room and given the size of the hotel did not appreciate having to pay an extra 10 euros per night for a room facing in the right direction 
410779,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, staffs are rude and have no understanding what hospitality means Don t understand why most of the staff are reluctant to be friendly Coming from Dubai experience of hospitality is no where comparable , close to the central sattion
410780,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Stayed from 30 12 15 to 1 1 16 Hotel clean and staff at check in very polite However the 5 city tax was not mentioned on check in We were told that we had to give a 150 deposit which would be refunded on check out Nothing was mentioned about city tax I understand tax is not for the hotel themselves but it was deducted from our deposit on departure I explained to the member of staff that this was not mentioned at check in and I felt that it should have been My problem was not paying the tax my problem was it was not mentioned until we were leaving He became quite rude and raised his voice while there were many other people in the check out area Not very nice at all , Girl on desk was polite and mannerly 
410781,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The price of the breakfast is too high if you book a room without breakfast, The restaurant was closed during the day so we had a lunch in the bar Staff was very friendly and paid lots of attention to our daughter Thanks for the chocs 
410782,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing, Brilliant hotel no problems at all friendly staff lovely food and brilliant location ten mins walk near the water to the city center lovely hotel for couples been too Amsterdam numerous times now and will always go here 
410783,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, This was the best hotel I ve stayed in I will never forget my 25th birthday thanks to Movenpick The junior suite was excellent Very presentable and well worthy the money Thank you so much
410784,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I didn t like that we had to pay 150 for incidentals which I was not aware about which took away a big chunk of our spending money and then when we went to get our money back when we checked out they had taken a city tax out of it Which would have been fine if we had of been told about it on arrival or before hand Just another thing I had booked a double room but arrived to find two single beds with a huge gap in between which I wouldn t count as a double bed Other than that good hotel, Very friendly staff and very clean modern hotel
410785,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing experienced , Location it is just a 7 minute walk to the Central station and along the canal Views from the room are outstanding overlooking the river and motorway great effect at night too Rooms we stayed in the family room with interconnecting doors very comfortable beds and great for a family of 4 Breakfast worth dying for You are spoilt for choices Staff extremely polite and helpful great work ethic Transport free shuttle every 30 mins to central in case you don t want to walk solves the problem of the location being slightly away from the center 
410786,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Staff took money without informing us No explanations 100 deposit needed on arrival Hotel restaurant extremely expensive for portion size and very limited choice , A short walk to the centre
410787,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The double beds are two separate beds instead of one large bed a bit of a bummer if you want to wallow around The hotel restaurant is kinda bland but there is good food just around the corner , The views from the higher floors are spectacular they accommodated request for an early check in and the location is perfect 
410788,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, For a woman traveling alone this location is not a pleasant location Walking back to the hotel at night not recommended because of the location Breakfast sharing long tables with strangers is not what I want and 25 euros is overpriced , Decent clean hotel with friendly staff 
410789,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, room rate was ok But breakfast in a sort of cantine sitting at a long table with strangers for 25 euros was unpleasant and way overpriced , Location close to city centre and central station nice view from rooms on higher floors 
410790,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, location was not so bad but in the winter you still have to walk 10 min to get to central station , Excellent staff We stayed 4 nights We booked specifically a double bed room but got twin beds We asked to change when we arrive but the hotel was full But we have been able to change the room for a double bed for the second and the rest of the stay Very comfy and clean Shuttle service to Central station was helpful too There is also a bike rental company in the parking just below the hotel 
410791,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Speed of internet was limited unless you upgrade to business lounge We gladly did upgrade But it s better to provide at least 5Mbit s, Perfect hotel
410792,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing in particular just bear in mind that hotel is not in the old town center but like 10 min walk which was absolutely fine with us , We ve been upgraded to Junior suite which was really nice Location is very good all extra services where really well timed We ve got our room early they are offering free shuttle to the train station concierge Paul was very friendly and helpful giving tips as to how to reach our restaurant and where we could stop for a drinks All was superb 
410793,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Rooms are very very cold the aircondition does not work properly they changed my room in second day wifi too expensive during check in they say wifi free but when you make the check out they charge, Clean
410794,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The heating wasn t working only cool air Have to pay an extra for the taxes of the country around 5 will be nice to knew it in advance like the 50 per day deposit to make sure have enough money on arrival , All very clean and tidy Good staff Nice area with nothing to see around but just 7 min walking to the train station and 15 20 to the center 
410795,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, The service was amazing staff extremely friendly and helpful and always willing to go the extra mile The breakfast is amazing and the every 30 minute shuttle bus to the centraal station was so convenient Would stay there again
410796,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, wifi was a little limited as it only allowed up to 2 devices to connect to free wifi , Concierge was so lovely and friendly and informative breakfast spread wasn t too big but solid good quality food with a gorgeous view Beds were so comfortable and the rooms were well lit Excellent location two minutes from Central Station by tram 
410797,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The only thing is the distance to the centre there s a huge bridge however there is a shuttle bus and tram right outside, The staff were amazing and friendly never encountered any problems Room service was quick and helpful The room was as the picture shows but bigger Value for money so many extras included than just a room 
410798,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Liked everything As something minor the view I had was not as nice as last time but then I liked having a room with a bath so it wasn t an issue at all, really like the hotel super convenient and comfortable all staff lovely
410799,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, I really liked everything The stuff the location the room the breakfast We had the perfect day at the M venpick hotel and we are definitely coming back
410800,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, At checkout they charged us 50 euros for room cleaning fee we asked why this was added on and they had no apparent reason They also created a fuss during checkout a we were questioning the fine , Location to Central station and city centre is alright The view however is great
410801,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We could hear the wind through the vents in our room Staff are a little bit lost it was new years and they weren t completely focused At one point someone from outside threw a firework into the rotating door of the hotel The lobby was filled with smoke for about 5 minutes no one did anything about it Their IT system is outdated I had to run all over the hotel to print a document the staff weren t very helpful Bed sheets were a little dirty house keeping didn t clean our room one day and walked in on us at around 6pm to clean the room We were out all day and were resting at the time they came in We didn t have a do not disturb sign We asked room service for it it took 45 minutes for them to bring it up The building seems to be old but well maintained, It s good value for money if you re happy to put up with a few discomforts It s a 3 minute walk from the tram line that takes you straight to the central station Check in and check out was very smooth
410802,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Just like the rest of the touristic centre of Amsterdam is this hotel overprized and overrated, The location is very good It takes some time to walk to the center but the view is wonderful
410803,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, On having a shower we discovered that the drain was blocked It took only 30 seconds or so for the water to start spilling into the bathroom It took 3 calls to reception before the drain was unblocked on our 2nd night a 5 minute job The king size bed was made of two separately made single beds butted up together with a gap in the middle The free internet had to reactivated after each 24 hour period The reactivation process was complicated and took too much time , The view the location and the friendly staff The facilities provided such as a small fridge a kettle and a couch were great The provided breakfast offered a great selection of different good quality dishes Dinner was great as well Wait staff were efficient and friendly 
410804,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Long queues at check in and check out Staff not helpful when checking in Requested early check in and hotel emailed saying this was possible only for hotel staff to dismiss and ask we pay for an extra night to check in early check in time is 3pm Location wise difficult to reach by foot and is out of the way The main centre is a good 10 15mins walk away and no shops restaurants near the hotel, nice clean room and sauna was good
410805,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Have to log in every 24 hours for the free wifi, Staff very friendly and approachable Free shuttle to central station but didnt get to use until the last day 
410806,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, It s biggest downside is the location It s 15 minute walk to the train station and longer to get in to the city centre Despite its distance I would book it again which is endorsement enough , This hotels biggest asset is the size of the rooms Because it is outside the central cluster it can offer larger rooms for the same price as more central hotels Also because of its location there is no late night noise or trouble makers Staff were very pleasant TV had a wide selection of European channels I didn t use the restaurant or gym 
410807,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, breakfast is busy quite busy don t expect to get your fried egg without a lineup, the river view outside window was beautiful furniture were new and urban washroom was big and clean However you have to choose for a car park if you drive 1 under hotel costs EUR50 per night but straight access from hotel 2 across the river EUR12 per night but walk in non stop Amsterdam Wind for 10 mins
410808,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Drinks in the bar were a bit expensive mix up over second room but to be fair this was soon sorted would stay again , Clean comfortable hotel modern with well equipped rooms We arrive about 10am and went to drop off our bags but our rooms were ready so they let us have the instead of making us wait until 3pm Friendly staff good breakfast 
410809,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The room we received as the first one was too close to the lift and was noisy because we can hear the lift mooving outside the wall The hotel should not sell this rooms without warning that it is a noisy one Anyway when we asked them they change it with no problem , Staff is very helpfull and professionall they are focusing on solving the problems not creating them Beautifull view on Amsterdam from room on 19th floor with panoramic window i guess all of the rooms have the same kind of wide windows Very good restaurant with very nice staff Excellent bed the king size Close to Central Station 10 minutes walk from Old Town 
410810,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Well nothing really , great location within walking distance of the city centre and really close to the station very close as well to a car park with decent prices for overnight stays very friendly staff great view from the 20th floor receiving an upgrade without asling for anything nice addition the nespresso machine in the room
410811,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, We liked the cleanliness and the very friendly and helpful staff Location was also important to us close to Central Station and city center Breakfast is rich in choice and good quality There is a shuttle service to Central Station in case of plenty luggage to carry It was a pleasant stay and we ll definitely return here 
410812,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, At reception upon checking in there were a lot of attempts made by the front desk to upsell us in terms of a different room breakfast all of which were ridiculously overpriced and terrible value for money at a time we were far too tired from the journey to want to have such discussions I understand what I paid for as the booking com website lays things out very clearly I don t want to have to rehash my decisions when checking in The location if you don t have business with the pier is extremely plain boring it s in a fine part of town but if you re travelling to Amsterdam just to see the city itself I wouldn t stay down this end this area feels like Amsterdam s loading docks , We travelled to Amsterdam to meet with family who were docked at the pier so this was a really good location for that The room had everything we needed and was warm comfortable and clean The concierge helped us greatly with regard to navigating the city on the first day we ventured out and sold us tickets for the Van Gogh museum as well which we found extremely helpful 
410813,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Breakfast is ridiculously pricey , Clean spacious rooms Stayed here prior to boarding a river cruise just down the river from this location 1 tram stop from Amsterdam Centraal so easy to jump transit and get to sights 
410814,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, After our excellent dinner the night before breakfast was very disappointing The selection was limited for the size of hotel and the quality of product not great Having prepaid the breakfast and already had reception query it but sort it out at check in when we arrived for breakfast we were made to wait 10 minutes while they sorted it out and confirmed AGAIN that yes we had indeed pre paid for it very unprofessional for a top name hotel The glasses for orange juice etc were tiny so my husband took a large wine glass and filled that but was told he couldn t use them and when he asked the waiter to please bring four of the small glasses to the table as he likes a large glass of orange juice in the morning the waiter said I don t do table service Really A waitress appeared with a paper cup for my husband to have his orange juice in this is not the standard of service we expect from this level of hotel It seemed there were plenty of staff but standing around and not serving or circulating with orange juice coffee etc We told the reception staff on check out who were really apologetic about it and gave my husband a bar of Movenpick chocolate by way of apology Unfortunately due to the location of the hotel there is nowhere else nearby for breakfast , The rooms are very clean and modern with a lovely bathroom and we had a stunning view down the river from our room on the 16th Floor We had an excellent if pricey meal and service in the Silk Road Restaurant 
410815,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The breakfast is expensive and you really need to eat a lot to justify the 25Eur It would be nice to have an option for a light breakfast The breakfast room was unpleasantly crowded on the Sunday morning of our stay The Hotel is a little bit anonym , Functional polite staff
410816,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Directions from the train station were not clear Also construction was a major problem The breakfast buffet was overpriced for the quality , Cleanliness of the room Great location for Viking Cruise ship Bartender and bar staff were professional very friendly 
410817,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Check in staff was really pushy trying to sell upgrade Once we declined she became aloof and indifferent This appeared to be the way most Front of the house staff interacted with hotel guests The way the hotel emphasised so much on selling upgrad also gave out an impression that they provided two tier service full if you upgrade or mediocre if you don t Pity as the hotel seems to have so much potential , Large bedroom with great views of the city and surrounding waters Room maintenance team responded very quickly when we made a request for an extra duvet Thanks 
410818,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, There was too loud electronic music coming from the concert building next to the hotel at night I guess it was a temporary event Normally I wouldn t bother it if I didn t visit Amsterdam to run my first 42K marathon , The view of my room was almost perfect and my room was clean and tidy Hotel staff was polite and helpful You can reach city centre by a 10 15 min walk 
410819,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Awful bed pillow could not sleep, Location ideal as we could just walk from the ship Reception staff kindly made a room available for an early check in much appreciated Excellent breakfast 
410820,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Heating system in the room was not effective , Excellent reception people very informative and able to assist at all times Nice room very clean Good buffet breakfast 
410821,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Nothing, I stayed 7 nights in a twin classic room It was very convenient with all needed stuff for a business traveler All staff including receptionist concierge waiters and shuttles drivers were super friendly and helpful Hotel is only 10 minutes by walk to central station and tram 26 s stop is a cross the road 
410822,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, staff are a little bit rude and location is far from centre if it s a rainy day, fantastic view from the rooms very quite and clean rooms and hotel generally 
410823,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Cleanliness was very bad i ve had pillows that smelled and no not the pillow cases but the pillow itself The sofa under the glass window was dusty specially in the corners the water heater had water inside since i don t know how long and stank basically poor staff after midnight menu ridiculous and on top of all i got checked in a room with 2 beds when i had specifically booked a Classing king bedroom I had to argue with the receptionist and log into my email to prove to her that because it was saying otherwise on her computer Well i got upgraded to the 16th floor but still it s a hotel i wouldn t think of using anymore , Location
410824,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, No tea and coffee making in the room A little far from the town good 10 minutes walk The walk is flat and very interesting , The place was modern and well appointed Staff were friendly and helpful The walk to the city was a very pleasant one Perfect place if you were going on a river cruise
410825,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Check in was rather slow rooms booked not available but 2 rooms were eventually upgraded to executive rooms but we had to complain to get same, Breakfast was amazing
410826,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Two of our group stayed in a room opposite ours Unfortunately this backed onto a music centre or disco the music could be heard booming ALL night The reception staff were very helpful by swapping rooms the next night , We had a junior suite It was luxurious and we enjoyed the free mini bar and lounge bar facilities The pillow rating was a great idea Breakfast was amazing 
410827,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The only thing I would say is that the bathroom doors are frosted glass and they don t close properly or lock It doesn t leave much to the imagination , The room was brilliant big clean great views and a free minibar The best and most impressive hotel I have ever stayed in 
410828,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The main dining room gets pretty loud at breakfast time A shade pricey but then Amsterdam is , Perfectly located for our target the Muziekgebouw an t Ij next door although a bit out of the way for some other things Clean sparkling nice staff well appointed room Top class breakfast 
410829,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The Location is a wee bit off the beaten track but to be fair it was alright being close to the River and in reality only an eight minute walk to Central Station , Very spacious inviting room Great Bed Nice hot shower any time of day Great Breakfast Warm friendly staff Good Gym facilities including Two Saunas 
410830,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Concierge staff not particularly helpful Room was not made up on one day and was after advising reception finally attended to by a surly housekeeper Our breakfast booking was not communicated to the dining area staff , Restaurant was quite good with pleasant staff 
410831,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Not sure about the final charges on our credit card for the breakfasts and we may have been overcharged , We had a lovely room on 11th floor overlooking the water which was very comfortable We did not mind the short walk to the city centre 
410832,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Fantastic hotel for a great rate We booked this at the last minute and the staff were more than happy to accomodate us only 30 minutes after booking Friendly staff clean and modern Would definitely stay here again 
410833,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Only one night stay so review based on a short stay Beautiful modern contemporary rooms with ample room and great view About a 10 minute walk to Central station and the edge of the central and red light district 
410834,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, The hotel was good and staff was polite But the location was average There was no shop around and hard to find food outside after 8pm You have to stick hotel made food ,No Positive
410835,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, If you are a light sleeper there s a noise every time trains pass from there Not a very loud noise but yeah it is there , Great location Very close to the city center although nothing much around the hotel Good views if you are on a higher floor Great staff and excellent amenities and a very comfortable stay Very nice breakfast 
410836,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, The hotel is in a good location one tram stop from the central station Rooms are very trendy However what I appreciated the most is the staff flexibility and approach to the guests They are very at tentative to any concern you might have we faced an issue and the Hotel Manager and Front Office Manager were very accommodating It s a hotel that really cares about maintaining it s brand name and reputation I definitely recommend and will come back to again 
410837,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, I wasn t able to get tours to drop me back at the motel and taxi s were expensive to get to and from motel from the airport Would have been good to have a pick up and drop off service to the airport , Location was great and it was walking distance to the centre of town I was able to get tours to pick up from the door 
410838,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, A little too far from Old Town Needed to take a shuttle or tram to Central Station to get to public transportation , My husband I had just returned from a Viking river cruise The hotel was close to where the ship docked We had a junior suite which was very spacious and nice The bathroom was huge We also had privileges to the executive lounge The staff was very accommodating 
410839,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, No mention of deposit to be paid upon arrival of 100 when I was booking Other than that No problems, Free shuttle bus in or 10 min walk to Central station Nice view of river Friendly staff Very helpful
410840,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Very busy hotel reception people very rud they speak like if they own the hotel Very far from everything you need to walk a lot to reach the center Better to stay somewhere close,No Positive

410842,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, We had to call housekeeping every night during our stay to have our bed made Toiletries and coffees were never supplemented , The view from our room was excellent 
410843,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, My wife was shouted at by a member of staff for taking a phone call from our children while in the bar He actually shouted at her while on the phone Bed sheets were ripped and when the bed was re made the same bedding was used not fresh bedding Upon check in we were asked some very personal questions about our home life children and how old my wife was when she first got pregnant , The bar food was nice but after waiting half an hour for some soup they realised they forgot to put the order through Restaurant food was good quality 
410844,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, CONS A little far walk to from Central Station Hotel room rate for an average room without breakfast was expensive for 200 e per night Room was cleaned late and not thoroughly on second day Breakfast limited in Silk Road restaurant Not many restaurants in vicinity Gift shop prices for souvenirs higher than elsewhere Beware of taxis to the airport Though they are supposed to charge 50 e due to a contract with hotel but our taxi ran the meter and charged us 67 e A shock , PROS View of water was fantastic New modern hotel next to cruise terminal for Viking river cruises Conciege and front desk were very helpful and quick with responses Dinner at the Silk Road restaurant for about 20 e was a good value Hotel was neat and clean Check in was quick and they got us a room on the 11th floor on early check in

410848,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, When I reaerved specified low to ground room Nobody told me they had no stairs only elevators I am phobic of elevators They would not refund my money I had to wait aometimes up to 10 minutes to get to my room as a guard had to take me up to the third floor via fire escape some of which outside Very angry should have made it clear when I booked , Modern and clean Free shuttle to airport and or station 
410849,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,No Negative, Movenpick is a great location if you are taking a cruise We stayed there the night before our Celebrity cruise left There is a tram stop right across the street from the hotel so it is easy to get into the center of the city
