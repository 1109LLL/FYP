482742,NH Milano Grand Hotel Verdi, The shower needed a shower curtain as the water splashed on the floor and the edge of the bath shower was mouldy Incidentally there is no shuttle service as one concludes from the write up on Booking com This was very misleading and quite disappointing when we were arranging our transport to airport I had booked this hotel with the shuttle as a main incentive , The room was very spacious and the bed extra comfortable 
482743,NH Milano Grand Hotel Verdi, Breakfast could be better they didn t fill some empty trays There is only one coffee machine which tasted bad and there is a line for coffee on busy mornings , Amazing staff very good location just next to corso como and close to public transport pretty big and clean rooms except curtains
