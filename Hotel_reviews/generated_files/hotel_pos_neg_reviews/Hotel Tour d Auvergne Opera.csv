22010,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, Had a mixed experience with the staff first day excellent helpful and friendly second day at checkout I was charged twice because the guy was convinced that I did not pay That was rather frustrating but later his colleague sent me an email to say that the refund was arranged so this speaks in their favour despite the negative experience After reading other comments related to the room size I decided to book a double room still there was barely any space for my carry on suitcase I don t think a double room would fit two people , Great location within a walking distance from La Gare du Nord and many other attractions cafes and restaurants an enjoyable atmosphere on a sunny day My room was very comfortable 
22011,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, No wifi for samsung 7 and 8 had i known this may have booked elsewhere No complimentary food in area downstairs which alot of other hotels do, NASSIS at reception was awesome friendly and helpful the room was modern classic style and we loved it Roomy comfortable and quiet I would recommend staying here it s great
22012,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, Breakfast expensive 20 euros for coffee juice croissant yogurt and a small slice of cheese Would reserve there again but have breakfast in any or the nearby cafes , Location staff was great Issues with leaks in the bathroom but they seemed to have fixed it 
22013,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, Wi Fi It is really slow and unreliable Parking around hotel is a total nighmare parking allowed for 2 hours only with price around 1 5 euro for 15 minutes Garages are withing 10 15 minutes walk call in advance to check if places available , Location is great lot of restaurants bars around Very convenient transportation Rooms are not new but in good conditions 
22014,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera,No Negative, There is a laundromat two doors down supermarket metro Sunday market lots of cafes in the area and very helpful staff with 24 hour reception Opening windows and air con give you options and the lift is a god send with luggage good bathrooms too
22015,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, The room was small Just enough space to move around The elevator and the passageways are small making it difficult for a person with heavy luggage to move to the room , The room was very comfortable the staff was very warm and hospitable and the pantry with the coffee and the snacks was very useful and good The location was excellent Overall a very good hotel Total value for money 
22016,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, No English Chanels on the tv said stations were in the 60s but tv channels only went to 50, Very clean and central staff very friendly Had room service nd free wifi room decor was amazing
22017,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, I booked the room 40 days earlier at the flexible rate I checked the rate again two days before my departure and the rate was cheaper than my booked rate Not happy with that , close to Gare du Nord Montmartre and metro station The area is full of restaurants supermarket few steps away

22021,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, I was very disappointing with this hotel despite reading positive reviews My visit did not reflect this We stayed in room 11 on the 1st floor and I must say I was shocked at the standard from the second I walked in The room was very dark with hardly any sunlight no soundproofing it was very noisy you could hear people talking clearly in other rooms and walking up and down the stairs Our TV didn t work and despite reporting it twice the staff where reluctant to do anything about it until we insisted on a discount on the room charge if they didn t Room service only put new towels and did not remove the old ones lay the bed or clean the bathroom Being a frequent visitor to Paris and having stayed in several other hotels in the area this by far does not live up to it s 4 star rating , Wifi was good
22022,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, Room 54 or 55 not sure as had both not suitable for children at all due to graphic details of wallpaper Overall decor too sexy for family with kids below 14 Hotel night guard not aware of hospital options in an emergency ,No Positive
22023,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, There is no actual bar or restaurant facilities just a common area where you can order some drinks or snacks However this is more than offset by having a Boulangerie Supermarket and bars within 1 mins walk So I am really not picking here , Good distance from Gard Du Nord and ability to walk into Paris or use Metro Lots of local shops nearby to cater for all sorts Staff were really helpful and friendly 
22024,Hotel Tour d Auvergne Opera, The pillows were awful foam I m not sure how it was sound proofed as we were woken just before 8am by the cleaners and earlier by doors banging shut There was also a little road noise which as we slept badly was a little disturbing Nice selection of cosmetics although lotion would have been nice , Kind and helpful man who welcomed us exactly the sort of person who should work in customer care Room was beautifully designed shower was gorgeous bathroom expensive and tasteful
