313034,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Didn t like the fact that there is no roof terrace The pictures you see of the pool etc make it appear that they are on the roof however this is all actually on the 6th floor and stops serving at 8pm and closes at 9pm The bar on the 24th floor has a roller shutter roof and cannot really be described as a roof terrace either Ps there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room at all , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was lovely with a great if far off sea view and the air conditioning was really good The place is very nicely decorated except maybe the odd corridors 
313035,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Staff not professional Had someone walking in my room without knocking and I was almost naked Told reception but only said sorry, Accommodation and breakfast
313036,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff at Amelia Sky were amazing They were quick with check in and took the time to show us a map of the city and give us lots of coupons to local tourist attractions Staying here was worth it the outdoor pool was beautiful and so were the rooms themselves Would definitely stay here again 
313037,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Hotel was slightly too far out for what we wanted Not a massive problem throughout the day but ideally would have liked to have been more central on an evening , Hotel was excellent staff were extremely helpful pleasant and very polite Very clean Hop on off bus stop close by which gave access to whole city 
313038,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The fact that breakfast was included despite booking com advising it wasn t without paying extra Would have been better to be informed before we went , The spectacular views of the city uninterrupted and just how friendly the staff were 
313039,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The city view from our 10th floor room was relatively obscured by the neighbouring building however we had been offered an upgrade to a more superior sea view room for a price that may have offered less obscured views , This hotel was wonderful There was a very modern feel to it and a high level of professionalism from all the staff The rooftop pool area was fantastic 
313040,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, There was construction around the building The main areas looked dated with all the stainless steel The shower was small The cocktails were expensive compared to other places , The sky lounge view was great 
313041,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Only thing was that we left the room around 11am with please clean room sign and came back around 4pm and it wasnt cleaned yet we didnt report though , Great bed great shower great view
313042,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Pretty basic room Poor lighting in room and tv reception and channel choices were not great not many English speaking channels no CNN , Friendly check in experience Decent view 
313043,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The maid woke me up one day and came straight into the room I work in hospitality so I understand and it didn t dampen the 10 10 review that i stick by , All the staff were so friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome Service is amazing The facilities are excellent and the location is superb if you know a bit about BCN so it s easy to get around I will be returning for leasure for certain and maybe even for business later this year Thank you to all 
313044,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, 1 We had two beds in the room both very narrow cheap economy class overnight sleeping place You cannot call such a bed a peace of furniture other hotels use such things only as an extra bed 2 Very narrow shower place 65 cm see photo and whater runs to the floor making your bathroom full of water and slippery 3 4x10 m swimming pool is good for one two people not for 29 storey hotel 4 When you hear the voices in next room you cannot confirm you are in a 5 star hotel 5 Construction works at day time in swimming pool area is not good This area is empty in early morning and evening the works are to be done in proper time not to distirb clients , Modern high tech design hotel young serious personnel 
313045,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The food was expensive and not the best but everything else was really good Its very corporate but still a nice hotel , We liked the pool the rooms were comfortable the location was really great 
313046,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, A number of things didn t meet expectations When I arrived I was persuaded to upgrade to a superior room with so called lots of extras however the only advantage I could see that we were given a room on a higher level which wasn t needed We asked on the first day if we could change our bathrobes because they were too small they were taken out of the room and never replaced so we couldn t go and use the swimming pool We asked twice for the replacements We asked the front desk to advise us of the nearest pick up point for the city tour bus after arriving at the pick up point which was a ten minute walk away were told by the bus agent that we had booked with another bus company and they didn t pick up from this point so we had to pay 12 Euros for a taxi to take us to a correct pick up point , QUIETNESS OF ROOM AT NIGHT IN A BUSY CITY
313047,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, There were some leftover toiletries in the drawers one drawer was broken and when I advised staff of these I was told this would be sorted when I returned they were still there As a courtesy they offered me a delayed checkout 2 hours after time which was a nice gesture and access to the gym and spa but I just wanted a clean room , Nice modern hotel breakfast was good room was a good size bed comfy Pool area well thought out Staff were friendly facilities in the hotel were good 
313048,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, shower tray was dirty booked room asking for sea view months ago couldnt have one unless upgraded for another 100 euros a night Breakfast too expensive Could not use the pool unless paid extra for the use, very friendly staff location good
313049,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Room was too dark needed a proper light Lack of information in hotel regarding spa phone numbers in the room for reception etc Mini bar didn t shut properley , Breakfast was good and staff where friendly and polite
313050,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The room looked a little tired in comparison to the photos on the website Although there was a kettle in the room there was no tea or coffee provided The shower is lovely and spacious however it is not very powerful and the temperature is temperamental I d suggest getting a taxi to and from the airport as this is approx half the cost of the hotel service , The views out of the rooms floor to ceiling windows of the city on an evening were lovely The bed was very comfy and the room modern The staff were very friendly and observant The location was good for us out of the way of the hustle and bustle but walking distance in a good pair of shoes to the metro La Rambla and the beach 
313051,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Honestly We loved this place, The staff is unreal amazing here The pool area is beautiful and the upstairs restaurants will blow your socks off with views and quality food 
313052,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, Prices are high but not unexpected due to the high quality of the hotel As mentioned in other reviews there was a kettle for the ramen pot noodles but no tea or coffee facilities I was also charged for the minibar but hadn t used anything from it We had used it to store water we had bought rather than pay for the hotels maybe this is why they thought it had been used Something to watch out for As mentioned before the shower leaks a lot but as long as you put 1 2 foot towels down it s not a big problem we left them in the bath each morning for the maid to change for dry ones , Hotel was lovely we had a great stay at the Melia Sky The hotel is further out but it s a quick walk to the metro Poble Nou and cabs cost around 10 to the centre In the summer season I bet it s a perfect location for the beach and using the pool facilities etc The staff were friendly and accommodating It was my partners birthday whilst we were away and the hotel brought us a bottle of Cava and a gorgeous chocolate cake to celebrate which I hadn t asked for so was a thoughtful touch Bed was comfortable and the big windows and view were lovely Overall really happy with our stay and Barcelona was as beautiful as always

313056,Melia Barcelona Sky 4 Sup, The location is a little out of the way all though there is a metro station 5 minutes walk away From there it is around 20 minutes to central Barcelona and 50 minutes to the nou camp, Room lay out is unique and views of city are great Staff are great and de celios restaurant was amazing
