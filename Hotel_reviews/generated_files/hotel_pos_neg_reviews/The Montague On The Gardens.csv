54303,The Montague On The Gardens, Small bathroom ground floor room on busy street so cannot open blinds, Very comfy bed attention to detail location all staff very friendly and efficient 
54304,The Montague On The Gardens, I cannot fault the Hotel , The hotel was a great location for walking around the City area of London the Tower the Globe and the British Museum It is close to banks two metro stations river transport and three of London s main train stations The reception desk staff were excellent and we cannot thank the two concierges enough They made our stay exceptional particularly for a late afternoon checkout and the late long flight back to Australia 
54305,The Montague On The Gardens, Hotel blocked ca 300 GBP more than the price on the bill for a 6 day long stay This amount was not possible for me to access during almost 2 weeks What is the point Is that a standard procedure , Staff was very friendly and helpful especially Lucia during brekfest 
54306,The Montague On The Gardens, The bathroom was quite small compared to the size of our spacious room , The staff was top notch and they actually upgraded our room because it was our anniversary The bed was amazingly comfortable and we loved the charm of the hotel The bar cigar lounge was so cool to hang out in at night 
54307,The Montague On The Gardens, There was no hot water on the night I stayed I had to shower with cold water, The atmosphere the friendly staff and the decor Bathrobe and bed are very comfortable
54308,The Montague On The Gardens, Hmmmm The breakfast could be a bit better But still was very good , I have stayed here before and liked it This time was even better We were upgraded to a great room It is in London and parking is difficult They helped me to get the needed permit to drive in London and helped with parking and helped with tickets to the theatre I have a four year old and the staff was fantastic helping out with him I always love the red apples at the front desk Could not have been a better stay 
54309,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The staff were fantastic and the hotel had great character The leopard bar had a lovely atmosphere Our room was upgraded to the Masters Suite for free and it was such an amazing experience 
54310,The Montague On The Gardens, The only thing which could have been marginally better was the meal My starter was superb but my main course of confit of sea bass was just a little too cold and had to be sent back to be warmed slightly and the accompanying pickled fennel with it was too strong in flavour and overwhelmed the dish But as you see I m quibbling over niceties Otherwise the South African white we had with the meal was excellent We couldn t basically find fault with anything during our stay other than that minor point Everything was superb , We were very kindly upgraded to a junior suite Nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly staff I had requested extra water in my room as l need to drink a lot of this and this was seen to straight away The amenities were excellent The welcome bucket of ice for drinks water in the hot weather was most welcome as were the assorted petit fours and biscuits The bathroom was very well appointed There was live jazz in the bar and this provided a most congenial atmosphere when having a pre dinner drink Everything was superb here and we look forward to coming to stay again when we are next in London We can t thank the staff enough 
54311,The Montague On The Gardens, Tv did not work brilliantly in the room 113 , All staff were extremely friendly and professional from arrival to departure dining room and food superb service excellent and great comfortable rooms 
54312,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, This is one of most charming hotels where I ve stayed The customer service was outstanding my room was small but with all the niceties The food was excellent and I so enjoyed the Leopard cocktail The location is ideal in central London for sightseeing and easy getting around by foot and via the Underground I will definitely visit Montague on the Gardens on my next trip to London

54314,The Montague On The Gardens, Classic single room Single bed would have been better The double bed took up too much room in a somewhat limited space Next doors chatter and movement could clearly be heard ,No Positive
54315,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The room was very comfortable and unique which I like however the most outstanding part of the whole experience was the staff who were incredibly polite friendly and very helpful Beth at reception and Patrick at the door were two of the team that made me stay more enjoyable and I will certainly want to come back thanks to their personable nothing is too much trouble manner 
54316,The Montague On The Gardens, The bathroom was very small and the shower tended to spill all over the floor , Lovely hotel good staff friendly great location Air conditioning worked well which was extra important as it was 31 degrees outside 
54317,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing, A stunning property We always enjoy staying at smaller hotels with a history like this one The location was ideal for our visit and the staff were outstanding We loved having Russell Square just outside the door and the British Museum around the corner Afternoon tea on the terrace is a real bonus 
54318,The Montague On The Gardens, Fixed rain shower no handheld option but that is preference and absolutely a very minor point in the whole experience We definitely choose this hotel again for a next London visit , Amazing service Delicious English breakfast Great location walking distance Covent Garden Soho Room with all comfort and a good bed

54323,The Montague On The Gardens, Our stay was too short Nothing to complain about, Excellent staff though out Very professional service with great attention to detail The Manager and all the staff signed a Card wishing my wife a SPECIAL BIRTHDAY and there were cakes waiting in our room when we returned from the Theatre Lovely touch well done 
54324,The Montague On The Gardens, The only problem was the shower curtain was not totally sealed and water would soak the floor , All staff are friendly and approachable They would assist readily No problem too great Fantastic stay 
54325,The Montague On The Gardens, One of the reasons that we stayed at the hotel was the terrace which was carefree in the past The restaurant overlooking the garden is to be a beach bar from June 1stband the outdoor terrace now serves cream teas Therefore if you want a casual drink and a sit in the sun or just to sit outside for some fresh air this has Now disappeared as an option However these are very early days and we will see what transpires , Very good customer service the staff are excellent 
54326,The Montague On The Gardens, Shower water pressure, Room decor was lovely Great selection of TV channels Bed was extremely comfortable Location was great just next to The British Museum 
54327,The Montague On The Gardens, Rooms on the Garden interior side of building have stairs inside the room It was a bit awkward but I am sure we could have made arrangements to move rooms , The staff was very courteous and helpful at all times There was several areas to eat and socialize inside the Hotel Includes a Restaurant Tea Room Patio and Bar area at the Montague Our room looked out on the garden area Centrally located near the university restaurants and parks

54330,The Montague On The Gardens, We loved staying there There was nothing we didn t like , We loved the selection choices for breakfast especially the juice bar were you can juice your own selection of raw vegetables This hotel had a number of gorgeous areas to eat drink and or enjoy the live piano bar without leaving the hotel All the staff were very friendly and accomodating Will definitely be coming back 
54331,The Montague On The Gardens, the room was tiny A double bed as advertised However I am glad I was by myself since there were no drawers or room to turn around, The staff of course All were so nice and accommodating Willing to help with my wishes A special shout out to Sebastin Cesar Paulus and Patrik The location is excellent as I was able to do a good deal by walking I was celebrating one year cancer free and the reception staff gave me a little present 
54332,The Montague On The Gardens, I liked the decor of the hotel The bedroom was very small although the bed was comfortable I found the staff to be a little over familiar Breakfast disappointing , Comfortable bed nice decor Nice hot bath
54333,The Montague On The Gardens, Poor Extraction in Bathroom , Brilliant location 3 mins from British Museum easy access to west end theatres city and Tottenham Court Road Very helpful staff and House keeping even turned beds down at night which does not happen very often Hotel is currently undergoing external building works so we were upgraded to a suite by way of recompense

54337,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The staff room and breakfast were excellent Lovely complimentary tea and cookies on arrival and the staff arranged for housekeeping to hurry our room for early check in as we arrived sooner than expected 
54338,The Montague On The Gardens, The room was very small though clean and tastefully decorated Hard to say value for money considering the price The breakfast was the same everyday not much choice and no fresh vegetable , The front office staffs were very attentive thoroughly helpful and friendly They make you feel safe and at home The hotel also has a cosy lounge Its location is very convenient a couple of minutes walk from the British Museum 
54339,The Montague On The Gardens, The bed was a bit of a squeeze but okay , Excellent support and efficiency from all staff The well heated cigar terrace complete with blankets was a wonderful discovery 
54340,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, This was a completely good experience We loved our stay The staff were great and extremely helpful We shall stay at this hotel in the future when in London 
54341,The Montague On The Gardens, The only thing to let it down was the small size of the bathroom no real room to move , The staff were excellent there was a nice feel to the hotel and the decor and style were inviting Good food and drink and in particular the bar staff were friendly and always made sure you were looked after I would recommend staying here as I will again 
54342,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The staff and whole experience was fantastic we stay on a regular basis at different London hotels but this has to be by far the best and we will definitely be returning
54343,The Montague On The Gardens, If I had to complain the pillows didn t suit me, The staff are incredible always friendly and helpful The room was maintained twice a day and I always had a little surprise on my pillow when I went to bed Actually forgot my scarf in the room and the concierge ran over on the tube and brought it to me One of the best hotels I have stayed at plus location is perfect

54347,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing Everything was excellent Breakfast was non inclusive so I cannot evaluate the quality of it , The most amazing room decor lovely and cozy rooms Perfect temperature and attentive staff Newspapers delivered to the room each morning right on time Great tv and bathroom A safe choice in every possible way 
54348,The Montague On The Gardens, There was nothing I didn t like except having to leave , As usual the extremely courteous and efficient staff the attention to details We dined one evening with my partners in the restaurant and had a very enjoyable high quality meal Every bedromm is decorated differently with antique desks tapisserie wall paper heavy lined curtains The beds are very comfortable and there is a turn down service

54350,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The staff make it a wonderful place to stay They discovered it was a special anniversary and we found a lovely gesture in our bedroom on returning from a show 
54351,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing everything was thought of and predicted to my taste and needs , I loved the old English kindness and politeness of the staff they were superb and extremely helpful and discreet I loved the taste style beauty and opulence of the decor The quiet rooms and lounges are a true luxury in the middle of busy London The food is fresh plentiful and very tasty superb afternoon tea The rooms are lovely comfortable the bed was so good I slept right through each night in real comfort Truly brilliant staff without their care my stay would not have been the same Thank you And hope to be back soon 
54352,The Montague On The Gardens, Room was bit too small as a Kings Room Ceiling not perfectly isolated could hear people upstairs walking but I know that this is quite usual in old English buildings , Beautiful classic English style hotel just around the corner from the British Museum the shopping district is just 10 mins walk Loved the hotel atmosphere cosy lobby and restaurant Breakfast was nice good selection and great English breakfast corner Staff friendly and always there to help nice personal touch hand written welcome letter from general manager at room Would definitely stay here again 
54353,The Montague On The Gardens, D cor a bit on the old side creaking floors of people walking past your room was the only thing I could fault at this hotel , Overall a lovely hotel the staff at buffet breakfast were amazing and so hospitable reception concierge all very helpful and really nice 
54354,The Montague On The Gardens, The ground floor room was very noisy overhead during the night and rather stuffy I also left my theatre brochure behind in the lounge area at the end of the evening I returned 10 minutes later to be told it had been thrown into the bin Wasn t that impressed with the shrug of the shoulders attitude , Excellent breakfast and concierge service The head waitress at breakfast was trying too hard though with the banter meaning you could hear every exchange she made throughout the breakfast not very English if you know what I mean
54355,The Montague On The Gardens, Bedroom not as advertised certainly no high ceilings on ground floor with cold and drafty floor and window uncomfortable heating system some old furniture and fittings bathroom just ok quite tight with a fixed ceiling shower head but no flexible shower part Basin tab had very little flow bedoom door undercut too big letting too much corridor light in and sound , Very polite staff excellent personal service nice breakfast traditional style hotel with lots of character 
54356,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The whole hotel just oozed with professionalism spefistication and beauty Staff were incredibly friendly organising my partner the birthday boy a happy birthday plate of goodies in his room And Harry Potter muffins as we were seeing Harry Potter that afternoon Such a personal approach to accomdation Fully recommend 
54357,The Montague On The Gardens, The staff was aloof and not welcoming I asked to fix my tv the first night and they never did it I did not feel comfortable here as a single traveler The lobby needs updating it is a bit shabby , The location was central and walkable to covent garden theatre british and other museums 
54358,The Montague On The Gardens, Some of the room was a bit drab Clean but scratches and some minor stains , The staff could not have been friendlier Stayed here whilst our house was renovated with my two one year olds Staff went out their way to help made the twins feel so welcome Wonderful service Breakfast was delightful Highly recommend for families 
54359,The Montague On The Gardens, Breakfast at an additional 20 pounds per person was expensive , Staff are so helpful and friendly Great location Room was charming immaculate and cosy
54360,The Montague On The Gardens, Kindle left behind in room after check out was not available for return to the owner Staff were polite about same but outcome disappointing Bed and room very small , Lovely ambience in bar foyer area Perfect location for British museum Great idea re ski lodge bar outside Staff v apologetic about outcome of missing kindle not returned
54361,The Montague On The Gardens, We found the unusual layout of our room to be charming but the narrow washroom down a set of stairs had a narrow bathtub that would have presented difficulties for less mobile guests , We enjoyed the excellent British breakfast with hot and cold buffet and also had perfectly poached eggs to order every day Location in Bloomsbury is around the corner from the British Museum and a moderate walking distance or short underground ride to many prime visitor locations in Soho and Covent Garden Close to Russell Square subway station Rich sumptuous decor throughout the hotel and in the rooms Quality linens towels and toiletries Staff were always helpful 
54362,The Montague On The Gardens, Tiny room next to the storage rooms a bit noisy in the mornings bathroom needs an upgrade a bit moisty smell, Excellent location extremely warm welcome eg cookies in the room friendly staff
54363,The Montague On The Gardens, The only thing that would have improved my stay would have been to have a swimming pool on site but a really exquisite hotel , The staff were just fabulous so friendly and welcoming courteous and keen to help nothing was too much trouble I enjoyed every minute of my stay in this super hotel All of the meals that I had during my stay breakfast and an evening dinner were first class I would definitely recommend this hotel and really look forward to my next stay at the Montague Thanks team Montague you re just brilliant 
54364,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The question is what didn t we like Everyone was so helpful knew and fulfilled our every need I would highly recommend The Montague on the Gardens 
54365,The Montague On The Gardens, The toilet flush in both our rooms 115 117 did not work very well It was always insufficient to just flush once The bed was too soft and my hubby experienced back ache after 2 nights We were pretty annoyed by the creaking sounds from above our rooms every morning and late in the night , We appreciated the daily replenished sparkling still water in the room The complimentary coffee tea and muffins in the provided in the morning and hot chocolate drink in the afternoon were very enjoyable The staff at the front desk and concierge were also very friendly and helpful 
54366,The Montague On The Gardens, Now this would be being picky the only thing I can fault is that the dressing gowns weren t as soft as the towels but I wasn t bothered at all by that , We were upgraded from a double to a king size room free of charge which was lovely The breakfast in the morning was really nice and all the staff were brilliant Can t fault anything really I enjoyed it so much even got complimentary cookies 
54367,The Montague On The Gardens, The front desk staff were a little preoccupied most of the time not as welcoming as the males at the door and concierge were Room service meals were a bit limited which was sad as being alone I did not feel like going into the inviting dining room by myself , I loved the ambience of the place and the fact that although it was so central it was very quiet The room was lovely and the d cor was entrancing Room service cleaning and restoring order to the bedroom was better than anywhere else I have ever experienced prompt and efficient I loved this place and will definitely return again already telling all my friends and relations this is the place to stay when in London 
54368,The Montague On The Gardens, Breakfast not included in price Single room cramped perhaps a 3 4 bed instead of double would make a difference Only 1 bottle of still water available Bathroom a bit cramped , Generally service reasonable though my room was cramped Bit pricey for me especially as breakfast was extra Single occupancy expensive 
54369,The Montague On The Gardens, I had a steak which was quite tough and the food was slightly overpriced , I booked a single room but I had a small double Small touchs including the card from the manager accompanying the fresh biscuits were lovely 
54370,The Montague On The Gardens, Bar prices extortionate even by London rates Room was small but it was comfy , Staff excellent Bed incredibly comfy and food delightful Location brilliant Just a stones throw from The British Museum 
54371,The Montague On The Gardens, It is not the fault of the staff hiw complicated the telephone situation is in London It is forever changing and the telephone companies have no live people to talk to or ask advice from The staff did their best to sort out outdated Homephonenumbers and mobiles The prefixes are all different phoning to London from abroad compared to phoning inside London Also the staff of the hotel cannot be responsible for lack of public benches I prefer to walk 5 to 10 km at a time rather than tubing or bussing with my oystercard Walking is the thing to do in this gorgeous architecture and gardening London is My favorite town for 50 years And I have known them all for a long time , The plants were abundant and well cared for plantwalls and potplants e g palms and zamioculcas plants Attractive dried flower decorations were to be seen in the foyer and public areas This is important for me as I originally picked the red carnation hotels because they won the award for the best flower decorated hotels 20 years ago They then had beautiful big bouquets everywhere The present situation with potplants everywhere is very pleasant Also the cook makes attractive food plates and tasty and good value The looks interior and food in short have improved vastly since I stayed here the last time May 2014 
54372,The Montague On The Gardens, The drinks are pretty eye watering prices even by London standards , I booked on the day and was unexpectedly upgraded to a lovely King deluxe room Wonderfully comfortable bed very spacious tastefully decorated room Excellent macaroni cheese from room service Great service too this is a very classy hotel 
54373,The Montague On The Gardens, The gym was a tiny room with three machines and the temperature was almost below freezing It could do in a pinch but not really a gym , Loved the staff and their care full service Loved the location It was quiet and the windows in the rooms open very important for me to get fresh air 
54374,The Montague On The Gardens, The first room we were given didn t match our expectations but the staff very quickly remedied the problem with a room switch , The room was very clean quiet and tastefully decorated We appreciated the free bottled water each day as well as the fine quality bath soaps and the luxurious linens on the comfortable bed This is a very well run hotel and the staff make guests feel welcome and looked after 
54375,The Montague On The Gardens, Overhead shower in bath was fine but no lower shower attachment , Helpful friendly staff comfortable room and bed Good choice and quality of food at breakfast 
54376,The Montague On The Gardens, The floors make a bit of noise because it is an old building I had no problems with it did not wake up or anything but take it into account , The staff is fantastic so friendly and helping Rooms are comfortable and very clean On first look from the outside I thought it was just another typical London hotel but it is a true gem a great combination of new and old The location is also great next to the British museum and it is a five minute walk to Russel Square where the Piccadilly line stops direct connection to Heathrow 
54377,The Montague On The Gardens, I couldn t fault anything in this hotel, The staff were fab polite helpful the room was lovely the bed was so comfortable I love that fresh milk is available fo tea in the room Lovely hotel
54378,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing, I have never been more pleased with a hotel as I was with The Montague EVERYONE there was so friendly courteous accommodating The hotel is my perfect kind of hotel boutique Lovely decor quite charming The staff all knew my name greeted me with warmth remembered what coffee and cocktail I liked I am definitely going back there when I am in London 
54379,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, It was wonderful Especially the staff VERY helpful with traveling in the city and tickets to Stonehenge I loved your hotel and will recommend it to my friends Laurie Sullivan
54380,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, The hotel really met my expectation with its design and character Everyone at the hotel were pleasant and always willing to help Our room was well kept Even our transfer service which the hotel arranged for us was on schedule I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family 
54381,The Montague On The Gardens, Oops the above should be in this box , The hotel was lovely but sadly our other friends booked with travelogue and got a much better deal with champagne in room better rooms and breakfast for less than we paid just for the room so rather upsetting 
54382,The Montague On The Gardens, Room was small Could only just about get around the bed Couldnt sit at dressing table as partner couldn t get past , Bed was very comfy Room was spotlessly clean staff very friendly and helpful
54383,The Montague On The Gardens, The room could be a little more spacious but I must admit I booked a regular one , The staff were extremely polite and efficient The bed was very confortable and the room service was excellent Breakfast was of high quality and nicely served The hotlel has an overall atmosphere of distinction and calm The location is super for those interested in the British Museum the University area Senate house University College Warburg Institute etc and it is also quite near to useful bus stations and to a tube station Russell Sq 
54384,The Montague On The Gardens, Rooms are on the smallish side particularly the least expensive Restaurant is good but not great , Lovely traditional 18th C property converted to a boutique hotel Common rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable Staff is pleasant accommodating The restaurant tea room overlooking the gardens is a delight Easy access to Piccadilly tube and many bus lines Virtually next to the British Museum 
54385,The Montague On The Gardens, The size of the double size bed is really small When i asked about larger beds i was told that they were at king size rooms But the bed itself was comfortable At booking com the rooms we saw had nice decoration which i thought was standard in all rooms but our room had very classical decoration and in fact bathroom did not reach to even 3 stars for me However it was always clean , Breakfast and food in general are delicious Staff at the restaurant are very very professional and friendly at the same time Kudos to staff The lobby are garden and winter garden are cute I really enjoyed the atmosphere close to russell square station to which you reach with a short walk through a park by walking around 5 7 minutes and 3 4 stops away from oxford and piccadilly circus 
54386,The Montague On The Gardens, I didn t quite like the breakfast too much stirred food and bread was not that special but maybe that was typical English breakfast and this is just a matter of cultural differences I m anyhow happy that there were also a lot of fruits available Service at breakfast was very good overall but surprisingly there was quite a lot of variation with coffee quality it was lovely and freshly brewed in the first morning then on the other almost cold and not that fresh at all , Location is really excellent nearby Covent Garden and Oxford street yet the place is really peaceful and quiet Staff was very attendant and service very good 
54387,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, This was my second time staying at the Montague on the Gardens which should indicate my pleasure with the first stay There really is nothing to critique from the location of the hotel to the food served the comfort of the rooms and above all the superlative service 
54388,The Montague On The Gardens, nothing, the hotel is beautiful great location across the road from the british museum staff were superb very attentive and professional room was spotless and great breakfast 
54389,The Montague On The Gardens, Room was really too small couldn t even fit in with our luggage bags The heavy drapery doesn t help with the feel of the room size either Probably too expensive for what you get The location is okay if you want a quiet place The only close attraction was the British museum the rest requires travel by tube or walking it out , Breakfast was nice helpful staff location was good since it s just next to the British museum The terrace is lovely for an afternoon tea 
54390,The Montague On The Gardens, It was hard to get good black coffee at breakfast breakfast buffet food choices were good but not quite up to the standard of hotels in this price range The gym is VERY small , This is a very comfortable small hotel with an individual character and in a great location With very few exceptions the staff are wonderful The restaurant serves very good food 
54391,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing at all , Excellent hotel staff were professional courteous nothing was too much trouble My husband and I will definitely be staying there again We have stayed at the Rubens Hotel which belongs to the same group 
54392,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, We were surprised and delighted with a room upgrade upon arrival Our suite was gorgeous very elegant and comfortable I never wanted to get out of that amazing bed However it was the little things that really impressed us Nice toiletries free newspapers turn down service which came with a free afternoon gift lip balm one night chocolates the next bags carried up to our room offered to be stored on checkout and taxi organised there was no need for us to ask staff also suggested the best times for the taxi so we wouldn t miss our flight There was a nice room service menu with items like homemade chicken noodle soup and gourmet hotdogs We enjoyed the room service both nights very delicious Breakfast was included and was also of a high standard Nothing was too much trouble for the staff The location was perfect we walked to all the major London attractions from the hotel We couldn t fault our stay it was outstanding We would come back here for future stays in London Should also mention our room was perfectly clean 
54393,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, Hotel staff were always helpful and attentive The room was clean and comfortable Due to the location in London it was very quiet at night and very convenient for facilities
54394,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing It was the best hotel we have ever stayed at in London, Warm welcome Attentive personal service Attention to detail eg home made biscuits in our room fresh lemonade available in the lounge Interesting d cor Very quiet rooms Excellent afternoon tea served on the terrace 
54395,The Montague On The Gardens, The shower head is right overhead if you don t want to get your hair wet it s not a great experience, This is a lovely elegant hotel with exceptional service and a delicious full English breakfast 
54396,The Montague On The Gardens, Unable to comment, I have stayed a the Riz Savoy the Hilton and man other hotels in London but I have never given ten out of ten I could not find fault with this establishment Excellent staff rooms food and room Thank you to the housekeeper who provided me with non feathered bedding even though she was going off shift 
54397,The Montague On The Gardens, Liked everything, This hotel is amazing from beginning to end The staff is so helpful they started us with nice afternoon tea had great concierge service and the room had so many little tiny extras that just added to the experience Just super
54398,The Montague On The Gardens, Could maybe have varied the breakfasts a little but this is only a minor thing, Friendly helpful staff Lovely building and ambience Excellent rooms and huge bed 
54399,The Montague On The Gardens, Old building so floors were creaky and other guests footsteps were loud to be expected in historical structures small when compared to other big city hotels in this price range but again this is not the fault of the management Prices at the bar very high Internet was poor Overall a great place but I think it s overpriced, Excellent location friendly and highly professional staff comfortable good size bed modern bathroom clean and luxurious towels daily nice touches in room such as sweets and biscuits civilised bar unique and traditional in design cosy and away from the drama of Soho but close enough to walk to it
54400,The Montague On The Gardens, The rooms are very small and ours not particularly clean Also the noise of people walking on the floor above and outside our room was very annoying ,No Positive
54401,The Montague On The Gardens, The practice carried out by a lot of London establishments of automatically adding 12 5 service charge to the bill mandatory and then a line below on the bill for gratuity tip , Courteous friendly staff and excellent service Lovely rooms all different all nicely decorated with little extras included Good location close to tube station and street not too noisy Food high quality although a little expensive Overall top quality hotel 
54402,The Montague On The Gardens, The room was a bit tight but exquisitely decorated and laid out , Everything was perfect a glass of chilled lemonade on arrival hottest day in London outstanding staff attention to the smallest detail it was an absolute treat to stay The box of handmade biscuits and personal note from the Manager says it all 
54403,The Montague On The Gardens, Just personal taste The drapes are sometimes too heavy and ornate and make a small room look smaller , very comfortable bed Excellent service especially all the front desk concierges and staff 
54404,The Montague On The Gardens, Perhaps a little too much furniture in the room a small table and chair in the anti room which block access to the bedroom was perhaps unnecessary Very limited channels to watch on the television which was a right performance before your reached the BBC channels , We didn t have breakfast here as has a meeting at the Wolseley booked for 08 30 hour Ate snacks here and they were very well presented only criticism would be the chips could of done with a little longer cooking
54405,The Montague On The Gardens,No Negative, Friendly efficient staff Upgraded on the day without asking Great room 2 bathrooms Comfy bed free toiletries Huge choice at breakfast Air conditioning quiet location

54407,The Montague On The Gardens, I would appreciate a handheld showerhead to complement the rainshower , Perfect location genuinly friendly staff great breakfast comfy bed cosy room
54408,The Montague On The Gardens, In light of the cigar bar significant portions of the hotel smelled like old smoke The room was typically tiny London but in need of an overall update Thought this was very overrated all things considered , Location was outstanding 
54409,The Montague On The Gardens, Did not use any facilities so review is based solely on bedroom , Chose the hotel for its location and being near to the Shaftesbury theatre Comfortable bedroom although small 
54410,The Montague On The Gardens, There was nothing we didn t like about the Montague on the Garden It s got its British character it s small and comfy the wifi worked really well and we were totally entertained by the internet at night the beds were great the room super quiet , Best location Next to the British Museum the 98 bus line the Piccadilly Underground line that connects you to Heathrow Airport With good shoes you re in walking distance of Covent Gardens Getting the Oyster card and using the buses and underground you can go anywhere easily It puts you where the tourist mobs are not but where you can join them if you want 
54411,The Montague On The Gardens, we had a junior suite and the rooms was small and limited space 2 toilets was a waste as we only used 1 the extra space of the 2nd toilet would be much better incorporated into either bed or lounge the room was noisy anf the ceiling not noise insulated from people walking around their room on the floor above, position of hotel

54417,The Montague On The Gardens, I object to booking a hotel only to find that certain areas are then reserved for private functions Either the hotel has a contract with the customer to provide certain amenities or not It can t have it both ways and advertise things which are then not available or if it does it should offer a discount on the price Other than that policy issue the staff were wonderful ,No Positive

54422,The Montague On The Gardens, I can t think of anything that was not perfect We went on to Madrid and the concierge spent a long time on the phone trying to get through to Iberia for boarding passes for us , we loved the atmosphere we felt as if we were in a family home the lounge was so inviting the staff was the best We were in London to be with our granddaughter who was in school nearby so we had a lot of visits from her and her friends and we were treated so well Our son daughter in law granddaughter s parents were also in London at that time so we really enjoyed the hospitality of the staff and lounge Coffee and croissants delicious The room was small but had the most delightful window seat that overlooked the rear courtyard I liked the black and white decor it made the room seem much larger Each afternoon when we returned the housekeeping staff knocked on the door to ask if anything was needed We would return 
54423,The Montague On The Gardens, In our opinion it could not be improved , The service was outstanding Staff seemed genuinely interested in making our hotel experience memorable All the little touches were very much appreciated We will definitely be returning in the Summer and recommending this hotel to friends and family

54427,The Montague On The Gardens, Rooms are quite small unless you get the suite, Great location Walking distance to a number of places Beds and pillows were nice and fluffy Hotel is clean and well maintained 
54428,The Montague On The Gardens, Nothing to mention, The staff were all very friendly and helpful and moved us to a larger room when we said the original room booked was rather small Food was good and the location was ideal walked to most venues but it was also close to underground stations as well if needed Would re book at this lovely hotel again

54436,The Montague On The Gardens, I thought the breakfast was a little too pricey at 20 person although it was very good and the service charges were 12 5 , The rooms were clean and comfortable and the bed was 6ft wide did not hear any noise at all even though we were over looking the street The attention to detail was excellent and the staff were extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble we would definitely book again if we visited London again as it made our holiday 
54437,The Montague On The Gardens, nothing all good cost ok for a good london hotel quiet and not great for small children I suspect as all adult orientated hotel with comfortable sophisticated bar and excellent restaurant although my children would have loved the free cookies in my room , very friendly wonderful staff very clean extremely comfortable beds excellant food quiet and good sleep wonderful location next to british museum

54452,The Montague On The Gardens, I found it really odd that upon check in staff were asking to charge me an extra 100GBP for things I haven t ordered that they plan to refund me with after I leave They were also a bit inflexible impatient and rigid in the way they were communicating the request as if it s something that they re entitled to and that of course I should do it It s a minor thing though and I d probably stay in the hotel again if I am in town , Amazing location beautiful rooms convenient location loved it

54465,The Montague On The Gardens, The price How can this be justified We booked a classic king on the basis of images presented on the website Although we were given a complimentary upgrade we thought the bathroom very cramped for two people it is smaller than my home bathroom of approx 6x4 5 ft The bedroom had no real seating area or table It had 2 chairs a desk and a large couch we couldn t fathom its use In our view the couch area would be better used for a proper seating area table and chairs for room service So 600 was not good value for 2 nights , We have been previous guests at the hotel We returned as we like the public rooms furnishings and atmosphere
