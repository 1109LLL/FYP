40185,H tel Square Louvois, The staff was kind but not necessarily overly welcoming The experience was what you might expect from a large chain We booked a family room via booking com my confirmation from the hotel showed one double room They quickly responded and assured me we had a family room What we actually had were two rooms next to each other Absolutely great for us as our kids are older but families with younger kids might not have been happy We knew when we booked this hotel that it is in Japan town it takes some searching to find non Asian meals near by , The rooms are nicely decorated with current key amenities A good balance of close enough to Paris icons price and aesthetically pleasing The small pool makes a nice wind down after a busy day 
40186,H tel Square Louvois, Nothing, The comfort level of the rooms was exceptional and the location perfect Staff were accommodating and friendly and the style of the building interesting and elegant
40187,H tel Square Louvois, When we booked it said there was parking available which technically there is but it s 3 streets away and costs 40 a day , The staff were fantastic so friendly and helpful it made all the difference to our trip Super comfy bed quiet street quiet rooms you didn t hear a sound and amazing location 
40188,H tel Square Louvois, Nothing , A perfect stay staff were fabulous and the hotel is immaculate Beautifully comfortable bed good sized well appointed rooms for Paris and fabulous safe location near most of the central Paris sights good for walking around Will definitely use again when in Paris Thank you Hotel Square Louvois 
40189,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, Immaculately clean very central and wonderful staff all hotels should be like this Rooms clearly designed by someone who travels good lighting power points where you want them and the most comfortable bed of my 4 week trip around Europe Breakfast was delicious and good value for the range of options on offer All staff I encountered from the front desk to house keeping were very professional and obliging 
40190,H tel Square Louvois, Only that they forgot to wake us at 4am for a flight but we made it to airport but nothing to complain about at this hotel, Incredibly helpful happy staff unusual for France Nothing was a problem even a turn down service with cookies I love this hotel would say of my times in Paris this was my favourite for many reasons 
40191,H tel Square Louvois, Rooms are small but that s what you get in Paris Not a big deal for us , Good price for the location The pool was lovely a very nice place to relax Opening between 9am and 10pm 
40192,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, Attentive and caring staff took note of our itiniary and after it had rained asked if we still had visited the sites naming the ones we had shared earlier in the day such familiarity does not go unnoticed The pool was a highlight after a day walking the streets of Paris and the room amenities and decor simply outstanding 
40193,H tel Square Louvois, Very minor issue not located near the main m tro lines so visiting any place will require some transfer s , Location in the middle of the Oriental district so Japanese Vietnamese and Japanese restaurants shops and eateries galore Located near the Louvre the Tuilleries the Galleries Lafayette and the Op ra and at a 30 minute walk from Saint Germain the Eiffel Tower and the Grand Palace Facilities hotel boasts a lovely in door pool which is small but utterly charming Free coffee tea facilities in the modern light rooms Lovely multi lingual staff 
40194,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, The care taken by all workers from the night attendant reception to the breakfast chef and house cleaner made our stay very enjoyable We will certainly stay again 
40195,H tel Square Louvois, Nothing I want to stay here again , Nice location few minutes walk to Louvre and La Fayette lots of Japanese and Korean restaurants Nice decoration Nice staff Nice room 
40196,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful It was a relatively short walk from the Gard du Nord station Great locations and lots of great food options within a short distance Hotel room was great the mattress was amazing 
40197,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, The hotel was close to many of the attractions I wanted to see especially the Louvre Museum Although the room was small it was fine for me and I was only there to sleep They also have tea in the afternoon which was a nice break 
40198,H tel Square Louvois, Nothing, The staff here are exceptional Youssef went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic The breakfasts are very good and pool is lovely at the end of a long day 
40199,H tel Square Louvois, Breakfast was poor paid 40 for a couple of sausages some half Cooked scrambled egg and a bit of bacon my partner had jam on toast I wouldn t even pay that at home for a decent cooked breakfast Air con didn t work, Staff were more than helpful and very friendly room clean good choice of films fresh towels comfy bed
40200,H tel Square Louvois, Everything is perfect , This hotel is perfect Everyone was so nice and we enjoyed going to the spa after a long day Would definetely stay there again when staying in Paris 
40201,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, Reception staff was extremely friendly and supportive Every night they gave us some surprise candies Birthday surprise was amazing Perfect small pool in the basement we were the only ones there most of the time Everyhting was clean elegant Nice colours and interior desings Everything was great Only one thing that might be solved those old windows let the street sounds come in the roomduring nights But after long walking in Paris every day it was not a problem 
40202,H tel Square Louvois, Poor service from staff Pre paid for hotel but charged a 60 deposit without being told on arrival Room was very hot Staff were not particularly helpful English wasn t great Housekeeper walked into room at 9 30am without knocking the day before she didn t come until 4pm Stale orange juice by the pool area Small room with almost no wardrobe space and no drawers or cupboards for clothes Poor value for money ,No Positive
40203,H tel Square Louvois, The only think I didn t like was that at checkin the staff didn t inform us that breakfast wasn t included in room rate This wasn t so clear through out booking It didn t matter given the quality of the food we actually had but would have been nice to know from the outset , There was not much to dislike about this hotel We spent four days here and it was terrific Make sure you get to know Moussa who was one of the most friendliest and warmest hotel staff members we came across in the four weeks we spent in and out of hotels throug Europe The complimentary tea and brownie in the afternoon was a great touch Staff were very helpful with recommendations to good eats close by 
40204,H tel Square Louvois, The staff On the day of our arrival we are carrying 4 heavy suitcases and the concierge hostess did not offer any help at all She walked us to our room with me and my mother trailing our heavy luggages to our door Also the cleanliness of the room undoubtedly needs improvements On the day we checked in to the room we found hair and few visible dust on the bed linen Worst of all other concierge lady didn t not make us feel welcomed I felt subtly racially discriminated and I ve lived abroad for more than 8 years For us it s an unfortunate choice , Location 
40205,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, Loved new chic stylish and clean room The staff was warm and helpful Afternoon tea is a nice touch The indoor pool was very clean relaxing and located in a cool cave life stone space Great location near a beautiful park and walking distance to a lot of great restaurants in the 1st and 2nd arr I would stay here again on my next visit 
40206,H tel Square Louvois, At checkout they did not now that we allready payd all incl citytax so they wanted to add citytax to the bill and they put 2 breakfast instead of 1 on the bill So if we were not to be focused we could have payed abt 90 eur more But still the staff was greate just needs a bit improving of the inner comunication ,No Positive
40207,H tel Square Louvois, No bar however they are in the process of installing one , Staff is super friendly Centrally located Rooms are just the right size functional clean luxurious 
40208,H tel Square Louvois, Pool was a little cold, Staff were amazing Love the free film choice on the TV can get UK channels Great facilities pool looked amazing and was very relaxing
40209,H tel Square Louvois, I really didn t have any issues with this hotel If i was to be really picky the pool could have been warmer However this is hardly a deal breaker , The staff are what make this beautiful little boutique style hotel so great from offering free maps of the area and giving directions to various places to offering umbrellas for the day free tea coffee when you arrive and ensuring you have everything you need for your stay The hotel offer a free tea time which is from 4pm 6pm and is ideal when you ve been walking all day and need a quick pick me up before getting ready for dinner later on Location is excellent approx ten mins walk to the Louvre and round the corner from the Opera and Lafayette department store The underground pool is the icing on the cake Don t hesitate to book your stay here 
40210,H tel Square Louvois, Everything was perfect, Very stylish interior great service very attentive and friendly stuff Beautiful pool Would definitely recommend Will be happy to return 
40211,H tel Square Louvois, Room was small In the breakfast room there was chaos many uncleaned tables 20min waiting for warm food all the time many things missing , Very cosy and beautiful hotel looks like new Our room was small but very nice there was everything we needed Good breakfast and nice neighbourhood 10min walk from Louvre museum 
40212,H tel Square Louvois, Well as I sad the bed was just ok mattress was not really convenient Thanks God the pillows and blanket were fine , The hotel is definitely worth to be considered for stay It s brand new new furniture fresh and very cosy bathrooms no that hotel smell inside And the hotel is not big so it gives him 1 in my rating The room itself we stayed in 407 was nice not big but ok Equipped with kettle and nespresso machine with free tea and coffee in the room Bathroom is really cool with full size bath not just a shower TV is ok has a set of films available in different languages Internet is super fast in the whole hotel not just at the lobby Bed is ok Staff was very polite and friendly explained everything recommended the restaurant next block which was nice the hostess even went to the room with us and showed everything Location of the hotel is wonderful close to the metro well what a hotel can be far from metro in Paris 7 mins from Louvre by one street near the square with hotel 
40213,H tel Square Louvois, Nothing Flawless , Incredible staff who went out of their way to make your stay enjoyable Clean rooms Great facilities Absolutely incredible breakfast with great range of pastries fruit yoghurt meats cheese etc Absolutely recommend this hotel 5 stars We stayed here for our honeymoon and they absolutely spoilt us silly Such amazing service from every staff member we met Location was fantastic with 3km walking radius to every attraction in Paris Stay here and don t even waste yours your time trying to find somewhere better 
40214,H tel Square Louvois, The hotel still needs to fix some things to be on point For example their Wifi is quite poor which makes it difficult to work if you re visiting for business I also found the breakfast a bit limited and expensive for what it was , It s a brand new hotel very well located boutique style which is usually more comfortabble and cosy 
40215,H tel Square Louvois, No complaints Everything was as expected , We liked everything about this hotel The location is wonderful the room was very clean and the stuff very polite and helpful Special thanks to Erwin and Matilde

40217,H tel Square Louvois,No Negative, The aesthetics are impeccable Location is right in the heart of everything The staff were super professional and friendly After leaving the hotel my girlfriend realized she had left her robe hanging in the room The hotel found it and shipped it to us in the States Top notch all around 
40218,H tel Square Louvois, the pillow is one of thosse cheap thick sponge foam things and the comforter same so very uncomfortable Given so much care was given to other details in the hotel its too bad they couldnt have gone just a bit better on the bedding , Location small hotel and price at a deep discount from rack rate whichh I d probably never pay well equipped even a Nesspreso machine in the room not common in France and the fact the hotel is a month old all made it good
40219,H tel Square Louvois, Never saw an Hotel of 350 euro with no laundry bag The room was really TOO SMALL The bathroom was so small that if I opened the door I could not use the washbasin The room floor was not very clean and the furnishings really poor for such a price , Only location is very good The Hotel is very new one month old but they ve chosen very poor furnishings for 350 euro per day 
40220,H tel Square Louvois, Pool hours could be later and earlier only 10am 8pm Need more towels by pool and hooks for robes and towels by pool No ice at all should get a small ice machine in reception Tv system has a few minor bugs like no music , All staff very friendly and helpful pool was great location central and interesting for shopping Asian restaurants especially Japanese and Korean Quiet street 
40221,H tel Square Louvois, The alarm at night but the staff made up for it and hopefully they can fix the glitch A very minor point they close the fire doors at night but I got up early one day and also during the alarm it s ok to push but there is no handle to pull those doors I opened by pulling the door stopper all the way at the top can add a handle for people to pull , Great hotel very new decoration is very chic the swimming pool is really cool Location is great 3 mins to a metro station walking distance to many attractions Lots of restaurants nearby Staff very friendly The alarm went off on both nights which was annoying at first but got a handwritten apology card from the hotel along with a jar of candy that was a very nice gesture Loved my stay Hopefully they can fix the alarm and also the cabinets may need a bit more air venting can still smell the newly decorated smell Coffee machine and kettle in the room free water in the lobby 
40222,H tel Square Louvois, The toilet door had windows which let the light in and woke us up in morning Not major issue but could be easily fixed with a blind etc, Staff very friendly Bed and decor great Pool in basement nice but area should be improved so a little warmer with pegs for dressing gown etc
