262308,La Villa des Ternes, I couldn t afford the rates during the conference days , The staff was extra helpful including booking an airport transfer for us They were helpful with directions to walk to Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysee The location was near the conference venue but as I was there the three days before the conference started I could afford to stay here 
262309,La Villa des Ternes, I book a superior room and was surprised that it was too small In fact I payed more for the small corridor in front of the bathroom that it s useless, The location
262310,La Villa des Ternes, Location wasn t perfect but only a short 10min trip to the centre of Paris where the main attractions are I upgraded to the superior room which was JUST big enough to move around the bed comfortably I wouldn t like to see the size of the standard rooms if that was a superior The en suite was a good size though , The hotel is in very good condition and is modern clean The king size bed superior room was comfortable and the en suite was excellent and spacious however the space around the bed was just adequate I searched for a while reading multiple reviews before booking this hotel and for the price vs standard of the hotel there isn t much better however if I visit Paris again I think I would sacrifice hotel quality for a better location walking distance from main attractions for the same price Overall I would score this hotel 8 5 10
262311,La Villa des Ternes, Sound insulation with the street was outstandingly poor Far too noisy Disapointing breakfast Is it that difficult to get really fresh bakeries , Overall good quality
262312,La Villa des Ternes, Bed is typically french quite a small size , Very good quality hotel comfortable if you are about to visit Palais des Congres as it is 5min walk Same distance to metro line 1 but you can also reach Champs Elysees by walking in 20 min We were surprised that although the room was located into a busy street there was no noise in the room Also curtains were perfectly blacking out 
262313,La Villa des Ternes, Parking is at neighbour hotel Le M ridien with a 25 day voucher , Modern clean and comfortable room Nice bathroom Quiet despite being a street facing room 
262314,La Villa des Ternes, The only complaint was the eggs were a bit rubbery , Really enjoyed the breakfast selection many things to eat Enjoyed the fresh orange and grapefruit juice All the trappings of a delicious petit dejeuner 
262315,La Villa des Ternes, Horrible weather in Paris during our stay , Clean room and facilities very friendly staff excellent location for visiting Fondation Louis Vuitton at Bois de Boulogne Great restaurants in the neighborhood parking at 25 Euro per day 
262316,La Villa des Ternes,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel with great location and kind staff Although internet connection was a little bit poor everything was perfect especially cleanness I strongly recommend this hotel 
262317,La Villa des Ternes, Wifi didn t any work any moment service wasn t good at all not what I payed for very unhappy In the description is said the location was close to many things it wasn t ,No Positive
262318,La Villa des Ternes, The only thing is the size of the rooms are so small the cupboard does Not open all the way the bed is too close And in the guest book they said they can post mail for you but when i asked the front desk they said they cant cuz their is only one staff member at the front desk they should get a concierge , Location is perfect
262319,La Villa des Ternes, The bedroom was very hot and we were told that there is no air conditioning in the winter The only air is through the balcony door which we did not want to keep open at night , Very clean bedroom and facilities 
262320,La Villa des Ternes, Internet connectivity could be slightly improved on the 3rd floor that s all It s good downstairs , This is a fantastic place to stay in Paris In fact it s the best hotel I have stayed in so far in Paris and I have been here many times Spotlessly clean room comfortable bed and very quiet Friendly staff This place is great when you have a conference in Palais de Congres but also close to Arc de Triomph Public transport will bring you anywhere from here For great Italian dinner go to La Casa Di Sergio just down the road at 77 Avenue des Ternes Airport bus from CDG stops just around the corner 
262321,La Villa des Ternes, Breakfast can be improve for the price we pay, The bedroom was big nicely decorated clean Close to the subway and Porte Maillot Palais des Congr s Staff is very nice 
262322,La Villa des Ternes, good insulation from street but a few noisy neighbors after 23 00 one night made me think more about soundproofing from corridor , very satisfied good service at front desk
262323,La Villa des Ternes, It is a little tight in the top floor single room if you are bringing a lot of luggage , I like the modern decor and the staff was very helpful and willing to make my stay easy and so fun 
262324,La Villa des Ternes, The workspace foldout table is very small and with the chair one can hardly move due to the lack of space An Ottoman or a chair witOUT armrests instead of the comfy chair would have been better , Very convenient if attending a conference at the Palais de Congres Staff particularly frienly and helpful 
262325,La Villa des Ternes, Wifi was average Also the area around the hotel at night wasn t very safe , Good location only 10 min walk to arc de triumphe Modern rooms and kept clean

262332,La Villa des Ternes, Nothing , Newly renovated rooms Helpful reception staff with good English my French is nursery level Close to shops and eateries at the convention centre
262333,La Villa des Ternes, The optional breakfast is over priced and without doubt the worst coffee I ve ever tasted in France I only did that once Plenty of nearby places for a continental breakfast a much better option , Polite staff comfortable room almost next door to the Palais des Congres where I needed to be If you re travelling Eurostar it s a direct 2 25 min bus ride Route 43 from the Gare du Nord to almost outside A lot cheaper and only 5 10 mins longer than a cab Direct coach service from CDG Airport stops right around the corner Porte Maillot Metro not too away

262339,La Villa des Ternes, The room was tiny Absolutely minuscule The bed was a queen sized bed and pressed up against the wall on one side and there was barely enough room to move around it I was disappointed as it did not look like I imagined from the pictures Also the window to the road outside was not double glazed so you could always hear the traffic , The location was good for the Paris Marathon and for sightseeing 5 minute walk to Port Maillot metro stop on Ligne 1 The staff were very friendly and helpful and the place was clean and pleasantly decorated The bathroom was modern clean and with a great shower
