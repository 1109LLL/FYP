190107,The Justin James Hotel, We chose this hotel because we had stayed a few years ago but we now know that we paid well over the website tariff for this stay Very disappointed that no breakfast was included Staff in the hotel and cafe were very unhelpful There was no information in the room about breakfast options When we asked at reception where breakfast was served we were told through that door which was marked dining room but nothing else was explained When we went through in the morning it was door into a health food cafe and the options for breakfast were from the quite specialist cafe menu with matching prices No option for e g toast and cereal and the cost for coffee and tea was ridiculous for a hotel breakfast When we queried the menu explaining that we were hotel guests we were told quite rudely that it was up to us to choose from the menu and pay full price We went to another cafe round the corner and paid a reasonable price for a simple breakfast We will not be back , Location ideal for railway station underground and shops 
190108,The Justin James Hotel, Climbing a narrow staircase up two floors with heavy bags No lift and no offer of assistance We re in our upper sixties The only way to take a shower was kneeling in the bath head jammed against the angled ceiling , Adjacent free parking Spotlessly clean
190109,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Very convenient location for visit to Wimbledon Small amount of off street parking Technically no restaurant at the property but good choice of reasonably priced breakfast fare available at adjoining cafe with communicating door from the hotel Staff friendly and helpful 
190110,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Really great little find perfect for going to Wimbledon Staff were extremely kind and helpful The room I was in was spotlessly clean modern and bright Advertised as single but the bed was a large single for sure On the main road but really not too noisy at all Breakfast at the cafe next door was superb again lovely and clean place lovely decor you can also sit outside Not too expensive either for London 10 out of 10 If I get luckly enough to get tickets for Wimbledon again I will definitely be back here 
190111,The Justin James Hotel, I wish I could have sat up in bed more comfortably to watch TV at night , the room was well refurbished clean and had all the neccessities provided generously such as in addition to the tea coffee milk 2 types of sugar a chocolate sachet drink and a biscuit was provided each day
190112,The Justin James Hotel, The bathroom needed an airing to freshen the air but it was a particularly hot day so understandable Perhaps an option of breakfast to go for early leavers would be a real bonus but that s just an idea , Fantastic find We needed a place to stay near enough to Clapham Common to make an early start for the London to Brighton bike ride and were fortunate to find this Very easy parking at the hotel and an easy stroll into Wimbledon for a great choice of places to eat or drink or shop The owner couldn t be more friendly or helpful and had even put a fan in our room which was a lovely gesture and helped a little on a day that was in the 30s The room was very clean and though compact had everything we needed 
190113,The Justin James Hotel, The facts and websites introduction are slightly different For example their website said that most of their rooms have shower bathtub but it isn t true The staff told me that only the family room has a bathtub Moreover the website also said that they provide toiletries but they only have shampoo and conditioners no body wash Last but not least I wrote to them asked for a room with a bathtub they replied yes but when I got there they provided me with a room without a bathtub Which was disappointing and annoying , The breakfast is nice and the bed is comfortable The wi fi is stable and fast The location is great only 5 minutes walk to the station 
190114,The Justin James Hotel, Room 20 is a shoebox I ve stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years on business trips I ve always been impressed Spotless rooms comfortable beds and good location However this room did not live up to my expectations It was the last room available when I booked so I was aware there was no en suite which to be fair I ve always booked before However the bathroom was on a different floor and my room did not have space for a sink ,No Positive
190115,The Justin James Hotel, we had a huge issue with the late night staff member not letting my husband in when I was asleep despite confirming that this would be ok 3 times twice before we had even turned up when I spoke to the staff member in the morning he said that he couldn t identify him and didn t know if he should let him in so decided not to My husband had then travel back to bedford after finishing a 12 hour night shift who just wanted a couple of hours sleep This cost My husband a lot of money to travel back to our home and I was very very angry to know that he hadn t been let in I have heard nothing back despite being told they would call me during the day to confirm what had happened I will not be staying here again and I would advise against staying here if you need to check in separately as apparently the staff do not communicate with each other , The room was what was described the tv channel selection was good 1 of the staff members was good 
190116,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Great Location very near the Wimbledon Train station My single room was compact but had everything I needed to makes make comfortable and a nice break from corporate blandness you get from chains It had a relaxing feeling to the place which is nice after a long hard day in the City I would also consider using this hotel for a family trip in the future too 
190117,The Justin James Hotel, The Pillows were dreadful so soft the your head kind of fell through the middle and the contents bunched up at the sides Room 11 had a sloping ceiling which I bumped my head on a few times , It location was convenient to where I needed to be 
190118,The Justin James Hotel, Very disappointed with the very small bed room for the price and no breakfast in the price then the bath room is on a different floor you have to walk down the stairs and along a corridor to the bathroom same walk to fill the kettle up so you can have a cup of tea , The Staff were very pleasant just a shame the bedroom let them down 
190119,The Justin James Hotel, En suite for the price , Very comfortable room Small but lovely Bathroom was not en suite but was excellent Friendly staff no problems at all Would definitely recommend
190120,The Justin James Hotel, Our bedroom N0 1 was right next to the front door so we were a little troubled by the constant comings and goings from an early hour in the morning , Comfortable beds and spotlessly clean bedroom bathroom Breakfast was very good and quickly served in a very pleasant friendly manner 
190121,The Justin James Hotel, That I only had 1 night available to stay , I find the atmosphere friendly and relaxing the staff personable and helpful and the location very convenient 
190122,The Justin James Hotel, No problems all worked fine , Two nights here comfortable and well located for my appointments Car parking challenging but the helpful manager made sure I got in okay 
190123,The Justin James Hotel, Inconvenient location for shower and toilet on ground floor No value for money if its a struggle to get to the shower and toilet all the way down from the room , Friendly staff
190124,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Wonderfully cosy and spacious room 5 min walk from Wimbledon train tube station and shops free parking hotel owned parking space may run out late evening as hotel fills up Hotel does not serve breakfast but adjacent cafe has some excellent things on the menu 
190125,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, The manager could not have been more helpful Giving us travel advice helping us at every turn I left medication in my room after check out the manager sent it home for me without any quibble I was very grateful The cafe attached to the hotel was an absolute delight Gluten dairy sugar fee heaven The location was fabulous 
190126,The Justin James Hotel, Although I knew the room had no en suite bathroom and the nearest bathroom was down the stairs it was a little overpriced However I would definitely stay again , Friendly staff location and comfortable room This was my 4th stay at the hotel as it is very handy for my work when I need to stay late in London for social occasions 
190127,The Justin James Hotel, There is no breakfast included but can be bought in the cafe next door The wording in the information about the hotel could definitely be better than sounding as if it is included Would still have booked it The room was extremely hot when I arrived in the evening however woke up at 3 am freezing cold as the radiators were switched off and didn t come on until 7 in the morning It was not possible to operate them from the room Blankets could definitely have been provided in the rooms ,No Positive
190128,The Justin James Hotel, The WiFi was very weak intermittent in one half of our room Wet room was so wet we couldn t walk in it after shower was used , Very clean and perfect location for our needs Receptionist was very helpful when we checked in 
190129,The Justin James Hotel, The dilemma of the kettle made me smile As the room has no sink you have to pop downstairs to fill the kettle It did have some water in it but then we all like to use fresh water Perhaps an empty kettle plus some bottled water , Hotel is welcoming with a cafe style curb appeal Very nice lady on reception check in was fast was even shown to my room I had the basic room so the shower room is downstairs however it was spotlessly clean with a brand new power shower Bed was comfortable so that plus the hotel being on a quietish road mean t I grabbed an excellent night s sleep Had to dash in the morning so can t comment on the breakfast but there were some lovely aromas as I approached the reception area Perfect location for everything in Wimbledon right next to all transport links 
190130,The Justin James Hotel, The bathroom was very clean but the toilet was just about touching the bath I think this property is more like a B B than hotel , The coffee shop has a great variety of home made dishes using fresh ingredients and no microwave non dairy non gluten menue 
190131,The Justin James Hotel, Old building oddly shaped rooms barely usable shower my room was on the top floor under an angled roof the only way to use the shower was to squat in the tub , Good location not far from Wimbledon centre funny organic Vegan cafe
190132,The Justin James Hotel, The bed could have been a bit softer , Room was nice and a reasonable size for a single room It was in a fairly quiet location and I managed to get a good night s sleep
190133,The Justin James Hotel, You could feel all the springs in the mattress Not super comfortable , Great location staff is super friendly Shower was great and the room was nice and warm The cafe associated with the hotel was brilliant with very tasty food and nice staff
190134,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel Perfect location 2 min from the centre of Wimbeldon I normally don t bother leaving reviews but they deserve one Best for me was easy and free off street parking 
190135,The Justin James Hotel, Older style and the decor is a bit dated Could be a bit cleaner as some mould in the bathroom Shower pressure not very strong but hot Shower would wet the whole floor even with the curtain , Great location close to shops and train station Beds are comfortable The staff are friendly and very helpful Enjoyed the healthy food in the associated cafe Warm and cosy in the middle of winter 
190136,The Justin James Hotel, See above, Location was most important One member of reception team was not ver polite to the friend who stayed there one night and the room they gave her was pokey They did change its eventually My room was good 
190137,The Justin James Hotel, Bed wasn t the most comfortable in the world but we both slept all night , Warm and friendly staff Close to everything Spacious rooms Free on site parking 
190138,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, It was perfect for a single person wanting to do anything in the surrounding areas Beautiful room lovely and clean very comfy bed incredible price for everything Would definitely stay again 
190139,The Justin James Hotel, felt advertising was slightly misleading in that this is not a bed and breakfast and if you want breakfast you have to pay for it, Good location and great to have off street parking in central Wimbledon
190140,The Justin James Hotel, Room the size of a cupboard shared bathroom which was down two flights of stairs and bed located directly below a very cold draughty window Location was good for my business trip but did not stay the last night of the booking as just couldn t face it If you choose to book here do not get misled by the room facilities as it definitely does not have a toilet or shower in the room or anywhere close by A disappointing experience and certainly would not stay here again A real shame because the staff were great , Lovely friendly staff Clean Free wifi and parking 
190141,The Justin James Hotel, Room was a bit too small walls very thin and bathroom was downstairs from the room Staff were on hand throughout the stay but service was generally offered without a smile , Good location facilities generally modern and comfortable 
190142,The Justin James Hotel, Check in receptionist was a bit robotic the shower wasn t very powerful and the night time London noise was noticeable through the old fashioned single pane windows didn t put me off I would stay there again , Location is great a few mins walk from shops restaurant and transport Clean and Cosy Good value for money Wifi was good A good option for an overnight business stay 
190143,The Justin James Hotel, We would have preferred a different type of restaurant on the premises The restaurant was only serving vegan type foods smoothies etc It was good food but we would have preferred a more middle of the road type of restaurant serving a greater variety of food types , Clean quiet small hotel friendly staff and very convenient location 
190144,The Justin James Hotel, Avoid room 15 if you can next to reception and there can be noise at night , Excellent shower comfortable bed Cafe within hotel has great food and excellent service 
190145,The Justin James Hotel, Took me 30 minutes to finish the shower because the water went from freezing cold to steaming hot , Good location Friendly staff and the price is pretty reasonable 
190146,The Justin James Hotel, Was happy with how I experienced it , Such helpful and concerned staff There was a slight issue with the heating and they were so anxious to make sure it was fixed and also came up with an immediate short term solution Liked the friendly Lu Ma cafe that is part of the hotel Vegetarian but that s OK Breakfasts are superb and lasted me all day And a stunning large bowl of soup A neighbourhood caff more than a staid hotel dining room Top location very short walk to Wimbledon Station and on several bus routes Close to Wimbledon Common too 
190147,The Justin James Hotel, Room was a bit noisy in morning as right next to reception Loo brush covered with loo paper looked unsightly Bits of fluff stuck in carpet otherwise room acceptably clean Cheapish room 80 booked at last minute in an emergency I was not expecting much and wasn t disappointed Not even soap in bathroom to wash hands a bit stingy luckily shops were open nearby ,No Positive
190148,The Justin James Hotel, I didn t take breakfast with them once I read the menu discovered that the principal ingredient of the English Breakfast was avacado , Friendly staff being able to park there for 3 days was a great bonus 
190149,The Justin James Hotel, car parking advertised as free on site was not availableon either of the 2 nights i was there had to park on the road and was told i would get a ticket if i left the car on the road after 8 30 in the morning no lift and the room was 3 floors up narrow staircase, very friendly staff for booking in
190150,The Justin James Hotel, My single room with a shared bathroom was a little too cosy and in an ideal world would have been a foot or so wider but for the price I cannot complain at all , Staff welcoming and helpful everywhere was very clean the bed was comfortable and the shower hot Pretty central location and near plenty of amenities For a one night stay for a business traveller it offered excellent value for money 
190151,The Justin James Hotel, Breakfast was terrible unless you needed gluten free Travelled with my son so needed more choice and at least everyday cereals, Fair value for money comfy bef
190152,The Justin James Hotel, Was firstly given a room directly facing the main street and couldn t sleep a wink the whole night as there is no double glazing soundproof windows Thankfully though the staff were very good at finding me an alternative quiet room for the subsequent nights where I thereafter slept soundly , lots of space nearness to Tube station and shops and restaurants healthy eating cafe on the premises for breakfast and the very friendly staff 
190153,The Justin James Hotel, Room 1 should not be let as a hotel room It is by the front door and you hear everyone entering in and out of the main door all night long the entrance light shines through the room door which coupled with the curtains that do not block street lighting means the room is not dark Noise from adjacent rooms is audible showers hangers on wardrobe rails walking about loud talking Appalling nights sleep , Clean beds and shower Tea and coffee in room Sockets to charge laptop phone Car park Adjacent tea house with interesting food 
190154,The Justin James Hotel, Nothing apart from the healthy cafe is just that healthy A nice sausage or bacon option at the hotel would have been amazing but appreciate its a difficult market , Lovely hotel in a centrally located Wimbledon I booked this for my mum and aunty to come visit an exhibition and Hampton Court Palace The hotel was perfectly connected to all the major transport links 
190155,The Justin James Hotel, The room was a little small, Very close to my office the lady on in the morning was very nice and helpful The cafe was beautiful and my breakfast was lovely
190156,The Justin James Hotel, Not a moan but constructive criticism The shower could ve been abit bigger as I struggled to have my shower And we could ve used a later check out time It would ve been very handy , Comfy beds Top marks for them Super comfy And very bubbly staff member who checked me and my best friend in after 11pm Very chatty Absolutely fantastic Would love to stay there again and will absolutely recommend anyone to go there if they do a spot of shopping or a night out 
190157,The Justin James Hotel, I took the basic single room on the understanding that I would share a bathroom I have stayed there many times before with an ensuite bathroom What I didn t know was that to reach the shared bathroom I had to go through two fire doors and down a flight of stairs into a communal area to reach any source of water and the toilet I found this very inconvenient as I had made the assumption that the shared bathroom would be in the bedroom area I would have been happier if this had been described on the website as for many people it would not have been a problem for me it was I would stay there again but not in that room , The welcome and the gluten dairy and sugar free cafe 
190158,The Justin James Hotel, The layout and the round were a little cramped but well appointed and decorated , The cafe attached served beautiful breakfasts and coffee The location was very convenient for local amenities and for central London
190159,The Justin James Hotel, Breakfast The guest information booklet included information about an English style breakfast which is no longer available This information needs to be removed from the booklet because it is misleading Breakfast in fact is vegetarian and the Full English they now offer includes avocados and spinach etc This is my only complaint in every other way I thought it was a nice hotel in a good location and very convenient for getting into London , It is a clean hotel run by friendly staff in a great location near to the centre of Wimbledon
190160,The Justin James Hotel, Just one point the room was on the ground floor bedroom window overlooked small patio and a back gate The window needed to be open for air as it was a hot evening but I felt insecure when sleeping as there was no stay on the window to stop an outsider opening the window and coming into the room , Crisp clean sheets large bath sheet comfortable chair to sit on comfrotable bed
190161,The Justin James Hotel, No proper dining room and cafe is not part of hotel Food very trendy and not suitable for families wanting standard breakfast food , Hotel very accommodating and welcoming Staff very helpful Rooms were excellent and quiet location 
190162,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, Only wanted somewhere to stay so didn t investigate some of the things the hotel mentioned Did use the attached cafe which is into good quality food I had a sunshine omelette which was just wanted I needed The location is easy walking distance to Wimbledon Underground which is overground in Wimbledon and easy walking to Wimbledon village Took me about half an hour to walk from the hotel to Windmill cafe on the common This is where Wimbledon Parkrun starts from every Saturday at 9 a m and everybody is welcome and the event is free 
190163,The Justin James Hotel, The hotel is actually in a red brick house and rooms are rather small I ve been there a few times and the bathroom was sometimes an updated shower room another time a small bathroom on the top floor under a velux window with no real shower It can be expensive for the rooms and facilities provided , Convenient location close to Wimbledon tube station Friendly staff 
190164,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, I was super happy and grateful to find through Booking com this GEM of hotel which provided on site parking It s in such a great location two blocks from the high Street of Wimbledon with an abundance of shops restaurants and pubs and then just down a bit is the train station to get into London I had a single room with ensuite and it was all sparkling clean and cosy Small and compact but plenty of room to move have cases out etc double wardrobe desk side table plenty of breeze from the double window if you wanted it As with a lot of small hotels there s no aircon there is heating which is more necessary in the UK however there is a fan if it gets a little warm Shower was great with good pressure and plenty of hot water you need to run the tap a while before it comes through The hotel wasn t full when I was there so I found it very quiet and I love quiet The staff from my first interaction were so lovely and helpful Everyone I saw on the reception desk as I passed in and out each day said hello and a chat which I enjoyed You do have to get your cases up the stairs so know that or ask for a ground floor room What a bonus is the beautiful cafe attached now to the hotel The staff and food all fabulous and healthy and there is outside seating under trees also Good coffee a rarity in the UK and they have almond milk Inside the cafe is gorgeous as well Fresh cold pressed juices and smoothies Wonderful healthy salads and raw food desserts What a gem to find this I could not fault the hotel or anything about it I loved it and will definitely recommend to everyone and will go back when I next visit London They are also sending me my chargers because like a dill I left them in the wall sockets sorry I had a lovely three nights 
190165,The Justin James Hotel, No hot water in morning to shower propaly staff tried to help but other rooms had same problem would of liked a cooked breakfast for a 93 stay are breakfast came to an extra 17 BUT THE BREAKFAST WAS OF EXCELLANT QIALITY, Staff very helpful 
190166,The Justin James Hotel, The room was located on the second floor and was reached on a rather narrow staircase , Pleasant big room with comfortable bed The owner very kindly allowed me to let my car in their parking on my departing day till the early afternoon without any charge
190167,The Justin James Hotel, No extra pillows given even though we asked for them We were compensated for not having team , The breakfast was good Cooked well and served quickly Healthy options made a pleasant change 
190168,The Justin James Hotel, I was able to change my room to one without a shared bathroom but it was very small The room was located near the reception so noise from arriving departings guests and banging doors were quite disturbing , Good location
190169,The Justin James Hotel, Nothing particular , Small pleasant hotel very close to Wimbledon centre and railway station Clean fairly quiet location Good fresh made English breakfast in co located caf Well worth the price 
190170,The Justin James Hotel, Only fault was the hairdryer didn t work , The staff were very friendly and welcoming The breakfast was excellent and the dining area is light and modern Will definitely stay again 
190171,The Justin James Hotel, Thin walls I could hear every movement from the upstairs room , Very close to the subway train and Wimbledon s center with shops and restaurants Room was really nice confortable
190172,The Justin James Hotel, Double bed jammed against wall so one of us had to climb over the other to get out seems a bit cheeky to call it a double room and charge over 120 and not even include breakfast ,No Positive
190173,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, As it s independent it really had that feel that you were staying with family rather than a hotel chain Nothing was a chore to the staff who were always pleasant and helpful A thoroughly enjoyable stay 
190174,The Justin James Hotel, We had a small top floor room which are small and warm up quickly in the sun If you leave the window open there s significant road noise If you are used to city noises that s not a problem but if you like it quiet and dark it s not so good , Lu Ma was a pleasant surprise and provided a decent breakfast Handy location for Wimbledon itself as well as a choice of rail tube to central London Plenty of restaurants in Wimbledon Village 
190175,The Justin James Hotel, breakfast was a little bland for the price i e cheap beans tasteless bacon the room was really hot we had 2 rooms between the 3 of us and both were unbearably hot with window locks to stop the windows opening fully this meant having the standing fan on all night , cleanliness was spot on room was well furnished with spare pillows etc staff were very friendly and helpful
190176,The Justin James Hotel, Stair carpet but I don t like patterned ones anyway , Handy for Station which I was using to access Wimbledon area 5 minutes walk Good size room Nice and clean in all areas good towels Free wifi always nice when it works
190177,The Justin James Hotel, It didn t bother us this time but not being able to get an evening meal at the hotel could worry some , The location just 10 minutes walk to the station and similarly to Wimbledon Village 
190178,The Justin James Hotel, The location is in zone3 the District line close 2 days while I just stayed 3 nights in there Even I put the Do not disturb sign in my 2nd day before I go out my room still be got in and made my stuffs tidy I hope their can inform me before , The staffs are quite friendly and helping Near to Train station Over all the room is small a little humid but clean If they have laundry facility and micro wave for my super would nice 
190179,The Justin James Hotel, The shower in the room I got this time was not ideal The room was under the roof and so it wasn t possible in the shower to fully stand , I ve stayed here more than once the experience is always very positive 
190180,The Justin James Hotel, No lift to the 3rd floor rooms and as it is under the eaves the bathroom is a challenge No way to stand and shower so you have to have a bath or sit in tub and use wand The bedroom is large enough that sloping ceilings do not present a problem, Mostly quiet and very clean 
190181,The Justin James Hotel, The hotel situated in a corner of a busy street with loud noise coming from a passing traffic The hotel building is a two storey house with small stairs and no elevator Can be difficult for large luggage , Although far from central london and all of the popular tourist attraction the hotel is a very clean local neighbourhood hotel with location that is only walking distance to busy central Wimbledon and train tube station with plenty of shops groceries store eating places braserrie starbucks nearby 
190182,The Justin James Hotel, Unfortunately the position of the short bath tub gave me a perfect view of the grime encrusted under the rim of the sink Apart from that no complaints just a little tap on the chamber maid s shoulder , Very convenient situation of hotel close to Wimbledon station Friendly helpful receptionist showed us our large comfortable room rather than leaving us to find our own way up 
190183,The Justin James Hotel, Nothing, Great location short walk to the shops restaurants pubs train station for quick links to Waterloo Station Staff very helpful Room was small but adequate for a short stay Great cafe attached to hotel which is used for breakfast Breakfast was very good but sausage was small 
190184,The Justin James Hotel, I know its London and parking is a nightmare but not everyone arrives in the city by train or plane I was lucky and got a parking space however it seems to be pot luck and there are few alternative places in the area So I didn t have to test the staff on this one , The homely feel about the Hotel I had reviewed it and it lived up to expectations The venue was fine for what I wanted to do that weekend The location is quiet and I got two good night s sleep 
190185,The Justin James Hotel, Nothing, Excellent customer care and location only few minutes walk from train station Would book this hotel again when if I am in this area again 
190186,The Justin James Hotel, Single room under eaves at front so small and a bit noisy because facing main road Light shining in from street lights would be better with blackout blinds No decaff coffee sachets in room, Spotlessly clean Very convenient for station 
190187,The Justin James Hotel, It is in a town centre location so there is some traffic noise, Beautiful clean room with very comfy bed Breakfast freshly cooked and excellent value for money 
190188,The Justin James Hotel, Nothing , The room was very cozy I m glad I could control the temperature of the radiator and open the windows and I also found the spare pillows in the cupboard Both the room and bathroom were spotless I left too early in the morning to sample the breakfast but to be fair they did offer me tea and toast 
190189,The Justin James Hotel, the toilet layout in the room was dismal a builder of even a basic standing cannot have approved the plan, Location staff and general amenities other than the bath room and toilet
190190,The Justin James Hotel, More pillows were needed and the bed could have been slightly more comfortable , The breakfast was delicious freshly cooked to order All the staff were friendly and helpful I am very fussy about cleanliness but it sparkled Would recommend 
190191,The Justin James Hotel, Walls are a little thin Sometimes noise from next room bothered me in the night , Clean wi fi well working good location And staffs are very friendly 
190192,The Justin James Hotel, room too hot in fact hotel was like sauna during stay no bar area or dinner area for evening, Front desk staff really helpful and friendly room cleaned and comfortable breakfast was first class
190193,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, The staff were really friendly and very helpful The rooms were clean and tidy and very quiet The hotel was really well placed for Wimbledon centre A very peaceful feel to the hotel and the cafe Lu Ma s
190194,The Justin James Hotel, We didn t have any problems at all, This is a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Would recommend this to anyone wanting something different to the usual chain
190195,The Justin James Hotel, Rather small bathroom especially toilet was hardly any leg room and shower leaked onto floor Could have been hooks for nightmare in the bathroom and rails for wet towels , Comfort ease of travel to WBS and friendliness 
190196,The Justin James Hotel,No Negative, The restaurant on the ground floor was really good you can found really delicious and healthy dishes The location is perfect if you need to take the tube 
190197,The Justin James Hotel, The room was very cold no heating and the staff unhelpful My daughter was told it was up to her to turn the heating on she is only 19 the room s heating should have been checked prior to arrival the weather had dropped to freezing over the weekend My daughter waited in the breakfast area for over 10 minutes and no one came to serve The kitchen staff were just chatting in the kitchen This was one of many visits our family has made to the hotel usually we have been very happy but this time the care and service were very disappointing ,No Positive
190198,The Justin James Hotel, My room on the ground floor had no view at all and it was somewhat noisy in the morning when I opened the window it gave on to an alley which felt insecure especially when I returned one day after the room had been cleaned and the window had been left open , Free car parking is great and massage therapy on the premises also the Lu Ma Cafe suits me perfectly My room had a bath which I requested 
190199,The Justin James Hotel, No bad experiences but let s be clear that the hotel is a little basic , Well located tiny hotel that offers comfortable bed and breakfast type rooms Nothing fancy but workable Staff super professional
190200,The Justin James Hotel, Hardest bed I have ever slept on and noisy guests returning late made for a restless night Also the room was brightly lit with the sign outside and a large gap under the door letting in much light , Great location for where we wanted to be and to get to
190201,The Justin James Hotel, Extra charge for breakfast Room cramped and small Car fender scraped in parking slot not notified , Nice man in reception offered to call taxi for us 
190202,The Justin James Hotel, wasn t a bad experience it was the bathroom having a bath instead of a shower due to the lack of head room where the bath was , location was good for me as had business in the area 
190203,The Justin James Hotel, The bed mattress is perhaps in need of a changer other than that nothing, Very friendly welcome and room exceptionally clean and functional Great value for the area Did not have breakfast at hotel but the small cafe attached to the hotel where breakfast is taken looked popular and quite good 
190204,The Justin James Hotel, Room very small for two people and luggage Bathroom Ok but take your own shower gel as very little provided by hotel , Friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast and price acceptable for London Some great places to east nearby 
190205,The Justin James Hotel, All good , I d just arrived in Wimbledon from Australia jet lagged and in pouring rain 2 blocks from the tube Lovely welcome at reception and a nice little room cosy but clean and warm I needed some advice from reception the foll wing day and received it with no hesitation happy to help me in the office and decline charging me It s sometimes these little things that really matter Thank you 
190206,The Justin James Hotel, The hotel has increased the breakfast charge to 7 50 which appears to be more than the charge for non residents ordering off its standard menu At this pricing point you would probably expect it to be inclusive and the portions could have been more generous Room was comfortable and well appointed bar some traffic noise from outside and from adjacent rooms and a hole in the ceiling of the bathroom My general feeling was the hotel was clean and comfortable but that the tariff was around 10 too high , The hotel is conveniently located for Wimbledon centre and the rail and tube links from the station The hotel is clean throughout and free parking was provided on site which was a bonus Would stay again
