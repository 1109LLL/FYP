291408,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Luxury does not come cheap and while you get what you pay for 51 Buckingham Gate provides its outstanding service for a price , Spectacular luxury hotel in Westminster Easy walks to in St James Green and Hyde Parks museums theater restaurants Generous and amazingly comfortable accommodations It s not easy to be both discrete and attentive but they are both 
291409,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, The washing machine is not cleaned regularly It s dirty inside , The bed is very very comfortable I was sleeping like a baby The staff is very kind and helpful The dinner service is excellent in general 
291410,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing negative, Everything I visited with my mother to celebrate her 75th birthday We had a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite which was marvellous and my Mom was treated very well She received complimentary sweets cakes which was delivered to the suite by butler service Overall a great place to stay Will definitely return 
291411,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, The spa could use a little love but was still nice , The residence apartment I stayed in was extremely large and fully stocked The staff was exceptional 
291412,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Only thing would have been the option of a bath rather just a shower but I should have read the information more carefully as it does advise, The staff were helpful friendly and really wanted to assist The food was fabulous and could not be faulted 
291413,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, High level of service and care They couldn t do anymore to ensure our comfort Suite was cleaned daily within good time Any requests pillow preference more water coffee capsules and more were acted on immediately Almost like they were already on the way while on the phone with us Good quality kitchen equipment 
291414,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, I called downstairs for help on matters and 3 or 4 times call went to voicemail This is strange as when you speak to staff they are SUPER helpful , Amazing service Best in London but 
291415,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing this was just an outstanding visit, As in most reviews ALL of the staff from check in to check out were friendly happy and very welcoming The rooms were excellent and were an outstanding location to Buckingham Kensington and Parliament 
291416,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, We stayed here for our anniversary I can honestly say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in The whole hotel had a luxurious feel to it Our room was much bigger than we thought it would be and was very comfortable What really made the experience memorable for us though was the level of service we received from the lovely staff They couldn t do enough for you We were even given a lovely dessert as a gift for our anniversary I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone and will be definitely staying again on my next visit to London 
291417,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Cannot suggest any improvements, Amazing attention to detail spacious well equipped rooms Fabulous breakfast and cocktails Just love this hotel and will definetly return In my opinion great value for money for the level of accommodation and service you receive 
291418,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Expensive and impractical parking rushed check in lousy wifi with poor coverage and largely temperamental , Maid service is excellent Rooms are spacious 
291419,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, The only thing that let me down was 1 member of staff at the reception he wanted me to move my car as there s not much room for parking outside he was very rude and demanded me to move the car straight Away which I was already attending too his attitude was disgusting however every other member of staff was excellent , Everything about the hotel was Excellent we stayed at the Kings building which was exceptional will definitely stay again 
291420,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing loved everything, The service was amazing fantastic staff they made out stay very comfortable and beautiful place rooms amazing central location Brilliant can t wait to visit again 
291421,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing it was faultless , Amazing Hotel one of the best in London and the best staff I have ever encountered in any hotel anywhere in the World The suite was incredibly well appointed and spacious and the overall experience was everything you expect from a top hotel Great value for the price we paid as the suite was a proper suite with a sitting room etc rather than a room with a sofa as we have had in other hotels Very well located too for anything you want to experience in London 
291422,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, Very friendly staff truly made you feel at home Very good location Great for family s looking for spacious rooms with a kitchen Would be going back to stay with them the next time I am in London 
291423,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Breakfast could have been a bit more varied bigger selection but no complaints at all and reasonably priced , Good location Nice room Great staff Can t speak for all but incredibly spacious relative to similar type hotels rooms Will definitely stay here next time I m in London as it appears to be comfortably the best value high end hotel around It really isn t worth paying the huge premium to stay in Mayfair for example when you can stay in a bigger room suite here for a fair bit cheaper It s a very pleasant walk up towards Piccadilly even in winter and there are loads of black cabs around The kitchenette which is basically a small kitchen is a real bonus if staying longer and you don t want to eat every meal out 
291424,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, All great , Everything about this beautiful establishment is 5 star From the lovely staff exceptional and thoughtful service to the beautiful interior and exterior buildings All of the staff managed that rare blend of professionalism with a friendly warm and kind approach minutes from Buckingham Palace St James and Green parks and close to the Victoria shops From the wonderful gentle seated check in and my room was ready in the morning with hot towel and drink and cookies provided to the equally efficient and friendly check out and umbrella escort to a taxi I was given a free upgrade from a King Suite to a beautiful spacious 1 bedroom apartment This included an entry hall large lounge with couches coffee table and TV as well as a 6 seater dining room and fruit bowl large floor to ceiling windows fully equipped kitchen with a clothes washing drying machine a spacious bedroom and beautiful ensuite bathroom with a large spa bath separate shower double vanity heated towel rail toilet and bidet as well as a guest toilet room There is a happy hour in the evening with complementary drinks and canap s and a I moved to this hotel after an unpleasant experience and just 4 hours sleep at another hotel and the difference could not have been more marked nor more welcomed This is a rare find and pricey but worth every cent 
291425,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, 2 of the 4 horizontal shower jets didn t work There was no TV in the bathroom there was in the suite we stayed in last time and that suite was cheaper ,No Positive
291426,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing, The hotel was perfect amazing service attitude from all the staff helped us on anything we needed the suit was great we had small issue in the first day and it was fixed immediatly
291427,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, I really couldn t find a single thing to complain about, The suite we stayed in was huge high end with all amenities we were a family of 5 with 2 toddlers and 3 adults We thoroughly enjoyed the living space room service and the care of the hotel staff 
291428,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, I only have 1 complaint and that is with the WIFI It was super slow and hard to connect at times , The concierge team was beyond amazing They arranged a ton of things for me and they were always available and extremely fast Being there on business with lots of materials for an event the bellmen received all my items delivered to my room before I arrived helped me move them in an out as I needed etc The suites are amazing well decorated and very spacious Toiletry amenities were very large and generous and a great brand Housekeeping was available 2 times a day and super nice and the hotel served free drinks everyday from 6 7PM The experience was the best hotel experience I have had in many years 
291429,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing at all , This is undoubtedly the best overall hotel in London It offers brilliant service and excellent facilities It is infinitely better than all those overpriced ageing hotels taking advantage of their Mayfair location Taj 51 really is fantastic 
291430,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Nothing everything worked and in good condition Perfect London stay for us colonials , Very hospitable staff and environment in a totally perfect London location Great breakfasts and the happy hour was perfect 
291431,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Shower was leaking however they fixed it as soon as we informed the housekeeping staff the folder kept in the room for the convenient of guests had no information only page separators no information kept between these seemed like negligence , Love the residences facilities in the kitchen and the pleasant ambience during breakfast Very helpful front desk 
291432,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, The staff were so incredibly kind with our 3 year old daughter Not only did they surprise her with little gifts throughout the stay but they also genuinely seemed to care and want her to enjoy the experience too They even found a golden ribbon that she could use as a leash for her stuffed animal 
291433,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Dining times at the Quilon their Michelin starred Indian restaurant are inconvenient , This is a great hotel in an excellent location I ve stayed here twice and both stays have been great Its not far from a tube station and the staff are unbelievably good If you can afford it do stay there but it is expensive

291436,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, I love the privacy and space of residencies combined with the services of the hotel The building is beautiful and interiors well done Staff is extremely friendly 
291437,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Noise Levels The floor was too noisy in the night with banging doors Mornings were equally noisy with noise from outside guess from school kids I guess hotel needs to insulate doors windows effectively , Location and Staff The staff was extraordinary 
291438,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, I prefair a more modern look hotel but that s just personal preference, The sevice in this hotel is second to none you feel like a lord from start to finish
291439,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, As the hotel is made up of a few buildings within a courtyard I would have liked a renovation of the entrances to the level of the main hotel lobby with security access gates activated , Everything Cosy feel Attention to detail in the food and the little extras in the suites spacious room suites location superb 
291440,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, There were a couple of issues on arrival that where very swiftly dealt with and dealt with in a way far beyond our expectations which was a nice touch , Staff are amazingly friendly and make you feel very welcome throughout your stay

291442,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences,No Negative, Attentive staff very enthusiastic about our 2 year old daughter Gave her a welcome pack including crayons and a nice teddy And a lovely lady played hide and seek with her straight away upon arrival Then they delivered a cookie with her name on it the next day The 1 room falconer suite is really a 2 room suite with lounge and kitchen and separate hallway and bedroom We loved the DVD library with complimentary popcorn sent to your room Would recommend to anyone looking for a home away from home but in the middle of central London Great for tourists we live in London but still enjoyed being around the corner from Buckingham Palace and Houses of Parliament 
291443,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, We had to leave , What a fantastic place perfect location and wonderful staff that nothing is too much for them Your wishes are fulfilled with a smile every time They can not do enough for you 10 10 Fantastic rooms

291445,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, The apartment smelt of smoke Things were a little basic Nothing high end it was just pretty ordinary The dress gown had sadly seen better days house keeping woke us up 9am and kept knocking until I answered School kids behind the hotel can make some noise Staff which smoke could make some attempt to freshen up before coming into your room or being in close contact with guests Overall it was ok , The apartments are large The guy at breakfast was truly lovely Its location is good the outside the building looks lovely 
291446,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Check in was slow Other arrivals given hot towels we were not Difficult to get a taxi very often no staff there to call a cab No milk in fridge on arrival and never got any at all No decent view , Very clean comfortable and staff helpful especially the concierges 
291447,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Service significantly below of what you eould expect for a 5 star hotel The hotel es better described as a 4 star hotel with premium accomodations, Room space is great
291448,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, I ve stayed in the Falconer 2 bedroom suite several times and always enjoy it The bathroom is a bit tiny certainly only fits one person at a time Thats my only complaint , One of the finest places to stay in London near the West End and Buckingham Palace You can easily walk to Green Park Station The hotel is tucked away in a marvelously private courtyard you feel posh and regal The rooms are very comfortable and the staff goes above and beyond Pricey but worth it 
291449,Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, Had to leave and go home , We booked the junior suite and it was brilliant the food was great the staff were excellent took the wife for her birthday and she was very impressed so I got some brownie points as well Definitely worth the wee bit extra over a hotel room without a doubt Well worth the 5 stars
