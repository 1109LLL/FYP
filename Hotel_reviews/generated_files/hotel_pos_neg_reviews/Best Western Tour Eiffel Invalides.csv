158391,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Have already commented in my overall review in 3 above, Hotel s location is excellent They gave me a Boulevard facing room which I had requested earlier at the time of booking I had originally thought that a 16 sq meter room would be small and not comfortable I was a little surprised that it is not so Although you it is a little cramped with the furniture but overall consider all aspects it was comfortable Their staff are was very polite and helpful Wish they increase their numbers considering it is FOUR Srar property whose major front office functions including concierge functions can not be left to single purpose at the reception
158392,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides,No Negative, It was smallish but I expect that in Europe the air conditioner worked well in the beginning but by the end of the week it wasn t keeping the room cool enough
158393,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Would have liked their to be a mini bar fridge Shower water was very slow to go down drain pipe , We were very happy with the service staff and location 
158394,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Some of the staff was confused first he was not able to read our names second he gave us a wrong room upgrade which he changed just after we started unpacking The worse thing was we got the second room at 3 10 PM one hour after the regular check in time Then we were asked to pay the city tax even if it was paid through your site However at check out they reimbursed us the amount of tax we paid extra Too many mistakes for a few days stay , The hotel is small but the rooms and the bathrooms are fine The location is not bad being in walking distance from Eiffel Tour and not far from Champs Elizee The restaurants near by are not expensive without being convenient either except the Asian one with really low prices 
158395,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Room size was snug but considering we were not spending much time in the room not a problem , Beds were really nice and the breakfast was in a cozy cellar with really nice croissants Excellent location 
158396,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Staff was not very English speaking and when asked about directions gave simple answers a d didn t give alternative ways to get around, Bath room was clean and nice The beds were Not as comfortable mattresses could be better But room was large And felt good
158397,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Feel the hotel could do with just a little modernisation to bring it up to where other similar hotels are at , Everyone was friendly and the hotel was very central
158398,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, There was construction and the elevator was not working The bathroom lights flickered They did not make up my room or give me fresh tea or coffee for it until I called down 2ce , They gave me a coupon for a drink of bunbly at a mearby restaurant I guess for inconvenience but they should have reduced room fees 
158399,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, The shower in room 42 is not the best The shower head needs cleaning or repair , First the staff is extremely good The location is awesome and the beds are comfortable 
158400,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Smaller room than the photos on the web indicated Some clever photography techniques used Our room was on the 6th floor undergoing roof repairs my view was of tarpaulin and scaffolding I had asked at booking for a nice view as the trip was for my wife s birthday My request appears not to have been considered The room as very compact but the facilities listed were all found to be in place The television although having english speaking channels listed were not available The terrace was not available for use undergoing repairs On the 6th floor the lift could clearly be heard rumbling up and down , Good location and excellent WiFi Good breakfast selection 
158401,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, I actually had taken a train to Paris for my two day stay and had left some toiletry items in Nice thinking that I wouldn t need them But my hotel in Paris didn t have these items in the bathroom It wasn t a major issue though , The helpful friendliness of the staff and close local to the things I wanted to see 
158402,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, The lady in the breakfast room was not willing to make a swap in the so called express breakfast yoghurt instead of a croisant and a roll moreover the express breakfast was in the lobby and coffee was kept in a large can Checked out without any food The BW I stayed in in May had no problem with my request, Checked in by Giovanni Politeand nice 
158403,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Very noisy hotel Occupants in next room sounded like they were in ours Not good if you re a light sleeper , Staff friendly and helpful Room clean and tidy Situated within walking distance from everywhere if you re ok with walking 
158404,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Friend couldn t order room service at 01 00in the morning when it was supposed be 24 hours But was offered a few packets of crisp , Bed was comfy n clean Reception staff very helpful and friendly
158405,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Small rooms Parisian Elevator good for two Ground floor was under renovation but hey breakfast room is the smallest and mysterious I have ever seen , Location was great for our purpose but also in Paris Staff is very friendly and helpful
158406,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Everything was almost perfect Only wish small fridge mini bar in room , A soft comfortable bed the very helpful staff and grate location Can evaluate variety of breakfast because we did t use this service as we had a kettle in the room 
158407,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, The shower was a little cramped due to the low slanted ceiling on 6th floor I was cold that evening and they said there was no heating in the summer I was proposed to take a hot shower instead , The room was nice and the bed comfortable
158408,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, No restaurant in the hotel Places to eat are far away, The people at the reception were espectacular They were a lot if help for m ltiple things we need
158409,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, limited tea coffee curtains didn t match stain on floor dust hairs round bathroom floor, location great room adequate hair dryer in bathroom
158410,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Carpet a bit worn but room was really clean so it didn t matter too much , Very clean Great location Plenty of restaurants nearby Staff very courteous and helpful 
158411,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, The same price was charged for adult breakfast and child s breakfast There should be a deduction in price for under 10 s as they do not eat as much, Fantastic location clean tidy and great staff
158412,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Heating in the room was far too hot and wouldn t turn down so we had to open the window One of the blinds in the bathroom was missing Neither would have been much of a problem except renovation work was underway and we had scaffolding outside our room This meant with the window open we were disturbed by noise from the workmen in the morning and my girlfriend had to shower at select times when the workmen couldn t see into the bathroom , Reasonably priced for Paris good location large bed helpful staff 
158413,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, The room was too warm and we had no refrigerator and no bottles of water apart the day of our arrival The red walls and moquette give a sense of anxiety and darkness , The position is good just a few minutes away from the Eiffel Tower and the metro station of Les Invalides Our room 21 had a balcony and despite the traffic was very quiet WiFi always worked properly The staff last but not least was very very polite I really appreciated it 
158414,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights first night have a bottle of complimentary water only second night no towels in the bath room no refill of suger and milks in the rooms 3rd night no refill of shower shampoo empty bottles in the bathroom very disappointed lift is very small but better than nothing 4th floor rooms are painted in dark red colour small and old very different from the photos shows in booking com website good location but it should not be a 4 star hotel , location
158415,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Nothing I will return soon, Staff staff staff everyone was super friendly and helpful breakfast was also very good with a lot of variety Room was very clean the standard room was small so we decided to upgrade to a superior room which was very spacious bright and clean Location is excellent within walking distance to Eiffel Tower champs elysse invalides
158416,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Tiny bit dusty behind bathroom doors tiles need a little clean Rooms could do with a mini fridge and more English TV channels , Must stress how lovely all the staff are and location is amazing Our room this year was a superior which was lovely with A C if needed Generally very clean and very comfortable This hotel is in perfect location and this is the second time we stayed Happily stay here again 
158417,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Breakfast poor standard and bits bought out at a time eg only 3 rashers of bacon 2 slices of bread 2 crossiants you had to ask for food to be replenished If we had known this we would not have paid for breakfast but walked to the bistro at end of the road and ordered breakfast there for 10 We were nt advised of the building works going on in the courtyard and we were staying in room 5 that is in the courtyard the workman stared at 8 and outside of the front door was constantly wet, Location was excellent Staff welcoming 
158418,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Our air conditioning didn t work and there were renovations going on in the garden area outside our room This meant we had to walk underneath scaffolding to and from our room There were workmen using loud tools there also from 9 am until 5pm each day We were not aware of this when we booked , Very clean and tidy Our room was quite spacious for 4 people and on ground level which we were thankful for with our luggage 
158419,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, We had accommodation for 5 nights On two occasions when we returned at 3PM the rooms had not been serviced On another occasion same situation but this time it was after 4PM When complained to manager he simply stated they did not have sufficient cleaning staff A traveler we met at the hotel said he waited until 7PM for his room to be serviced, The location
158420,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Very small for three adults very pricey but there again its the location The extra bed mattress was not balanced on one side it should be rotated regularly to avoid wearing on one side , location near to Eiffel Tower the receptionist Jonathan was very friendly

158422,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, Apart from the location this hotel does not provide adequately to the its price The biggest problem is the lack of space , The location Very convenient 
158423,Best Western Tour Eiffel Invalides, not as bad experience but the breakfast room is in the basement without any windows and rather dark breakfast was fine but the room not went out on the second morning to a nearby caf , good bus and metro service very quiet boulevard with lovely trees Nice to have kettle and coffee tea in the room
