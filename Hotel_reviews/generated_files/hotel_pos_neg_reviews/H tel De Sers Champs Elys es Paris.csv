185372,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, We had several logistic issues with our room the bathroom door could not be closed the water streams in the shower were partially blocked by limestone and the air condition did not work for the first two days while it was extremely hot in Paris The hotel staff provided us a ventilator until the air condition was fixed The staff was very responsive to our complains and fixed all these problems They offered us our last night for free as a compensation , Great location and the staff is really professsional and helpful The breakfast is very good located in a very nice patio

185377,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, A bit understaffed for breakfast so there was some misunderstanding and it took to long but since we was on holiday we had time Had I been there for business this would have been my first and last stay But again I was on holiday and enjoyed staying at the hotel , Excellent location Very friendly and service minded staff I can highly recommend this hotel 
185378,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, Hotel dosent deserve to be rated as five star there is no basic amenities at the room no water boiler machine for tea or coffee rooms are Wet small no standing shower we had bad expierence last day of our stay there was cut in the water from 3 we had to be informed about it at 5 they tried to compensate us with one night free but already the day has been spoiled and we had to spent the whole day outside to avoid being there in the room with no water, Location was the best thing about the property
185379,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, The price is high It could be a very good budget five star hotel Otherwise comparison with other 5 stars starts , The Staff Doorman Reception Concierge Restaurant Breakfast Cleaning location are perfect The staff and management work hard to keep the hotel at 5 star status
185380,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, We had a cheeky peek at the room service one night but it was pretty expensive for what you got , The staff were incredible really went out of their way to help me and my partner to establish the best POA in regards to maximising our time comfortable in Paris The location is a 2 min walk from the north of the Champ Elyees Arc De Triumph which meant travel on the Metro was simple if not in walking distance We had the executive room which I believe is their most basic option the room was very clean came with a beautiful balcony area and the bed was the best night sleep I have had in years The restaurant looked fantastic although we did not eat here as we were so busy seeing the amazing sights that Paris has to offer Overall we were delighted with our stay and would highly recommend 
185381,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, Shower was terrible old school shower not a rain show Bed was just OK not super comfy , Location Friendly helpful staff Modern Parisian design of lobby Breakfast and breakfast room were very nice Relatively spacious rooms for Paris 
185382,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, room size is smallish even for a superior room but I guess this is to be expected in Central Paris, new renovation is elegant and design staff is attentive yet discreet I had spent a lot of time in this hotel when it first opened 13 years ago but had not been in over 8 years and I am not disappointed at all they were also a big hit with my 7 years old daughter
185383,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, Breakfast in room with extra charge No showers only tubs , The breakfast room is very nice with the glass ceiling Friendly staff Excellent location Nice lobby and interior
185384,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, Nothing, Location is just perfect Stuff is nice friendly and highly professional I ve lost one of my earrings in the room just before leaving the hotel and we ve spent 2 hours trying to find it with my husband but unfortunately failed Anyway I left my number at the reception just in case And 3 hours later they called me to say that it was found As we were still in Paris we came to pick it up Can you imagine how happy I was Many many thanks to girls at the reception and of course Housekeeping lady

185388,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, The toilet door doesn t have a lock so you really couldn t keep it closed , The room 72 was fantastic Every member of staff we came into contact with was very helpful In general the hotel is in a great location service was excellent and our stay was very comfortable The chef s dinner menu set menu or a la carte was so good and everyone staying at the hotel should try it at least once

185390,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, The large group of young girls congregating next door who blocked the path and had to be asked in order to pass This was a problem everyday we were there, Location and staff very friendly
185391,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, On that area not so many restaurants no Parisian lively street feeling in the evening For nice lively evening life and restaurants go by metro to Louvre Rivoli area Fitness room is a joke One block down the street and towards Champs Elysee you can find city Carrefour where you can buy snacks water etc No complimentary water in the room and charge in minibar was 7 , Good room size great bed excellent sound insulation in the room Clean and tidy Breakfast included was the continental breakfast served to table Coffee orange juice yogurt chopped fresh fruits croissant baguette marmelade and butter Nice start for the day but not worth 30 if you need to pay it separately Other things charged according to order Nice 5min walk to George V and Pont Alma metro stations Rate 250 night breakfast included worth every cent

185396,H tel De Sers Champs Elys es Paris, We had to pay an extra charge for water in the rooms which usually if free in most hotels there was no coffee maker in the room Break fast was complementary however if your orderd eggs or pancakes or toast Etc you had to pay an extra charge There was a very loud sound in the water pipes sounded like someone was boling water I was transferred to another room It was an expensive hotel for what they had to offer in sure I could get something better for the same price , Location was perfect the hotel was clean the staff where very friendly and helpful
