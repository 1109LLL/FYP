371004,Hotel Topazz, Nothing really everything was very nice and a very good price I ended up staying an extra night and they honored the price I booked my room from booking com , Loved the whole atmosphere of hotel So convenient clean wonderful staff great breakfast excellent wifi Bed was very comfortable shower temperature and pressure outstanding Also there was an almost 24 hour coffee room which had cappuccino machine teas and some snacks It was all free too I would highly recommend this quaint and lovely hotel for a stay in Vienna 
371005,Hotel Topazz, Although we did not try it breakfast is actually served at the associated property across the road It prompted us to find alternative breakfast spots of which there are many close by , Great location if you plan to walk everywhere Rooms are quite luxurous and the guest lounge in the basement was also a nice alternative to coffee in the room Staff were always friendly and helpful 
371006,Hotel Topazz, Can t remember of anything really, Rooms are comfortable and the hotel is much quieter than its brother across the street where breakfast is served Staff is incredibly helpful and gave us excellent tips to enjoy the city Plus they had a very nice gesture and left us a bottle of sparkling wine for my birthday Can t recommend it enough 
371007,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Fantastic hotel only a few years old in the heart of Vienna About three minutes walk to St Stephens Cathedral shopping and restaurants Breakfast made to order by very efficient staff Enjoy free coffee biscuits and water in their very plush and comfortable lounge 
371008,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, From the moment we walked through the door we were met with a smile and professionalism This was also the very first time in our lives and we do travel that we had an orientation of the hotel and all of the extras in our suite That really comes in handy for so many things The lighting could be a tad better in the bathroom for us gals doing our makeup No problem as I simply used the main area mirror The cool oval sit in windows were so unique as was the style and artsy look of the unit We luuuuved it Would definitely go back 
371009,Hotel Topazz, Breakfast being served in Lamee Hotel across road would be inconvenient in winter months Fine for us Expensive But that s Vienna , Super staff well presented super efficient 
371010,Hotel Topazz, There is a downstairs room to make tea and coffee No electric jug in rooms but there is a fridge Staff were helpful in providing electric jugs when we requested them , Fabulous location Excellent rooms Helpful staff
371011,Hotel Topazz, We hadn t realized we had to cross the road for breakfast this is why I have scored the photos as not quite accurate But this was not a problem we enjoyed the breakfast and once again the staff were very friendly and helpful , The location the very friendly and helpful staff We were surprised there was no tea making facilities in our room but when we asked the tray soon arrived this is a must especially when you had left us the macaroons 
371012,Hotel Topazz, View was poor to the side of another building also breakfast is across the road at their sister hotel not a big deal however, Excellent room facilities bed shower etc
371013,Hotel Topazz, There was a mixup at check out but the staff rectified it , Liked very much the design and comfort of the room Was entranced by the sound of horses hooves during afternoon nap Timeless 
371014,Hotel Topazz, Bar facilities are in a sister hotel across the road This was not really a problem but a little inconvenient , The hotel staff were very friendly and efficient Free good coffee available in a separate area The location is perfect for everything we wanted to visit 
371015,Hotel Topazz, Breakfast is in the hotel across the road The breakfast room isn t that big and same for the buffet But the quality is good , Very good location and stylish rooms 
371016,Hotel Topazz, Rooms are too small You need to cross the street to have breakfast in another hotel , Great location awsome design especially windows free drinks tea coffee water during the day 
371017,Hotel Topazz, Slow busy lift I was on the 6th floor and would have taken the stairs otherwise , Very central location Modern comfort Professional and friendly staff 
371018,Hotel Topazz, The air conditioner didn t seem to cool the room enough for me It was better to open the door to the balcony During the night and early morning it was very noisy outside , Absolutely loved this hotel The bed was very comfortable and the shower was fantastic Perfect location Would definitely stay there again 
371019,Hotel Topazz, A Nespresso machine in the room would have been nice Waking up jet lagged at 04h00 I would have liked to make a coffee Bathroom was beautiful however a bathtub would have been nice , Beautiful design elements loved the window loungers Silence abounds for a fabulous night s sleep Location is incredible right in the center of everything you want to see 
371020,Hotel Topazz, No gym No pool No bar No real lounge just an empty basement salon with biscotti in a jar Restaurant located in sister hotel across the street A C in room malfunctioned Too hot causing broken sleep and general misery The hotel solution was to open a window Have never paid more for a city hotel and got less Have, Great location Great shower Crisp clean linen 
371021,Hotel Topazz, Nothing could have been made more comfortable or welcoming Even the drizzly English style weather didn t put us off , Perfect size corner room with perfect size bathroom for the two of us and two sofa window seats with different views of Vienna Also it was brilliant to be able to open the soundproofed windows when we wanted to hear the sounds and feel the light breeze of Vienna There was even a tea coffee lounge downstairs if needed and breakfast could be taken in the hotel across the road if wanted with fun efficient staff Charming helpful staff all around always with a smile to greet us Top marks for customer service and for Alexandra Wild re handwritten card Plenty of good fun bars and restaurants minutes away Shopping of all ranges nearby And well Vienna is packed with all sorts of culture and most is walk able from the hotel The people we met and talked to and there were many were lovely and we will most definitely return to explore this little gem more 
371022,Hotel Topazz, Gym was under maintenance, The staff were amazingly friendly One time i forgot my bag in a bus and everyone said its impossible to find it overnight Hotel staff got it for me plus the hotel facilities and decor was astonishing the location is amazing
371023,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Bed was super comfy and the staff were very helpful in providing details of the area and things to do Coffee and multiple types of tea are available downstairs for guests 
371024,Hotel Topazz, The air conditioning was noisy and room was too hot without air conditioning on , Knowledgeable and friendly reception staff Very clean Excellent central location 
371025,Hotel Topazz, The hotel didn t tell me that at winter days the Air conditioning in the hotel was automatically on to heating which means you can t get it to cold mode anymore until the weather becomes hotter I dont mind this feature but i wasn t informed about this one of the main reasons for choosing Topaz was because of the A C Also there isn t any English channels except news , The service was the highlight of the trip special thanks goes to Selina from the front desk The location is also worth mentioning it is centred to many of the main tourists sites 15 20min or sometimes less walks from basically anywhere touristic Also the room is spacious loved the windows the beds were comfortable the bathroom was spacious with Molten brown amenities 
371026,Hotel Topazz, Please note stable internet but rerouted wifi might cause VPN or location based subscription like Netflix streaming issues make sure you have offline content or remote access capability , Great location great service note I have not given a great service remark in 5 years of 50 hotel nights a year Overall my favorite hotel in Vienna for fun and business 
371027,Hotel Topazz, Reception were very keen to know where we were eating as we were not having breakfast or evening meals in the hotel They were quite expensive No complimentary water expensive mini bar for water Room was deceptively smaller than photos showed Tried to ask receptionist for help in purchasing some tampax everything closed at 6pm and no where available husband had to get on the underground to a supermarket in the suburbs Reception should have some emergency packets available in my opinion If more attention had been given to our basic needs sanitary pads and water we might have felt more inclined to hang around the restaurant more Its all about the detail guys , The location and comfort of the hotel room was really good 
371028,Hotel Topazz, Rooms for the standard category are not very large Ideal for a single person but if 2 people it is a little tight especially if you have 2 luggages, What I liked the most us the location of the hotel Very very centrally located Ideal The hotel is a boutique hotel Breakfast is very good and fresh taken at sister hotel Lam e facing Topazz hotel However it is expensive 18 Euros For the price charged for the rooms breakfast should be included Housekeeping is good but can be improved for a 5 star hotel Last but not least the staff is very nice friendly and very helpful In particular I would like to mention Dimitar and Denisa and the front office manager Mrs Wild 
371029,Hotel Topazz, The hotel front desk associate quoted me the wrong price for sparkling wine When we checked out realized the mistake and the hotel still charged us more than quoted Disappointed but still loved the hotel , The salon was beautiful and conveniently open late The location is perfect and the rooms are so beautiful 
371030,Hotel Topazz, To have to pay the taxi , Great place The Topazz is in The center that was amazing The bedroom was really confortable Everything was well except we booked a vehicle on our arrival we waited 20 minutes and then we took a taxi I really was angry The hotel charged us the taxi I find it shameful for a 5 star there was no organization 
371031,Hotel Topazz, The main remark we had with the breakfast was the staff It was not really affiance but rather slow At first I thought that it was a policy of enjoy in nice quiet slow breakfast But then we realized that our order for eggs was forgotten because a nearby table got their eggs and they ordered after us After which I had to ask the waiter where our food was When it did come they got it wrong in the sense of quantity Also the choice of fruits was limited , The location of the breakfast is on the first floor of the sister hotel across the street and has a beautiful view The food was delicious 
371032,Hotel Topazz, Although magnificent the oval windows overlooks into the next building and you should draw the curtains if you wish some privacy , Bathroom mirror doesn t get foggy after a shower Staff is friendly impeccable design Wi Fi has good signal and speed There s a lounge with hot drinks perfect for business appointments 
371033,Hotel Topazz, Breakfast should have been in the same hotel We were asked to go to a hotel across the street As per Booking com this is a 5 star hotel but it is not It was just rated as such by booking com , The staff was very nice Clean rooms Very nice location 
371034,Hotel Topazz, For a hotel of this price range I would expect more This was my tird time in this hotel and I think last one First i came with car there was no parking at all and they do not have vallet parking they have but I was told I have to wait 20 min for someone to pick up my car so just imagine where to put car for 20 min and not get ticket Second they do not have concierge service so I had to leave my wife with luggage to carry it while I was looking for a garage for 380 Euro night in hotel I really expect more Third they do not have breakfast in the hotel they had excellent breakfast but not any more so you have to go across streeet to their sister hotel I do not have to mention that it was raining when I was going to breakfast and no one offered us to bring us breakfast in room Fourth bathroom needs renovation you can see it is few years old and it does not represent hotel in the way they sell themselves This room was not worth more than 200 Euro night so I think it is completely overpriced I really liked this hotel but it is obvious time to say goodbye and find something better , Location and comfort of the room specially bed is great 
371035,Hotel Topazz, Not 5 stars booking rating is 5 stars You pay expensive price to get 5 stars when u check in you notice that it s not rated There is no lobby The breakfast is average located in a hotel next door The hotel is fine but 5 stars No way Very expensive an international chain is far more affordable and really 5 stars , Location
371036,Hotel Topazz, The bedroom looked bashed and worn with stains on the carpets and walls We had to walk across the road to another hotel to have breakfast, The staff were very friendly and offered to do helpful things wothout being asked The 8th floor bedroom had stunning view of central Vienna
371037,Hotel Topazz, No breakfast no in room dining the building is really small and have only one elevator and sometimes you have to wait long the room service come to your room with a basket which they can t clean like others do and no vacuum my room was worst because of the light it was sticked with front building I couldn t recognize is it day or night it was dark always dont take rooms with balcony , excellent location excellent wifi 
371038,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Hotel was very different from what we normally stay at the decor was stylish and the prestige room we stayed in had great views unusually huge windows sills with cushions the wife enjoyed chilling in them 
371039,Hotel Topazz, Ask for coffee machine not standard in the room, Location practically next to the Stephansdom Staff polite friendly helpfull Hip seats in oval windows
371040,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, The location is absolutely fantastic The rooms are very nicely designed and well equipped The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Overall Topazz is one of the best hotels we have ever booked 
371041,Hotel Topazz, I found the solution of parking very expensive 40 per 24 hours is a lot of money , I liked very much the design of the hotel small and nicely designed and executed I am an architect and a contractor so I inspect good quality very easily in a supper good location clean nice basic l can say only good things 
371042,Hotel Topazz, The room is not cleaned every time I requested it no full information is given at check in time so every time I have to ask to get information I don t think the hotel worth this much as price given the service we had , The location is good very close to the center of shopping area 
371043,Hotel Topazz, Missing internet corner or one computer for guest use , Great location very comfortable bed Friendly and nice stuff Willing to help Although there is no computer for guest use they have organised computer use in hotel next to us Thank You Great 
371044,Hotel Topazz, No breakfast at all Only possible for extra payment at next hotel , Perfect location Cozy but a bit small rooms with extraordinary design Perfect hotel for Instagram photos 
371045,Hotel Topazz, I requested a late check out with half of daily rate They applied a very high rate for late check out They did not charge me for 50 of my room rate as per my booking and they applied a much higher rate My late check out cost was almost the same as my full night booking , Location
371046,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, The highlight of your arrival will be meeting the receptionist Anka She was very pleasant and willing to navigate us through Vienna upon our arrival The hotel is very nice and modern 
371047,Hotel Topazz, expensive breakfast and that too at their sister property across the street , Staff especially Sunny who was very helpful The bathrooms were big and very clean with good toilette The tea and coffee salon Perfect location 
371048,Hotel Topazz, Nothing , The staff were so attentive and wonderful We were there to celebrate our anniversary and the staff decorated our room with roses and sent us prosecco to make our stay more romantic We were thrilled And yes everything else comfort balcony location decor was perfect too 
371049,Hotel Topazz, Ac in my room was not working well and they couldn t fix it during my stay , Staff very friendly and helpful Location very convenient Arab news channels Guest self service lounge 
371050,Hotel Topazz, No room available for us maintenance problem they had booked us into another hotel a taxi ride away New hotel had a view of a concrete wall Ended up paying additional 80 to get a better equivalent room Had to negotiate to get breakfast on a similar level to what we had booked They had sent a bottle of wine for us as an apology Disappointed that we didn t get to stay there as our plans were based around that location , Booked because of the boutique style and location 
371051,Hotel Topazz, I can t find a criticism If I were to say anything it would be that I personally would prefer a dresser over cabinets for clothes storage , Extremely comfortable beds loved the linens robe slippers great coffee available free each morning room was beautiful the bathtub and shower was huge and the staff was amazing I am 73 traveling with my 65 year old sister in Europe The staff was always happy to assist in providing directions for us to get the needed subways etc for us to get around to all the attractions even picked up our opera tickets for us I can t say enough about how helpful and pleasant they were and we needed a lot of help Their assistance made all the difference for us in getting around efficiently 
371052,Hotel Topazz, The maids took away towels etc even when they did not need changing The duvets were too hot for the weather but the hotel could not provide thinner blankets Breakfast was across the road in another hotel , The funky bedroom decor and comfy bed Quiet but central location
371053,Hotel Topazz, I was supposed to get an upgrade but the room seemed to be pretty standard for double didn t like that opposite our window was an office meeting room that could see me if I would have opened the curtains , great location clean room well connected 
371054,Hotel Topazz, For understandable reasons rooms and corridors are a bit smaller than one would expect from the 5 star hotel this can be tolerated given the location and limitations of surrounding Major fall back is a lack of a garage not comfortable feeling to give the keys and codes of an expensive car to a total stranger , Design location and overall impression very good stands out from the usual It merits the category of boutique hotel 
371055,Hotel Topazz, Unfortunately this hotel is NOT the 5 star Hotel for sure There are missing services more spacy rooms those are really too small breakfast served on the other side of the street and many other details Who is looking for the 5 stars because of its hospitality will be unsatisfied as we are , Perfect city centre location very nice staff at the reception and especially the service staff in breakfast room of the neighbor hotel where the breakfast is served 
371056,Hotel Topazz, In the bathroom the loo roll holder is on the wrong way round and the roll fell off EVERY time you wanted to take some paper Also the washing things fell out of the rack in the shower all the time and I put my soap in there which immediately fell out on to my toe Nasty bruise Shower itself very good Did not enjoy indifferent dinner taken in sister hotel l Am e, We liked the helpful staff very much We liked being able to help ourselves to coffee tea in the lounge downstairs We don t eat breakfast so cannot comment on that as it was taken in the sister hotel over the road We loved the position very handy for all outings and sights We had a balcony with no view but it was nice being able to have it open at night 
371057,Hotel Topazz, A choice of pillows might be a good idea Also breakfast variety could be improved , Excellent stay at the Topazz Hotel Location and front desk staff outstanding Free Coffee tea facilities greatly enjoyed Rooms are a very good size Bathrroom facilities are excellent 
371058,Hotel Topazz, Air conditioning was quite noisy and not very effective We choice to switch the air con off to sleep That was just about OK in mid April but I wouldn t like to do this in the height of summer Breakfast is provided in their sister hotel opposite Very expensive for what you get , Great Location Interesting architecture
371059,Hotel Topazz, Everything was great except one staff member at the Cafe Bar Bloom where breakfast was served Melanie was behaving rude and unprofessional And the most important thing with European and US guests she was extremely nice and friendly and professional Had to report a racial discrimination to the manager Thanks to other staff members besides this incident everything else was great , Location comfort 
371060,Hotel Topazz, Just the smell from the drainage in bathroom but it is like this in the old town everywhere, Perfect location perfect service perfect sleep quality No complaints Just a couple of rooms on a floor which makes it a very quiet place Loved the design of the rooms From the outfit and the manners of the people at the reception to the smallest detail everything just classy
371061,Hotel Topazz, Nothing, It is my first time in Vienna and Topazz hotel made Vienna feel like home The staff is super friendly and are willing to help anytime The location is perfect and would definitely stay there again and recommend it to everybody 
371062,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Great hotel in a great location Prestige rooms definitely worth the extra Staff in both Tooazz and Lamazz were great very helpful and friendly Dinner in sister hotel Lamazz was excellent
371063,Hotel Topazz, Breakfast could be improved with the addition of menu perhaps , Extremely comfortable beds Larger rooms worth it value for money Location is superb Staff friendly and helpful Would recommend and stay again for sure 
371064,Hotel Topazz, Room was small for 2 people Wardrobe was tiny and there was no space for 2 suitcases Also there was only a stool in the room so no chair to sit in not great for older guests No tea making facilities in the room and the guest lounge closes early , Location and the welcome chocolates and note from the manager A very nice touch 
371065,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Everything was great especially loved the touch of the tea room on the lower level where you could go and make a beautiful pit of tea with leaf anytime you liked coffee to 
371066,Hotel Topazz, The room was too hot and it was not possible to turn down the heat even after inquiring with the front desk When we requested an iron it took about 15 minutes for it to be delivered to our room When we went downstairs for coffee in the morning the staff hadn t even added milk to the coffee machine so it couldn t make anything but espresso We had to notify the staff of this In the end I would only qualify this as a 4 star hotel not 5 , The check in process was very smooth and the people at the front desk were always helpful and in a good mood 
371067,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, We have no menu sir just tell us what you would like and our chef will make it was our answer at breakfast Hotel Topazz will make you feel welcome in every way possible We stayed over Christmas with them and we even received a card and a gift on Christmas Day The decor in the room is amazing the bed super comfortable and the room words can t describe with those two windows looking out onto the street below 
371068,Hotel Topazz, I had booked a deluxe room that stated the divan window seat was featured however we were not given a room with this feature which was very disappointing Breakfast is served in the sister hotel across the street which wasnt a problem except for the extremely rude staff Staff were rude when it was pointed out that there were no glasses and plates left available in the buffet section we were ignored upon arrival and treated like unwanted visitors We didnt bother returning for breakfast on the second morning , Location was perfect So central everything in walking distance and stephansplatz around the corner Lovely decor in the room brilliant shower Salon downstairs great for grabbing a complimentary tea coffee or in my case hot chocolate 
371069,Hotel Topazz, Nothing, The staff in the Topazz Hotel are the best we have ever met Without exception each member of staff was friendly professional and extremely helpful 
371070,Hotel Topazz, We would have appreciated coffee being available in the early morning and an English language news station , The room was very clean and comfortable The bathroom was modern with a great walk in shower 
371071,Hotel Topazz, The rooms were slightly over heated and we couldn t control the temperature, Excellent location friendly staff very nice room design just the best place I have stayed at in Vienna

371073,Hotel Topazz, we loved everything about this hotel Hope to be able to go back one day , Great location about 2 small blocks away from Stephan s Platz The hotel s design was lovely The beds very comfortable and the bathroom perfect They also have a lounge in the basement where free coffee and tea are served free all day no coffee in the room There was a nice gourmet type super market right across the hotel and it was very close to the nice shopping area 
371074,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, We contacted hotel in advance of stay and they were able to accommodate all requests We really enjoyed our 4 night stay and the location is in the heart of inner city The lounge windows are so unique this hotel has style The breakfast is across the street but a very nice hotel with amazing views We ll be back 
371075,Hotel Topazz, I didnt like that breakfast area is in another building It was better before when they had it in the same building downstairs The smell of bakery in the morning made the hotel cozier ,No Positive
371076,Hotel Topazz, Whilst the mini bar was free it did not have wine beer or crisps There was no way to make a cup of tea in the room The salon downstairs only ran 10am to 10pm so no good night cup of tea when coming back in after a meal and a walk around town , The room was beautiful and the bathroom was wonderful 
371077,Hotel Topazz, No facilities whatsoever For example breakfast are is served at a sister facility across the street No gym or a lobby lounge to speak of , Great location helpful staff 
371078,Hotel Topazz,No Negative, Totally in love with the window The whole room was beautiful very stylish and full of gorgeous details The bed was very comfortable the staff friendly and the roof bar opposite served excellent drinks I can t recommend this place enough 
371079,Hotel Topazz, Restaurants close by are rather touristy Although the roof terrace in the Lamee is close I would suggest the Sofitel bar Le Loft , Great location although for an authentic Viennese experience you should be prepared to walk away from the touristy surroundings Very friendly reception staff Great shower
