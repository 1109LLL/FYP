247583,H tel Original Paris, Wifi was weak in my room The bathtub was too near the bed which only allows you to take a bath instead of shower if you don t want to wet the bed and floor , I left my Valentino handbag in the hotel The staffs search and confirmed the bag is with them efficiently after I called the front desk They kept the bag for me until I returned to Paris for a short stay I also love the complimentary tea coffee in the lobby as well as the large and comfortable bed 
247584,H tel Original Paris, Only a bath tub with curtain in the middle of the bedroom was very uncomfortable to shower in nowhere to put shower gel and hold up shower head at same time Tiny toiled room no privacy No minibar fridge iron coffee making facilities in room Baseboards were dirty one pillow cover was dirty no refills on the q tips after using the 4 provided on first day Bath tub was not cleaned one day , Great location right next to Place de la Bastille and Metro stop not far from Gare de L est Easy walking or metro rides to all attractions Nice bed but moved away from headboard Mirror is also the TV Free tea and coffee downstairs in the afternoons 
247585,H tel Original Paris, A larger room but it was sufficient for the two of us , Stayed two weeks unexpectantly this hotel is a GEM the hotel is beautifully curated as an art hotel the staff is SUPERB they couldn t have been more caring more professional or more concerned that my stay in Paris was perfect The rooms are beautiful not hugh but perfect BED AND SHOWER FANTASTIC and the sauna Was private and spotless The hotel is impeccable 
247586,H tel Original Paris, We really enjoyed the stay no criticisms here , Fantastic location in Marais only a few steps from Bastille and Plas de Voges Staff were extremely friendly and helpful We stayed in the Gold room Room was very clean and the shower was probably the best hotel shower my wife and I had on our 15 day trip in France Room size was slightly larger that expected compared to other equivalent Paris hotels we have stayed at in the past Our room overlooked Boulevard Beaumarchais but it was extremely quiet double glazing comlpletely blocked out traffic noise We only spent one night at the hotel but it was our last night in France and this was a perfect venue and a very confortable last night stay We will certainly stay there again and strongly recommend this hotel
