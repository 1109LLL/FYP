472322,Hotel Clerici, AC was not on when we arrived in the room We were shown to the room so the staff had the opportunity to turn it on properly This was not done When we asked they turned it on but it did not work properly so the room was too hot to be comfortable Furthermore the noise from the street is fairly high , Breakfast and location very good Friendly staff but not high performing in terms of making sure the room is in perfect shape 
472323,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, The staff was great and the breakfast was marvellous We had a great stay Unfortunately we only stayed for one night We will definitely be back again 
472324,Hotel Clerici, The hotel staff did not offer us any help with luggage despite the elevator was broken and our room was on the third floor My wife and I are elderly and it was very difficult to carry our suitcases up to the third floor room The breakfast room was very small and the food was regular I wouldn t stay here again , Location 
472325,Hotel Clerici, Dirty bathroom when we arrived at the hotel dusty room Elevator was broken during our stay The breakfast place was very small and had some products not very fresh Definitely is not a 4 star hotel I wouldn t stay at the hotel again , Location 
472326,Hotel Clerici, No air conditioning working Promised us rooms one level up because no elevator But one room was two levels up and one was five levels up above lobby Booking said the hotel agreed to give us a discount if elevator was not working but hotel refused to I will put negative on Facebookuuui,No Positive
472327,Hotel Clerici, The elevator was quite old and the smell of the cleaning spray i m guessing was quite strong The coffee was alright for Milano but always on the colder side I would still stay there again , Beautiful cozy and quiet boutique hotel in the heart of Milano but away from the crowded areas Staff were very nice and always welcoming with a big smile Central location takes 5 minutes walking to Duomo di Milano shopping streets and to many great restaurants They were very kind to upgrade us to a jumior suite Rooms are quite spacious very clean huge bathroom and a big balcony with a nice view The bed was very comfortable hard mattress if you like them with memory foam pillows finally a hotel did it Breakfast was simple with pasteries eggs cerial and cold cuts and quite tasty Recommended for couples small group or solo travellers but not for families 
472328,Hotel Clerici, This is not a 4 star hotel The hotel said that they would be able to provide gluten free bread for my sister However on the morning when we were expecting the bread they informed us that they were not able to provide any this was clearly too late The dining area only sits 12 people and considering there are 12 rooms in this hotel breakfast was a tight squeeze in an area smaller than our actual room Also they don t wash the blueberries before they place them in the serving bowl Hotel is down a pretty quiet street if you re on your own I wouldn t book this place it s quite isolated even though it s off a main road No kettles in the rooms Hotel is down a quiet street Small dining area Blueberries were not washed before being placed in the serving bowl Not gluten free friendly Making a mistake with our rooms We checked in and they gave us a suite then told us to move out Traveling as a family of 4 in 2 rooms we were not put together put on different levels Not good Definitely not returning This is a shame because the location is great , Location 
472329,Hotel Clerici, This definitely was NOT a 4 star hotel It was not even comparable to the 3 star in Venice we stayed There was essentially no air conditioning It was so hot in the room we sweated the whole time and it was hard to sleep To top off the hot room the shower drain was broken and plugged up so we had to wait for the water levels to go down to finish a shower and before the next person could go There was no laundry service on the weekend which we didn t find out about until after we got it all bagged up There was no ice This was a miserable experience , The memory foam pillows
472330,Hotel Clerici, Airconditioning did not function well due to the vent location Apparently a known problem , Very friendly and helpful staff In spite of late arrival and a non functioning credit card we were accommodated in a nice large room Excellent breakfast Good location near Duomo 
472331,Hotel Clerici, The hot water in our room could have been hotter but given it was 30 degrees outside we coped but wouldn t want that in the winter , Small boutique hotel will lovely spacious rooms spotlessly clean and with a huge comfortable bed There is a small breakfast room all the produce was excellent as was the coffee There is no bar area in the hotel we prefer to use non hotel bars on holiday but an excellent wine bar at the end of the road for night caps etc Very centrally located for the Duomo etc staff were friendly and helpful would recommend and def stay again 
472332,Hotel Clerici, Can t think of anything , The location is great Close to the Duomo and La Scala in a very quiet street The breakfast was delicious fresh fruit and the best selection of breads Staff very friendly and helpful 
472333,Hotel Clerici, Breakfast would be great if e g omlettes would be offered for Business trips often a great way of having a swift and nurishing breakfast also I have to say I didn t ask given the rather small breakfast room and breakfast set up I simply assumed they would not have it Entrance door of room was not really sound proof one would hear people talking in the hall very loud, Small family style hotel in the center of Milan yet a rather quiet street Location in general very good however a bit to walk to uderground Station s obviously newly renovated rooms with good WIFI bathroom and room of good size breakfast was also family style like with e g a variety of fresh and good quality fruits nicely cut Swift check in and check out process
472334,Hotel Clerici, Would have been nice to have tea coffee making facility in room, Excellent location close to the Castello and Duomo Clean modern rooms and lovely breakfast choices Staff very friendly and efficient We had a problem with our room and we were allocated another room without any fuss Would definitely stay here again 
472335,Hotel Clerici, There was nothing we didnt like everthing was perfect , Staff were very helpful and went out of their way to help The room was very spacious and very clean and the bed was very comfortable Only ashort walk to the main attractions 
472336,Hotel Clerici, The pillows were hard I told reception when we checked out and she said that if I had asked there are soft pillows I told her it would be a great idea to tell people when they check in , The bed was comfortable Location excellent near Brera and a 10 minute walk to Duomo 
472337,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, Room was really big comfortable and the bed was really nice Decoration was modern and spotless Bathroom was big enough but shower was a bit tight Some staff was really helpful and gave awesome recommendations others weren t that helpful Location was really central but hotel is located in a really small street a bit dark for night walk Breakfast was ampler than I thought it would be for a small hotel 
472338,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, Remodeled and updated 10 room hotel in a good location to walk to various sites On a quiet street off of the main streets Might be hard to find on own One way streets to navigate Wonderful staff and lovely accommodations Very good wifi in the rooms We booked the suite on upper floor which was a higher price point than the other rooms There was a small lift to get to top floor We enjoyed the private patio Had easy walks to several restaurants close by Full continental breakfast with a wide variety of options We enjoyed our four days at this hotel 
472339,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, The location is very central yet quiet and cozy It is a pleasure to stroll in all directions from the hotel The rooms are stylish and modern The bed was comfortable and I had a great sleep The hotel employees are very friendly and helpful It was a great stay 
472340,Hotel Clerici, N A, We stayed in a good size superior room Staff very friendly and welcoming Breakfast good standard continental breakfast The hotel has only 10 rooms in very central location walking distance to Duomo Brera and shopping districts 
472341,Hotel Clerici, The mini bar was not working the door didn t work properly the water pressure in the shower was really low the door has space bellow so you can hear every door and every noise coming from the building, the location the breakfast the fact that they are dog friendly and big space of the room
472342,Hotel Clerici, The breakfast could do with a bit more variety however what is offered is nice and of good quality , Great location all key sights within easy reach by foot La Scala is literally round the corner Nord Cadorna train station where the Malpensa airport express arrives is within 10 12 minutes walk Despite a very central location it is very quiet at night The room as well as the bathroom are spacious and I loved the firm but not too firm mattress such a contrast to the soft mattresses all too often found in hotel beds Drinking water in the room was free of charge and was replaced daily Staff are friendly and helpful 
472343,Hotel Clerici, Only one thing I can remeber it would be great to clean the light switches and vaccum the ceiling fan in the bathroom from time to time , Everything was just great 
472344,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, It was definitely not noisy at night which was mentioned several times when I was browsing reviews Also the breakfast buffet was beyond our expectation good even though there were limited choices 
472345,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, Charming and modern hotel located in a quiet road in the heart of Milano The room was spacious the staff was very friendly and we loved the buffet breakfast 
472346,Hotel Clerici, They don t have a bar if you want to have a drink at night , We stayed at the superior rooms and they where actually VERY big Specially for Milan the facilities where modern It is a boutique hotel only 10 rooms Location was great and the breakfast selection was very nice Staff was attentive
472347,Hotel Clerici, It would be nice if the bathroom towel heater would work bathroom is a bit chilly , friendly staff comfortable pillows perfect location walking distance from Duomo la Scala good breakfast with fresh fruits and berries

472349,Hotel Clerici, wouldn t changed a thing, For not having any cooked food like omelette etc their breakfast was terrific with fresh berries great cheeses and hams pastries The place is spotless rooms are roomy decor is cool and stylish location is outstanding close to La Scala the Duomo Brera fashion shopping streets

472357,Hotel Clerici, The room wasn t very quiet with the noise from the street, The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful location is excellent Very good value for money
472358,Hotel Clerici, This is not a criticism of the hotel but of the male interior designers who seem to think that hotel guests will be 6 7 feet tall presumably like themselves and thus can hang clothes on a wardrobe cross bar that is so high it requires some to use a chair to access Similarly the design of the room door handle tricked more than one guest while I was staying there , The location of Hotel Clerici is superb when your reason for visiting Milan is to go to La Scala it s just a three minute walk away The hotel is new very Italian understated chic clean and comfortable The staff were really friendly and helpful I d have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others or in staying here again 
472359,Hotel Clerici, slight mosquito problem, The comfort and cleanliness of the room were fantastic The staff were lovely especially the two ladies who work during the day Very attentive happy to direct you or make reservations for dinner 
472360,Hotel Clerici, Room AC was very poor and it was very hot and I don t recommend staying in summer Mosquitoes was everywhere and you can imagine next morning Breakfast very poor and simple, It is 5 minutes walking from Duomo
472361,Hotel Clerici,No Negative, We were upgraded to the junior suite which was a very comfortable and expansive area The hotel is newly renovated modern and clean with friendly and helpful staff Breakfast was an expanded continental and more than adequate Being 10 minutes walk away from the Duomo was very convenient

472364,Hotel Clerici, Being attacked by mosquitoes every night when stay there when reflected the situation to front desk requested for anti pest actions the lady suggested us to buy anti mosquitoes spray in supermarket Even after killing more than half a dozen mosquitoes we still left with amost a dozen bites each Won t come back again , Location is pretty close to the city center 
472365,Hotel Clerici, nothing we didn t like, Friendly and informative staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable Great location and beautiful room Would definitely stay there again when next in Milan
472366,Hotel Clerici, I would very much have appreciated having a kettle and tea coffee and cups in the room Also an ironing board and iron , I liked the boutique nature of the hotel only a few rooms the great service and the excellent breakfasts A petite breakfast room but a really delightful selection including breads hams cheeses fruit and pastries The combination of modern sleek rooms with things like good bathrooms and bedding and flatscreen TVs in an older renovated building was very pleasing The location is very good although it is in a VERY quiet street it is only a few minutes walk to the main city centre 
472367,Hotel Clerici, Door knob system was really uncomfortable but was informed that they are already to change those , Have been in Milan before and never had such a nice stay Great location spotless room nice breakfast super friendly team I will surely return Happy to have finally found a nice accommodation in Milan

472370,Hotel Clerici, The hotel is a bit pricey considering it has no facilities such as gym spa etc Breakfast is nice but could use some additional healthier options and some warm dishes For example dark bread low fat yoghurts lactose and gluten free options scrambles eggs , The hotel is located very near to the Duomo so right a the centre Te staff was really nice and helpful The room was large and the bed very comfortable 
472371,Hotel Clerici, Everything was great , Gianluca and his staff were amazingly welcoming helpful and professional The location was incredible walking distance to most major attractions The room was quiet large and extremely comfortable The breakfast provided a delicious and varied selection with protein choices as well as fruit cereal breads and pastries Will definitely choose this hotel again when I return to Milano
