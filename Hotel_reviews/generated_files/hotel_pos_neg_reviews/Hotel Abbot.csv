280315,Hotel Abbot, In some places there was a smell of sewage in Barcelona and it came up from the pipes a couple of times into our room , Helpful front desk staff and excellent breakfast 
280316,Hotel Abbot, after travelling through france and spain staying in little towns full of charm this hotel was pretty charmless but it served its purpose , Really good location for MOBILITY close walking distance i e with a rolling suitcase to the main Sant train station to the metro and rental car agencies by Sant In a more work aday section of town so lots of little cafes for locals with inexpensive but yummy food 
280317,Hotel Abbot, Only a few minor negative aspects The reception staff was not overly friendly The doors to the corridors with the rooms were left open causing some noise during the night as other guests were returning There was no coffee or tea facility in the room , We liked the efficient cleaner The air conditioning and the blackout blinds were a major bonus during a heatwave The reception staff spoke English There was a hairdryer in the room The bed was comfortable The location was good as it is only 5 min walk from the main train station which also has two metro lines passing through it 
280318,Hotel Abbot, NOTHING They were excellent staff and the venue , The staff were great I d forgot my UK plug adaptor and they lent me one to use without any charge The maid was lovely and kind and the room was kept very tidy
280319,Hotel Abbot,No Negative, Approach good smal room with little moving space no room service no staff should be 3 star hotel asked about charges too much paid
280320,Hotel Abbot,No Negative, Nice hotel and good destination to where we wanted for the Grand Prix if your just looking for bed and breakfast definitely a place to go They only have a sun terrace and a breakfast room rooms were good but only to and mini bar facilities and bath and a small tv didn t watch as we were out all the time 
280321,Hotel Abbot, Less road noise upgrade the double glazing , Great location near Estacio Sants station for RENFE metro and a short walk from Placa Espanya and Tarragona metro Very helpful staff baggage left until later for my convenience VERY clean modern and and neat room with great aircon I was in a 2nd floor room facing Avenida de Roma 
280322,Hotel Abbot, Our room key kept not working so we had to go to the reception everytime we wanted to get into our room we were on the 5th floor It was quite far from the city centre but was close to the magic fountain etc The aircon didn t work properly and the room was really warm and humid throughout the night Bathroom tiles were smashed in and just looked really worn out It was expensive for what it was , The breakfast was really good and it was near to the metro and train station It was also easy enough to get to from the airport via to aerobus 
280323,Hotel Abbot,No Negative, Great location near Sants Estacio just a short metro into the centre Hotel was comfortable with a great breakfast Really helpful friendly staff We would stay there again Photo is from the hotel good area opposite a supermarket 
280324,Hotel Abbot, Bad sound isolation All noises from the corridors street are heard in the room The toilet was running and leakind in the first room I got so I asked for another one In the second one the toilet was also running but not so loud the room needs repair the mirror in the closet door was broken Overall everything quite shabby , Fairly decent breakfast City center Catalonia square within 30 min walk 5 min on taxi Helpful and friendly staff
280325,Hotel Abbot, Tourist attraction places was far away from here There is not much halal options in breakfast as well , The balcony view was quiet good The only plus point we got is that the hotel is very near to saints station as we have to catch a flight so we got the direct train to catch up the flight on time 
280326,Hotel Abbot, the facilities were poor the morning guy was rude but kept a smiling face we had no fridge and he said that s just the way it is I would not recommend this hotel , the lady in the afternoon shift did her best 
280327,Hotel Abbot, Breakfast was not included and for the price it should have been , Staff were always very friendly and welcoming Good location close to the best metro lines and on the tourist bus route 
280328,Hotel Abbot, In the middle of summer the air conditioning was centrally controlled and very low We could not get it to a comfortable temperature to sleep Also we checked in past midnight as out train was late and when we asked for a bit of a late checkout we were told that we would have to pay even for 1 2 hour So it turned out to be an expensive night just to use the bed , The night staff that checked us in was great He was friendly and directed us to a late night restaurant where we could get some food 
280329,Hotel Abbot, The air con seemed to treat its cool setting as an aspiration rather than an achievable goal , A perfect location for those arriving on the airport train just 5 minutes walk from the station And the Metro line from that station takes you direct to Las Ramblas the sea front in a few minutes The room was compact but spotless and very presentable and very quiet 
280330,Hotel Abbot,No Negative, Used the hotel for a single night s stay for catching a connecting train the next morning The location was very close to the trains station and accommodations fitted my needs
280331,Hotel Abbot, Probably one of the worst hotel I have been to I have been charged extra fees without any authorization and the receptionist is going away from his desk during the night Expect to stay at the door 35minutes before to be allowed to enter without any excuses from him The poorest customer service in the world and don t expect to get a room like it s shown on the pictures everything is a big joke here Shame ,No Positive

280334,Hotel Abbot, On arrival I was sent to room 401 which was the size of a shoe box I changed rooms and was put into 201 This room was slightly bigger Decoration is awful no English tv noise levels high I would advise to stay elsewhere Outdoor roof top area needs TLC, Staff were friendly
