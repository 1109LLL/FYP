13100,Hotel Panache, You can hear people from other rooms loud and clear I couldn t sleep after 7am after the other guests woke up The first guy on the reception was rude and unhelpful , Location Good view Clean room and clean bathroom Air conditioner 
13101,Hotel Panache, ventilation is good on the top 7th floor as our room 702 had windows facing in 2 different directions However room 402 e g facing just one side was kind of stuffy , the staff was friendly and helpful When making a booking i added a couple of special requests 1 the room to face away from the street and 2 have 2 twin beds When we checked in both requests have been ignored although the concierge could see them in his system So next day after my complaining they readily moved us to another room which again did not satisfy either of the two criteria but was now on the top floor higher up above the street noise Go figure I really apreciate the advise I got ftom Mohammad to be at the airport earlier It turned out that indeed the lines and the wait at CDG were horrendous There is an ajacent restaurant that serves fine complementary breakfast The staff there is also very friendly For other meals prices are a bit too high for the value Another plus is that this hotel is a long walk await from Montmartre The beds were very comfortable 
13102,Hotel Panache, The walls are thin so it was possible to hear a lot of what was happening in the neighbouring room , Very cozy and pleasant hotel nice staff and great rooms 
13103,Hotel Panache, The elevator There are only 2 elevators one of each only reach up to level 2 and the other one is able to reach up to level 7 But the one which can go to high levels is so small and only able to fit 4 persons it also uses for the housekeepers You need luck to be able to use the elevator , Yummy pain au chocolate nice staffs clean room
13104,Hotel Panache, Nothing, The staff went over and above for us before we had even checked in The female manager was a joy to deal with The detail in the room is just to die for It s a great area with lots to do within walking distance 
13105,Hotel Panache, Nothing, Everything Fantastic room on the 5th floor spacious comfortable bed staff is always very nice and location is perfect Everytime I go to Paris I try to book this hotel 
13106,Hotel Panache, The cleanliness of the bathroom could be improved And the shower was way too small for me , Great design of the room which was very cosy loved the atmosphere in the hotel nice products in the bathroom and the location is right in the center of the trendy Paris with many bars and restaurants around
13107,Hotel Panache,No Negative, We were able to visit most places on foot but Metro is only a 5 minutes walk away Good breakfast in relaxed atmosphere just ask for coffee and everything else is self service Fresh bread and croissants Good shower pressure Great burger place just opposite and tasty crepes at the top of the road 
13108,Hotel Panache, Though chambre de bonne was very cosy we could not walk up straight in the room because of the beams We also missed a proper wardrobe with hangers and some hooks for coats , Extremely helpfull staff Charming hotel Great beds 
13109,Hotel Panache, The wifi was slow and sometimes we were unable to use it , The staff where welcoming and friendly and our room always got nicely cleaned Reception staff very helpful 
13110,Hotel Panache, We d appreciate if the staff hadn t referred to us as MadameMonsieur we are two guys even though it s a habit obviously , We got the most beautiful room with four windows facing the streets of Paris Wonderful views The staff is very friendly The bed is comfortable We had a great time 
13111,Hotel Panache, Cleanliness They didn t clean the used coffee cups from previous guest , Very nice interior design of the hotel Very convenient location and safe neighborhood 
13112,Hotel Panache, The shower room is small so water could be everywhere , Location is excelent staff very helpfull my room has a balcony so my husband could smoking out there 
13113,Hotel Panache, We had an unpleasant experience when getting breakfast I was traveling with my 83 year old mother We arrived just at the end of the breakfast hour and although the buffet was still out were told we had to leave which seemed ridiculous as people were still eating and food was there in front of us My mother is very unsteady on her feet and the restaurant manager was totally rude and inconsiderate I complained to management and I believe he was reprimanded They told me that they might offer us a free breakfast the next day but they charged us The manager had changed his attitude though The elevator is tiny and not for the claustrophobic , The design is really fun and fresh The beds were very comfortable Most of the staff were lovely Bathroom was big with a huge tub 
13114,Hotel Panache, See above, I was very disappointed with the hotel as it had received rave reviews from Conde Naste Traveller magazine The room was basic with no bed side tables The only good thing to say about it is that the very small twin beds were comfortable I would never stay there again
13115,Hotel Panache, Wifi wasn t great showers are also tiny not all rooms have showers which could be better communicated online as people expect a shower as standard Mini bar is limited and fridge not cold , Beautifully designed hotel very comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful
13116,Hotel Panache, The bathrooms smelt like cabbage and the halls are very narrow so you can hear quite a lot , We didn t spend much time in our room but the hotel itself looks very stylish The rooms have lovely decor features although our room is quite basic looking Location was nice plenty of restaurants to visit 
13117,Hotel Panache, It would be nice if there was coffee served in the lobby served as well As the restaurant is closed during the day , Loved the design of the hotel The soaps were very nice as well en the bed was lovely 
13118,Hotel Panache, Narrow bed small windows and dark interior Cold bathroom without additional heating Low ceiling in the room gives the impression of gloomy room Small elevator for 2 people , design
13119,Hotel Panache, Service was terrible we asked if we could have a drink in the restaurant which was empty and we were told only if we were eating There was no other place to have a drink We also asked a number of question at reception and were told someone would come back to us which they didn t And finally we were disturbed by other guests who we think had escorts to the hotel and proceeded to keep up the whole hotel with their activities We were on the 4th floor friends on 5th and other guest we talked to from 2nd floor and everyone was disturbed also by the subsequent arguement and intervention of another guest Several people were complaining at reception however no discount on the room not even a complimentary breakfast was offered The guy in reception was laughing about it , Looked nice from the outside
13120,Hotel Panache, Very tight space all around Shower cubicle not made for bigger people Staff is uninterested and borderline arrogant Hotel is far from any tourist destinations area not very attractive or interesting If you have a neighbor who smokes your room will also smell of smoke Will not return , Stylish decor
13121,Hotel Panache, one staff who can t speak English it was always tough to communicate with him and sometimes there s only him i appreciate and feel more secure if he can speak English a bit more , breakfast here is just amazing good selection stylish desinged restaurant and soft croissan you can t miss it room is cozy but it s enough space always tidy and clean such a well designed and fashionable 
13122,Hotel Panache, yes the corridors might be tight but it is Paris, the bed was great and comfortable value for money is great for Paris hotels this is a newly renovated hotel and it was great
13123,Hotel Panache, The shower head in room 204 needs to be tightened , We liked the location good buzz felt safe with many good restaurants and supermarkets Close to Metro The staff were very welcoming and accommodating The room was small but not tiny and very clean The bed was very comfortable WiFi was very good We would definitely return 
13124,Hotel Panache, some staff is not good at commnicating in english i asked them not clean my room as i don t prefer someone to enters my room but it was done all day i stayed, good location stylish designed room awesome breakfast
13125,Hotel Panache,No Negative, From the moment we walked in we felt like we were in a dream Each design element is so tasteful and we loved the decor furnishings and colours The bed was comfy x 10 The only downfall was that we had to leave our beautiful room to explore the city 
13126,Hotel Panache, The bread ran out at breakfast When i asked for more of the french baguette they told me this was not possible If you can t get a french baguette in france for breakfast where can you ,No Positive
13127,Hotel Panache, The drain in the bath room is very bad When I was taking shower I need to control the water faucet in case the water overflow , Good location It s very close to Opera metro station 
13128,Hotel Panache, we stayed in a superior double which was a lovely room but the wet room did not contain the shower water the water went everywhere except for down the drain and flooded onto the carpet in our room resulting in a very rushed shower We got moved to a suite for the following night because of this issue then found that the suite had EXACTLY the same issue carpet drenched Tiling needs to be more angled to allow the water to filter to the drain hole , We liked the location of the hotel the beds were very comfortable the decor of the rooms was lovely and the hotel felt clean and fresh Staff were friendly and spoke good English Breakfast was nice enjoyed the croissants 
13129,Hotel Panache, No wardrobe only two shelves plus a metal bar without hangers good that I always have a couple in my suitcase Light was flickering when turned to the dim mode , Perfect location between the metro stations Grands Boulevards and Cadet my favourite area of Paris with lots of caf s bakeries and food shops Cleanness and stylish design of the room very comfortable double bed spacious bathroom with a window nice little balcony room 603 a kettle and a cup provided upon my request Nice and friendly staff Great choice for the price 
13130,Hotel Panache, Nothing it was perfect Although the lift is teeny tiny not good for anyone with claustrophobia 4 ppl were like sardines in it , Lovely quiet rooms gorgeous design features really comfy bed good size room and bathroom for Paris immaculately clean really lovely staff perfect location 
13131,Hotel Panache, Room sizes in Paris are naturally very small The shower area has a very small glass panel and water would fill up the entire bathroom floor as it spilled from the shower area despite a lot of conscious manoeuvring There are no tea or coffee making facilities and I had to buy water from the nearby grocery store , Location is fantastic surrounded by grocery stores fabulous patisserie round the corner 2 subway lines and even a famous french bistro Chartier The room is beautifully decorated in art deco style and the bed is comfortable Eventhough it is located in a busy intersection the windows are sound proof Its great to just look out the balcony and watch the world go by Staff are friendly helpful and respond well to feedback and requests
