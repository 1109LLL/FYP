494173,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I wished that booking com could have told us that the hotel was closing on the day of our checkout It was inconvenient that we could not do a late checkout and or leave our luggage at the hotel after checkout as the hotel was closing at 12 30 noon Also the walls in the hotel are very thin and you could hear everything in the hallway however the hotel was pretty quiet when we were there so it was not much of a bother , Very clean room comfortable bed and good size bathroom Good and strong wifi The location was ideal for us as we don t mind walking It is about 15 mins walk to the Duomo 
494174,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Chaotic service at breakfast we had to wait for a table for a while and nobody was interested to provide us one Mediocre food for 4 star hotel , Nice spacious and quiet room comfortable bathroom with bath tube Kind service at reception desk 
494175,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The staff at the reception during my checkout were not that helpful and kind Probably because I was a bit late on the scheduled checkout I felt they were upset Overall it was a great experience though,No Positive
494176,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great Hotel its in a good location Shops cafes near by A nice 20 min walk to Duomo and Galleria Emanuel Staff very helpful Our room 4th floor was quiet and well equipped for us would recommend 
494177,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The breakfast could be healthier and the outdoor space more inviting The piano bar could have a more lounge feeling Fresh drinks not only alcoholic should be available in a welcoming bar , The staff at the front desk The linens on the bed The bathroom the shower specially 
494178,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, 20 min walk from Cathedral it was OK for me but other may find it far away or some form of transportation would be needed, Hotel is great modern clean staff is very nice and helpful
494179,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Located in a quiet and safe area in city center 10 15 min car drive to Milano Centrale train station Well maintained and clean room Breakfast is nice with a small garden as dining area Staffs are helpful with taxi booking 
494180,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing , This was our favourite accomodation in 4 weeks of travel Superb breakfast decor and clean We felt so spoilt and relaxed to be in this hotel in Milan 20 minute walk from cathedral and quick taxi to central station 
494181,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Too much focus on the dolce at breakfast if you ask me but I guess that comes with the territory , Overall good impression of the hotel 
494182,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing, Great Staff which is very helpfull and do good service clean Rooms and very quite 15 minutes to foot to the centre The connection by bus is about 10 minutes to the main station 
494183,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, A bit far from the underground 15 min walk in a summer day seems quite long but for us was ok we choose this neighborhood on purpose as we know how to move around from there , The room was nice the staff very helpful professional and efficient the bed I think had the same mattress I have home if not mistaken should be the Tempur line or sth similar and it was comfortable Cleanness excellent the breakfast with good choices Well the overall review score 9 2 tells it all 
494184,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing , Nice hotel Nothing fancy but nice Walking distance from the center On the way to the center there are many small local cafes for locals which I found very nice and cozy 
494185,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I didn t manage to operate the air condition and I was a bit cold , The room was excellent quiet spacy and all in good condition The breakfast was really good The staff as also during my 1st stay was very client oriented service minded and friendly I also had a special wish which the staff was able to accommondate A big thank you for the flexibility 
494186,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel in a decent location I was about a 20 minute walk to the Duomo I decided to eat breakfast at some nearby restaurants and there were a few nearby It s in a nice area and I felt completely safe It even had a nice exercise room which is not common in hotels in Europe I would recommend this hotel 
494187,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Would have liked some more English speaking television channels , Convenient location for Milan city center short taxis journey from Linate Airport Nice room and bathroom breakfast was very good 
494188,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Very nicely appointed hotel in a nice area Excellent value for the money clean will stay again without hesitation We just stayed for a night on the way to Linate Airport The staff recommended an excellent restaurant The airport is very easy to reach the bus stop is within 5 minutes walk and it s a 30 minute easy ride While not in the centre it s close enough to make location convenient to get around 
494189,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Perhaps someone should be at the door to give a hand with the luggage as the lift is a bit too small for 2 people and 2 large suitcases , The bed was extremely comfortable the red and blue lights in the bathroom were very original and all the staff was extremely helpful As we had to leave very early for tour we were given 2 little bags of goodies That was very much appreciated 
494190,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The position isn t near a metro station and the buses are very confusing and the staff were not helpful at all Breakfast also wasn t great , The hotel is really lovely and clean and comfortable I liked that there was a Coin Departmental store very nearby 
494191,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The breakfast restaurant does not have enough comfortable seats for all the guests in one part the restaurant there are small coffee tables which are rather to have coffee and cake and chat than to eat breakfast , Room was very comfortable and quiet bed very comfortable Breakfast very good although not many vegetables to choose vegaterian friendly vegan not so much 
494192,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Maybe the reception staff could ve pointed out the rooftop terrace we didn t know it was there until We checked out , The room was very spacious Breakfast was fantastic everything you could have wanted We also had dinner there one night and it was superb 
494193,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, No coffee and boiler in the room, Buffet breakfast was great Drawer style mini bar convenient beside bed and enough space for other stuff Room style and decor sleek and modern 
494194,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Very cold in the room Not possible to turn off the AC Very arrogant and unfriendly young waiter serving breakfast , Nice room nice variety at breakfast 
494195,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Breakfast had a large variety of options but I d rather have less options and better quality , Really comfy bed huge bathroom excellent shower setup
494196,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing to criticize , The Hotel has very friendly and helpful Staff and is sited in a good location close to the city center The breakfast is nice rich and tasty The rooms are not very big but comfortable and clean With my Genius discount it provides an excellent value for the money with the regular price it is still ok I really enjoyed my stay and will come back 
494197,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The locations is ok but it s a little to far from the city centre and more important even further away from the Resturang and bar districts , Nice Hotel average breakfast parking service 
494198,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I would have appreciated a fitness area to work out the kinks from a long journey , A boutique hotel in a predominantly residential area of the city Within walking distance to the heart of the city and a short cab ride to all the train stations yes you need to know which station you are arriving or departing from 
494199,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Well first of all when we got there nobody met us to help with all of our luggage and there were stairs immediately in front of the entrance They had a lift for the luggage that we couldn t figure out how to work but even though the staff saw us struggling they offered no help My husband carried the 3 very large bags up the stairs and again nobody went out there to help him Once we got to the front desk they did the bare minimum to help us check in No map no suggestions and again no help with our luggage to the room The staff which were about 3 of them just stared at us like we were some oddity Very unwelcoming The hotel was not convenient to any of the tourist attractions so definitely not centrally located as described The breakfast was ok The biggest beef we had was that the service was terrible which is a recurring theme of our stay It was virtually impossible to get a waiter to bring us something to drink other than the terrible pre made coffee they were serving We had been traveling for a couple of weeks in Europe and without exception all the other hotels served fresh coffee individually at the table Americano Cappuccino Espresso The next morning we were woken up to maintenance work being done right outside our door They had the entire ceiling panel dismantled and in addition to the noise it was very hard to navigate around all the equipment to get to the elevator Then we found out our AC was being regulated and our room was set for 28 celsius which is in the 80 s We called for assistance and he came and gave us 30 minutes at a lower temperature We later went to front desk and John told us that it should be at 21 celsius so that there definitely was a problem and when we got back to the room later it was fixed with no further issues John and the handyman was the only helpful staffer we dealt with Lastly and maybe the worst when we got home late one night we were locked out of our room , The room was comfortable except they regulated our AC and we had to get that fixed The only staff member that was extremely helpful was the morning guy named John 
494200,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I was so sure my charger was left in the room if the reception girl could help me to check further apart from just making a quick call to lost and found clean lady when I was on site it would save me so much trouble on getting it back , it s a very modern hotel with all the facilities you need Even slippers which are not usually seen in European hotels location is good 1km to Duomo de Milano and several stops to the train station Room is clean and big bathroom is great supermarket is within walking distance and staffs from the bar downstairs are very kind Luca from the hotel is really helpful i found out that i left my Bose charger which is not easy to find a substitute in the room after I checked out I tried to get it back when I was back to the hotel to pick up the luggage in the afternoon I was leaving for Roma and it was my last chance to get it back however the reception girl checked with clean lady and insisted they didn t find anything I had to leave with doubts though I m pretty sure it s plugged in the socket on the wall Then next morning Luca from the hotel texted me saying that they found it and she will help to keep it till my friend goes to Milan next month thanks for your help Luca Really appreciated 
494201,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent breakfast the best in the whole Italy Very comfortable bed and pillows as well Modern place and kind staff they helped me with online check in for the return tickets from Malpensa In one word Fabulous 
494202,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I didn t like that hotel charged 30 euro for small dog We were charged for private hotel parking but car was left in front of the hotel street parking , Location of the hotel is very good It is clean and staff at the breakfast was especially friendly and nice If I would have a hotel I would hire all of them 
494203,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, There was nothing that I didn t like , The room and bathroom were spacious and very clean It was quiet The breakfast was great The staff were very helpful and professional I would definitely stay here again 
494204,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The hotel is on a busy road and rooms at the front suffer traffic noise , Well located near public transport stops and a 20 minute walk to the historic centre 
494205,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, We booked very spontaneously and found the nightly rate fair we used the hotel s valet parking since parking spots in the area are difficult to find The room was surprisingly spacious and very clean Personnel was friendly 
494206,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The restaurant is great and the breakfast was amazing Thank you to to lovely staff with all your assistance with the train timetable and guidance , The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is beautiful very clean and centrally located to the cbd and the tram which gets you to Milan central I was upgraded to a luxury room which was very nice 
494207,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The bed could be softer , Interesting foam memory pillows Was weird at first but they grew on me Good breakfast clean place and smiling staff Free water bottles in the fridge nice 
494208,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The windows in our room on the 7th were locked so we had to resort to AC only for temperature control , Best value for money in Milan Great location amazing facilities and delicious breakfast Highly recommended
494209,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Drinks at the bar were 15 each Not worth it Bathroom fixtures not user friendly , Delicious Breakfast was very good Staff was very nice and obliging 
494210,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The windows are not sound proof and the hotel is on a busy street so you hear too much noise from the cars , Clean big rooms nice bathrooms big comfortable bad very good location close to the city center Good wifi 
494211,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I didn t take breakfast but in my opinion 22 EUR for the hotel breakfast is a bit expensive , Location is very good Not far of from the central sights The rooms are fresh and the staff is very professional 
494212,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, No coffee machine poor fitness centte no iron for cloths but only 1 steamer for the whole hotel roof of the room has humidity stains AC is very week no water in the room except charged water, Room size clean bathroom
494213,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, The room was beautiful clean modern The bathroom was huge very large shower looked brand new The bed was comfortable and very nice bedding It was just a few miles from the airport and a few miles from the Milan Cathedral area The breakfast had a large variety of items including quiche pastries fruit eggs cereal and the service was excellent Parking was 25 euro extra they drove the car somewhere not sure where and brought it back when requested 
494214,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, No tea and coffee making facilities The breakfast room was a little crowded The toilet door was right next to the bed, The bed was comfortable the bathroom was amazing but I found the room to be a little too warm 
494215,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Our stay at the Bianca Maria Palace Hotel was wonderful Your front desk staff helped us with many things including restaurant and spa recommendations and directions to various sites Our room was spotless The location was perfect for us We were able to walk to local sites without being in a crowded area 
494216,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Could do with better pillows too flat and hard i didn t get a good sleep because of the uncomfy pillows More english tv channels could 0nly find 1 which was the news channel its nice to have the tv on whilst getting ready to go out , Choice of breakfast location and friendly staff lovely rooms with a spendid bathroom 
494217,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is barely 15 20 minutes bus ride BUS 73 from the terminal s door at Linate Airport the tickets are just 1 50 euro single from a machine at the stop on the way back get them from a news stand So no costly taxis necessary The receptionist was a beaming young lady very helpful with storing our luggage before the room was ready helpful with directions to near distant attractions She took the trouble to find out opening hours location of 3 local markets and gave us directions to Navigli a canal district packed with eateries She also remembered we asked for a room with windows opening for the night facing a side street And while there proved to be no kettle in the room as per usual in Italian hotels the kitchen served us tea at no added cost So staff were great The room itself bathroom were very clean with fantastic working shower loads of room to put the luggage In any case we came to La Scala to walk watch shop ourselves dizzy not to sit in the room But the bed was heavenly after the long day out the breakfast offered a wide choice including a fine selection of local dolci We are usually rather critical of hotels we stay at often move rooms sometimes more than once but there was no need for that at Bianca Maria Thank you we felt pampered 
494218,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The breakfast should be a bit more different at least some bits since it is basically exactly the same every morning , The hotel is nice would expect some more for the value we paid but in the end it was a nice stay
494219,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Left forgotten private stuff in a room were not found by the stuff even if I called them immediately when I landed I also asked them to contact me and they did not It ruined my opinion about this hotel gym is very very small and poor The distance to the city is 10 mins walk only 2 lifts, breakfast tasty few choices Bed was comfortable room was modern and quiet Bathroom big and will all amenities u need everyday Cleaning was ok 
494220,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The rooms aren t well heated There s always a cool breeze coming from the vents and wasn t able to adjust the room temperature , Very clean Renovated rooms and bathrooms Excellent location Breakfast is very good too 
494221,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, A bit far away from the center about 15 to 20 minutes walk to the Duomo 145 per night is far too expensive regarding the room size comfort and location We could hear doors slamming and people talking outside and playing the piano in the lobby during the evening , Very nice breakfast overall interior design quite pleasant modern and spotless room Tramway lines and public bike rental within 3 minutes walk Bus 73 from Linate airport stopping nearby 
494222,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, It is not a disadvantage but I ll put it in this section Even considering that the hotel is located relatively close to all the landmarks The neighborhood is a bit boring with no restaurants or supermarkets around It may be a benefit for people that prefer quiet places , As I understand this hotel is new so everything is fine The room was clean and the beds were comfortable The breakfast is worth taking there are plenty of options to choose Located in about 15 20 minutes on foot from central square and Duomo 
494223,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I liked everything but just one tip all members of the staff should learn english , The cleanliness was very impressive one of the best hotels ive been for Cleanliness Thats my 1st priority Im very happy that i choose your hotel 
494224,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Booked 2 rooms and one of them had an issue with the electrical system but they were trying to fix it instead of issuing another room immediately That took like 10 15 minutes before we insist to get another room The breakfast was way below average and didn t like it at all , Staff are decent rooms are spacious 
494225,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Perhaps softer music in the breakfast room , We had a very enjoyable stay Excellent spacious room with a large comfortable bed The bathroom was spacious and relaxing thanks to the coloured lights The shower was very good Breakfast was excellent 
494226,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I have nothing negative to recall, Everything was fine as to the hotel of this rate Good breakfast not delicious but quite enough Helpful staff location is not in the very centre but it is just 10 15 min to the Duomo by walking I drived by car they handled with it by themselves so it was comfortable Room is clean with coffee and tea device 
494227,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Tables in single rooms might have been one step bigger , A good place to spend a few days in Milano even if for business when many details of comfort are overlooked But even then some features become pins the location is good the building well visible espresso first class mineral water free of charge the services are unobtrusive but relevant An easy place to temporary live and work 
494228,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing the location was not the greatest but for the difference in price for being closer to center it was worth it for me , The hotel was a good value for the location Not in the middle of everything but if you are willing to walk 25 minutes or so to the main sights and attractions it is worth it I was there on a Sunday so many stores and restaurants were closed but when I walked around there seemed to be a number of options for other days of the week My room was on the small side but it was comfortable and quiet The breakfast was good especially when compared to the usual Italian breakfast plenty of savory and sweet options both hot and cold The internet connection was also good The tram line that goes to the central station is located very close to the hotel so it would be an easy ride there and back 
494229,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Overall the experience was great but there was some discomfort of waking up from traffic noise at night Next time I d ask for a room on a higher floor , The room was very clean modern and comfortable I also loved the high ceilings the space Bathroom was impeccable definitely extra points for the shower Excellent option for business trips 
494230,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Slightly on the pricy side Nothing praticularly special about the property , Nice clean hotel Big beds Sound proof Free water in the room Good location Nice shower 
494231,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent stay as always Stayed here a few times ever since its opening excellent location clean and comfortable rooms good breakfast Recommended place to stay in Milan 
494232,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Absolutely nothing , The staff and I mean EVERYONE I came across during my stay were polite and helpful I didn t have to ask for anything exceptional service I have never stayed at a hotel where there was at list something negative to say this hotel ticks all the boxes It s perfect 
494233,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, There is not to park legally nowhere so the guys in reception recommended to drive the car in hotel s garage with cost 25 euro per day So much overcharged , The room was small but very clean The staff was very helpfully The breakfast didn t have a lot of variety but everything was tasty 
494234,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I would have expected to have something else in the minibar than the complimentary water Also we had the unpleasant surprise to have only cheap single use plastic glasses Indeed when we asked at the reception they brought but , At 20 mins walk from the city center in a very nice area Staff very friendly and really helpful room very clean and cosy Free WiFi good breakfast OK Complimentary still water

494237,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Definitely not value for money For a 4 star this barely passes for a 3 star Nothing in the room except basics i e bed phone tv and water bottles that s all Won t be staying here again , Not much Very mediocre
494238,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing, The staff were wonderful we had excellent service throughout our stay which was only one night a pity From reception to porters and restaurant staff we had top notch assistance The room was spotless nice size bathroom free water in the minibar and the beds were firm but comfortable Full set of toiletries provided It s beautifully designed the decor is modern and classy Tram stops 300m away will take you directly to the centre Breakfast was delicious I would definitely stay there again 
494239,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Hotel restaurant was a little pricey for Dinner but that s typically to be expected , Great rate per night 88 Large clean modern rooms Good breakfast with lots of choice 
494240,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Bed just a bit firm for me but others would love it I m sure , Friendly and helpful staff Great view of a pretty street with tram running into city Beautifully comfortable room and top bathroom Complimentary water in fridge and excellent toiletries very much appreciated 
494241,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing to complain about , To be honest everything Location cleanliness location friendly staff Didn t have breakfast as i left early So cant comment on it 
494242,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Being picky walls in second room bit dirty Could hear traffic sometimes , This 4 hotel keeps its promise for the level We booked two twin rooms Helpful staff room very clean comfy beds spotless bathroom parking available on reservation valet parking We will definitely go back Complementary water bottles in the room Nice stay 
494243,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Too much cake at breakfast Bed very hard Lack of channels in english english subtitles No work station with computer , Tasty mushrooms at breakfast Awesome and spacious bathroom with decent lighting Very good cleaning Bathrobe and slippers included Good toiletries Helpful staff Good wifi Central location

494247,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Some of the rooms needs to be repainted I have stayed in two different rooms which both had patchs from spackling paste on the walls The breakfast can be a bit chaotic It would be nice to be able to open the windows to get in some fresh air , Even though the hotel is located at a busy street the rooms are fairly quiet 
494248,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing, Price quality ratio we artived before noon and they let us check in early there were 4 bottles of water in the room and they were complimentary 
494249,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The hotel was difficult to find with our Navigation system but once there it was great The overnight parking was 25 Euros a night which was a bit expensive since we had paid at most 20 in other places and even as low as 5 , Loved the breakfast it included Mimosas It was the typical Italian breakfast The hotel was beautiful and very modern The bed was the most comfortable of our 12 days trip The bathroom was large and the shower amazing The reception provided great service with good advice on where to eat and how to get around not the tram

494252,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Single rooms a bit small , Martina was excellent at checkin and helping resolve issues very positive Michael at reception tops in service and client support he exceeded all expectations 
494253,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The lack of bathtube which I requested and the noise from the boulevard Also the rooftop terrace was not accessable for a drink the bar is within the breakfast area so no view , Great breakfast with quality products Location right next to tram and bus stations tram 9 takes you there for 25 mins from the stop of the Malpensa shuttles and 20 mins walk to Duomo but far from metro stations Very helpful staff free wi fi sky sports channels and 4 bottles of water a day 
494254,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Unfortunately not close to any underground station But it has a decent tram connection to the city center , Very kind and helpful staff Well designed and comfortable room Good breakfast variety 
494255,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, There was a cold breeze in the room that was coming from the ventilation system The room temperature was a bit cold Would have been good to have option for hot air or heating , Very clean comfortable and beautiful interior design Delicious breakfast Central location

494259,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Lifts small and very slow hotel is quite a walk to Metro 14 mins and Duomo is 25 mins walk but through vibrant attractive streets with wonderful architecture buildings and shops to see so worth walking A shame there were no baths in our rooms but being very picky, A delightful hotel stylish and quiet Staff are all excellent and nothing was too much trouble Always ready and willing to help with a smile and reliable knowledge for visits transport and restaurants You can purchase day Metro passes at reception Rooms are newly refurbished to a high standard with comfortable good quality beds linen and pillows Superb cleanliness throughout Breakfast is of a very good quality buffet service although there are plenty of friendly staff ready to provide attentive service After 12 hours a day sightseeing it was a total joy to return to our comfortable rooms with a pit stop visit to the bar for a swift reviving drink served by fantastic bar staff

494321,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Even though the hotel was looking nicely designed nothing was properly working it was all design but not useful The restaurant below is super pricey and like the hotel design the food was also nicely decorated but super small , Location was good 
494322,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The first shower leaked the second shower had hair in it and the third shower was an upgrade which we had to pay 30 extra a night for We didn t want to waste our time looking for another hotel so we agreed to the upgrade The receptionist seemed intent on the fact that she had done us a big favour by giving us this room perhaps she forgot that she was charging us for a room that we would not normally have booked if the standard room had been clean enough We asked at check in about the gym and they said it was downstairs We found out later that it was being renovated and the equipment was in pieces so it could not be used We booked the hotel for the gym for health reasons and would not have stayed if we d known This information should be on the website The air con makes noise all night clicking on and off every 40 seconds or so It can t be switched off we asked at reception and were told that it s the same in every room The place is rather strange no sense of luxury despite the high prices 159 a night plus 30 for the upgrade plus 30 for parking The so called junior suite had an exercise bike next to the bed which seemed really odd and the pale colours make the room feel dated although the bathroom is nice and modern Breakfast is quite basic with terrible so called American coffee Seating outside is limited and cramped and the wicker sofa chairs outside are extremely uncomfortable There is an outside restaurant area but you are not allowed to sit there for breakfast which makes no sense as people usually prefer to sit at a table while eating We checked out early after 2 nights The whole package failed to fulfill our expectations , Staff were always friendly 
494323,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The room was on the first floor without any view and the air conditioner did not work Looked more like a 3 star hotel instead of 4 , The hotel is close to Duomo 15 min walk

494330,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, They pre authorized my credit card almost 20 days ago and until today they didn t release it I have contacted them several times and didn t get anywhere Never put a valid credit card you ll be in big trouble chasing them for your money later on unprofessional accountant , Lovely location and nice breakfast clean and beautiful rooms
494331,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, It is fairly far away from the center of town If you stay here learn how to use the light rail The nearest Metro stop is 20 minutes away and it s not a straight shot , The accommodations were impressive clean cool room with a great bathroom as well 
494332,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, It was a tiny bit out of the way so options for dinner nearby were limited , The bartender waiter in the lounge when I ate dinner there was extremely nice and very helpful Breakfast was good and the room was spacious updated and very clean 
494333,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Mattress was very uncomfortable we were able to listen even to the smallest noise coming from the other rooms a cross the hall room doesn t have any insulation at all No help with luggage you carry it yourself which is not a biggie if the hotel didn t have 4 stars No coffee in the room either again very weird for a 4 stars, Great cappuccino good location valet parking nice helpful staff
494334,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The weather was too hot at end June to do much city touring or lining up for tours of the Duomo etc Not the hotels fault of course but I wouldn t try to wander around Milan again in mid summer , I changed my booking a number of times as my grown up children decided to join us The staff were very helpful and adaptable In particular Michael was very good at making recommendations for restaurants in Brera and walks along the canals He was also happy to recommend different streets for shopping and the best connections on the different trams Free bottled water in the rooms was also a nice touch 
494335,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Room was a bit small but enough for a 2 night stay Could use some fresh paint and touch ups , Staff were fantastic especially Michael Breakfast was really good Fast WiFi Room clean soft bed blackout curtains mini fridge quiet Location was good for tourism as it was close enough to walk to duomo 15 min or even the fortress 30 min had great trolley and bus access 2 blocks and lots of good non touristic restaurants nearby try Omega 3 for seafood 
494336,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The only point I would like to see addressed is the extremely expensive hotel bar and the lack of a visible drinks pricing I suppose I could have and should have asked for the menu which would probably saved me the surprise at the till but if there was any pricing at sight I wouldn t have paid 24 euros for two drinks , The room was extremely comfortable with plenty of light large bathroom and a very welcome air conditioning on a very hot weekend 
494337,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Breakfast buffet wasn t very rich , Staff at the front desk are very friendly and they go above and beyond to make sure you are happy with your stay

494341,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I didn t like the lighting the hotel has neons in the corridors it felt like being in an hospital The decor is dated and the hotel could use a face lift especially in the entrance hall , The room I was given was clean and quiet It was ok as it was just a one night stay Location is also good very convenient if you are going to the city center 
494342,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, NO facilities to make a drink No tea coffee etc Unusual for a hotel not to have these Breakfast has lots of good to choose from Breakfast staff wasn t impressed with Very noisy city we heard sirens every few minutes No where to sit with a few and have a drink and just relax after a day of walking They have a small area down by the bat outside but only walls as views , Hotel room was ok Couldn t fault cleaners Bar Manager Adam was great made our first night fab 
494343,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, There are really no negative aspects to consider , Good location within a walking distance of the city center and just around a 15min walk from the University Very good breakfast with a lot of options a comfortable bed good sound isolation Wifi available in every part of the hotel with good speed Water available at the room free of charge We arrived during a period of a lot of movement at the hotel with a lot of people checking in and out and our room was not quite ready However the staff at the reception was super nice apologized for the inconvenience and offered us Welcome Drinks at the bar Due to the anti terrorism measures all around Europe we were asked to sign a consent stating that we accept that our personal data may be checked for security reasons The thing is that we were only told the purpose of the consent after we sign it Please next time do it the other way around explain the purpose then ask to sign it Everyone will sign it either way It is just a suggestion and not a critique

494348,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Breakfast service seemed overstaffed but nevertheless slightly inefficient you had to pursue the cappuccino rather than being asked what you would like for your breakfast The American coffee on offer was terrible , Staff friendly and helpful 
494349,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Brand new and modern decor Quite a change from what Milan used to offer Nice staff Chose it for the location east side of Milan so gave me 15 extra minutes sleep before an early flight out of Linate yet central enough to walk everywhere 
494350,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing about the hotel But instructions regarding our reserved car parking would have been useful , A very stylish hotel Breakfast was really good Valet parking Great staff Highly recommended

494354,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing It was a lovely stay , Great staff in every part of the hotel From reception to housekeeping to the restaurant staff Everyone was polite and very helpful 
494355,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, We have been somewhat disappointed by the dinner served at the hotel s restaurant The size and the quality of the dishes hardly justify their prices , The hotel offers high quality clean well equipped and tastefully decorated accommodation We have liked the wide produce selection offered at the buffet breakfast The location is convenient for travelers planning to visit briefly Milano s historical center 
494356,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The air conditioning was not working properly The breakfast was a little monotonous for a a longer then 3 or 4 day stay although more than sufficient , In general everything was really good the staff in particular It was really nice to have water on the house each day I suppose this was to compensate for the lack of hot drink making facilities Would definitely stay there again 
494357,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Lift didn t always work properly , Rooms modern and clean Breakfast excellent for room rate Cocktails from bar great sitting out in garden Overall a great stay for the price 
494358,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, I was disappointed to find out that you could not use the outside terrace unless you were part of a function That wasn t clear when booking , Room was great with plenty of room Bed was big and comfy Reception staff were most helpful Great location with a short walk into centre Tram stop 2 min walk 
494359,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, It was too bad that the rooftop terrace was closed during our stay , The hotel was beautiful the location was great the room was clean with a really comfy bed the staff friendly and the breakfast really yummy 
494360,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Only issue we had was the inability to get the room temperature down to a cool comfortable temperature The result was uncomfortable stuffiness that was best alleviated by opening the door to the hallway in order to get some needed ventilation , Front desk staff were extraordinarily professional courteous and helpful Room was smallish but quite comfortable Breakfast first rate Quiet location and convenient to all key sites in the city We will return 
494361,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Wouldn t change anything We really enjoyed our stay , The staff were very friendly polite and helpful Could not fault them Lovely hotel Would stay again if ever in Milan Would recommend to friends family Nice and clean Rooms were lovely Especially liked the shower 
494362,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Very cold in the hotel Airconditioning in the room hard to shut down , Excellent value for money Quiet location Large clean rooms Excellent breakfast 
494363,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Amazing staff and hotel close to city center What I consider a great and valuable idea is the mineral water in the room minibar There are as well other hotels which offer a free bottle of water but in this hotel you have enough bottles a refilled fridge everyday in order to drink and take away with you during your journey in Milan A small innovation that goes to great things Hotel is looking nice outside and inside cosy rooms amazing personnel especially the lady receptionist that resembles Selma Hayek Breakfast buffet is very good having enough variety for everyone served inside or outside on the terrace There is also available a bar on the rooftop 
494364,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The location is ok but not so close to the Duomo Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and other attractions Also at night the neighborhood did not seem that safe Went out to eat with the family and a couple approached asking for money We kept walking and they threw a can of soda at us which fortunately missed the target Yes it can happen in many places but we didn t see any policemen in the area , The hotel has modern facilities including bathrooms which are hard to find in Europe Nice staff good breakfast 
494365,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Our airconditioning was nt working so w ll spend both eventing and night in a temperature of 27 4 degrees celcius in the morning it still was 26 3 the reception could nt help us in the morning when we woke up we were nt fit to do the things w ll wanted to do , The room was nt that bad at all A very good breakfast and a good bed and shower 
494366,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Restaurant menu was over priced and limited Room air conditioning could not be adjusted to cool room down to a comfortable level had to leave curtains closed and miss out on the view , Location Staff service attitude ability Room and breakfast facilities 
494367,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Nothing in the hotel But pay attention to your belongings when visiting Milano I got my smartphone stolen by a pick pocket , Staff is very helpfull and kind I got good advice for shopping and sightseeing Swift check in my room was ready when I arrived at 2pm Nice quiet room with a comfy matrasse large safe and free non alcoolic drinks in the bar Good shower and amenities in the bathroom Great choice for breakfast excellent coffee Good location it takes 15 min to get to the duomo by feet Several trams nearby 9 for central station takes 20 minutes Stayed 3 nights in a single room April 2016 
494368,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, That you couldn t open the windows No alcohol or coffee mashine in the room , I really enjoyed my stay for two days As I was working from the room I apprichiated the office desk in the room and the room service The room was luxory and nice too bad you can open the windows and that there was no real mini bar and only water The location was great and central The hotel was nicer in real life comparing to the pictures at bookings I also loved the bathroom and great shower 
494369,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Customer service especially the dining room Bar manager who gave us valuable site seeing information which resulted in us extending our stay with an extra night Location to attractions 
494370,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The air conditioning was not working properly so we had to request to have the Windows unlocked to cool down the room at 26 C and it s only late April We could also use a comfortable chair to sit on rather than just sitting in bed , The entire staff was excellent very friendly and quick to respond to our request We love the bathroom and the amazing rain shower best in Italy so far The overall d cor was quite nice with quirky material and color schemes Location was convenient 25 min walk to Duomo We had the corner room with 3 large windows which was nice but the layout seems very inefficient so it didn t feel as spacious The mini bar was excellent 
494371,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The size of the triple room is a little small for three people The rooms are really only comfortable for two and a smaller child , The staff were really amazing Best I ve had at hotels from all over the world compared even to five star hotels Friendly sincere and doing their jobs to be utmost 
494372,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The shower could only be set to either hot or boiling hot The breakfast buffet on Saturday morning was almost empty one hour before closing and staff were overwhelmed to keep the tables ready for the next guests , The location was good There was a station for several trams and buses nearby There were two lifts so there were no long waits to go up or down The rooms were tidy and clean and the staff was very friendly 
494373,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Breakfast choice is not that great and the menu was same through out the week , Location is excellent easy to walk to downtown in few minutes Micheal at the front desk was very helpful courteous Enjoyed my stay at the hotel will definitely stay here again 
494374,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, breakfast was busy but you can eat on the terrace outside untill 10 30 on the weekend, amazing room I booked a single and got a double clean and silent room
494375,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, no proper glass or tea cup in the room only plastic cups Asked room service but could not get proper tea cups, very friendly staff easy to get to by tram from Railway station and onwards to downtown area with the Milano ticket
494376,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The only downside was that breakfast could get very busy near the end of service when some items ran low but the staff were always helpful and polite despite being run off their feet by demanding guests It was also rather expensive but then again everything in Milan is expensive and after our stay we felt the cost was worth the top class experience this hotel provides , The bed was very comfortable amazing room with a massive shower the view from the room was really nice and also the room had its own fridge which was refilled daily with bottles of still and sparkling water The staff were always very polite and helpful with any questions we had and we were given some excellent restaurant recommendations We stayed to celebrate our 10 year anniversary which we noted in our booking comments the hotel recognised this and gave us a gift to celebrate it 
494377,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The bed was a bid hard but that s just personal preference really doughnuts at breakfast definitely compensates, The breakfast was brilliant so much better than expected and staff very cheerful
494378,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, Staff is very helpful and friendly Great breakfast which we enjoyed outside on the terrace Location is good city centre within walking distance Nice bars and restaurants nearby 
494379,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, We would have liked real glasses in the bedroom not plastic The shower doors did not close properly Lack of shelves or drawers in the bedroom was a problem , We liked the location Bar staff were always cheerful and professional and gave very helpful advice on using the trams and getting around 
494380,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, the fact that i was charged for 2 people my friend cancelled at the very last minute the manager overlooked the fact that i was still occupying the room and this for 5 days , everything was lovely
494381,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The room was too hot with no opportunity to drop the temperature or open windows The restaurant had a very limited menu and there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms which was a shame , Good location Friendly staff who were very willing to help Special mention to Alice and a thank you to the check in staff who let us have a late check out on the day of the marathon Another big plus was the free and fast wifi 
494382,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, They tried to charge my card for the whole stay the day before even though we were supposed to pay at arrival We didn t get rooms next to each other even though we had requested it several time and in advance They changed towels even though they were never used Their environment policy says other Breakfast area is too small so it easily gets crowded We had to ask for refill in the mini bar , The breakfast was very good good selection Really nice rooms and bathrooms The pillows Nice gym Water in the mini bar is included Staff is nice and helpful Tram stop is just one block away About 10 min walking to Doumo 
494383,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The breakfast could be richer for a 4 stars hotel and a coffee kit in the room could be helpful , Nice clean hotel located a few Tram stops from the Duomo or about 20 minutes walk Very helpful staff especially MICHEAL and MARTINA Good WiFi connection Recommended hotel in Milan center 
494384,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel,No Negative, I have only positive experience with the hotel and its personnel I like that it is a bit aside from the main touristic areas still close to the stores parks and just 15 min walk from Duomo and about 5 min by Taxi to the Milano Centrale station Personnel was helpful room service quick As to the breakfast in comparison with usual breakfast in other Italian hotels this one was good 
494385,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, My only small criticism would be that there were only two English channels that were based around news from China , The bed was extremely comfortable the shower was great and the room was very clean 
494386,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, Normally in some 4 hotels you find a small coffee kit in your room for a quick coffee or tea I missed that , Very new modern design hotel great fresh breakfast every morning Very clean room and bath room invites you in its so clean 
494387,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The mini bar had only water , The mini bar had water for free The stuff was great Martina and Marko at the reception was the first among equals The hotel generally was very clean

494390,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, No iron in the rooms which meant we had to require the laundry service and unfortunately they burnt my partners brand new shirt but refunded us the laundry fees Also most times it seemed the some of the hotel staff didn t know the location of many places , Decent Location was easy getting around Breakfast was ok and the room and bathroom was lovely 
494391,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, It was a bit stuffy in our room because of always closed windows Bad organized breakfast area at second day buffet was empty and hadn t been renewed compared to first day Shower door was in terrible condition , New hotel beautiful design Well located 15 min walking from Duomo Very closed to Linate airport Small but comfortable and clean room good for 2 nights stay Reception staff was friendly and helpful Breakfast at first day was rich and delicious diverse warm dishes cheese fruits etc

494410,Bianca Maria Palace Hotel, The room was in a separate small area that at the beginning was locked with a door So I had to go downstairs again and ask for the key In the end the Key was on top of the room key Only 1 towel in the whole room TV was not already prepared so no channels available Wireless password was needed but not communicated upfront by the reception , The structure is fully new so it is absolutely fresh clean and modern Light hall and nice bar in the basement Room was small but ok Wireless very fast In a 15 minute walking you are in downtown
