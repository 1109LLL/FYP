89870,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, Nothing , Beautifully stylish modernised hotel perfect service from everyone from the friendly personal greeting every time we passed the reception to the breakfast and cleaning staff Fantastic location most major attractions are within walking distance or a very short taxi ride if not a walker We would highly recommend this hotel for as romantic break 
89871,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, the fact that the bathroom could not be ventilated and did not really give privacy for using the toilet , the room was very nice although it was very small and not much room to park a two suitcases the staff very helpful and nice very attentive
89872,Hotel Design Secret de Paris,No Negative, The staff Mc Wilman and camilla were absolutely fantastic Nothing was to much trouble I will definitely come back just because of the staff Rooms nicely decorated food nice 5 
89873,Hotel Design Secret de Paris,No Negative, the team where very friendly we arrived early after a night flight and they allow us to do early checkup free of charge and even gave us coffee while we waited The room is very nice and the location is excellent 
89874,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, The Gym facility is limited but that might not be very important for everyone, Well one of the best hotel staff I have experienced given my yearly 100 days I spent in hotels worldwide Simply extremely friendly and thoughtful staff offering you help with charming face in all aspects at all corners of the hotel 
89875,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, I am gluten intolerant and felt that the selection of breakfast wasn t that great it was typical French which is amazing but not when you cant eat bread or sugary cereals , location and the comfort of the hotel Sauna and gym facilities Great and helpful staff also
89876,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, I guess the wall is too thin and the room layout isnt nice meaning we have many dead spaces even I knew its small Im not specialist of hotel ratings but it isnt the one which has 4 stars Additionally its corridor is too small and narrow which means no one couldnt reach their room without bumping somewhere , The staff were nice but I feel its a little bit superficial like we aksed them about the noise at first night and they changed our room for improving the situation I guess but it wasnt changed Music and other noise was still there even they told us its quieter 
89877,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, I could not think of anything negative about this hotel , The staff Very warm friendly and helpful The location is good and near to many attractions Metro station near And good places to eat and drink Also had a few days on own and never felt uncomfortable 
89878,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, although brilliant the rooms are on the small side and the bathroom leaves little to the imagination However still not enough to put me off this gem of a hotel , The staff particularly Wilhelm were fantastic Nothing was too much trouble I would definitely stay here again 
89879,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, 2 things that could be better breakfast could be cheaper 18 per person is a lot and you ll need to fill up to get your monies worth You hear the hot pipes making a noise throughout the hotel when someone runs a bath and thats alot when their baths are also Jacuzzis It will wake you up when someone runs it at 01 30 in the morning , The themes of the rooms are fantastic staff are very helpful 
89880,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, The breakfast was nice but not nearly worth 18 euro It was nice but better to have half that price Also should have had coffee tea and kettle in the room Finally we were in room 55 and the water pipes woke me early each day made the hangovers harder to overcome when I woke at 7am each day , The staff were amazing Without a doubt they were the friendliest happiest and most helpful in any hotel They were fun and funny too Not stiff and formal but relaxed and seemed to really think about what we might need Offered a bottle of water to take out with us on a hot day is a great touch 
89881,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, This part of the city wasn t great it was a bit dirty and the surrounding buildings seemed a bit run down compared to other districts However we always felt safe as the police station for the district was literally across the street , The staff was great the free juice and water was good the AC was a great find for Paris It s a small hotel so it felt that everyone on the staff got to know you better so that they could make better recommendations I think we met almost everyone that worked at the front desks over the course of four nights 
89882,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, As would be expected in Paris the room was quite small , My partner and I celebrated her birthday with a romantic weekend in Paris We loved the quirky eclectic decor the helpful staff who found a lost passport the honesty bar the delicious breakfast and the location which was within walking distance of Montmartre 
89883,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, Music playing in the hall was loud enough to bother me when trying to get to sleep Room was a little small for the price , Staff were really nice and the room was comfortable Nice toiletries and good array of equipment in the room I ll stay here again 
89884,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, A little more interesting equipment in the gym a recumbent bike perhaps for those of us with back problems and perhaps a bench with some free weights Otherwise really great , Staff were delightful SO helpful and great senses of humor I felt at home and cared for from the moment I walked in the door Also loved the breakfast buffet which was of good quality and plenty to eat reasonably priced 
89885,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, I had a perfect stay Nothing to complain about , The staff were amazing The rooms are modern and roomie for a European hotel The breakfast is great and it s very close to lots of restaurants and sights 
89886,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, The location is not ideal not near to any places of interest in particular Very hard to locate and lighting is too dim in the lobby , The staff tried to know us personally and offered us drinks after our check out 
89887,Hotel Design Secret de Paris,No Negative, We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights It was amazing Value for money definitely worth it The rooms are incredible clean very and comfortable The design of the rooms is perfect The location is very convenient as the nearest metro station is a 5 minute walk The staff is super helpful and friendly We will definitely return to this hotel with the first opportunity we will get Thank you

89892,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, The bathroom was separated from the bedroom by only a glass partition door which does nothing to keep the smells in The shower bath was a bit high my partner needed help to clamber in and out , The reception staff where extremely friendly and helpful the beds comfortable and the breakfast excellent 
89893,Hotel Design Secret de Paris,No Negative, The d cor of our Musee D Orsay room was sumptuous the bed extremely comfortable and the service outstanding From the welcome drink downstairs whilst our bags were put in our room through the staff recommending and booking an excellent local restaurant for dinner to our takeaway coffee for our taxi ride when departing I could not fault them Highly recommended

89895,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, A bit pricy but it was worth every cent spent , We stayed at Opera room and everything was excellent The photos here on booking com really don t do any justice to how lovely the room was in reality We loved the spa bath a lot and the breakfast was fantastic ordered it in a room and enjoyed every bit of it Highly recommended

89901,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, The only thing we didn t like is the fact that we had to say goodbye to a beautiful hotel in a perfect location with amazing staff and come home back to reality , The staff went the extra mile for you all day every day When leaving to go out they would ask if we would like some water bottles to take with us and when coming back to the hotel they would ask us if we would like a hot drink and brought it to our room The one thing we really liked was we brought a bottle of champagne home and the next day they had put two wine glasses next to it which was extremely thoughtful The staff spoke very good English and helped us find the best restaurants and cheap taxi service and also a nice takeaway down the road when we wanted a quiet night in we would definitely stay there again because it is so clean but the main reason we would go back is because of the staff especially the two males who were on reception 
89902,Hotel Design Secret de Paris, You are a good 20 minute walk away from most attractions if your scared of the metro your going to have tired legs Breakfast is not worth 18 unless you can pack enough away for a large family No tea coffee facilities in the room but in all honesty for this one the staff were always happy to get you either hot or cold drinks often for no charge , Great modern hotel in a decent location yes the rooms are not the largest but it s a boutique hotel what do you expect This is Paris you shouldn t be spending forever in your room They are well laid out and have all the mod cons Staff very friendly and attentive they could not do enough to help even going as far as to make us hot drinks was 5 cold and being genuinely interested in our day upon our return They could never do enough for us with great suggestions from directions to eating out I felt like these guys and girls made a good hotel a great one Literally 200 yards from the Metro which is super cheap to get around don t be affraid it s super easy
