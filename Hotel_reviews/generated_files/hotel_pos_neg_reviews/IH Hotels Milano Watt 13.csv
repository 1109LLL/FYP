476820,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13,No Negative, I recently booked this accommodation for a group of 11 on a stag do It s about 30 euros from the airport Linate by cab and a fifteen minute walk from the nearest Metro Romolo or the canal area at Navigli which is a beautiful area for meals and drinks A train in to the city centre is around 15 minutes and under 2 euros The staff were superb in particular the female receptionist and Andrea the room division manager They couldn t have been more accommodating of us 
476821,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The location was a little too far out of the centre for us although once we were given clear instructions from the staff we mastered the trams and it was easy to get there and back , The staff were extremely helpful and caring The breakfast was really very good and very well set out with a great deal of choice 
476822,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, wifi is cutting, The hotel is suitably located to where my business meetings were arranged I think that the hotel changed mamagement because the front staff look more professional to me than in previous stayings breakfast is fine and room too 
476823,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, One day I was facing the problem with the hotel staff he is the Men regarding for the complaienary water matter When I was come back from my business office I said the water is not placing inside the refregator he said you are Lying No My cleaner is placing at refregator I was quick response to him how why lying I am the guest I was placing at the hotel a lot of the valuable thing This is the less then 1 for the water I was told him I am feedback to you only Another one When I was check out the time Nobody can help Because of only one men in front desk So that I was bring down Mg self and check out Then payment I was gave the balance amount with my cash big note He said cann t I was try to pay my another credit Taxi matter Taxi is not easy to get it Always we need to wait Some of the staff are not very well English So the we had a bit difficulty for communication Thank best regards Zin, Room layout is not bad 
476824,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Breakfast was not great quality and there was lots of cake and pastries and not enough cooked food There is a bar opposite which was quite noisy as it was the weekend Bit far from the nearest metro , The bed was big the room was decently sized and very clean and the staff were nice The hotel was pleasant and fine for the price but not really 4 level Takes about half an hour to get into the city centre by metro or tram 
476825,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The rooms and bathrooms were cold There is no direct transport to the hotel , The breakfast choiceserved was really nice evening for vegetarian The stuff was friendly 
476826,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13,No Negative, We visited Milano for the weekend a few weeks ago Rooms are nice and very clean staff very nice they are trying to help wherever they can Just a short drive to the city 
476827,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The bed was horrible it was hard as a rock The buffet did offer eggs which in my opinion was inedible but there was bacon as well which was fine not to mention all the cakes and other options , The staff was extremely friendly and the place was very clean Buffet was acceptable was a typical Italian breakfast buffet with plenty of options 
476828,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Need better maintenance A C is keeping too cold can not manage at a high level for heating only 23 degrees C , The breakfast was amazing The hotel is modern style 
476829,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The smell in the room Long time needed to get the hot water running , Accomodation perfect esp the bed was good Quality The nice bars opposite of Hotel The breakfast was extra great 
476830,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The room was absolutely not price worthy we paid crazy much The room was promised to have air condition at the booking com but it did not work during our four nights stay despite repeated requests of the problem to the hotel staff which lead to major sleeping problem because of very warm environment in the room We did not get any compensation ,No Positive
476831,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, No air condition I wasn t informed about other fees like city tax Too poor experience No stuff enough No fan in bathroom Kavien is the best stuff in the hotel That s it,No Positive
476832,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The rooms were too hot and some members of staff were not very helpful No facilities for a kettle so if one comes late into your room The shower is not great , Nothing
476833,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, should say on the adress the name of metro and tram stop to be the closest instead of famagosta wich is a bit enoying to walk from, was easy to check in or out clean room good breakfast free wifi friendly staff the area is quiet and not far from nice local food place
476834,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Eggs and shower cold on second day on stay But this wasn t a major issue as had a lovely stay overall, Staff were helpful friendly especially the lady on the bar at breakfast Lovely clean rooms Allocated rooms together as requested Great breakfast option 
476835,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, A bit far from the tube but I knew that in advance, Staff is really kind and helpful The bes was very comfortable and the room was very nice Good breakfast
476836,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, 3 bus stops away from the Romulo metro station but this wasn t realy an inconvenience for us The bus arrives every 3 5 minutes , Nice staff good breakfast clean room very comfortable bed There is a lidl supermarket nearby I recommend this hotel 
476837,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Acceptable breakfast options compared to Italian standards Wouldn t have touched the eggs though , Clean room Basic Okay for a short stay on budget Tram ride into the city cheap and not too long However will book hotel in the center next time for an extra 20 30 Euro per night
476838,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The shower really needs a curtain or a full shower cabin All the water is pouring onto the floor Also the sink faucet was leaking so badly the water was going in streams on the floor Finally the hotel is really far from the centre But on the other hand the area is quiet and nice , The breakfast was amazing The staff was nice Big supermarkets are within a 5 min walk 
476839,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, In some places the carpets could do with a bit of a clean , Really enjoyable stay at a perfect location City centre easily accessible by tram or bus and walking along the nearby canal was great to find places to eat Breakfast was great and overall the room was fine too 
476840,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Room had some bruises that I think should be fixed before letting guests in 50 in city tax came as a surprise when checking out , Good breakfast for being in Italy 
476841,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The hotel was fully booked so they gave me a room for handicaped Not very clean I found a cigarret pack in the toilet Far away from city center , Practical hotel
476842,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, the air conditioned inside room was difficult to stop because during the night restart several times and it was noisy , the breakfast was good and it was very silent the back front room the room keeper were excellent and very kind
476843,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, This is far from being a 4 hotel The carpet looked quite bad and the furniture is a 2 really bad breakfast and the internet was even worse, Is a good value for money Comfortable bed clean and nice bathroom Very nice and helpful staff Very close to Naviglia which one of the best hot spot with dozens of bars and terraces 
476844,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The carpet in our two rooms where quite filthy they definitely need to be cleaned We had to walk around in our flip flops The bathroom needs a really good clean and some re grouting also both the showers had very low pressure which was uncomfortable , The staff were very helpful and attentive We needed to move rooms due to our aircon not working and they set t up right away They also helped us with tips on what to do in Milan and where to go Great variety for breakfast but they need to get real eggs as powdered stuff is quite disgusting and definitely not what I d expect for a 4 star hotel 
476845,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Open WiFi signal weak in the rooms Lack of resturant choices nearby , Breakfast was amazing Room was very spacious Had good pizza from friendly family operated shop nearby 
476846,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Inhospitable staff and no drink making fasilities in room Security issues Room was left open all day by staff after alarm apparently went off while we were out all day Came back to the door wide open Nothing taken but a serious breach of privacy and security , Modern and clean adequate breakfast
476847,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, It was not explained neither on booking com nor by hotel staff what options exist for free parking There is some space in front of hotel that may be used for free as well but as the night receptionist said it does not belong to hotel and hotel has its own parking that costs 20 EUR per day In reality t seems that there is a lot of space in nearby non residential streets as well and there is an option to have night parking for free in the street Watt as well Breakfast offer was somewhat worse then in other Italian 4 stars hotels coffee was good No balcony nor city view we did not ask explicitly for In order to use wi fi one has to provide personal data and to watch commercials The explanation of hotel staff is that it is Vodafone s policy However in other Italian hotels we visited there is no such violation of privacy or at least it was lesser than here City tax too big but that is an issue of Milano and not the hotel , Seems to be fine option for car traveling since there is tram line 10 minutes walk away that runs directly to Duomo and to Lanza and it is possible to find parking for free just be aware that it takes quite a long time to reach the hotel from the Venice highroad Since the hotel seems to be new it is mostly comfortable and clean 
476848,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The location is not good It s barely in Navigli and very far from the station Tram not too far away buses a little unreliable , A little rundown but clean and comfortable enough 
476849,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Free parking is in front of the building and doesn t belong to the hotel so it s kind of luck to get a place there The furniture in the room was demaged everywhere bathroom was never really clean climate did start cooling the room in the middle of the night even when it was turned off uncomfortable beds , Not too far away from naviglio grande where it s quite nice to stay in the evenings Breakfast was ok Staff was friendly 
476850,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The water from shower running on the floor, We stayed 2 nights in this hotel There free parking not far from center excellent breakfast good stuff What else for this price just perfect 
476851,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Location 20mins from nearest metro so not great by foot Finishing on some areas of the room wasn t great showed a bit of wear The towels smelt like tomato sauce that had been left out on a plate over night mixed with salt and vinegar chipsticks One day the shower only ran cold water Look out for City Tax added to your bill wherever you stay in Milan it s 10 for a 4 hotel, Staff were friendly and spoke good English breakfast was a plenty and was enjoyable enough everything generally seemed clean and sharp The Octopus bar opposite was pretty cool Overall I enjoyed my stay and would go again 
476852,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, the parking is not guaranteed out side the hotel becuase of the crowded cars the hotel garage is 20 euro per night which is much expensive the breakfast is the same everyday specialy the one type of i don t know what to call it eggs or else no tea or coffee after breakfast in rooms or in the lobby , the location is good near the trum and IDIL supermarket 
476853,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, At nighttime it sometimes became a little noisy but with closing the window it worked just fine Also the air condition turned itself on all the time so we were quite chilly at night time , The breakfast had a huge variety We were a little concerned with the hotel in advance because we read the reviews but then were surprised when we arrived The rooms are not very large but clean and not tiny either The location was convenient a bus stop to the next metro station pretty much in front of the hotel We usually walked back from the Duomo or canal to the hotel and it wasn t a big deal We d definitely stay there again 
476854,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The booking com website is a farce and made it too complicated to realise that we had booked a twin room which one would expect is for two people for only one person Hence we had a massive bill to change this when at the hotel ,No Positive
476855,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, We got a room under the central heating vacuuming ventilation something which made so much noise that you can t sleep in that room after complaining we got a different room I just can t understand they can rent this room out ever , Comfortable bed Breakfast was fine Tram number 2 is less than 5 minutes away and it will take you to the centrum of Milan in 10 to 15 minutes
476856,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, I made a reservation on booking com indicating that 1 adult and 2 kids will be checking in To my surprise I was told by the hotel receptionist that I registered only 1 person and had to pay 35 euros for other people That was in addition to 95 euros that I paid for the hotel We arrived to the hotel at 12 am The receptionist did not explain how to turn on the light It was pitch dark in the room and turning light switch on did not do anything Eventually I felt the slot for the hotel card and intuitively inserted it in Voila The lights turned on The bathroom had towels for 1 person only the bed was a big kings bed where my kids and I fitted fine I was also mislead about location of the hotel The hotel room lacked any charm This ended up the most expensive and the most un inviting place I stayed in Italy , Breakfast
476857,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13,No Negative, Good location especially if you travel by car Close to the bars in Navigli district and the tram line to the city centre Hotel is nice and modern breakfast buffet is very good Good value for money 
476858,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, My room was very nice inside and it was clean the bathroom was ok The parking spots next to the entrance are old and the pavement is falling apart the lobby is old and septic If you pay 100 110 per night you can find way better 4 stars hotels in town, The hotel overall looks nice and it would be a perfect location for a good quality cheap price type of offer let s say average 70 80 a night Anything above that is overpriced
476859,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Small shower , Breakfast is OK beds are very good shower is way too small but I am a tall bloke Staff were top draw everyone we met was friendly polite and helpful first class 
476860,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, It s not the first time I booked at this hotel but it will be probably the last When I arrived late at night a scruffy receptionist couldn t find my booking I got a voucher with a booking number The shower was not working and I had been promised a change of room for the following day that did not happen The very following morning I talked to the receptionist that was polite but clearly not trained Eventually they had me showering in another room while a clueless handyman was trying to repair the shower No aircon I had been told that the mayor of Milan forbids conditioning in May When I tried to drive away the gate got blocked and again this poor handyman tried his best On top of everything apparently in all the hotel there is not a working pressing iron to be given to the guests I used to love this place but it looks to me that nobody cared about it , The bar staff was very welcoming
476861,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The pub in front of the street is very noisy and unfortunately my room wasn t soundproofed They charged on my card the first night one day before the deadline specified on booking Fair enough no problem but when I booked on Booking website it was clearly specified both in the hotel Policies and in price details data sheet that there would not be any prepayment and no deposit would be charged , the hotel is very comfortable rooms and bathroom are very clean Also this time my room was clean spacious and well furnished The breakfast is fantastic with very fresh fruit and some cakes homemade The staff is friendly and helpful
476862,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Location is a bit from city centre But we knew that in advance , Room 604 was clean and to the backside no noise from the street Not too spacious but clean 
476863,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, My room faced the street and you could hear the people drinking at the local bar at night , Breakfast included and it was good Local area had good places to eat Staff was very friendly and helpful Hotel looked nice and modern The outlets were universal so I was able to charge my US phone 
476864,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The only problem was fluctuating water warmth in the shower it managed to go from scalding to freezing several times during the same instance I tried to wash myself, OMG they had such variety of cakes and pastries on breakfast table it s good I m not diabetic because I could have died trying to sample them all D
476865,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, I had to put in the wifi password every time I wanted to use it even after a few minutes The hotel was a little difficult to find because the name on the door is different , Lovely spacious reception and breakfast area Nice balcony Friendly staff The breakfast offered a good variety 
476866,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, We had a bad connection with the WiFi , Staff was very helpful with providing information about Milan Hotel location was good You could easily travel by public transport 
476867,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Wi fi was disconecting all the time I type the password 9 10 times until I memorized it The breakfest very poor cheese and ham and a bit of a omlette , I liked the location Was 15 minute from the city centre Free upfront parking but optional you could choose for private parking 20 night 
476868,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The room was quite dusty in places but not to the extent of getting uncomfortable Also I wish the bathroom was warmer, Very cosy and very quiet room as requested Good breakfast too 
476869,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, 20 Euro a day the private parking is a little bit expensive , Good Hotel with clean room near bus station than bring you at metro station The italian style breakfast is good with a good choice of cakes For a week end was a good preis for this hotel in Milan 
476870,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Super bad shower It seems like staff washing towels with vinegar because it smell like that When i came to the hotel i had my booking confirmation with me but receptionist told me that it was canceled without any reason It was very stressful Temperature control was bad It was always around 30 in the room , Breakfast was good clean room In the morning you can ask for cappuchino or coffee good design 
476871,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Check out is 10am which is a bit early but considering that the hotel is on walking distance from Termini station you can leave the luggage if you have few hours before departure, location is fairly good walking distance from Termini and you can walk to Corso and Spanish Steps through Barberini as well about 20 25 min walk 
476872,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Bad Wifi too far from city center plus bad public trasportation to reach But enough parking spaces so if you have a car would not be a problem , Comfortable Clean Nice people Nice breakfast
476873,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13,No Negative, A really nice and lovely hotel in Milan with kind stuff and rich breakfast The coffee was amazing and in the rooms was really warm It is located in a quite area far from Center about 30 minutes with public transportation There is a supermarket Lidl 5 minutes from the hotel I went there 2nd time and can recommend this hotel 
476874,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Poor location not a nice district Graffiti everywhere Difficult to find as the Hotel does not have a sign outside No TV that worked in room as no remote available at reception Cracked and broken shower tray Not 4 star as advertised surly uninterested staff Not recommended, Not much
476875,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, It seems that this hotel is running it s last days no internet for some reason they stoped using the key card system No Sky TV anymore and the staff seems not to be that much motivated anymore ,No Positive
476876,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, This is not a four star hotel not even sure this should be a three star hotel Cleanliness comfort CLEANLINESS There was half a centimeter of dust on most surfaces terrible bathroom noisy dirty carpets dirty walls For 220 night disaster , Location is quite good abd easy to find 
476877,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Although the Wifi was included in the room price the network was very slow or difficult to connect to every time you needed to re enter your access code Creating a hotspot with your cell Phone is a lot quicker , Location only a 15 minute walk from Navigli
476878,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Our room was not cleaned properly it smelled a bit of urine and the bathroom was kind of shabby old appliances and so on Besides the sleeping room lacked any charme Not even a picture on the wall Very unpleasant atmosphere , Location and breakfast were good 
476879,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Some rooms need to be refurbished , Very convenient location and 2 minutes from tram station Free hotel parking and very friendly staff Good Wi Fi in the room 
476880,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Small room for the price this is definitely the most I have ever paid for a hotel room that is not 4 or 5 stAR or in a prime location hot breakfast was cold Cigarette butt s on the balcony , Close to where I needed to be quiet street
476881,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The condition of the hotel was not that good For what appeared to be a relatively new hotel it seemed quite run down both lobby area and rooms Also the entrance was so jam packed with cars it was a bit difficult to know where to park when checking in , staff was friendly and breakfast was good 
476882,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, it is located ca 10 min walk from the nearest metro station however there is a bus to the metro station just in front of the hotel and a tram to the city centre there are some bars clubs in the same street so it was loud during the weekend , very good breakfast new and clean rooms very good value for money
476883,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Wi fi was very slow , Location easy walk to the tram Not too far from the city centre close to the Navigli Helpfull staff and execellent breakfast 
476884,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, the rooms are not clean enough especially the carpets and bathroom tiles We got a retractable bed for an adult wifi is not that good , breakfast parking
476885,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, The shower was small and the water splash out of the shower no matter how hard you try not to And the location is far from the center of the city Plus the wifi is very slow so I was kind of disappointed by that The service and the stay was pleasant but it s too over priced , The staffs were really friendly and nice The bed was pretty comfortable and the room was clean 
476886,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, we booked this place for a businesstrip to milan Although we booked a double bed we got twin beds BUT that was not the problem The problem is what you get for 360 EUR Dirty beds the very small room fitted with a carpet that now is gray dirty room walls and ceilings Across the street is a bar which plays loud music till 2am in the morning At the car park my rental car was damaged at the mirror My wife wanted a comb as she forgott her brush This 4star house had no comb available for guests Only the breakfast was good , the breakfast

476888,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13,No Negative, The hotel was really bad no room service and really far there is no meal after breakfast having payed 700 euros per night for such hotel was a very bad experience No porter to help with luggage Very disappointed especially value for money was very poor
476889,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Price for 3rd was tent times as expensive as first night with no difference in service Just ripping off customers who don t have a choice , Location
476890,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, Long walk necessary to get to the next metro station at least there s a bus stop close the the hotel Friendly staff but expected better English skills Beds are very hard Bathrooms are very small seem much bigger on the pictures online Not really worth the money, Check In even possible until midnight Nice breakfast

476893,IH Hotels Milano Watt 13, It s incredibly difficult to get to we got lost for like 3 hours before we found it and the only reason we could get there was because a local person offered to drive us The hotel does not have a name on the front of the building The directions they provide in their this website to get there are all wrong , The hotel is really cool Minimalist super clean and breakfast is just awesome
