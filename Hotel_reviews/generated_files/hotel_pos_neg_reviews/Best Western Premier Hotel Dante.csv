374216,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, We liked the quieter location It s not smack in the centre of the busy sections but walking distance The breakfast was amazing and staff all helpful Rooms were quite clean and spacious There were lots of places to eat within a short walk and the subway train station was not far 
374217,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Internet connection has been completely not sufficient to provide the possibility to work out the daily businness job A nice hotel with a good staff but for two days I have been cut off from my mail contacts An Hotel absolutely to avoid for bussinness journeys ,No Positive

374220,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Nothing, The property was centrally located near all the major sites and restaurants The staff was extremely helpful spoke excellent English and knowledgeable We enjoyed staying there 
374221,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, there wasn t anything we didn t like, the hotel was lovely the staff very helpful the only problem was there is no station as advertised so it was difficult to locate it we found by chance
374222,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Nothing, Friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel spotless clean great breakfast that seemed endless good size rooms with comfy beds in a great location not too far away from The Ramblas but quiet enough to be just away from the busy streets Some great restaurants and bars really close by Lovely walk into the centre of town too Highly recommend 
374223,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The room is so noisy at the exit of lifts The value for money is not logical only Bed in small box with wifi for price of 5 stars hotel , Clean room
374224,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, We didn t feel like we had good directions to the hotel , The room was comfortable The staff was friendly and helpful The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and recommending and booking tours 
374225,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Room was quite noisy especially Monday am I paid for a triple room but toiletries were only provided for two and sometimes I even had to ask for those Also only two cups and milk portions were left daily I arrived by taxi from the airport and paid approx 24 euros on leaving staff asked if I wanted a taxi I said I would pick one up from the corner outside staff said they could call one for me I asked if it would be the same price and they said yes The driver started with 3 euros on his meter rather than the 2 10 which is standard and when we reached the airport he added 9 euros onto the meter price this was an unpleasant ending I had used other taxis during our stay and this was the only unpleasant experience, Location was reasonably convenient water was provided in the foyer for use of guests We discovered a handy supermarket very close by 
374226,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Being picky I could say that there was not much natural light reaching the room and the hotel was 15 minutes walking from the very center of Barcelona, The room was nice spacious confortabile and well equipped The staff was always really kind and helpful I would say above Best Western s standards
374227,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, breakfast was quite simple expensive washing amenities shampoo shower gel only for one person, comfy beds and pillows attentive and helpful staff special thanks for the anniversary present it was a lovely surprise 
374228,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Booked in July but the room allocated was very noisy as it was at the front I asked to change which the staff would have accommodated but couldn t offer a double bed so we remained in the room for our stay Very disappointed as this was booked a long time ago for my husbands 60th,No Positive
374229,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Soundproofing I could clearly hear the person next door I felt a bit rushed by the receptionists when I had questions regarding the surrounding area or nearby transport It would be nice to post a map for visitors or have one handy other than the hop on and hop off bus map which is terrible for example to show how to get to the nearest metro station for example without being rushed , Very clean There was everything in the room including slippers and a bath robe The bed was very comfortable and the room and facilities were functional Room temperature was good at all times and could be regulated 
374230,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Altough double glazing rather noisy street and only one free outlet at the writing desktop , Maintenance of rooms is excellent and we liked the private parking for our car and bikes and the spatious bathroom 
374231,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The standard of the room and hotel was very casual and quite simple I had a single room with no view and I felt a bit claustrophobic , Walking distance to La Rambla and Passeig de Gracia Good value for the money and very nice and helpful staff 
374232,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, New arrivals in the morning had to wait in the small lobby that was very small with few seats until 2 pm to get to their rooms , We came believing that it served no food but there was breakfast lunch and dinner Breakfast especially was just great 
374233,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Rudest hotel staff I ve ever seen If we were not exhausted by the flight and it being 10pm we would ve fled this hotel and looked for an other one To avoid , 
374234,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Can t find fault with anything really Perhaps the breakfast was a bit pricey but there was an offer on we just chose not to take it Went round the corner for a croissant and a coffee instead , The room was very comfy and the air conditioning very effective as it was hot Staff could not have been more helpful We had a great stay 
374235,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, For what I paid very small room inside with no natural light or view 1st night out till 3 am Got a nasty call from cranky old man at desk to turn down sound on TV Kept neighbours up all night it was regular sound and not on all night It shuts off when out so should have called at 3 am Most discusting front desk except for lady on at day The TV only had one sound and don t scream at clients due to fact you have a miserable night job and walls are paper thin I do not party in room so they were rude I would not look at the front desk for the 9 days and night staff miserable and Turn off customers Will never book best Western again and I travel a lot Worst service for the clerk being miserable and rude Tom, Location

374238,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, Friendly helpful efficient staff perfect location beautifully appointed comfortable hotel very accommodating a great introduction to our first stay in Barcelona
374239,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The WiFi was quite a ddisaster The signal either did not come or was very slow especially in the evenings when more people came back to their rooms We had to go to the lobby downstairs to use it where it was better The hotel unfortunately was not a help in removing this issue Told us that it was because the hotel was fully occupied and thus the WiFi was slow , The hotel was very well located The staff was good and attentive The room was comfortable The breakfast was good with a good spread Overall a good hotel 
374240,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, If this hotel was just a bit closer to Las Ramblas it would have been perfect , Although the breakfast was extra it was convenient quite good and well worth it There was a good variety of hot and cold food along with fresh fruit We took advantage of this to stock up and get a good start to our day filled with a lot of walking and site seeing Also the WiFi in our room on the 4th floor worked great 
374241,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Wifi was useless Shower door didn t close properly so it leaked , The room was very nice and comfortable Well equipped with plenty of space Location is good with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby 
374242,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Windows onto the front street were not sufficiently insulated so early morning traffic noise was quite intrusive Air conditioning was not sufficient to manage the 30 degrees and there was no thermostat control in the room to change it , Clean comfortable rooms with good facilities Breakfast was good if a little restricted in choice Great location just a short stroll to Las Ramblas Friendly and helpful staff 
374243,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, It is a bit far to walk from the core areas of sightseeing shopping but metro and bus stations nearby , It is truly great value for money the rooms are comfortable and stylish even single rooms I was surprised to get the fantastic deal on booking and wasn t sure what to expect It was a good surprise They have thought of smaller details to make guests comfortable The staff was also helpful 
374244,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, we didn t like some of the guests praying on the floor without shoes in the lobby, Good wifi excellent breakfast very good reception very polite rooms
374245,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Inefficient aircon 15EUR extra for breakfast One staff member checked people in whilst a queue formed and two other staff were on duty at the front desk standing around but not assisting, Great location Comfortable modern clean spacious rooms Staff help with early morning taxi arrangements Very good advice about traveller safety in Barcelona provided
374246,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Charging the same rate for breakfast when the children were only 4 and 6 We eat in a local coffee bar, The staff went the extra mile to help with planning a journey by public transport
374247,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, i was accused of having smoked in the room while i never smoked anything in my life , Close to All Many restaurants in the direct neighbourhood In the middle of the center and you can walk to the main attractions shopping port Gaudi buildings Fantastic location to discover this wonderful city 
374248,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The hotel did not have CNN channel on tv , It was located in a great neighbourhood There were cafeteria bars restaurants and supermarkets very close to the hotel Just five blocks from the famous street Passeio de Gracia six blocks from La Pedrera We walked to visit la Sagrada Fam lia It was very safe Good wifi connections I will recommend for all my brazilian friends 
374249,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, On foot a little too far away from Las Ramblas and marina approx 20 to 25 minutes However cheap and quick by taxi , Comfortable spacious room Very good secure underground parking ideal for motorcyclists looking for security Fantastic tapas restaurant opposite hotel 
374250,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Asked for fried egg after two days of tepid sloppy scrambled eggs and almost cold bacon Reply was no management said can t do them an get you one hard boiled egg Given cava for inconvenience but when asked at desk again told no fried eggs Had trouble getting off to sleep traffic noise could do with better double glazing Double room two people had to ask for 2nd robe Housekeeper left pillowcase in room after cleaning 4star premier grade best western think again, The room was comfortable
374251,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, A little bit far from the centre with a few roads to cross but definitely walkable , Had everything I needed air conditioning WiFi and a good night s sleep Had one of the internal rooms and it was fine 
374252,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Have to take the subway to go anywhere , Relatively close to Hospital Clinic metro station and helpful staff The only hotel that provided written information about being careful of pick pocket and con artist Stayed for 4 days out of 20 and got robbed 3 blocks from it 
374253,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, stayed 2 nights at a single occupancy room 508 it can t be a room in a 4 star hotel the only source of light is a window facing a wall and a another window so it has no ventilation or proper light and this was never mentioned in Hotel Description room is quiet old and walls very thin you can hear all sort of noises I paid nearly 110 euros per night for a room that has no value what so ever i tried to change to a normal room that can see the sun the second day Reception asked for 30 euros extra , Location is great
374254,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Staff speaks English poorly and are not polite They have not expressed any words of welcome or even spoke to me for 3 days words like hello how are you and can we help can not be heard , Location clean and comfy beds
374255,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The walk to the main city centre attractions was slightly longer than we would have liked , The bedroom we were given was extremely comfortable and spacious with a superb bathroom Being on the top floor of the hotel it was also very quiet with a wonderful view overlooking the city 
374256,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, the personnel on the reception were not very polite nor helpful Often they did not even say hallo to us when we came to the hotel the double bed in the junior suite was quite small, good location nice rooms excellent breakfast
374257,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, no sauna or pool weird for a 4 stars hotel, excellent breakfast very comfortable big double bed and large room very clean buses goes everywhere from around the hotel walking distance to elegant passeige de gracia
374258,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, That toaster , Everything but especially the very kind and welcoming staff I learn a lot from them on every visit They are generous with their time and knowledge The refurbished ground floor planta is quite impressive 
374259,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Location a little far from the metro but the metro in Barcelona is fantastic Next to a grocery store to get food , We had great help from the staff what to see and how to get there 
374260,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, On the 5th floor the wifi did not work well at all in the room and it only marginally worked in the hallway This was an inconvenience , The bed was very comfortable the room was very clean and the location is excellent The staff was also very friendly 
374261,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, They need to explain a little more about parking and the price for breakfast , We only stayed for 1 night since We spent more time in Valencia Place is almos 5 blocks from Paseo la Gracia so is very close It was a nice Sandwish store right next which it was perfect because their breakfast is 15 per person per day plus is You planning to park in their garage is almost 25 per night Bed were very comfy 
374262,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The noise from street ask for a quiet room hope they will improve the quality of windows Poor quality of Internet in the room, Very good location buses for every direction in 200m Delicious breakfast Very cozy area restaurants cafes supermarket next door 
374263,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, the hotel seems to be under rennovation work and the hotel entrace was the garage back door and front desk was on the 1st floor Sometimes the elevator from the ground floor was not working so we had to go to the 1st floor by stairs and take another elevator to go the room , breakfast was good location was convenient
374264,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Nothing , The staff were excellent and the breakfast great Location wise it s not too far from 2 metro stations so easy to get about and it s a 5 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas 
374265,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Hotel was being renovated noisy dusty and they didnt warn us They were completely renovating reception downstairs and simply relocated reception desk one floor up with only one tiny lift access Very bad no relaxing area for guests or a bar , Male receptionist was friendly
374266,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, If ground floor work finished, Friendly people of the hotel Even out side people are nice Prices are not expensive I cleaned my teeth for 29 euro taxi not expensive It is Jan now weather beautiful cold Hotel has larg bathroom breakfast for me ok
374267,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Noise from background could be irritating in the evenings Some renovation going on which was not a pleasant scene Mirror by the bed in some double rooms cd be irritating had to change my room , Great location Walking distance to almost all the tourist attractions if you enjoy walking Lovely staff ready to help Close to a coffee shop ad supermarket 
374268,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Hotel Dante was under repair which I suspect affected the price if the price remains the same when the modifications are complete then I suspect this would be a fair price for a nice hotel that has a good situation in the city , My wife and I have used Best Western hotels on several occasions Rivolli in Rome Twice City Hotel in Prague Dante in Barcelona if the standards and price of Best Western hotels remain the same we will continue to use them for future holidays 
374269,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, I travelled with my small two children I reached hotel very late night They were ready for me Excellent service One of the best hotels I stayed Can recommend anyone
374270,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The building is undergoing some renovation work at the front so could be easily missed There was a lot of work going on during the Thursday and Friday that we stayed and this could be heard throughout our room 3rd floor Not really a big issue just would have like to been told before booking Wifi also very intermittent, Value for money was good 
374271,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, The hours of the breakfast buffet was great in the morning The market right next door allowed us to make some of our meals instead of buying them all 
374272,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Location abut 20 minutes walk from main areas a bit tiring after a day out, Staff very friendly helpful Room well worth what we paid Breakfast good selection Overall very happy with stay would use hotel again
374273,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The only thing for us was the WiFi it didn t work on the third floor It was weak and then it went away completely so for a 4 star hotel it is a shame that you have to sit in the lobby and get tickets for the attractions or call your family , rooms were clean supermarkets and the shopping street near by staff was kind location was good 7 8 minutes walk to the metro
374274,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, All was OK for me but if you are not driving and are not a walker know that you ll either have to walk a few blocks to Passeo de Gracia or else take some public transportation , Site is perfect if you travel by car easily accessible both from the East through Calle Arag or from the west through Avenida Diagonal Convenient garage at hotel Efficient personnel Cheap for a 4 star in Barcelone even at this low season Many shops and restaurants in the area 
374275,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, No problems , The hotel is in a modern building located in a nice part of town only 3 blocks to the nearest metro The room was clean very comfortable and had a good shower The furnishings were modern and an electric coffee maker with coffees and teas was provided in the room I d gladly stay here again Rooms in Barcelona can be expensive so a hotel of this high quality was a good value 
374276,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, very tired needs updating room was small and looked out onto the street so very noisy could not talk or sleep with a window open We paid for breakfast on our last morning and was very disappointing not worth the money pleased we went out on the other days for breakfast twenty minute walk into the main attraction ie La Ramblas this hotel needs to get its act together as we found 4 star hotels nearer town that were far more superior , close to some excellent restaurants and cafes
374277,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, There was construction work right next to our building It may be an issue if you wake up late during the weekdays , Big comfortable bed in a clean spacious enough room We liked our stay very much in general 
374278,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, The Dante is tastefully decorated comfortable and in a good position Everything one could possibly need has been thought of including a very good buffet breakfast The quality of the staff is the reason I have been there over thirty times 
374279,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful The room was very clean Easy walking distance to La Sagrada Familia and other places of interest Would definitely stay at this hotel again 
374280,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, You were able to hear everything from the nearby room Breakfast was okay but not really good Too expensive but on the other side this is Barcelona , Room with windows to the rear side so there was no traffic noise Comfortable beds Friendly personal 
374281,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, First night given the wrong room Short changed by hotel receptionist Kettle not working in the room took them 24 hours to sort out , Quiet location within easy reach of the airport and tourist attractions 
374282,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Small thing only The air conditioner could only be set to very cold or off , All the hotel staff were very professional friendly and helpful The super comfortable and blackout curtains helped to deliver a great night s sleep Unlike a lot of other European hotels there are tea and coffee making facilities in the room The room that we had had an opening door to a small balcony which meant that we could enjoy the outside air whilst relaxing in the room
374283,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante,No Negative, Lovely hotel perfect location for the sights short walk to metro clean rooms good shower and the staff couldn t have been anymore friendly and helpful 
374284,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, the location for us was a bit to far from the main activity i e ramblas and it lacked good resturants in the immediate area , The staff were very helpful and friendly rooms very clean and well prepared 
374285,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, The location was a little bit far from hop on and hop off busses Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas We had to always catch a taxi to get back to the hotel as I had a young child traveling with me , The breakfast was excellent good selection of food and the room was nice and clean I liked the bathroom it was new modern and clean Hand shower worked well Good to have a safe for your valuables Reception staff very helpful We were at the back of the hotel which was nice and quiet It was a pleasant experience and a great hotel 
374286,Best Western Premier Hotel Dante, Room 214 possibly any room ending in 14 Great room but no natural light Window opens into a void asked to be moved and was promptly moved the next morning to a room at the back of the hotel It was lovely , Super helpful staff Always pleasant and helpful Supermarket 2 doors up does cans of Estrella 50 cents a can
