411833,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff were so friendly Loved the jacuzzi it was super cheap and the 15th floor complimentary terrence was beautiful so was the downstairs garden and outdoor pool Drinks served 24 hours Amazing hotel
411834,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, It was a magical experience the room was very big super clean and all the amenities make for an amazing stay Also bed was very good and loved the pillows Stuff is very nice and super polite View also beautiful some buildings cut some of the view but all in all you can enjoy the sea and it is very relaxing Room lounge bar pool spa everything is amazing 
411835,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, If I am going to be super picky there is a window from the bathroom to the main room There is a blind but you can see through it when the lights are out in the main room This would be fine if it was just me and my partner but I was travelling with my 13 year old step daughter However this is minor fault and I d definitely stay there again , The executive lounge on the 15th floor with free access to alcahol and snacks was fantastic for a free lunch with brilliant views over the city and the sea Aditionally the buffet for breakfast was exceptional and almost worth staying in the hotel by itself 
411836,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Breakfast started at 7 and by the time my husband and son went down around 9 some food had already run out and were not replaced This included the chocolate fountain , The hotel was strategically located within a short walking distance to the conference centre where my congress was making it convenient for me to walk to and fro each day There was a tram stop directly in front of the hotel and a metro station a little farther away This made exploring the city very easy for my husband and son who had accompanied me on the trip The natural history museum which was just next to the conference centre and the beach a little beyond the centre were also firm favourites with them There was a shopping mall with eateries and popular brands within walking distance too During their walkabouts my husband and son discovered several halal eateries One was in the shopping mall while there were at least 3 others in the vicinity of the hotel These restaurants sold mainly middle eastern food such as kebab and biryani and were reasonably priced Breakfast was good with an exciting array of food to choose from 
411837,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We booked a triple room for 3 adults but It was a double room with an lesser quality bed added We were not always supplied with 3 of everything It was possible to see into the bathroom from the bedroom , The breakfast was very good The front desk staff were very helpful 
411838,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The fact that the taxis were on strike This meant traveling by public transportation to the hotel Although close to public transportation stop it is quite far from the airport, Hotel is very close to the company I was visiting It is located in a nice area close to the beach
411839,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, the pool from the picture looked much bigger than what it is The design of the room and the hallway is a bit tired comparing the lounge on the 15th floor and the patio on ground floor which are very modern looking and sleek the room was a bit of a disappointment let alone the very tired looking hallways When calling the reception the guy picking up all the time was the most unfriendly person together with one of the male bar tender they need to work on it a bit , The lounge space outside the bar s patio and the pool were really lovely Location is great if you want to be away from the crowd and the noise of the center and if you already know barcelona The hotel in walking distance to the Parc Forum with the sea close by mind you if you want decent sea you should go towards Barceloneta
411840,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Though very convenient for the work conference it wasn t at all convenient for the rest of what we wanted to see in BCN That definitely makes it a tradeoff We picked it partly b c of the rooftop pool thinking that my mom and son could relax and play there while I was at work mtg but the pool was a scene really only for women not fun for a grandmother and teenager The hotel had a lot of generic ads about things to do in BCN they could give more specific info about the beach and how to get to it it took me 4 days to realize where to go to get to the beach The first 3 times I walked out of the conference center I only saw the cement area behind the CCIB and thought that s all there was nearby but it wasn t They also could have made a more specific rec about the Museu Blau which was right across the street and was FABULOUS , Clean pleasant common area in the back was as pleasant as could be with construction going on was right across from the CCIB where my work conference was happening so very convenient for the work part of my trip nice workout room Fabulous spread at breakfast not clear which breakfast days breakfast was included with room or not 
411841,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, nothing, the staff was very friendly and helpful special thanks to Bianca in the reception she did everything to help from check in to arranging a transfer to the airport at check out the location is excellent in a quite neighborhood but with access to all public transportation at walking distance including bus metro and tram which made moving to downtown rambella and port very easy also the proximity to diagonal mar shopping mall made shopping an amusement at the end of everyday
411842,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The was nothing that we did not like The metro ride to the center of the city and other main attractions takes about 15 minutes but this was not a problem for us , Close to metro station After a busy day in the city enjoyed the lounge facility on the 15th floor Extremely comfortable bed Quiet room 
411843,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Nothing, It s not my first time to book in SB Diagonal I adore this luxury 5 stars hotel everything is wonderful the swiming pool in the 17 th etage the luxury rooms and the verry Freindly staf
411844,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The chef was terrible disgusting food Although set ok was beautiful Wasted 62 50 on the worst cuisine ever Other than that I can t complain much however I thought the staff were not informative enough No one came and told us about any events and where to go Staff could have been talkative and more approachable Seemed stuck up girls to be honest , Bed was comfy and hotel very clean
411845,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location in terms of accessibility to other tourist spots was good but the actual location right next to an abandoned building under construction made the view out our window not even worth opening the curtains Also the 24hr available room service was a bit of a joke for the prices they charged In hindsight I should ve just grabbed some late night McDee s instead , The room was very nice the bed super comfy the ability to turn the AC down as cold as we wanted and the blackout curtains made it a dream to sleep in 
411846,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Slowest check in ever had wi fi to improve despite two sign of do not disturb on the door the cleaning service knocked and entered in my room the window was broken and they were not able to fix it till the next day closing time of the spa closing time of the rooftop shower temperature regulation room temperature regulation , Gym facilities ergonomic pillow confortable bed
411847,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The wifi was horrible and inconsistent There was no variety for breakfast same buffet daily may be adding a station for making omelette pancakes lively will bring some flavor The entrance to shower cabinet is so tiny and tricky and could result in slippage or injuries, Friendly and pleasant staff overall 
411848,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel had a raucous party going on in the garden from 2pm until late evening on both evenings of our stay which was also open to non residents to purchase a ticket Although guests could attend for nothing we didn t want to and this made the garden inaccessible for us as we just wanted a pleasant early evening drink The bar area was also not conducive for the same reasons Hugely disappointing and totally inappropriate for an allegedly four star hotel , Breakfast selection was very good 
411849,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We arrive by 1 00 at night and we unfortunately we was not able to enjoy full day room and services, Excelent staff excelent hotel when travelling by car to Barcelona excelent bed excelent situation excellent all They upgrade us to a better room excelent quality service to clients
411850,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The shower was really difficult to use to turn off The touchscreen controls that control temperature lighting etc were very difficult to use initially when we arrived at 2am in the morning and had to work out how to operate them and you had to get out of bed during the night to make any adjustments ,No Positive
411851,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We enter the hotel 2 o clock in the night me and My college get a room with double bed that was not the request We come down to sort it out the straff send us to a temporary room and guess What There was a woman sleeping in the room when We entered UNACCEPTABLE She became angry and we were so embarrased I wanted to leave the hotel immediatly and refund My money The hotel arranged a room on the fifth floor and guess What happened next The shower was not working It felt useless to contact the lobby Every 5 minutes I was at this moment super disapointed The next morning we went to explain that I felt disrespected with How everything was going and I had paid a lot of money for 2 nights We got upgraded by the restaurant manager a lovely room with a view Fruits and champagne in the room we got access to the excecutive lounge and spa as compensation We were satisfied a couple of hours until We noticed that the room was like a sauna during sleeping time I was exhausted and had no energy to Call the staff I have astma so I Did not get so much oxygen I could not breathe during the night I just gave up Because there was ALWAYS something that was not working We got compensated with 9 euro discount for massage and late check out Even through i am Very Happy with the manager i am Very disappointed with the hotel and the lack of professionalism I feel like I have been robbed on the money I had so much expectations but I had a horrible experience with this hotel It is supposed to be 4 hotel , The breakfast was great the restaurant manager and the manager Diana were Very kind and Always tried a better solution for us 
411852,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff took time to check everyone in and check everyone out The process took long both times so that could have been better , The room was a nice size and the bathroom was clean and spacious 
411853,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The personal at the reception are helpless They really have to improve their check in and out system To request a late check out it is necessary to wait until the same morning of departure day , Well kept facilities

411856,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Some of the staff the poor food in the VIP lounge and some things not working well in the bathroom like the jacuzzi and the tube of the sink broken, Near to the beach size of rooms with jacuzzi
411857,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Upgraded to a great room with jaccuzzi I came back to this hotel because of the gym and its location easy to pick up as at the end of Av Diagonal in front of convention center and see to go for a run

411860,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The facilities were perfect the pool and the spa Especially the 15th floor lounge The rooms are really comfortable There s a tram that stops right outside the hotel and the tube stop is to the side the Barcelona bus tour stops right next to the hotel too so great location It is about 20 min from the main town centre there is also a taxi rank right outside And a shopping centre
411861,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Location is off the beaten path About 15 20min commute anywhere centralized Drinks need a little work , Pretty hotel Everything new Spa facilities were great Food was tasty and well priced Comfortable and clean 
411862,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I have stayed at this hotel annually for the last 7 years and for the most part have always been happy with the service and standards On our latest visit we paid for the upgrade to include the Executive Lounge which was not very Executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed It was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel has clearly cut back on the staffing of this area At one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice in the ice bucket fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty The toilet door lock was also broken over the two days we were there The place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol I thought this level was for over 18s There was little or no food available at what you would presume would be a key walk in time like 7pm this was repeated in the afternoon and the executive lounge closes far too early in the evening This is the 7th year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason I booked the hotel over other hotels but over the last couple of years it seems to have got progressively worse I thought last year s poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days I stayed there this year It is the last time I would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year I did complain to reception but there was no attempt whatsoever to recover the service or offer any form of compensation which I thought was a missed opportunity and has cost them a couple of customers as a result The rooms are Stayed 23 24th June 2017 VP Operations FTSE 250 UK Company, The spa was relaxing and clean and tidy to be fair the reception staff are always friendly and helpful although they missed an opportunity to recover the service following my complaint about the executive lounge 
411863,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Booked airport transfer with reception staff after waiting 30 mins after time taxi was due we checked with reception it appeared they had not booked the transfer This caused us to very nearly miss our return flight home Views not great from room Pool not as big as expected , Rooms spacious comfortable Breakfast had everything more Location is close to the beach Roof top pool had great views 
411864,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Customer Service needs improving No consistency with food considering the hotel is ment to be 4 , I have received and email with a refund from the bill which is a step in the right direction so the hotel is trying to get it right 
411865,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, staff didn t care not very inviting, no towells cold showers whole stay this is second time ive tried it should have stuck with my first instints but gave them a second try and no joy
411866,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location is more fringey than expected there are no restaurants or other amenities in easy walking distance The window into the bathroom from the bedroom was a surprising feature and not in a good way although it did have a roller blind for privacy Rather a limited menu in the restaurant and a bit pricey but that may have been due to Brexit and the terrible exchange rate , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was a good size and clean and comfortable Massive selection of food options for breakfast and plenty of it Lots of taxis wait just over the road there is a tram stop directly outside and Metro station close by The rooftop pool is fairly small but a nice amenity to have available 
411867,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, This Hotel is way too far out of the city 45 mins walk at least you have to use public transport Would not recommend for a city break more a business Hotel , Nice staff large rooms

411869,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The pool was due to open at 09 00 which my 9year old was delighted by We were stood waiting for just over 15 minutes which he didn t much like , The cleanliness the comfort and the fantastic nights sleep
411870,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It was a bit strange that our room had a window between the room and the bathroom Of course you could block the view but still strange , The hotel was great very helpful staff really clean nice view easy to reach through public transportation The restaurant was very nice with a diversity of foods for breakfast All in all a really nice location to spend your holiday 
411871,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Checking in was delayed for two of the party for well over an hour and no hospitality offered Four members of the party were accommodated on time but my friend and myself I organised the trip had to wait in reception until the final check on the room was made by the housekeeper This took over an hour I thought that the offer of a drink of some kind would have been in order , The accommodation was very good and the staff friendly Close to public transport trams open top tour bus and taxis 
411872,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Wifi kept disconnecting every few minutes The open concept bathroom was dangerous due to wet floors from having the shower completely open to the rest of the bathroom Had to use the few towels provided to mop up the mess so I wouldn t slip and fall The transportation company this hotel contracts with is abysmally incompetent They caused our party so much stress in our attempt to catch our flight They charged 2 50 for water bottles that were complimentary in our other hotel The rooftop pool was nothing more than a lap pool It certainly didn t have the luxury that the ad portrayed And those are just a few of my dissatisfactions , Our waiter at the restaurant was very accommodating

411876,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The room was a little hot and the pool bar wasn t ever open when we went to the pool , The location was great and the surrounding neighborhood was very fun The hotel was very clean and sophisticated 
411877,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Room was not cleaned very well each day Bath had chips out of it and hot water was a bit difficult to get going in shower Wifi was terrible in room had to move rooms once as it didn t reach and the second room was only marginally better , Location was great for convention centre and was very near public transport links 
411878,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff were not accommodating at all I let them know a month in advance that I will be traveling for 15 hours by flight before arriving and needed an early check in Apart from the check in service was poor The room did not have the basics We had to ask for days for a face cloth before someone got it For an international destination and hotel their English was not even basic The hot water water ran out often No international news channel on tv Large room Terrible view of a work in progress construction building right next door to hotel The concierge was ineffective There is a large shopping center nearby with restaurants and shops This hotel is close to the Metro and hop on hop off bus 5min walk Traveling to Seville after Barcelona and the service was worlds apart to this hotel Staff were friendly spoke excellent English took the time to explain the sites and routes and make recommendations checked me in at 10am etc ,No Positive
411879,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Wifi sucked Spa was crowded Neighborhood not very exciting , Great view of the city Very nice hotel more upscale than we usually choose but booked because of promotional price

411881,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Some iritated man from the recepcion and the nearbye of the hotel with some unfinished abandonated buildings , Confortable beds nice view good room service and excelent spa service Close to the metro and tramvia station 
411882,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Too far out of centre approximately 6 km Close to conference centre but not if you are traveling for tourism , Modern attractive property Very helpful staff 
411883,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Overall poor and unfriendly service We used the do not disturb signs for our room to no avail the cleaners still wandered in unannounced There was no soap in some of the public bathrooms They tried to overcharge us for items we did not consume from the minibar There was a taxi strike the day we were due to depart but we were given no warning and when we asked for information regarding public transport available the hotel staff were completely oblivious to what the city could offer us in terms of early morning transportation to the airport as an alternative We ended up walking to the opposite hotel to ask for help The cocktails drinks were overpriced and poor quality, The beds were unbelievably comfortable
411884,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, On 2 of the nights the wifi didn t work in the room We were told this is often a problem Other than that the hotel was perfect for a mini break , The hop on hop off bus was across the road as was the Diagonal Mar which has loads of shops including a primark and lots of restaurants There was also a metro within a few minutes walk The area was nice and quiet and the hotel was very modern and clean Very child friendly with a fridge microwave and kettle in the room which was excellent as we were travelling with a 8 month old baby 
411885,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Softer fluffy bed Air conditioner didn t work well I wish the lounge and pool area were open till 11pm so we could see the city lights , Bigger room than most in Europe the pool veiw from lounge and the court yard had a nice ambiance The coffee machine for breakfast was awesome The variety at breakfast was great too

411888,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There was nothing I wouldn t change Loved our stay, The rooms were decorated to a very high standard the mattresses were so comfortable The hotel was amazing it had great views and outside it there is a tram and a metro just around the corner which brings you right into the city centre The shopping centre is located across the road But what may our stay great was how friendly all the staff were The staff were actually amazing From receptionists to porters and told us how to get into the city as well So friendly My sister turned 21 while there and they sent up a bottle of champagne and a card to our room it was such a lovely touch 
411889,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The roof top bar and spa close exceedingly early 7pm and 9pm respectively considering if you take the morning and afternoon to go out and then return for a small siesta you only have a short time to make use of these selling points , Great location and had all the creature comforts that you could want The staff were all extremely attentive and even the bell hops and cleaning staff were kind to us asking how the stay was while on the elevator or in passing
411890,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I don t have any complain everything was perfect, I like the location I wasn t looking for a centric location great staff great facilities Would recommend it 100

411892,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Everything was perfect , Very comfortable bed perfect pillows different sizes Even the sofa chair in the room was surprisingly comfortable Big desk in the room if you have work to do Lots of meeting places and sitting rooms in and out doors inside the hotel where many of my colleagues met after the conferences ended every afternoon 2 minutes walk from the beach and from a big shopping center Tramway stop just in front of the hotel metro a 100m 
411893,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The bathroom window blind was very see through and everyone felt uncomfortable with each other looking in Had to wait 3 hours after I got there to check in and get our room key which was very bad as we had an early flight and was very tired Then finally once we had our room we didn t get what we requested we selected 3 single beds and got a double and a single The pool area closed too early Poor room view of a broken down building with graffiti, I liked the fact that most staff spoke English and could communicate well Very good range of transport around the area The rooms were very spacious
411894,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Is ailttle far from ramblas but it s not a problem with such good metro service, 3 of us stayed in one room and had plenty of space for all of us there Breakfast was lovely And room was comfortable and spacious
411895,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Not being able to work the tv iPod iPhone dock didn t work, The room was very spacious The shower worked very well The jacuzzi in the room was brilliant
411896,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, No bureau exchange and cashpoint at hotel Also the hottub functions didn t all work which made the entertainment less enjoyable , Clean and modern with good facilities Friendly and efficient staff and good location overlooking sea and close to metro line 
411897,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel was a little far out from the centre of Barcelona we had to use the underground but this wasn t too much of a problem for us The breakfast also was expensive at 18 per person but they knew people would pay it as there was no places to eat nearby but the breakfast was a big buffet with lots to offer so you got your money s worth , The hotel was stunning The roof top view was amazing and the rooms were clean and spacey The staff were friendly and helped with every query 
411898,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel is far too overpriced The 15th floor lounge is a nice option but the opening time is restricted from 11 00 20 00 The spa area is not exceptional it offers a small heated pool a sauna and a hammam that was not well heated The room prices are exaggerated for what the hotel offers There was a strange smell in the bathroom all the time , Very clean hotel nice breakfast with large choice nice 15th floor lounge with a good view on the sea and free drinks and snacks which is a bonus The spa area was okay nothing exceptional though Good and fast room service 
411899,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, When we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful and very accommodating We had booked a deluxe room but as there were building works right next door they upgraded us free of charge to an excecutive room with a sea view and access to the spa and 15th lounge Would definitely stay again 
411900,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Weather I couldn t use the water pool on the roof , The breakfast was of a very high quality a wide variety of meals fresh juices fruits coffee tea etc And you can get anything you want with you we used to take some kiwis and bananas for refreshment during the day It was very nice Downstairs at the bar we watched football matches on the wide screen also was a warm and nice experience

411902,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The daily cleaning of the room was pretty poor We did not have the toilet paper replaced for 2 days and ran out The coffee sachets also were not replaced once used As there are no bed side tables a glass got knocked over in the middle of the night by a pillow and it wasn t replaced at all during our stay Other glasses where not cleaned on some days The bathroom and bedroom is separated by a glass window with a blind you can pull down however you can still completely see through the blind , It was next to the tram stop so getting there was pretty easy on public transport from the airport The hotel itself was nice with good sized room the air con was good The terrace was a nice area and did really nice cocktails 
411903,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel was contemporary but basic with a cold atmosphere staff wore tshirts with friendly on them however none of them seemed to be friendly at all The hotel is set away from the city centre but close to the beach taxi bus or metro are the best travel into the city centre I would rate this a 3 than a 4 hotel the rooms were cleaned everyday however as it came to the last few days of our trip things weren t kept to a good standard no toilet rolls for example we stayed in a twin bed room the bathroom had some issues a bad smell of sewage coming from the drains and the large shower glass was attached to the bath making it VERY hard to get in and out of the bath with a very small gap to Climb through , The breakfast was nice good choice to choose from and staff refreshing the food than it sitting around which was good to see Lovely kid treats and cava for the adults

411905,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I didn t like that a lot of the staff couldn t provide us with information on how to get to attractions or transportation other than taxi s out side We paid extra for access to the 15th floor area but 80 of the time no concierges was there to provide any assistance to us We had access to the spa area but we wasn t given any information on the what that actual gave us access to , I loved the location the hotel was in And the amenities that were provide by the hotel were wonderful The hotel basically had everything you needed for relaxation if you chose not to leave the hotel 
411906,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Staff except for the girl on breakfast entrance was uninterested in our problems i didn t felt very welcome There is no slippers or bathrobe They couldn t call us a taxi transfer to airport just told us that we had to tell them 24 h ahead and she turned head to other guests like it s not her problem, Breakfast was great metro station is near 3min walk 
411907,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Beds are quite small first night they gave us a room that had terrible smell after we ve complained twice they said that hotel is fully booked although on booking com we saw that there is a plenty of available rooms they change it next day but first night we couldn t sleep they didn t even offer any compensation Small outdoor Pool and wellness can be used only if you pay extra , Breakfast was magnificent Metro station was quite near 
411908,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, If I had to say a negative it was at the wrong end of the touristy things to do but all the hop on hop off buses stopped at end of the hotel every 10 mins, The staff were brilliant nothing was to much bother good location lovely food great use of floor 15 bar terrace free drinks n nibble
411909,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, looks like and old hotel freshly repainted the staff is not the most professional ones i had much higher expectations for a 4 hotel is not my first time in Diagonal el Mar and I know that there are better 4 choices in the area similar prices , the location is good close to the seaside and public transport you can easily get to the city center in 20 min Breakfast was very good 
411910,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The bathroom was not clean due to a bad design they are not able to clean the shower doors and window to the bedroom and it has lots of dust inside looks very bad, The location and the lobby
411911,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I lost my kid s necklace and no response from the hotel so far after asking to help look dolores it as we left it on the bed after checkout, Location is great
411912,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Fantastic hotel We stayed in a suite with a Jacuzzi The most relaxing and comfortable nights sleep I have had in a long time The room was immaculate and the view out of the floor to ceiling windows was fabulous The staff and facilities are second to none and they are pet friendly so made our stay even easier I have no doubt that we will return to this hotel 
411913,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The bar service wasn t great we were the only ones eating on a Saturday night and the food took a long time to come was cold and had ingredients missing however when we complained the staff were understanding and gave us a discount which we appreciated, Convenient location from the metro The spa was great managed to get appointments for all three of us on the day we booked My friends and I were able to stay in one room despite
411914,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Room was ok but I exprcted better it was no wi fi at all in room we had to ask to change our room guy at reception was rought with us we had to incist hard to get our room changed during stay we noticed he was same rought with all the customers Would not go back for sure,No Positive
411915,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Air con didn t make a difference to the room, Wonderful hotel staff Close by the metro beach and local shopping centre Definitely topped the trip
411916,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Bathroom the see through panel even with the blind down takes a lot of getting used to, Comfy hotel with great amenities in a good spot to use as a base for visiting Barcelona Good transport links into the city and quieter at night so you don t get the noise Spa and 15th floor lounge are great facilities Would definitely stay here again 
411917,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Argumentative bar staff who made an undrinkable hot chocolate , Location was good next to a tram and met stop Pool area had great views being on the 17th floor 
411918,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Weak wi fi signal in the room I would have expected breakfast to be included in the room rate Bad communication with property via the Booking com platform which caused confusion regarding the extra charge for an extra bed , Easy access to public transportation beach shops restaurants natural history museum hop on hop off bus tours etc
411919,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The air conditioner but it was fixed within few hours , What we loved most was their breakfast facilities The best i have ever experienced They have everything one can eat for breakfast including Champagne which was unexpected we loved it 
411920,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Room size and style hotel location was quite far out breakfast options was limited, Business hotel and not family friendly at all Room options are very limited and distance from main Barcelona attractions is quite far from the Diagonal area Not my usual experience with booking com but I guess it happens
411921,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The doors of the bathroom with no locks, Marta is the best employee all of the stuff are great very helpful marta is the best Gracias 
411922,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, All hotels where I have stayed charged at the end of the stay before chcking out but this hotel asked for the payment at the time of checking in This is not in good taste The room did not have any plates spoon and knives which were supplied on demand at the restauramt They should be part of the things suppplied Shaving soap tooth brushes etc need to be replaced regularly , We initially were given a room that was on the 2nd floor and had no view It was shifted to 9th floor the next day and the view was good We were happy with the change The floor near the toilet seat tends to collect water this needs to be rectified 
411923,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, A small microwave should have been in the room It is little away from all the attractions however train station is close by and safe to walk even at night , Very clean and nice hotel Has gym and pool Good rooms Big mall near by
411924,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The pool on the roof was great with a great view but one bad thing was that their is no heating on the pool so every day we were at the hotel was a cold pool going to swim in the pool was considered a dare and much less as relaxation and enjoyment , The staff was great and very kind the hotel was very clean and accessible to many things tourist might need the price was amazing for such a place also their hospitality was great 
411925,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The only thing I wasn t keen on was the dinner menu I don t feel like there was a lot of option so we only had dinner once there but the breakfast buffet was probably one of the best I ve had at a hotel there was enough option for everyone , We had a jacuzzi suite and it was lovely The staff were brilliant for us the location was perfect near the beach and metro service right outside which took you to pretty much everywhere in Barcelona The bed was very comfortable It was my birthday on one of the days and they sent a card to my room which had been signed by all the staff with a bottle of prosecco which was lovely The room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels and bedding and the barmans specialty cocktails have to be the best cocktails I ve ever had Love this place and will be returning x
411926,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, We liked the location very much because it was calm near the beach and with the metro the City Centre was in easy reach Perfect breakfast with lots of choice to start your day And large shopping Mall with all the big brands just 5 minutes walk from the hotel 
411927,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Bed is comfortable curtains are blackouts very useful view from the window is gorgeous Breakfast is maybe a bit expensive though it is very rich buffet of a great variety of anything that you might like from savory to sweets 
411928,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There is big building site next to the hotel on one side and there were works on the street in front of the hotel so it was noisy and dusty Windows must be cleaned Quite often a bad smell is in the area probably from the building sites or from the abandoned building on the other side of the hotel Quite far from city center , Breakfast is amazing and I don t say this almost never bed was good view was nice I had upper storey room and sunny so it was according my request coming from airport with taxi was fast and easy Walking distance from congress center Pool will be probably nice in the summer in March was not functional 
411929,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, On our last day i walked from the foyer into the outside terrace only for the large glass door not to open quickly enough resulting in me walking into the glass door as I thought it was open Facilities Management for hotel should investigate at repair this door sensor , Very modern hotel with all mod cons served the purpose as we were tourist EG up early and out sightseeing after substantial breakfast 
411930,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff were tired and not very helpful stressed and no smiles The hotel looks good but closer inspection the small things are not being looked at I was in the standard rooms which looked right out to a new building site and the noise was intense higher floors are more money and was told they were fully booked out which can happen in fairness But not one thing was complemented for with these conditions as if it was the guests fault for booking Waiter staff in the restaurant really slow and unhelpful Reception staff were the best of all and the cleaners I stayed before in a suite room two years ago and had a much better experience then then now Think it needs a little more love in the workplace , Thomas the bike rental guy great bikes and real passion about his job 
411931,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The pillows were slightly odd one very large one and a smaller thinner one which was uncomfortable in the night The bathroom was like a wet room and was slippery when wet Not enough places to hang towels or put things in the bathroom Also a window looking into the room which did have a blind but you can still see right through it , The air conditioning worked The bed was comfy and spacious Lots of space in the room with additional cupboards for storage The rain shower in the bathroom was nice too Very quiet Brilliant in terms of location Minutes from metro station 
411932,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I have requested a room for 3 but everything was set for two Glasses towels bathrobes etc You could see people in the toilet It s not very practical , It was clean Very close to metro 
411933,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The bathroom has a really small bathtub for a double luxury room The parking fee is as the same as in the city centre And hard to find the parking area , Good Sea view but not in the city centre A little far The room has really nice sound blocking All facilities are new 
411934,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Just wish it was a little closer to the main center town , The spa was wonderful and I adored the rooftop pool Beautiful views We were absolutely thrilled with the complimentary drinks on the 15th lounge Fantastic stay at this hotel
411935,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, This hotel doesent have bell boy to help heavy staff passengers There is pne bell boy and he is always busy We reached hotel on March 25th 2 pm our luggages came to my room 2 20 Our checking out was 8 am on 28th because we had flight at 10 30 am unfourtunately nobody was there to bring down my 2 suitcases and i had to take by myself when i told teciption man that why nobody here to help he told me we have 2 bell boys one is in vacation one willcome between 9 10 Itold him its very bad for uou hotel reputation he told yes and you can report Its really ridiculous this hotel doesent have bell boy but take lot of money from the guests, Comfortability
411936,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Location itself is not to bad but hotel is surrounded with the lots of dead buildings around Breakfast price 18 eur per person is unreal So i went acros the road and paid 8 eur for full breakfast thats a customer lost for you , We liked a lounge room in 15 floor
411937,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We are used to staying right in the city centre so a bit further out staying here but short taxi drive is all u need to reach the centre of Barcelona , We booked a room with a hot tub and was not disappointed We had a large room with everything you would require for a comfortable stay The hot tub was very relaxing and with a bottle of cava free from the mini bar made it even better Staff greeted us straight away and made us feel very welcome We are certainly coming back to this hotel
411938,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The pool looked bigger from photos and opening times could be later for lounge and top floor facailities , Liked the lounge area and snacks and drinks available nice touch
411939,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We didn t really like the breakfast which has a lot to offer but it is all very sweet with cakes and chocolate and no vegetables The coffee was not good from a machine The separate foodcorner for children was beautifully arranged but we were shocked to see that all was sweeted cakes cookies chocolate cornflakes totally artificial and kind of junkfood style , I loved that it is located just a few minutes away from the beach We walked with our dog all the way approx 6km from the hotel to the city along the beach and it was wonderful A lot to see and very beautiful walk The hotel itself is situated beside a shopping center at the end of the diagonal road Easy access also to supermarkets to buy water and food for our trip back home in the car Hotel is easily to find with our car and with a good underground parking garage 18 per day It is not a five star hotel obviously but ok for the price and we are convinced and We will book it definitely again the next time in Barcelona 
411940,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, I really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel The staff is wonderful accommodations quite comfortable The electronic control panel for lights and temperature is a little tricky to figure out but once you know the secret there aren t any issues The pricing on spa services was very reasonable in my opinion The location is great if you are there for a conference at the CCIB as it is directly across the street and Diagonal Mar a large shopping mall is also across the street There are quite a few quick eateries in the area as well and it s just a quick walk to some of the beaches You will need to take the metro or tram both stops close by or a taxi to downtown and to go sightseeing however 
411941,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Room temperture seemed to be really warm or ice cold no in between The ice cream was overpriced for 3 scoops But flavour was really good Time from Airport to hotel length but good way to experience the surroundings Hotel in a business area but that is a personal observation , The breakfast spa lounge and the hot tube suite The majority was amazing The view on the 15th and 17th floor was amazing Tram station literally outside 
411942,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, In the room the partition from bathroom to bedroom is just a blind and you can still see through Overall you seem to have no privacy within the bathroom which was very strange and you felt you could be seen at all times Ice machine did not work Outdoor pool was closed very disappointing Bar too expensive Restaurant too expensive location too far out from city Hotel was surrounded by Empty Derelict buildings and construction , It is a very modern hotel Looks nice and new The room was nice and big and had everything you needed The bed was very comfortable and lovey view of sea Nice big shopping centre nearby and tram and metro within 5 mins of Hotel Staff were very friendly Spa facilities and gym were top class especially the bubble beds in the spa pool 
411943,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, restaurant was awful no follow up to taxi strike the day we were coming a bit too far from the city center not recommended for leisure or family with small kids, good breakfast cleanliness nice rooms
411944,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, They offered Deluxe room But I got just standard 4 room With shower like early afternoon rain where you are waiting for next drop of water and pray that will not stop It was very cold in the cool nevertheless that I put heating on max And it was not possible open the window , Location
411945,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The restaurant bar, Everything Apart from the restaurant not many options for menu and the restaurant manager wasn t very pleasant or helpful 
411946,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There s no tv channels enough I get a room with 3 beds instead a big one so it wasn t so comfortable We didn t had bathrobes as the first time We didnt get the breakfast, I liked the room is so comfortable
411947,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We enjoyed all aspects would have loved to use the outdoor pool but it wasn t warm enough , We absolutely loved the hotel especially the staff We had previously stayed here 7 years ago when it was brand new it didn t disappoint again We were in Barca for the marathon my husband could not run due to injury the hotel couldn t have been more helpful understanding even provided us with the hotels wheelchair which we wouldn t have managed without Special mention to Oriel think this was his name who was especially helpful lovely Loved the outside bar space zen like garden room service meals were great too Thank you for another great stay Upper star hotel without being pretentious 
411948,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, I traveled with my little boy The hotel staff were extremely accommodating with all of our needs Including allowing us to use the hotel freezer for storing some of his baby food The room included a microwave and a fridge which again is very good when you have a child with you Overall it is a very good hotel and fantastic value for money Everything is so near by The public transport is easy to use and you can reach the center of the city within minutes by metro 
411949,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Not lots to do around the hotel We thought that the spa was included but we had to pay extra for it , Friendly staff and very helpful Located next to a shopping mall
411950,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, A window between bathroom and room there was a blind one could pull down but you could still easily see to both directions our teenager found this very disturbing thinking their privacy was not guaranteed Lighting no light for the desk general lighting dim not possible to turn off the light at the room entrance unless you took out the access card from the reader and thus disabled all the other lights as well Poor air conditioning you could have cut the air with a knife in the morning luckily there was a window you could open Bathroom floor and shower floor are VERY slippery even when dry let alone when wet an elderly person would have been in trouble These things would not stop me from selecting this hotel again but are something I would want to improve , Close to a metro station and tram also some bus routes around the corner A quiet neighborhood but also a bit far from the city center Comfortable bed microwave oven and coffee tea supplies in the room Very good breakfast bacon scrambled eggs omelet sausages several types of ham and cheese yoghurt fruit many types of bread and pastries even a chocolate fountain A restaurant which is open until late in the evening A shopping center nearby A swimming pool outdoor on the roof terrace Hotel provides a taxi service to the airport 35 euros for 2 persons 
411951,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It was a little but far from la ramblas other than that the hotel was amazing, The nibbles on the 15th floors were always nice free jacuzzi in the room was the best for me
411952,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The pool was unheated and the roof top doesn t get much sunlight , The location easy to commute around the city go for a walk along the shore next to the beach was a bonus 
411953,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent choice of food in the hotel restaurant rooms were very nice inside and extremely clean Comfortable beds and excellent spa facilities Little bit out of the way from central Barcelona but with a metro station round the corner it was only a 15 minute train ride 
411954,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location is on the far side of Barcelona not close to much except a shopping mall but the public transport isn t far away Breakfast comes at an additional premium price of 20 each this is in addition to the room price I think the room price would have been reasonable if breakfast was included Not once were we able to access the executive bar at 15 floor It was shut every time we tried , He staff were friendly and polite 
411955,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I LOVED EVERYTHING, The staff were incredible So helpful we are English and they understood every word So good I have been looking to book again 
411956,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Only used the car park for one night yet got charged for two the staff member at reception was very rude to me regarding this and said it s either that or we don t get our car back Besides that the staff was nice,No Positive
411957,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Prices for food and drink in the hotel was expensive We ate at a fantastic restaurant 5 mins walk away called Casa Carmen , The hotel is in a great location with a shopping centre just 2 mins walk away lots of restaurants to choose from in tbe shopping centres We didnt eat at the hotel at all not even breakfast as great bakery round the corner where we bought our breakfast and lunch for the day for under 10 for both of us The Spa was good We got one days access included in the stay and also we booked a Tibeten hot stone massage which was exellent and highly recommend The room was very clean and comfortable with all your mod cons and free WiFi l would stay here again 
411958,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, This hotel was such a treat for us The staff was amazing we had an issue with the air not working and they fixed it promptly the hotel was exactly as pictured the spa was delightful and the location was perfect 
411959,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The indoor pool is a spa pool not suitable for kids , Second time at SB Diagonal and was still impressed The room was big and well equipped with minibar and microwave Great views of city from room and sky pool 
411960,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, bed was uncomfortable too much buissness people i was feeling like i am in a buissness meeting not in holydays, acces to the 15th floor where is gratis fruits cakes alcohol and drinks all included amazing 
411961,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Nothing at I would have preferred to have airport shuttle but it s not far from the airport so it not a major requirement , Everything there online photographs didn t do them justice It was way better than they advertised So all in all a pleasant surprise felt safe and comfortable 
411962,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There wasn t anything I didn t like, It was a overall excellent stay we had the jacuzzi suite which was amazing The staff were really helpfull throughout our stay and very welcoming Would stay st this hotel again
411963,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It was a little out of the way from the ramblas main centre but there is different transport to get there so it wasn t to bad , The hotel was amazing me and my partner stayed in the suite with the jacuzzi It was worth every penny Also with the suites you get free entry to the spa and gym You also get access to the 15th floor they provide free snacks and drinks 
411964,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Stayed in the hot tub suite with my partner for 2 nights celebrating our 2nd year together and had the best time No faults at all with the hotel especially for the price Weather topped it off
411965,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Occasionally there was a bad smell coming from the drains in the room Not very nice at all but I think it s very overall in Barcelona, The breakfast was excellent Beds were huge and the hot tub in our room was amazing
411966,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, That we can t live here full time , Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations The breakfast is the most varied I ve ever seen everything from a full English to champagne a chocolate fountain The facilities are never ending the staff sent me a free bottle of champagne up for my birthday Excellent hotel in every respect
411967,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, To turn lights on i had to use a keycard That is a factor behind i hit my head once sligthly in the dark bathroom , Till now normality wich is very rare inside and outside novadays 
411968,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, We went as a family with our 1 year old The room had a microwave included in it which was great for bottle sterilization It can be hard to find hotels that provide this in the room They had kids toys in the restaurant so during breakfast the little one was entertained they provided a very nice cot Very family friendly 
411969,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Unfortunately the hotel is a little bit out of the way but its only a 20 minute ride on the metro into the centre , The upgrade to include the spa access is totally worth it To our surprise it also included free snacks and drinks in the lounge WIN There was also a microwave in the room which you usually do not get 
411970,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The breakfast was a disgrace and we had a suite didn t realise breakfast wasn t included so we paid for it one of our 3 nights stay and we re so disappointed it was old dry food just awful so wouldn t recommend it for that one reason also we paid 36 euro for the pleasure , The hotel was lovely kept well and had great potential unfortunately we didn t get good weather to enjoy the outdoor poor but not to worry the rest was lovely
411971,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The breakfast is good but if you stay for a longer period then it gets a little monotonous but nevertheless there is enough variety, The hotel is very good well maintained very clean well situated and the staff is very helpful and efficient 
411972,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We had to change the rooms four times before we got a room which did not smell of smoke Not quite sure where the smell comes from past smoking rooms badly renovated or prior guests who have smoked or smell from street and or nearby power plant The furniture is quite worn for a four star hotel with very visible signs of past use The bathtub shower was difficult to use because there was basically no space to move If those things don t matter to you it s a very good and comparatively low priced options for the standard and location , The hotel is conveniently located in the modern beach side parts of Barcelona with a nice but small spa which costs extra It took quite some effort and time until we were given a decent room but then we enjoyed our stay very much 
411973,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The only issue for us that there wasn t any tea spoons and small plates in the room But were given when requested, Everything was spot on specially breakfast was amazing big choice of food for any taste Staff members r very friendly and helpful 
411974,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, In the first night the heating system wasn t working and our room had 14 C After I had been to reception 3 times asking for a solution or replacement of the room because our little daughter is 8 months and can get ill at 05 00AM somehow they found a room I m very sure it was available from evening but they weren t interested to put their head to find a solution no mater a small child was in the middle Totally disapointed We booked a double bed room and they gave us a twin bed room Even if we mentioned this was mandatory Also we requested an upper floor instead we received 2 nd floor In the day before our departure not the last day nobody cleaned our room or replaced the towels even if they were on the floor When I asked for clean towels I had to come down the second time to insist The reason was bad comunication But I paid for 4 service not 2 , The room was pretty spacious 
411975,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Quite bad reception service wrong information about restaurant forgotten shuttle booking generally quite uninterested with the customer needs Very expensive breakfast and bar, Fixed the broken AC the same day big room big bed microwave in the room quiet neighborhood
411976,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Rude and arrogant attitude of some staff at reception who insisted on believing the digital number of computer instead of the feeling of customers The results showed a defect air conditioning , clean and well located Room is large enough as a triple room 
411977,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We struggled with way too much heat in the room for 3 days before they fixed it Also the satellite channels for the TV were in and out for 3 days , The hotel was located just a short walk to the metro and the tram and bus were right next door Easy access to anywhere in the city Great view of the sea and the city1
411978,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is perfect in every way Room with hot tub amazing Cleanliness on point Spa and executive lounge was an added touch which complimented the stay Great location near to a shopping mall with resturants etc a taxi into the centre was about 10 not bad 
411979,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Spa was closed at our stay We chose this hotel mainly for that , The rooms were big nice and clean The beds were very comfortable The food was very delicious 
411980,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, we missed a soda bottle opener in the room Also the toilet flush small one was not working Otherwise all ok , The view from the room was good So was the staff Very helpful Room was comfortable and clean The extra bed for the baby was also very good Overall worth the price paid 
411981,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Great hotel got free upgrade to lounge and spa Excellent service 24 7 The lounge was quiet and with a view of the sea a good place to hang out and relax Taxi and Tram just outside the door 
411982,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The only fault of the hotel is the nasty car park building next door Could not fault anything , Staff were extremely helpful hotel was beautiful excellent facilities Best breakfast great value for money Would recommend the hot tub suite 
411983,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The room is too dark the safety box is hard to use the towel looks not that clean Most important of all the wifi didn t work at all in the room and the staff insisted there were no problems , The bed is comfy 
411984,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Room service food bland and uninspiring , Spa area friendliness of staff easy access to tram bus and metro executive lounge and terrace Next door to shopping mall and beach 
411985,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Some of the staff at Front Desk do not speak English The wellness area is tiny and messy and not really clean Really not worth to book it with the room We booked a suite with spa and these do not have beach view so its not worth neither The breakfast buffet ihas a good selection if food but its also not really clean probably due to the mass of people having breakfast at the same time Finally better not to forget any items when leaving the hotel one month after our stay we are still waiting that the hotel returns the item we forgot in our room Lets hope , The location is fine good access to public transportation and beachside close too 
411986,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Closeness to the beach comfort and style of each room was very good excellent hotel to relax in and do nothing Location beside the subway station provided excellent transport link to city centre 
411987,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The layout of the room was more like an office Staff was not very friendly even when I spoke to them in Spanish Room was worn out and dirty , The Sunday brunch was excellent Hotel is close to the hop on hop off tour bus stop 
411988,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, my bag was stolen from the breakfast restaurant and there seems no to be the first time that happened in the hotel The staff had poor eye and not compensating the incident properly,No Positive
411989,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The only thing makes me uncomfortable was the room clean in the morning we already turned on the don t disturb light but the cleaner came so many times in the morning makes us couldn t sleep well , Everything good the room is clean and the bed comfortable The location is good too 
411990,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, the room was a falling apart a little things such as the sink and tray for soap was broken and could easily fall they ran out of adapters for travelers, food was great
411991,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Couldn t figure out the light switches Toilet ran when flushed float needs to be adjusted Wish hotel was closer to the town center but city travel was fairly easy conveniently located to trams buses metro , Staff was very nice and congenial The hotel appears to be still in a renovation stage i e some floors smelled musty doors were not all the same 
411992,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, When I checked out they said that I hadn t paid for the room when it had already been taken out of my account even when my bank confirmed this they said we needed to make a payment today So we had to pay for the room twice and wait for it to be refunded Staff members knocked on our door about 4 times for no reason , It had a great location was a beautiful hotel The beds were very comfortable there is a huge shopping mall right next to the hotel and a taxi bay and metro opposite the hotel 
411993,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Didnt like the setting of the room I hated the desk that took almost half the space room Food was ok but not like in pictures Swimming pool is not heated which was not good for the bad weather when I went in late October, Liked the location very much and the spa Also the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean 
411994,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We found it rather ironic that our view was of the building site next to the hotel although the glazing of the windows kept the noise to a minimum , We chose this hotel as it was within our budget and it was important for us to be near public transport links to get around the city This meant that we were located outside the city centre and tourist area to some degree but this did not impact negatively on our holiday Our room was impeccably clean very spacious and the facilities were perfect There was a safe which we believe to be essential when travelling free wifi was also important for us and having a microwave in addition to the mini bar was a nice bonus The walk in shower was great although a nonslip mat would have made it feel safer there was a separate toilet and bidet as well as complimentary toiletries and extras such as disposable razors were a nice addition The staff were friendly and helpful and indulged our attempts to communicate with them in Spanish with good humour and their English was a welcome relief when we struggled s little We only had bar snacks and chose not to use the restaurant as we wanted to sample the local eateries instead We visited in October so didn t use the swimming pool or open decking area but would have in perhaps slightly warmer weatheras it looked fabulous We would definitely stay here again if we visit Barcelona again

412008,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Had a problems with water at reception they promised to fix it but didn t Advertised swimming pool on top of the building in reality looks much less impressive view blocked by neighbour high buildings and it was not really possible to use it because at morning it was still closed and at evening already closed Too high costs of breakfasts , It is interesting location will never guess that Barcelona could be so modern and with such a high tech buildings if stay somewhere closer to center Big shopping center nearby with a lot of cafe restaurants opened till late night so you never have a problem where to get something to eat also you can get it in hotel directely Sea beach is quite close so if you like you can get there 2 times a day at mornings and evenings while day time is for city center 
412009,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Unfortunately the view isn t that great and the pool is much smaller than it looks on the pictures , Free room upgrade with free asccess to gym spa and executive lounge and a free welcome drink at the hotel bar Didn t expect it at all Sooo nice People working there very friendly and helpfull 
412010,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The breakfast with 20 euro per night and Person is a Little too expensive sorry but for this Price i booked a room without breakfast i never had to pay so much for a breakfast and i dont think that it is necessary to do that it is bad that there is a unfinsihed Building next to the Hotel and you have a view to that Building all the time Maybe some People dont want that i ignored it because it does not disturb that much but the view to this Building is not sooo beautiful But you can also see the sea and the beautiful streets an palmtrees so all together it is not such a big Problem , The Hotel is very modern and Looks good The rooftop pool is very nice and the view fantastic The Hotel ist next to a Metro Station so you can reach Rambla etc very easily The stuff is friendly the rooms are clean Nothing bad to say there The only strange Thing is that you Need to pay at the beginning of the staying not at the end of the staying They accept cash and Card i paid by cash The room includes everything you Need the view is great The hotel gym was great one of the best gyms i have ever seen in a Hotel 
412011,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We did not have the best experience Rooms were not cleaned properly staff were rather standoffish and unpleasant at times Definitely did not feel particularly welcomed and most definitely would not return We should have stayed in the Barcelona Princess across the road , We did appreciate the good location next door to a great shopping mall and right next to a metro stop that led straight into town

412015,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Bar food wasn t great for the price Went one night and was really disappointed No light switch for one of the lights in bedroom unless you took out key card So we had to pick between a dark room or air conditioning Door handle into bathroom came off and was never fixed If I went back to Barcelona I d probably go somewhere closer to the atmosphere but that s a personal preference , Loved the breakfast free champagne caters for everyone s taste thumbs up Metro and tram are very close to hotel so you can get in and out to the main attractions easily

412023,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The gym and the spa should really be 24 hours or have late hours Tourists are outside the whole day and really cannot be expected to come back by 9PM Hence if this were to be sorted out that would be great , The hotel was extremely futuristic from a design perspective and had very fancy electrical fittings The decor was nice the location was pretty central beside the large mall and close to the Big Bus bustop and the breakfast has to be the best one can offer at that price It was a massive spread and really value for money The staff were pretty helpful as well and there were loads of little convenience stores around to get basic necessities The view from the swimming pool on the top floor was marvellous and the entire takeaway from our 3 night stay at this hotel was positive

412029,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Despite booking otherwise when I arrived despite being a solo traveller and pre requesting a double bed I was given a twin room I was told this was essentially luck of the draw which isn t what I d expect when paying 4 prices and given the option to select double in the booking Location is also poor and the staff are unhelpful I wasted about 40 minutes stuck in a lift that didn t seem to want to take me anywhere else but the 7th floor and another half hour or so trying to work out how to turn the numerous lights in my bedroom ,No Positive
412030,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location is quite far from the centre but there s a sight seeing bus stop right in front so it wasn t too inconvenient, Excellent hotel The room was clean along with the bathroom There were 3 restaurants in the hotel which were all good The pool deck was quite nice and had a lovely view There s a shopping centre right in front as well which is quite good

412032,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, the spa was a little disappointing needs a refurb in my opinion sewage plant nearby so depending on wind direction there is occasionally a horrible smell around the pool area outside the hotel , the buffet breakfast is awesome nice swimming pool on the roof good size rooms 2 minute walk from a metro station and 5 min walk to the coast lovely terrace and bar 
412033,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Bad points The Location We found this hotel to be quite abit further out of the centre than its first may seem We had to get the Metro Underground into the centre each day which took about 15 20 mins including the walking The metro station is only 2 mins from hotel There is also a tram stop outside hotel but it does not direct to the centre for some reason Another bad point about this hotel is the derelict building next to it It looks like another hotel they started to build and gave up after putting up the concrete frame It s not small about 22 stores high and only a about 10 meters from the hotel Giving a lot of the rooms a view of a abandoned graffitied concrete building site Also the pool area is very small you ll find yourself walking into to an areas crammed with People and not a sun bed of chair in sight If you re lucky you might get one as someone leaves as we did Also the bar next to the pool serves limited drinks No daiquiris or cocktails by the pool , Good things The Hotel is nice and Modern The rooms are modern and comfortable The staff are quiet helpful and even upgraded our room to an executive room free of charge when we asked for a sea view Executive rooms allow free access to the Spa and the roof terrace bar you see in the photos Unfortunately if you do not have an upgraded room you cannot go to the roof top bar This is a shame as it is almost deserted up there So if you like an atmosphere it s definely not the place you d want to spend an evening But the views are amazing and it has a FREE help yourself bar Yes as much Beers wine and spirits as you want The Spa is fairly good for a hotel A lot of the reviews will tell you about a large mall very close to the hotel The food court is fantastic it s indoor and out door The outdoor part is really nice and there is an Italian restaurant there that is really really good You must go for dinner there if you stay here 
412034,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Broken shower head on the jacuzzi when your paying that kind of money you want quality , I liked the jacuzzi suite and the 15th lounge as you have free drinks and overall nice hotel

412037,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I slept really badly during the first night as I did not realize air conditioning was not automatically on and despite several light switches I could not turn one of the lights off I called to the reception the next evening and a member of staff came to show me how to use the electronic display it did not react to my finger tip but needed a nail or a sharp card to operate From there I could control air conditioning and one of the lights while all other lights could also be operated from traditional light switches Breakfast selection was rather poor on my first morning but much better on the two other mornings I stayed , The room was large it had a working desk a comfortable bed and a range of pillows to choose from Despite difficulties operating the air conditioning I can recommend the hotel as it also has good metro and tram connections to city center The pool on the top floor was small but nice with a good view The hotel is also circa 10 minute walk from the beach and next to the Natural History Museum and a large shopping center 
412038,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Rooms were slightly tacky plugs lose bathroom door handle broken in one of the rooms and curtain covering the glass panel between bedroom bathroom broken in one of the rooms Pool water cold, Main facilities were clean and ok like foyer bar Spa etc Good location in terms of Tram and Metro
412039,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Due to the location we had to travel for meals if we didn t want to eat at the hotel Supplies in the room were light on and we had to ask for extra tea bags all the time Terrible shampoo provided and the room servicing was not great We stayed for a week and the sheets did not get changed and the bed was poorly made In the dining room the staff were not good at clearing tables or replenishing stocks as the morning breakfast was happening , This location was perfect for our needs next to the convention centre and close to transport for sightseeing The hotel facilities were excellent The room was well appointed with a desk and plenty of space The variety at breakfast was excellent and everyone was very helpful

412044,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, reception staff not attentive spa staff unfriendly and not welcoming to guests spa in general way too hot despite guests complaining no improvement same for the gym i saw several guests complaining about the high temperatures without any action air condition does not work effectively so gym smell at times was really bad did not see any hotel manager unusual which might explain the customer service standards staff is not listening to requests or acting on it there is lack of staff in executive lounge swimming pool rarely saw a person in the executive lounge and if there was someone available they sat in front of the computer and did not attend to guests or clear any of the used plates glasses away staff arrived late for opening of the swimming pool guests waited over 30min despite several guests going down 17 floors with elevator to inform the reception where upon the reception feedback was that the pool was open hotel needs a more organized approach disappointing standard for a supposedly 4star would not re visit spa one of the worst spas visited frequent traveller , location provides at least limited sea city view unfortunately there are several high rise buildings that are obstructing the views restaurant staff was friendly and food of good standard
412045,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The front desk staff named Diana is excellent She is fast and gave a good orientation There is ice machine the corridor Great The hotel also has tea making in the room Is so nice to have a cup of tea and coffee in the room Unlike the hotel across the street 
412046,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location is a bit far off from the beach so unless you rent a car or travel by other means it can be annoying walking 15mins or so to reach the first beach The coolest beach are in my opiniln Bogatell Nuova Icaria and the first one after the Barcelona Casino also thats were majority of clubs are No shops on the beach so buy your slippers and beach swiming suit in advance also consider takkng s beach towel aswell unless you want to rent it for 5euros per day depending ln the beach you go this is nothing to do with the hotel but with the experince Be prepared to wait until 3 30 4pm to get into your room check in is very slow due to busy season and lack of more cleaning stuff I guess so if you get there early is nice to do something instead of waiting cuz you will Hotel location is far from any attraction or place of interest from Barcelona so bear that in mind If you smoke get 2 3 packs in advance especially on weekens the Tobacco shops are closed and the bar that have cigarette offer a small range of choice Nothing else enjoy your stay Barcelona is amazing, The location of the hotel is very good we rented a car and the hotel offered the parking at extra cost 18 euros day due to being booked through booking com otherwise if you go directly through their website is free On the plus side if you book through this website you get a big discount on the spa facilities You get a bar at the ground floor opened until 2am you have a pool on 17th floor and also if you book a suite you get access to the 15th floor vip terrace The rooms are very tidy and cleaned everyday Clean towels are provided daily also though it usually happens around 2 3pm If you arent planing to rent a car there is a 24hr taxi station just in front plus buses and trams as well have the station in front of the hotel Very nice stuff and helpfull although I imagine they have to put with a lot on a daily basis I would encourage you to book a bed and breakfast and no more then that Reason being the breakfast is fabulous with lots of food to chose from and is really worth it otherwise is 18euros per day Im very happy with my choice The waiters from the bar downstairs are great big thanks to Jordi one of them Try the Eclipse bar at the W Hotel the view from the 26th floor is amazing

412074,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Some of the staff are too arrogant and neither helpful nor available They gave us an itching smoke smelly room and blamed it on us even looking that we were travelling with a baby They woke us up by mistake at 4 30 am on the night we had the discussion about the smoky bedroom The automatic lights seem fancy but not working After complaining again in the morning things got slightly better Not a good experience at all and not even close for the money you pay for The restaurant was way too expensive for Barcelona prices and took long for them to explain me the final bill They could not tell what was coming from the bar and what from the restaurant No way this hotel can be voted as the best as they claim It was a definitely a bad experience , It is close to a good shopping center and relatively close to the beach 
412075,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, For the amount of money you paid you dont get the treatment you deserved The staff at the reception was rather stuck up and they dont smile Maybe is a spanish culture 15th floor lounge food is not constantly refreshed , Nice location near the beach and shopping centre Is fairly a new area and is very well kept

412079,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Unfortunately the girls on the desk were distracted and weren t very helpful when we arrived They told us the nearest beach was to be reached by going to Barcoleneta metro station and then walking from there We were very disappointed as we had looked forward to a walk by the sea and a swim This meant we spent all our time getting metros into the city for everything On the last day when I asked again about getting to the beach a different staff member told us it was a 10 minute walk We couldn t believe it That wrong information when we first arrived really had a bad impact on our visit We were also told there wasn t really anywhere to eat nearby which also wasn t true we discovered We also found that we could have walked along the beach into Barcelona which we would have loved to have done Please make sure that your staff know the local area and take the time to give good correct information On the whole though the staff were wonderful , Lovely bed and pillows Apart from the first members of staff we encountered the rest were wonderful and couldn t have been more helpful

412084,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Our room telephone didn t work and the staff didn t think to change our room to a different one after realizing this which meant any requests for room service meant I needed to leave my room and go downstairs to order All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful except for the host employee who worked in the executive lounge who seemed to hate her job and the guests of the hotel , I loved the room our jacuzzi was top of the line and the jet system was lovely The lounge was amazing with gorgeous voice views but 
412085,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I asked for a extra bed in the reservation and also when I arrived in the morning and the check in wasnt possible and when I came back with my 2 little boys 1 year and 3 years after a day out the bed wasnt there I asked for a late check out and i was able to have it in my fathers room so I moved me and my child there and then every 30 minutes a housekeeping was opening the door and then someone called from de recepcion saying that i have to leave the room imediatelly and i was bathing my child and I said that i asked for a late check out and they said it is ok for that room Some staff wasnt nice , I like the hotel and the room and the boys that work in the door and luggage were very nice

412099,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff often seemed flustered We arrived to a sea of people who s rooms were not yet ready despite it being after the 3pm allocated time The rooms could do with some form of makeover as they are very basic and it is very far out from the centre of Barcelona Saying this there is a tram service right outside a mall next door , The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were cleaned to a great standard every day

412104,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel overlooks a deralict building spoils the view The reception was very busy on arrival it took quite a while to check in They also should ask for payment for parking when checking out I put my ticket in the machine the charge was frightening There is a hotel rate which meant it was much less, They had a choice of pillows and the location was excellent
412105,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, No view to the sea The hotel is simply shielded by a new skyscraper making very hard to get to a room with sea view Although we ve asked weeks prior to reservation date for a higher floor room our request was not answered we got only the 4th floor , Very nice clean room flawless with touch screen with commands for temperature or light in the room

412110,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It is a typical business hotel confortable but the design could be more applealing, Simpathy of the staff we were there for the Primavera Sound Festival and they reserved the same room that we used in the past years Location for us it was perfect accross the street compared to the Primavera Sound Location
412111,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We had to queue at the reception for 2 hours and a half in order to check in At 17 05 some rooms were not ready whereas the check in time is at 15 No explanation nor apology was given at the time As I wanted complain to the manager I was told he would come in the following morning The receptionist then offered us a free breakfast The manager did not show up the following day so I had to call booking com and pay a penalty in order to check out Disgraceful and stressful experience Also the rooms are very old , The outdoor pool was nice

412116,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Whilst the staff were friendly they weren t very attentive the Executive lounge has gone downhill not stocked up and poorly managed cleanliness was poor for the duration of the stay in fact we actually cleaned up ourselves at one point Room was nice lifts were quick No wifi in executive lounge which is not good this has been a problem for years and still not rectified Management have clearly cut back on staffing and are neglecting this area and need to refocus attention if they want people to pay the uplift To be fair it is a nice hotel and we stay every year and will do again we just felt on this occasion it didn t meet up to our expectations and there usual good standards , Room was nice lifts were quick 
412117,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, No fresh orange juice available at breakfast , Its location very close to the Conference centre and to public transport In general staff friendly and helpful

412121,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, OK this is a very tiny point but if you use the screen controller for the lights aircon there doesn t seem to be a way to switch the screen off and it s rather bright at night To be honest though this is the only thing I can think of that I didn t like We ll be back next year , I love this hotel so much We come every year for the Primavera Sound festival and whilst the hotel is more expensive than we would normally accept we think it is worth every penny The staff are always excellent the pool terrace is one of the best I ve previously used other hotels in the city the rooms beautiful and the breakfast incredible

412125,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The part built structure next door which hasn t changed since last year It is an eyesore The service in the downstairs bar is a little slow as the staff have to serve a variety of areas both inside and outside , The proximity to the Forum for Primavera Sound The easy walk to the beach The outside seating areas on both the ground and 15th floors The staff as whole were very attentive and helpful especially the concierge who looks after the luggage The rooms are large enough not huge and well kitted out 
412126,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, No working computer in bedroom reported this on the first of 4 nights but never looked at Only one of the computers in the lounge worked Food in lounge stale as left out in warm area Door in room difficult to close reported this too and never fixed Last room to be cleaned apart from the last day It was only the last day we were given a kettle Asked for a high floor room on this site but was given a low floor although the view was still good I know the biggest problem is communication on my part If I spoke Spanish then these could have been resolved therefore I accept that , I loved the hot tub in my room although this came at a price I also loved the lounge and roof top sunbathing area Good drinks I love the location by the shopping centre Toiletries in room were great 
412127,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I didn t think this hotel offered good value for money you didn t get your bedlinen changed unless you request it or kettle and teaspoons only enough milk to make 1 coffee or tea per day and the toilet tissue was of very bad quality they might be saving themselves a few cents per day with that practice but it is irritating when you pay that sort of money for a hotel room The use of the spa facilities is not included but apparently this is common practice in spa hotels in Spain , Good location walking distance to the beach and excellent public transport to the centre of town Staff were friendly
412128,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I was disappointed to notice that the pool was tiny and too cold to swim in The access to many facilities well being area rooftop cafeteria etc was not included in the price and we only noticed on spot , The rooms were comfortable and clean The hotel is next to the beach and close to public transport 
412129,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Breakfast for vegetarians could have had some more variety , Bed was super comfortable as were the pillows Amazing cleanliness and facilities Fabulous spa and treatments 
412130,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We skipped breakfast as the hotel was charging an excessive 20 Euros per person but there was a good cafe just across the road Also location is quite far off from the centre so there really is no reason to stay all the way here unless you re attending a conference at the nearby conference centre That said the metro is a 3 minutes walk , Large room contemporary design clean and well maintained the beds were comfortable lots of lighting options theres an ice machine and a microwave in the room There is also a pool and a spa which we did not make use of We had a leak in the toilet and a plumber was sent straight away to fix the problem Staff was very attentive and kind Good cafe across the road near public transport and a huge shopping centre 
412131,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, A kettle in the room would have been better than a microwave to heat water for tea and coffee The microwave in my room did not heat the water and I had to request a kettle , The staff were very friendly and helpful

412133,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Nothing, Service was fantastic best breakfast ever including choc fountain and cava Location was perfect for beach and for avoiding the crowds of downtown Barcelona All terraces were beautiful Would love to stay there again 
412134,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hot food at breakfast wasn t hot and rather than putting a little food out often large quantities of food were put out so a lot of food had been on display for some time The abandoned construction site next door isn t very photogenic and spoils the view from the roof The lighting and controls in the rooms is a bit quirky and it would be much better to be able to set a temperature rather than settings 1 2 and AT which don t tell you anything, Very friendly and helpful staff and a good location The taxi rank across the road was incredibly useful for getting around without having to call for a taxi or wait
412135,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The customer service was poor and because we booked with booking com none of our requests were granted Unfortunately we were very unhappy with the service and I would not book with booking com again or with this hotel We were given double beds when we only wanted and requested twin beds last October , The food was good and the hotel was clean 
412136,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I didn t realise how far out it was but the transport links were good so it wasn t too bad, We arrived a little early to check in and our room wasn t quite ready we were asked to wait in the bar and were given a complimentary glass of cava and a snack while we waited excellent service and a great treat
412137,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Window with blind separating the bedroom and bathroom No kettle Would have liked breakfast included in the price , The rooms especially beds were lovely nice view of the pier
412138,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We wanted to have 3 people room with one queen size bed and one single bed We got room with 3 separate beds Hotel didnt want to give us another room Water stream in bathroom was very weak There was a lot of dust on the floor On bed instead of normal duvet we got blankets which is very strange for 4 stars hotel , Close to metro and to the sea
412139,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Despite one comment in my booking despite having double checked with the reception on my arrival they invoiced me the two rooms and paid them directly on my credit card whereas I asked 2 times that they had to be paid separately The people at the desk did no effort to correct the situation and did not excuse In addition the location is ugly around and I paid around 200 for a room that should not exceed 100 , No real good location 
412140,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The drain in our shower was broken The shower shampoo holder was broken Half of the fuses in our room were turned off The pillows we had were incredibly flat Our full bin was not emptied when the room was cleaned , The staff were helpful but not overly friendly 
412141,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Pool was small and not heated but presume this is warmer to use in the summer Our room was not ready to check in at 3pm was about 45 mins late but wasn t a major issue for us The hotel is next to a building in progress but this is a minor eyesore, Location 5 7mins walk to beach 2mins walk to shopping mall with lots of restaurants and kids play area opposite macdonalds outside 20 min cab from BCN airport 40 EUR 5min walk to yellow L4 Metro line which gets you into central Staff we found very friendly and helpful and spoke good English Rooms Pretty clean and modern comfortable beds D cor Nice bar area and outside space We didn t eat the breakfast or use the Spa but it looked very nice

412143,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The light in our bathroom toilet did not work No Duvet cover on our bed instead it was a blue blanket with a white sheet on top Which was strange Didnt like the colour scheme of our room the walls yellow and the ambience light was yellow to didnt like that Reception staff could be more accomodating when checking in no warm welcome what so ever the most helpful person we met was the guy who took our luggae to keep behind until check in at 3 30pm, Cleaners cleaned our room to good standard Huge mall near by Metro near by and also the beach was close by 
412144,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, TV in room spanish channels only for child No kettle only microwave Shower made a horrendous noise when hot Toilet drainage smell was disgusting in room No view road Derelict building next door eye sore No local nice restaurants nearby only fast food chains in shopping centre Outdoor pool not heated for children Food poor in hotel and expensive Drinks expensive in hotel Expect to use public transport to access all tourist hotspots from this hotel nothing close by nothing in walking distance No beach just pebble port nearby advertise beach 5 mins away you can t use Airport taxi 36 to hotel This hotel is more for business stop overs nothing more, Room clean Bedlinen plentiful and bed comfortable Spacious room Shopping centre close by Metro station close by Bar staff polite and courteous Door staff polite and courteous
412145,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff was amazing there was nothing too much trouble for them We had an early check in We just wanted to leave our bags behind us but the men at reception offered a ready room The receptionist young spanish guy with glasses unfortunately I can t remember his name was the best so far You have to know I working in a 5 star hotel in London but I wish I had his colleauge Just so naturally kind and polite His knowledge about guest service and about the city is highlighted The room is fully equipped the location is brilliant just 5 minutes walk from the beach Just hard to say negative about the hotel yeah the lift so many times just stopped to work wich was fixed within minutes so who cares Definitely will be my choice in autumn when I return back to the city
412146,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Rooftop pool not heated totally freezing which was disappointing Local metro station was out of long term action and two of the front desk staff gave us directions starting from there There s a clear window between bedroom bathroom not great when you re sharing a room with your teenage son , Good location if you like being away from the city centre fantastic shopping centre nearby and sea promenade Hotel is modern and room was a good size 
412147,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, That breakfast is not included in room price That the spa was not included in the room price That the only swimming pool was outdoors and not suitable for this time of year , The location was good The rooms are good and big and clean 
412148,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, When I d originally booked was sure I d booked the other Silken hotel further up Diagonal Ave , We upgraded our room to allow us access to the spa and 15th Lounge which was very much appreciated 
412149,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The room had coffee cups and supplies but no kettle Bizarrely there was a microwave instead The bathroom had a clear glass window through to the bedroom with a blind which did not fully cover the window and was not opaque Putting on the bathroom light illuminated the whole bedroom, Exceptional range of food in the breakfast buffet I also used the executive lounge which was comfortable with snacks and a good range of drinks 
412150,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Quite a distance from barcelona main attractions , Very clean and modern hotel with friendly staff A close walk to the metro big shopping centre and beach 
412151,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, They was over a hour late with checking me in was told would be early several times and finally checked in at 4pm no kettle in the hotel room and was told on website there is was told they only give selective rooms Booked a beauty treatment and that then run 20 mins late as one of the beautiticians was later turning up 5euros for milk which I found to much A massive abandoned car park with all graffiti over it right next to the hotel but doesn t say or show in pics False advertisement , The reception team was friendly and the rooms was lovely and clean
412152,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The outdoor pool was not heated and while being offered we couldn t use it the water was very cold Also the staff couldn t speak or understand English very well , Overall we enjoyed our stay there I would recommend it 
412153,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The young lady who served us at the spa was extremely rude and the bar food was disappointing, Beds were comfy and hotel was beautifully maintained Reception staff were really friendly and helpful 
412154,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There was tea and coffee but no kettle so make sure to take your own , Staff very friendly and helpful Was out of the city but metro just around the corner and we never waited more than 2 mins for a train Had dinner at the hotel on the 1st night and it was exquisite and very reasonable price Would definitely recommend and stay again ourselves 
412155,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, On the online reservation I specifically mentioned separate beds We came at 11AM and after your staff ask about the bed type we confirmed that we would like to have separate beds On 4PM when we finally could enter the room only matrimonial bed was available In addition it is very inconvenient to enter a room after 3PM You should be able to open the rooms at least from 12AM , Room is nice and equipment also Tea option for free is also excellent Support with bicycle rent is also very nice 
412156,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, It was a great stay Free welcome drinks and food we were not expecting The staff were happy to help out with things we had forgotten Will be back some time 
412157,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Instead of a microwave in the room we would have preferred a kettle, The room was very clean beds so comfy and very close to all the things we wanted to make our trip away amazing
412158,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The control panel for lights wouldn t turn off so kept us awake with the light the room was fairly grubby and the shower head wasn t attached properly When I complained we were moved to a different room for the second night but that didn t help in any way with the lack of sleep from the first night A sorry by way of bottle of wine free breakfast spa treatment or something along those lines would have gone a long way in making me think differently about the hotel This kind of typical customer service is expected in an American or British hotel and I think that a 4 star hotel in Spain should have more of an idea about relationship marketing ,No Positive
412159,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Booking com is more crap then the hotel I was shown a hot tub bed room at the point of sale on booking com website though was given completly poor quality basic room When i asked for the same room was told have to pay 3 x more Hence make sure you are not booking this hotel only because of an eye catching room picture shown on the booking com WE could not use the pool as it was cold we were told it never heats up until June The cleaner took my night cloths which i couldnt recover and no one could tell me where they were The place is too far from the town hence taxi is 15 trip to the town if you are landing at BCN airport its other end of the city hence 45 each trip Breakfast was good though 17pp very expensive I would never recomend using booking com and this hotel to anyone , Nothing to share
412160,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Well I arrived at 5 pm instead of 10 am due to the it took 12 hours to get because of being held up so I thought I d stay in the hotel that evening first impressions thought it was lovely I paid for executive suite for two people that might I had an accident in the spa area I dropped my towel but as I got up smashed my face into the the glass door I told the lady who worked there she just oh I went to room I was in a lot of pain I woke up bruised n swollen do I went to feel mar hospital for 5 hours from then on the problems started my shower was leaking on to the bathroom floor I had to get extra towels I reported 4 times it was put on paper along with only 1 of the 3 electrical points not working I had access to the lounge area most of the time the tv was not on as I could not get any English to every day I went to the reception to get information to see the sights etc actually made to gaudi a catherdral to be told I had to book on line o came back to be told someone would go to my room fix the problems I had reported 12 hours before again there are strange men wandering around using the facilities I asked many times that my accident should be written down then told the manager would mot be back till Monday the last two days I was in bed ill my room didn t get cleaned for two days I spent most of it in the lift up n down I ve never been so badly treated at a hotel it was the worst holiday I ve I for one was so relieved to get home it s ironic because there called friendly hotels I ve booked quite a few holidays with the last one in Brighton was terrible which I also complained to you about n heard nothing so very dissapointed will anyone even bother trying to correct this or get back to Miss Corin Wormald
412161,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Only the Executive rooms and the Suite with Hot Tub s have sea view the rest of the rooms are located on lower levels and therefore you will have either a nice view over the street or you will have a bad view to an ugly tall building So NO SEA VIEW for Deluxe rooms The rooms are absolutely NOT soundproof We could hear everything literally everything which were happening in the corridor our neighbors bathroom both beside and upper floor and so on So be aware that the sentence which they put in the hotel introduction is just a joke Rooms are NOT SOUNDPROOF The hotel is also a bit far from the city center and you have to put around 30 minutes by Tram Metro to reach the city center Beside these negative points the rest was good We a young couple came to Barcelona for relaxation We decided to pick this hotel which is one of the most expensive hotels in Barcelona according to Booking com because it offered Sea View Totally Soundproof rooms 15th floor lounge and you can imagine how much we pissed off once we got none of them The 15th floor lounge is not accessible for guests of the Deluxe rooms Only for guests of Executive rooms and Suite with Hot Tub The outside bar was completely closed during our stay , The room is bright well equipped clean and modern The stuff were friendly We had a tiny technical issue with the bathroom and the technician arrived and fixed it in less than 5 minutes There is a tram stop in front of the hotel The bathroom was also fully equipped and it was bright and clean as well

412164,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel is popular for business events travelers we wanted to extend our booking but could only add one more day Not a negative about the hotel but it does fill up , The location was perfect Steps away from the tram and Metro near a very large shopping mall close to a seaside promenade all the convenience but a little quieter than the core I would definitely choose this hotel for future visits to Barcelona 
412165,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The room was very spacious and very clean with beautiful view and the bathroom was very clean and tidy Very comfortable bed with extra pillow and blankets if required We had a most enjoyable stay and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone Bar and restaurant were very pleasant with the friendliest of staff also Good food good Craic good fun

412167,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Hmmmm close to none , Price and location Tucked away from the busy city center About 30 40 mins away from the city center on public transport Near a big commercial shopping center good for shopping and eating at this commercial center 
412168,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Location wasn t the best and surrounding views wasn t to good , Staff were extremely helpful and there service was impeccable The room was very comfortable The hot tub was lovely 
412169,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel was really nice and the bed room was very modern and spacious for that price you couldnt get any better Loved the staff they were friendly gave us free spa and free night club passes with free drink was awsome loved the garden layout enjoyd coming down to it in the evenings to relax and ejoy the view highly recomend it if i ws to go back it will definatly be the sb hotel again 
412170,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The evening bar food seemed to be made from frozen premade food It was ok but for the price it was not reflective of Spain , Nice comfortable rooms Polite professional staff 
412171,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I had to call the reception three times and ask for shower gel and a kettle they didn t wake me as I had required nobody offered to help me with my suitcases although there were 3 4 employees at the front desk and the girl from the reception who came down to the spa for help was rude to me , Its location it s a lovely area peacefull still full of hotels reastaurants and a shopping centre the museum is right opposite it s close to the sea cleanliness view from my room the spa and the restaurant delicious breakfast full of variety catering for all tastes and health needs 
412172,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Softer bathroom robes Standing in the shower was very slippery Not having a mirror in the bedroom , The executive lounge The pillows in the bedroom The spa The staffs friendliness and helpfulness Location of the hotel near the metro 
412173,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The cleanliness was not as i excepted we told the reception about a lot of foundation on the hairdryer and they promise to clean this but after we told them this it was still there so my daugther clean it by herslef We want to use the Spa area and before we want to use it we will check it out and ask about if we should bring towel from our room or if we will get some towel there but the girl in the spa reception was more interested in speaking with her colleague than her customer so after we have waited in nearly 15 min we skip our plans about using the spa area which was include in our room but without treatment of course I will think twice before i will chose this hotel again , The staff in the reception was nice friendly and helpfull The breakfast was great 
412174,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, I loved this hotel Location was perfect Hotel was fabulous with great rooms and views Very clean with high standards Facilities were great and staff were excellent very professional and friendly Both breakfast and dinner we had was delicious and very well presented Will definitely 100 come back to this hotel again without a doubt 
412175,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, If going for sight seeing this maybe too far out but has a tram outside the front door and metro round the corner both easy to use and therefore makes it a reasonable place to stay 45 minute walk along the seafront to places of interest which was very pleasant 
412176,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Transparent screen on bathroom Reported it to reception Staff on reception desk disputed that could see through bathroom screen Lighting system too complex , Comfortable beds Room cleaned every day 
412177,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, honestly can t think of anything we ll defiantly be coming back on our next holiday, One of the finest hotels that we have stayed in we would recommend it to all our friends A perfect place to stay in such a beautiful city ease of transport to from the hotel not to mention around the city was a major plus Thank you all again
412178,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, One of the perks we were told of before we arrived was free spa access but on arrival were told that was only for 1 day Our room description also said sea view but the view from our window wasn t great as it looked straight onto a big building and there was definitely no sea view ,No Positive
412179,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Closed rooftop bar early every night we were there even at 8pm 1 night when it states open til 11pm Some of staff not nice at all and said on arrival wanted to pay room in cash said be fine then 2 days after staying room key was blocked went down and they said payment by card wasn t working when already told wanted to pay in cash trying to charge by card and locking us out room to get our attention Many times had to go and have room key reset as not working in the lifts etc v annoying Restaurant in house very expensive Possible bed bugs bites after sleeping each night , Some of staff very friendly welcoming Suite with hot tub excellent and rooftop bar excellent views free bar a nice touch Location is fine if prepared to travel well connected tram stop and taxi rank outside and lots of buses but we rented car v cheap 
412180,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We ordered some food to the room which was very average but to be fair this was at 4am on New Years Day so i dont fault them for that at all , The place was fantastic We had the hot tub in our room and it was just fantastic all round The Staff were friendly and helpful Book this place 
412181,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Half shower door Also the hotel was about a 20 minute train ride from the major sites not a bad distance I just thought it was closer , Very advanced high tech hotel Could change lighting effects control temperature etc from wall remote 
412182,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Maybe a little bit too far from the Center , The cleanliness confort and attention of the reception staff Our time in the swimming pool of the roof top were moments to remember 
412183,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I think they should make the parking free for guests or at least make it free for guests that book a suite or executive room, The suite was great with a hot tub in the middle of the room The lounge on the 15th floor with the terrace with a great view and the spa not to forget 
412184,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Everything was perfect, Very modern and clean amazing breakfast Really nice area on the 15th floor with drinks and snacks for free Definitely recommended
412185,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, No kettle in hotel rooms The shower was a little hard to work and slightly faulty Wifi was poor and not available in our room Nice TV in the room however it had no Ariel for channels nor could it reach the Wifi , Jacuzzi sweet was brilliant nice decor very comfy bed and nice extras included Staff were friendly and helpful Location is good not central but close 10 00 taxi to most areas of interest Nice views on the 15th floor lounge Hotel bar had a great range of spirits including premium bottles Plenty free useful items including toiletries shoe shiner etc Room was well sound proofed and didn t hear any noise Close to local shopping mall and caf s
412186,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The deal w the breakfast buffet was a tricky part We did not expect to get charged for the meal It was supposed to be included in the promotion which was mainly the reason why I chose this hotel to begin with instead we had to pay 34 on top , It s located in such a convenient place Malls and local bars are within 10 min walk range Beach is right next to the venue
412187,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It was too cold heating did not work well and the llighting controls are conplicated Walls very thin you hear neighbours I also had to pay for a night I did not stay there I needed to leave earlier than originally planned ,No Positive
412188,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The location is quite far from the city center it takes 8 stops by subway about 25 mins to Pla a de la Catalunya , The building is modern and it has a lot of free space for rest Rooms are quite large and comfortable Furthermore the staff was always professional
412189,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, For me it was the worst hotel in a while It is run down obviously staff and management don t give it a good care Everything is shabby and falling apart , Nice reception area Good breakfast 
412190,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The air conditioner did not work well and our room was cold during nights , It was a very clean and quiet place with kind and helpful staff The tram station was in front of the hotel entrance and a big shopping center was queit near the hotel 
412191,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Temperature of the bathing water is difficult to adjust The bathing water is slow and weak When I stayed in this hotel last year the reception staff helped me to get a taxi to airport But this year the staff refused to get a taxi for me She asked us to get it ourselves outside the hotel In fact one of the staff had promised to help us the night before the check out day The staff should be more helpful to customers who do not speak Spanish because many taxi drivers do not speak English We wanted a taxi big enough for 4 people and 5 big luggages However we had some difficulty to make the taxi driver to understand us until a passer by came to help , Room is big and comfortable Breakfast is good 
412192,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Although tea coffee making facilities were announced in the room there was no kettle I assume the guests were supposed to boil water in microwave which is somewhat weird There were 3 tea bags only for one room no refill Tea mugs were good though I did not like the view to the construction site Fortunately construction is suspended and at least it did generate any noise , Conveniently located for my purposes I was attended an event at exhibition centre accross the road Tram stop metro station and shopping centre nearby The Forum district is not historic but nice 
412193,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We had trouble with our heating in the room it was eventually fixed We also had a leak from the sink in the bathroom The room had no kettle but when we asked we got one , It s a beautiful hotel but it s just outside the main city of Barcelona The staff were lovely too 
412194,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, A bit far from city centre to walk, Location is excellent close to metro meant we could travel to the airport by train 5min easy walk from barceloneta station to estatio de Franca easy trip into gothic quarter to Jaume 1 fantastic shopping centre across the road Lovely stylish hotel with lovely staff Would definitely stay there again
412195,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Drinks expensive at the bar cocktails and spirits breakfast expensive for what you get , Handy for metro quiet location nice rooms Friendly staff modern comfortable hotel 
412196,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We were there only two nights and were fortunate enough not to have any negative experience All went well Awesome all round , The facilities were excellent throughout from our room to the spa facilities and 15th floor lounge we had access to as part of our room rate The food was delicious and there was great variety to it The hotel does a collaboration with a tour company that offers City tours in electric cars which we did and found to be exceptional value for money 
412197,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Thought the bar prices were a little steep , The hotel lounge has an excellent atmosphere Staff are so friendly and helpful Especially cleaning staff Second time staying here and would love to return 
412198,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It is a little out of the way the tram and metro are close by but walking to old town is not really feasible Also it has a grim building site overlooking it Other than that the spa doesn t open before 10am , Clean smart modern great staff 
412199,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There was dirty underwear left in the top of the wardrobe, The room was gorgeous with the hot tub and use of the 15th floor bar lounge and spa facilities

412202,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Beds were uncomfortable Terrible smell outside hotel although this maybe down to work being done on the drains outside , Decent hotel with pool Rooms clean and a good size Staff very helpful 
412203,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The hotel was a bit far from the center , Staff were very helpful especially the manager who helped us with a problem we faced and which could have ruined our vacation 
412204,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I think they didn t change the filters of the jacuzzi as it wasn t very clean and the water smelled We wanted to dine at the restaurant but despite the prices were quite high we hadn t been attended at all as the responsible was busy talking with a friend on the phone We had access to the VIP lounge but unfortunately it closes very early just at 20h To be honest not very satisfied for the cost of the room and the service recieved , Commercial zone not far from the hotel with good restaurants Parking included fais SPA zone
412205,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, The room was amazing the hot tub in the room was fantastic Everywhere was clean and tidy and the staff were brilliant We really enjoyed the spa and the 15th floor lounge was amazing Would highly recommend this hotel 
412206,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Hotel tried to fob us off with a smaller room We checked in and they allocated a room and when we returned a few hours later they had changed the original room It was much smaller and since we booked a triple room it was no good Happily we complained and got a better room But it was annoying, Quite location air conditioning and clean rooms
412207,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup,No Negative, Almost everything beds bar rooms were wonderful Mumms champagne at 44 a bottle a fab time just couldn t reccomend the restaurant new chef obviously didn t have a clue how to cook steaks 
412208,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We got approached by people asking us for money on the first evening we arrived back at hotel early evening Made us feel quite unsafe certainly wouldn t want to get to the hotel late in the evening Also it did feel a bit like people who booked directly with the hotel rather than through a book site were given preferential treatment I would have booked through the hotel but it was alot more expensive Our view from our hotel room was basically straight on to a building site We were out and about alot so not too much of a problem for us but I can see some people would not be happy with this , The spa was lovely after a busy sightseeing day It was nice to have a good shopping mall close at hand Breakfast was great too but you had to pay extra for this Female reception staff were very helpful 
412209,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The wifi was a bit unstable and required frequent reconnection Some staff could have been more friendly The extra large bed was two singles put together which kept on separating through the night , The location of the hotel near the shopping centre was fantastic and the tube was just behind The bedroom and bathroom were large and impeccably clean Having a microwave oven was very useful although it would have been great to have a kettle as well The wifi was free and available throughout the hotel 
412210,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We arrived on an early flight and I had hoped to get an early check in before 3 00 but it was twenty past three before the room was ready , Jacuzzi bath in the room was luxurious and relaxing after a day s sight seeing Overall the room was lovely 
412211,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Shower bath as hard to navigate Breakfast expensive for small eaters , Easy to get to all locations Friendly helpful easy to understand staff We were able to check in early after 12 day cruise which made our lives easier 
412212,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The heavy door of the cupboard in the room was loose the door almost fell out the stainless steel soap holder in the shower was broken however both were repaired after reporting it to the reception , The waitress at the Hotel Bar was extremely professional she was fast always smiling and had empathy for the guests She deserves to be the employee of the month 
412213,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Pool was way too small and very cold They wanted to charge 90 for late checkout Shower did not work properly and had no temperature control Fixed shower curtain could not move so you got soaked turning on the shower The view out the window was of a defaced derelict building Not very attractive , Close to the metro to go into the city Bar staff were very friendly 
412214,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, booked a table at the restaurant Service was very poor My husband was first in and waiting for me to arrive and he didn t even get offered a drink My starter was wrong tried to tell a waiter so he asked if I was finished with it my main was basically baked beans and nobody even asked if we wanted a second drink I wouldn t have minded if they were busy but they were not, everything was amazing Especially Nat who works in the downstairs bar made our stay even better than it already was 
412215,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, View from rooftop from one side is of a construction site at the minute and the bar wasnt open at rooftop pool but this is understandable as our visit was off peak The pool was also slightly cold but these are small things which did not affect our overall experience , Although it is sightly out of the way from the city centre in the Forum part of the city 20 euro in a taxi The metro Tram and taxi rank are all within 30 seconds of the front entrance The Hop on hop off bus stop is also located close to the entrance Massive shopping centre short walking distance away with food and 3 floors of shops Staff are friendly hotel is clean and modern and the rooftop pool is accessible and was quiet when we visited October 
412216,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The queuing at reception for checking in we waited 30 minutes for attention not very good for a 4 star hotel The room had no soundproof at all we had very little sleep due to people banging around and flushing toilets it was awful The reception staff looked very untidy no ties shirts open scruffy I would not recommend this at all, Nothing
412217,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The only thing I would point out is parking It s advertised at 18 per day but you must pay this at reception when you leave not in the ticket machine by the car park We put our ticket in to pay and it came to 209 I managed to get card back and complained to reception who were well aware of this and only charged me the advertised amount Wish they would make it clearer as we nearly had a heart attack , Clean friendly and comfortable hotel We went for a bit of luxury and certainly felt pampered Well worth paying for a suite the jacuzzi in our room was amazing There was no kettle as other reviews have stated but I only had to ask at the bar and they gave me one for the room Location is a long way from Barcelona central but easily accessed by taxi or public transport With a huge shopping centre opposite hotel plenty of little bars along the street and the beach a 5 min walk away we didn t feel the need to go anywhere Great place for 4 5 days of pampering 15th floor lounge an unexpected bonus personally I found the spa clean and well enough equipped and the Staff were great 
412218,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Only instant coffee in the rooms and cream and sugar were not automatically refilled It is a good thing that there is Starbucks at the mall, Excellent location tramway is right across the hotel a few minutes walk from the shopping mall and less then 15 minute walk to the beach Very comfortable hotel and breakfast buffet is excellent
412219,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The trip was a combined birthday gift for my parents and I asked for the rooms to be on upper floors and with a nice view however we got accommodation only on the 4th floor with no views Not a big deal though , Location was great right next to the huge shopping centre and 10 mins walk from the beach Staff was super helpful and accommodating Facilities and outside bar
412220,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, I HATED THE STAFF VERY RUDE NOT POLITE Also in one of the days we saw the janitor was changing the bed sheet with other used ones from another room, The Location of the Hotel
412221,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff on check in we re incredibly rude We were told that as we had booked through Booking com they didn t receive the request for a double room a cot bed for our daughter and that it s up to us of we wanted to cancel as it doesn t cost them anything The swimming pool is small and it s not heated so it s not suitable for children The rooms and hallways sometimes smelt like someone had been smoking The unfinished abandoned construction site next door is a bit nasty but I guess that s not their fault , The breakfast was superb However if you didn t want to pay 10 pp pn you could always go to the supermarket or caf s in the shopping centre or near the metro station The rooms were nice but maintenance is a little slow We had a broken shower tray and doorstop not massive issues but when you have a one year old these things are hazards Gym is well equipped and always seemed empty Although you have to pay extra to use the spa Surely if you re a guest of the hotel then you should get full access The location is perfect Near the beach a large shopping centre with loads of restaurants and caf s on the terrace It s only a 1 min walk from the metro station where you can get to the centre of Barcelona in 15 mins That being said the Hilton and Marriott etc are equally as well located 
412222,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The spa lacked luxury although I did have a very good massage The room decor was depressing The shower broke and they products were similar to those you d find in a public toilet The corridors of the hotel smelled like an old peoples home Also I left a pair of sunglasses and swimming costume in there I know exactly where I had left them and when I can to retrieve they d gone We won t be coming back the room was naff It s a business hotel I get that but in this day and age you don t need a giant desk in the middle of the room , The breakfast was lovely 
412223,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There was no kiddy pool The pool was to deep for our daughter , We really Enjoyed our staying The hotel is clean it s about 7 MN walk from a huge shopping center with anything you may desire the rooms are very modern the hours of the gym are very flexible Oooh the breakfast buffet was excellent We as a family definitely recommend 
412224,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Complimentary stuff such as coffee should be increased and water bottle provided , Staff are helpful and motivated to go the extra mile to please customers
412225,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Everything was great but I would reccomend staying away from the cafe on the corner directly across the street I had to fight off bugs to keep them from eating my food while eating inside Also took a cab from the airport during rush hour and it was pretty steep Around 50 EUR Just a heads up , My room was very clean and comfortable There was a good desk and work space The bar and restaurant had great staff and quality The location wasn t perfect but definitley not bad There was a tram stop right in front of the hotel that could take you down to Port Olimpic which was where most tourist go There is a beach in walking distance from the hotel but it is kind of small 
412226,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, There was nothing we didn t like , Everything Great location near to metro and tram which take you all over the city Breakfast was good massive selection of food The cleanliness of the hotel room was superb Had a jacuzzi in our room which was awesome and we used everyday at least once Fab views from the room Would definitely stay here again
412227,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The bed was a bit hard like in many hotels I ve stayed in Airconditioning was a bit noisy , The hotel is beautifully situated near the beach and conference centre tram takes you right towards shopping centres and metro to the city centre Hotel looks luxurious and breakfast was great 
412228,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The steam room was out of order at the time but I understand it can t be helped if it breakdown Also the WIFI wasn t the greatest often disconnecting but we was still able to use it , Great service with staff the hotel was very clean and had great facilities such sad the lounge on the 15th and 16th floor The breakfast was always great and of good quality Really liked the gym also great facility with lots of good equipment 
412229,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, electricity cable in the bathroom not protected scary not finished building second tower of the hotel making unpleasant views, very tasty breakfast comfy bed large room very close to the metro station
412230,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, poor administration every morning I had to argue with the expensive breakfasts Payment is made upon arrival a security deposit , abundant breakfast wellness room wifi 
412231,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, View to the construction site Flowing sewage from uppe floors is very loud They should clean the heirdryers because they are clogged , Closeliness to the beaches good public transport 
412232,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, We did have a problem with some running water the first night but they moved us the next morning , Lovely stay again and very close to lots if stuff Staff very helpfully and friendly 
412233,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, the shower is quite difficult to control the system of light need a course the toilet system is leaking room 701 , The transportation was very accessible Easy for shopping 
412234,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, It was difficult for us to find restaurants in the local area that were reasonably priced and offered variety Unfortunately the hotels evening menu was also a disappointment I feel this hotel is more suitable for couples rather that families , Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were clean The large shopping mall directly opposite the hotel was great The beach isnt crowded
412235,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, Bathroom plumbing was an issue even after we changed our room Also it was hard to adjust the temperature the room was freezing most of the time, The staff are very helpful and extremely nice Close to different forms of transportation 
412236,Hotel SB Diagonal Zero Barcelona 4 Sup, The staff are so unresponsive whatever you ask them the answer is No We were given a room with faulty AC in the hot and humid Barcelona These kind of accidents are normal although it should have been checked before our check in After we reported they said we cannot fix it now and you can change your room but it took nearly 1 hour from midnight to 1 am for them to service the new room and to give us a new key which was frustrating Because you re tired and it is in am you ve paid almost 200 euros and you have to stand and wait in the hot room for an hour it was completely unreasonable to me that they didnt have any room available in the entire big hotel and the reception even did not say any one sorry to us After all I was given a bed with a live small cockroach on my bed sheet , the hotel is nice and beautiful and the room is comfortable
