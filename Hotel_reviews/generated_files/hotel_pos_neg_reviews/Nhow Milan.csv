492644,Nhow Milan, It s not that easy to reach the hotel by public transport The other negative thing is that I find some patch on the bedding and on the wall It wasn t that visible but it s not that professional from a 4 hotel Would be lovely if you could upgade the hotel with a rooftop pool I saw that there is a space for it , I loved the style of the hotel it s really a unique one and it s amazing The staff was also very polite and kind The room was really comfy the king size bed and the bathroom was also one of the best I ever had Spent only a night there but never forget so I only can say thank you

492646,Nhow Milan,No Negative, Andrea the receptionist has been very welcoming the staff was very nice to us and the hotel was just incredible We were very pleased and It was very interesting to visit the hotel and see all the piece of arts exposed We highly recommend the place 
492647,Nhow Milan, Expected a bit more froth Premium room But Junior Suite was a blast large comfortable luxurious , We were offered an upgrade to the Junior Suite Very glad we took the offer for a little extra money we got a room twice the size of a normal room 2 walk in showers and a detached design bath Breakfast as great and varied as expected Staff was very helpful and polite 
492648,Nhow Milan, The rooms were very basic There should be more investment in the rooms themselves , The exterior is very appealing and it was nice to have a local museum cafe and pharmacy nearby 
492649,Nhow Milan, I had breakfast in the MUDEC bar for few Euro since the breakfast was not included in the room rate and the price was 23 Euro I also did not use the hotel parking but I used the street parking in front , The location is just in front of MUDEC museum where I visited an exitibition Around the hotel there are many streets with trendy or traditional restaurants like via Tortona or the Navigli and Darsena areas All is at walking distance The hotel is modern with many contemporary artist decorations The room was large and with a comfortable bed WIFi was working properly Staff was very nice 
492650,Nhow Milan, We didn t really have a view from our window but I think you can book a different room in order to get a nice view , Large and comfy bed in a nice modern room The staff is really friendly and helpful

492652,Nhow Milan, My room was disappointing Despite paying for the same room type as my friend for the same period she got a much bigger room with a queen bed separate bath and shower and dressing gown while I got a small double with a shower no bath and no dressing gown The bed was very hard and not comfortable The bathroom was extremely dimly lit so I couldn t see to put on makeup the only other mirrors was on the back of the front door and also dimly lit this was very frustrating The shower flooded all the way through to the bedroom on the first day but to their credit the hotel resolved this matter very quickly The air conditioning drove me insane even when switched off it made the worst throbbing noise which actually woke me up one night and it was torture The only way to stop the noise was to turn the AC on to the highest fan level so I could fall back asleep but in the freezing cold Finally the hotel is a 10 minute walk from Porta Genova the closest underground station in the June heat expect to be baked alive doing this walk It is also at least a 15 min walk toughg Navigli I got the impression that it was closer it really isn t Taxi situation can be frustrating as they have to be called very few just pass by especially as the hotel is set back from the road During peak times this can take a while , Breakfast the design and artwork featured in the hotel staff who were polite and efficient water in the room every day 
492653,Nhow Milan, , Really nice design very nice service including the Whatsapp service hotel staff paid a lot of attention very nice brunch comfortable rooms Yoga course with Adam was a nice highlight
492654,Nhow Milan, Their were no extra blankets and did get a bit cold The bathroom was very modern and had no doors curtain for showers which looked great but got a bit chilly Hard to get waiters attention at breakfast especially to get an ommelette made This was offered but not easy to actually get it , Clean rooms edgy and modern vibe comfortable bed and pillows Breakfast was huge and great selection

492665,Nhow Milan, Small signs of ware which could be fixed , I stayed at Nhow Milano few years ago and I was impressed by its eclectic design many art pieces and ambient atmosphere I was impressed by all those things for the second time Furthermore as my wife and I stayed longer this time we had an opportunity to experience more things including a really helpful staff rich variety of breakfast and chic neighborhood Via Tortona street where this hotel is located has evolved during recent years and now here you can find MUDEC gallery few good restaurants including Botanical next to Nhow temporal architectural installation by MINI 
492666,Nhow Milan, The room service takes an unexpectedly long amount of time and orders are often wrong , The staff were lovely and the beds so comfortable Nice big rooms and love the bath and open wardrobe facilities

492669,Nhow Milan, Nothing, Nice room complete with all the expected facilities and amenities Interesting concept and friendly staff Location is also good a short walk away from the nearest subway station and a host of bars and restaurants Brilliant breakfast We had a great and comfortable stay Overall good value for money 
492670,Nhow Milan,No Negative, Very comfortable huge bed Lovely dressing gowns and slipper provided The decor and exhibits are amazing I loved the free snacks served with our drink every night in the bar One of the funkiest hotels I ve ever stayed in and will definitely be back 
492671,Nhow Milan,No Negative, I travel a lot every few days different hotel and I have to say that NHOW HOTEL IN MILAN is one of the best I have ever visited I have spent there wonderful 5 days from 27 01 17 to 01 02 17 in room 459 Fabulous modern design great location close to the city center bicycles which you can rent delicious food but what is the most important PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER IS SMILING AND HELPFUL They create atmosphere of this place Receptionists who were flexible discussing about room price when I had to extend the reservation day by day The lady who was cleaning my room gave me her own bottle of water when I asked for one because she did not want me to wait The restaurant crew always kind Salwa and Monika who suprised me with goodbye present She knew that Jasmine Green Tea is my favourite so she prepared one for me when I was leaving I am honestly impressed THANK YOU Nhow Hotel crew for making my stay even better 
492672,Nhow Milan,No Negative, was the second time so we knew parking is good uncomplicated cause we needed an extra bed the second night my wish higher level was respected breakfast good choice

492675,Nhow Milan, Nothing It was a spot on experience , Really the most friendly personnel ever GREAT breakfast with lots of healthy options Nice room with all facilities that you need Wifi for free Nice arty atmosphere And best of all we got free tickets to a nearby museum when we told the reception we were going there 
492676,Nhow Milan, Not very clean specially for a 4 star hotel I also had a bug in the bathroom Probably because of the offer best deal in the city etc although we have payed over 120 eur night double room that was advertised on Booking site they gave us probably the most economic room without bathroom as you can see in the pictures , They let us check in earlyer No notificable problems
492677,Nhow Milan,No Negative, Staff nice and professional I asked for a champagne bottle while I was outside and they have been just fantastic Rooms Are big and clean and not noising at all Art expo in the floors amazing
492678,Nhow Milan, I expect from a 4 star hotel a good quality of service However very thin blanket rooms either very hot or very cold I ve been asking for an extra blanket but it was of poor quality room service staff hanging off the phone tea coffee glasses not replaced after use door of bathroom not closing well no conditionner and bath gels body creams poor quality the closet was missing more than half of the hangers when I entered the room , Design hotel with great and complete breakfast 
492679,Nhow Milan, Not as close to the Navigli area as it seems due to the closure of a footbridge but this is obviously not the hotel s fault , The bed was comfortable the room nicely decorated Good value for money 
492680,Nhow Milan, I honestly thought it was closer to the metro station it s a bit of a walk so need to take this into account if booking Breakfast not included in the price and kind of expensive so never bought it, Super clean very nice big room staff very helpful
492681,Nhow Milan, DJ for breakfast loud music Mosquitos in the room Loud aurcondition Too warm in general in the hotel seems like the heating could not be regulated , Modern design and architecture Interesting area of milan
492682,Nhow Milan, No problems with the hotel Actual locationinfo During our trip October 2016 the bridge between stazione Porta Genova and via tortona was closed Looked like it won t be reopened the next months So you need about 25min to Navigli 10min Tram line 14 is also a good option to the citycenter but not to Navigli , Very nice and stylish hotel in zona tortona near Navigli Nice designed rooms and very well integrated in an former industrial building 
492683,Nhow Milan, Not near any metro station Ordinarily not an issue but during fashion week taxis were sparse Not the hotel s fault though , Excellent gym spacious very well equipped with stuffed balls and kettle bells Enough for a cross fit workout Spacious rooms and passages Great selection at breakfast 
492684,Nhow Milan, The dark corridors are oppressive but that is just taste We loved the industrial feel of the place The bedroom had no view at all The location wouldn t have been so bad if the bridge from the Metro was open Navigli itself is a fantastic area you just need to walk 15 20 mins Plenty of fabulous eateries just round the corner too , The hotel itself is very uplifting with design artwork everywhere The breakfasts were fantastic with a wide range of healthy options The room was clean and offered everything you needed The staff were helpful and friendly 
492685,Nhow Milan,No Negative, First I want to thank this beautiful lady at the reception unfortunately I forget her name she was very nice and helpful good hotel professional staff clean tasty food everything was perfect my husband happy for my choice we will be back soon 
492686,Nhow Milan, The breakfast was not included and its a bit expensive The place is 900mt from metro station but 300mt from tram 30min to reach the Duomo , The place is great cool with an amazing design and rooms really big Its close to the trendy places good restaurants and Navigli town I really loved the stay there 
492687,Nhow Milan, Bikes had nearly flat tires no pump available Lifts smell really bad Take the stairs , Really liked the large bathroom and that the hotel was not noisy I like the thought of the free bikes when they are available and maintained 
492688,Nhow Milan, A bit noisy at night there was someone running around opening and closing doors in the early hours of the morning Sounded close by but with cork floors maybe the sound was coming from one of the other floors Also the hallways are a bit dark , short walk to the trendy Navigli area with bars cafes canals and metro but in quiet street Room was nice and spacious and lovely power shower Didn t eat there so can t comment on the food I would stay there again but ask for the top floor 
492689,Nhow Milan, There were large structural cracking sounds in ceiling beams which kept us up all night I am a builder BTW Texted owner about noise but never got back to us Gets quite hot upper bedroom Parking at rear but entry gate very tight small car suggested , Interesting conversion of old building with old paintings on ceilings Bathrooms were big functional and great presentation Meet and greet person very friendly and informative 
492690,Nhow Milan, We would stay again I would only ask for another room In room 130 the airconditioning is so positioned that it blows onto the otherwise comfortable bed Sadly we were not able to turn off or change the temperature on the aircon and I had arctic winds blowing at me all night It did not give me a comfortable nor restful sleep Maybe a few more comfortable seats in the hotel lounge would help too , We only had one night but it was our second stay We like the hotel very much it s easy and relaxed very comfortable especially the beds and the pillows are very very good My husband suffers from back problems and was worried he would find it difficult but woke up without any problem at all Full marks there One of the most important issues in any hotel Staff is exemplary friendly courteous and extremely helpful Brilliant 
492691,Nhow Milan, The passage is a bit darker And the fact that the restaurant was closed but nobody notified us in time so we had to wait in the bar for an hour The bartender tried his best to make sure that we get food , The bed was extra comfy The breakfast was good 
492692,Nhow Milan, A party with loud music was at night near the hotel we couldn t sleep But the receptionist was very nice and offered us a different room overlooking another street Hotel parking is too overpriced we parked our car outside on the public parking and it was twice cheaper Nhow seriously , It was our 2nd time at this hotel We really enjoy its contemporary art and style its unique design I love the Tortona and Porta Genova neighborhood it is young arty and hipster like but it takes about 15 min walking to get to the subway or any cafes There is a supermarket Esselunga in about 10 min walking and a bio market in about 5 min walking Breakfast is nice with a good choice of fresh fruit and brioches 
492693,Nhow Milan,No Negative, Hotel restaurant was great with complementary glass of Prosecco Good breakfast as well Can t fault the room and facilities Recommend Hotel Magna Pars for cocktails and food located 5 minutes walk away 
492694,Nhow Milan, I loved everything We did choose not to eat breakfast at the hotel based on the cost But I don t think that took away from anything I would definitely staY again , My husband and I stayed just one night to celebrate our anniversary and loved it The hotel staff upgraded our room for free and surprised us with a plate of delicious treats The location was good We were a 15min walk to the canal where we had a wonderful dinner If you like street art there is tons near the hotel The bed was so comfortable and rainfall shower was great 
492695,Nhow Milan,No Negative, One of the best hotel I ve ever seen And I ve seen kind of a thousand Great room excellent customer service good position just five minutes walk from Navigli It will be my hotel in Milan
492696,Nhow Milan, Maybe the metro station have to walk 600 meters , Beautiful modern Hotel Very surprising room A good service from a smiling team Will come back for sure 
492697,Nhow Milan, The building and concept of the hotel is cool but the hotel is not very functional I have got a double room The room was small The bed was small The bathroom had no doors Not a pleasent expertience , The building and concept of the hotel is cool 
492698,Nhow Milan,No Negative, I will definitely use this hotel again The without a staff were excellent Took care of all of our needs I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying In Milan better than a 5 star rating superb
492699,Nhow Milan, AC was non functioning window curtains were completely torn could not open window drain in both bathrub and sink did not work properly, location that is pretty much the only positive will not come back and will suggest to other not to sta here
492700,Nhow Milan,No Negative, The staff were very generous with us they upgraded the room that we were staying in without us asking They suggested that because they said the room that we first booked will be not spacious enough for the crib neither for our kid to roam around freely
492701,Nhow Milan, Everything was perfect I just feel that price is high for this specific type of property , The service was out standing The reception staff and the team serving in the restaurant were simply outstanding 
492702,Nhow Milan, It s bit far from city center And windows in rooms , Bathroom was cool decorated beds were confertable nice colourfull walls and staff was always there to help
492703,Nhow Milan, Nothing at all Breakfast may be included to booking com price It was 19 euro per person and extra for our staying , Lovely staff free parking design and spacious rooms Definitely recommend for business and leisure vacations in Milano if you are looking for the heart of entertainment Navigli 
492704,Nhow Milan, I really really loved it all faultless , We came for a 5 day break in Milan and the Nhow Hotel was fantastic Modern art on display in the foyer stylish rooms where little confectionery treats would appear after a day out the best breakfast in history served by 3 superb ladies Francesca Adellia and Monica and generally the friendliest welcome ever by the staff including the lovely Andrea in guest relations made this a wonderful stay Cool and chic but very welcoming I loved coming through the entrance hall with its amazing 100 metre screen of motion graphics Some hotels make you feel like you re a hindrance here they welcomed you like family 
492705,Nhow Milan,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with a very stylish design Very comfortable room with good facilities excellent breakfast choices very helpful and courteous staff Just a short walk away from Porta Genova Metro station ideal to explore the Navigli area Excellent value for money highly recommended 
492706,Nhow Milan, Did get some backache from the bed Water difficult to get the right temperature , In all it was a very nice experience The breakfast was really to my liking 
492707,Nhow Milan, I wish we had the foresight to include the breakfast in the room rate It was quite expensive on its own but was so good that I would have eaten there every morning if it hadn t been so pricey , The art everywhere was very cool and urban Clean and comfortable rooms and public areas 
492708,Nhow Milan, hot dishes at breakfast could do with more variety and better quality the hotel is located 15 min walk from the Navigli canal which is not very close , the decor and ambiance it feels like a art gallery the rooms are spacious and swanky
492709,Nhow Milan, Food was not the best But plenty near by specially if you walk towards canal its about 10 minute walk Past the train track and towards Naviglio Grande , Very trendy if you like contemporary style walls lighting furniture you ll really enjoy it but if you don t like that stuff you will be uncomfortable with the style I loved it 
492710,Nhow Milan, Unwelcoming staff in the reception and bar I felt like they just try to get rid of me when I was checking in The staff at breakfast was very kind and helpful Unfortunately the breakfast it self was not very good Selection ok but the quality was poor The facilit is not properly maintained The shower was not pleasant They charge 7 euros For a bottle of bier I normally don t pay attention to the minibar prices but after been charged the same in the bar I had to check Why 7 euros for a bottle This is Italy Not a country with alcohol prohibition Finally I believe it was not worth the 200 Euros a night , Bed was quite comfortable Interesting design of the hotel Location is nice 
492711,Nhow Milan, No idea how to make the shower work properly the rain shower couldn t be turned off Wish it was just a little bit closer to the metro station D, The rooms are wonderful the design eye catching and the breakfast superb Super clean 
492712,Nhow Milan, Silly design features like a tiny table and chair on a shelf a tthe window of the bedroom utterly useless A power outage during the night meant there was no hot water in the morning absolutely unacceptable in an expensive modern hotel Somewhere this large should have a backup generator No attempt was made to mitigate this problem or to offer an apology at check out When paying 300 euro a night I expect a lot better Room service was reasonably fast but expensive and the quality was poor ,No Positive
492713,Nhow Milan, To strict and more focusing in conferencearrangements that influenses the feeling , Nice modern arthotel with walkingdistance to the Navigli Ok also with parkingpossibilities 
492714,Nhow Milan, The dark grey of the immensely long corridors was depressing but gave me some sense of eternity The occasional bursts of orange provided some sense of hope but became tedious The masking fragrance of the corridors was foul , I liked leaving the hotel for walks and I loved checking out 
492715,Nhow Milan, Location was very cut off in feeling from the rest of the city great only if you were on business travel for nearby meetings Staff were not incredibly welcoming, Nice room Nice spaces
492716,Nhow Milan, I had to queue for a long time for check in out need to open more desks Staff were polite but not overly friendly I felt the hotel was lacking atmosphere and character , The breakfast was amazing 
492717,Nhow Milan,No Negative, The hotel is a beautiful gallery boutique hotel with art installation all over the hotel All staff was extremely helpful and friendly Francesca was a gem of a front desk agent So sweet and friendly Staff is genuinely happy to work there You can tell by the breakfast team happy to help and very hard workers We tip everyone They are awesome Breakfast was really all that you ca think fresh and continuously refilled Room was amazing Everything was super clean and new design Beautiful You are just few blocks from Navigli amazing night time a little hipster area with cute little stores and osterias cafes

492719,Nhow Milan, TV programs No English move Chantals No English news channels, I would like to see most some English move channels and more English news chandlers this is a must for such a nice hotel I would have likeed a bath tub in my bath room Some more vegetable at breakfast
492720,Nhow Milan, The AC did not work very well We tried calling the front desk on the first day because the room felt very warm but it didn t seem like whatever they did fixed the problem It was during summer time so a nice cool room would have been nice , The hotel itself was really cool modern and different 
492721,Nhow Milan, We arrived at Porta Genoa by metro Why did no one mention that to get to the hotel on foot you have to leave the station and cross the railway line using a very manky bridge At the bottom turn left and you are in the correct street Keep walking This piece of info would have saved us 20 minutes , Wonderful breakfast buffet Best buffet breakfast that we have ever had in an European hotel Hotel super trendy Coffee machine in room bottled water tea nice glasses Open plan bathroom very nice Near Navigli area 
492722,Nhow Milan, Nothing, I haven t been to such creative hotel It s just awesome I went to more than seven hotels in my tour in Europe all of them were disappointing but this hotel reimbursed me all the joy i lost Thumbs up
