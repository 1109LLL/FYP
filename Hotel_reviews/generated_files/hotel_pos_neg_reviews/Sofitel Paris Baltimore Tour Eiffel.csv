256760,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, There was no hot water for a shower when we first arrived We had cold showers The selection of teas and coffee to make in the room was mean For the price we were paying I would expect real coffee and the teas to include a normal everyday tea with milk , The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet The bathroom was very well equipped

256764,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The room could have been a little warmer as the heating did not appear to be working properly but the comfy bed made up for this , Brilliant location room was comfy and the staff were very friendly and accommodating

256766,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Room temperature super cold Asked for room dining service and had to call twice and ended up calling with my own phone Poor follow up of requests, Location and most of the staff

256768,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Did not offer any gesture of goodwill following an error made in our room allocations Kids room was located 4 floor up on the 6th floor Any one with kids would know this is a logistical nightmare ,No Positive
256769,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, We paid 355 euros and booked well in advance 3 weeks prevous a superior room with queen bed bath and they gave us a standard club double box room with just a shower tried their luck wonder how many other customers get treated like this as not everyone would realise I was disgusted to be defrauded by the staff who gave me the keys to the club double when I complained and refused to take the room they had given my room to someone else as their was no supreme room available so they had to stick us in the waiting room as all the rest of the hotel was fully booked I was now wasting valuable holiday time waiting around looking at other local hotels while they tried to find another room when they did they then realised that particular customer had rebooked a second night then they found us a suit but it needed cleaning which was a 2 hour wait we was supposed be checked in at 2pm and out by 2 30pm our day was completely destroyed by this only compensation was a drink from the bar while we waited till 4pm to be able to unpack our luggage and get changed I was totally embarrassed and humiliated by the hotels dishonest behaviour id warn people to take a tape measure and make sure that the room they pay for is actually the room cause I bet loads of people don t even realise this hotel is behaving in this manor,No Positive
256770,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Having to carry your luggage up the stairs to the lift not ideal Room service was ok but not great Front desk staff were helpful but only when prompted in relation to hotel facilities or local cuisines but still very friendly , Great place and great value for money especially from Paris The location is amazing walk to the left and you have Arc de triumph walk to the right and you have the Eiffel Tower restaurants cafes and ATMs Truely could not have asked for a better location 
256771,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Both rooms very small even though I reserved and paid for an upgrade for one the room was still very small little different from the small standard room, Helpful staff good breakfast attractive decor and good location 
256772,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The hotel pre authorized my card upon checkout i paid in cash After i left the hotel i called the credit card company they let me know that the hotel had to un release the amount for it to go back in the card when i called the hotel the employee at the reception was so rude she didn t understand what i meant when i told her she needed to un release the amount so i told her send me an email that states i paid in cash the credit card company needed it she told me in 5 minutes i called more than 4 times no use no email After calling bookings com they helped me resolve the issue And the hotel employee sent me the email the next day Seriously why would she say that she will send me the email in 5 minutes and every time i called she kept saying yes yes in 5 minutes and even when I told her please let me speak to the manager she told me I am the manager Honestly it was really bad behavior from a manager 1 The reception staff were really bad 2 No place for the luggage 3 The toilet was separate from the sink and shower area I would have preferred it to be all in one place , Great location very close to the Champs lys es Supermarkets Restaurants Pharmacy s The tower Very comfortable bed Clean
256773,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, the hotel was being renovated This information was very important for my visit the occasion was my sons 21st birthday and a construction site did not fit the occasion ,No Positive
256774,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Rude staff that came in room unannounced late at night Followed by manager calling and telling me he is outaide after putting do not disturb sign Terrible misinformation from manager and staff on procedures and policies of hotel Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night with no explanation when called to ask Hair dryer did not work and magically did not speak English when a new one was requested , The ending
256775,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, renovations were taking place at the hotel We were not warned of this and it took the gloss off booking a 5 hotel for daughters 18th birthday , Location and staff
256776,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Small room but we are in Paris I didn t choose breakfast because it is usually expensive in hotels in Paris and you can choose from several nearby places that offer it Overall nothing really important to complain for , Excellent location and staff Great value for money Amazing matress
256777,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, None, This hotel has a class Stayed at Pullman before this so stressed there This hotel gave me a genuine comfort and service True 5 stars hotel Close walk to the tower and nice restaurant and shop around this property 
256778,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The Hotel booked a dinner on river boats but neglected to tell us there is a dress code we were turned away and not allowed to go on board it ruined our trip and evening ,No Positive
256779,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Unprofessional and aggressive front desk staff my room was noisy and dull you have to visit the front desk everyday to activate room key Be careful when you check out ask the staff to reverse the authorized amount of your credit card immediately after the actual charge is processed , Can t think of something I liked but maybe the breakfast 
256780,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, 1 On the day of my checkout I was heckled by your staff at the reception and asked to pay 74 Euros for using the mini bar I had specifically asked in very clear words the hotel Concierge Mathieu on 9th August about my full liability and if I was liable to pay anything additional other than the amount of 1940 Euros mentioned in my booking He very specifically mentioned that I had to pay City Tax extra and NOTHING ELSE apart from that Further for your information I DID NOT USE my mini bar and even had one of your room attendants empty it on the very first day so I could not have used the mini bar as being claimed by you I had to specifically give a written request to confirm from the room attendant that I had indeed had her empty the mini bar I have attached the written request here I have also attached the bill for the hotel stay and had it countersigned by the staff at the reception where his Cashier ID is also mentioned 2 I had to catch a flight that day and your hotel caused me aggravated mental harassment Further my sponsoring company had arranged for a bus from their seminar venue to take us back to the airport Due to my precious time being wasted by your staff I missed that bus and had to take a Cab to the airport which cost me around 95 Euros for which none other than YOUR HOTEL IS RESPONSIBLE This is when I had specifically asked your hotel staff the previous night to give me a receipt of the bill and clear my account as I would be leaving early morning But they told me that the formalities wont take more than 5 mins and would be done in the morning itself Even after requesting you I was delayed by your staff , What I did like has actually been clouded by the things which tormented me 
256781,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, we could have been notified of renovations prior to booking Not genuine 5 star service or hotel no turn down breakfast was poor and the level of the hotel was not a standard we expect of a Sofitel aligned 5 star property They completely missed our room service and turndown facilities are poor relocated three times prior to getting suitable room , the bed was comfortable 
256782,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Nothing, the service level was par excellence Every staff member provided the same level of service and it was indeed service with a smile and very professional yet it was personable 
256783,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Check in to find because I did not have the credit card I paid with the payment has to be reversed and another card used I thought this was a bit over the top as I had my passport as ID It meant I was up for currency exchange always not in my favour plus cc charges for three transactions But after dealing with that we discovered on going to our twin room that it was not a deluxe room as was booked no bath I had specifically booked and paid for a delux room for this reason The receptionist yes same one insisted they did not have delux twin rooms with bath until I showed her the room description on Booking info We were given a suite with no extra cost but would have to wait till the occupier checked out 8 00 pm we were getting into our room Mind you the suite was just a slightly bigger room with a couch in it but it did have a bath We were compensated with a drink voucher But the whole business put a really dark shadow over what was a long awaited much anticipated trip So be careful with checking what you book with what you get in this hotel , Lovely boutique hotel near the Eiffel Tower Has renovations going on to the restaurant while we were there but did not impact on us too much bit of noise Conveniently situated near a metro stop so handy to get about Mostly the staff were helpful and pleasant except for the disaster of a check in experience 
256784,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The room had a shower although we were hoping for the bath tub also the shower section was not isolated by additional door , The hotel is great beautiful historical building Our room was comfortable and had a balcony with a nice view of Paris Breakfast was quite good too 
256785,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, booked this hotel on the assumption that it had a gaurmet restaurant and parking facilities They at best twisted the truth I wasted 400 and lost my no claims bonus Typical Paris rip off , Thought we d have a bit of luxury after camping on the Vandee So booked a five star in Paris near Eiffel Fitted the bill well located etc Arrived to find that the advertised gourmet restaurant was closed for renervation and nearest so called near by parking was 1 2 mile away So parked on street and car got broke into 
256786,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The small room was not very comfortable but the bed was pretty comfortable They did not seem very interested in pleasing their guests , The location is good 
256787,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Breakfast should be much cheaper , Good breakfast but way too expensive for what you get Put in wrong room per confirmation 1st night but then corrected and loved it 
256788,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Loved everything , The location was great and the hotel was great Everyone was nice and the service left nothing to be desired A travelers wish Thank you Baltimore Hotel They even allowed a late check out and stored our luggage while we roamed a bit more 
256789,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The management has a little disorder The staff for room service forgot to supplement the complimentary drinks someday However it s still very good , The location is perfect It s close to both Place de Charles De Gaulle l arc de triomphe and Trocad ro Tour Eiffel Just opposite to metro station and there is a Carrefour nearby The hotel style is a little old but still clean and full of French elegance The staff are all nice and kind
256790,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel,No Negative, I leave the hotel 2 days before for an urgent thing I was charged 2 additional nights i didn t consume I think it is catastrophic and abnormal for a client who books always in this hotel
256791,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, I thought the breakfast was very expensive I only wanted scrambled eggs however this cost 30 for the cooked breakfast option Included in this was many different meats as well as fruit cereal toast and pastries The express breakfast was 18 for pastries toast and juice While the variety was good I felt is was overpriced if you only wanted to have one or two things off the menu , The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating The location of the hotel was great 
256792,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Room service menu limited and can t understand why restaurant closes at the weekend, Amazing room with a view of the Eiffel Tower sort of Very well equipped and staff as helpful as you d expect in this class of hotel Metro station is two minutes away 
256793,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The bedroom could have more drawers and the bathroom needed a few shelves and possibly a heated towel rail The tired carpets need replacing , Most helpful friendly and obliging staff crisp clean uncluttered decor nice bedrooms and excellent breakfast 
256794,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The rain on our last day But that s not the hotel s fault , Everything The location was brilliant The room was amazing The staff were superb I can not fault the hotel or staff at all 
256795,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, We stayed at first floor at first night and woke up at 3 am in the night with a horrible vibration sound in the room They said it was air condition but it was switched off Anyway they offered to switch the room so we moved to a different room in the midnight The sound was still on but less than the other room They upraded our room in the second day to second floor which was ok , The staff was extremly helpful and problem solving 
256796,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Gym could be better and more equipped , 1 Very comfortable room Well maintained and clean Quiet without any disturbance 2 Friendly staff willing to go the extra mile we asked for a late check out which was accommodated instantly 3 Good location with a metro station close by 2 mins walk and lot of multi cultural eating places 2 of Paris s leading attraction is walking distance Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triumph 
256797,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The restaurant and room service are not open on weekends except for breakfast However lots of good places within an easy walk , Very friendly and helpful staff Dinner was great very good breakfast 
256798,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, No restaurant at the weekend which also meant limited choice for room service, The staff were great couldn t have been more helpful Breakfast fabulous 
256799,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, No English tea bags in the room Room quite small and this was a surprise as we had been upgraded Restaurant very over priced We thought the meal was good but not that special , Central location and a frequent bus service outside hotel Near metro too We got a good deal with this hotel which included breakfast good job too as it was over priced Staff were friendly and helpful 
256800,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Cocktails at the bar were overpriced and the quality depended on the barman , Friendly staff and excellent customer service Perfect location and delicious breakfast 
256801,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, gym was extremely hot and practically not usable mattress quality was poor , excellent location yet extremely quiet at night excellent breakfast very friendly staff 
256802,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, very old tatty carpets in room curtains also tatty general in room maintenance not top notch , friendly staff good bar very well run check in desk
256803,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Little disappointed that the hotel rooms do not cater for shelves or cupboards to unload your clothing The rooms are tiny to begin with so would have been nice to not have to live out of a suitcase for 8 days , We liked the location The hotel was close to metro and bus lines Laundromat and 24 hour mini mart within close proximity 
256804,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The gym was very limited and the was too hot , The staff were excellent and went out of their way to assist The buffet breakfast was also very good 
256805,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, We arrived on a Saturday unbelievably the restaurant wasn t open and worse still room service menu was unavailable and only limited snacks served We were on stopover on our way back to Australia and were too tired to eat out So while we loved the hotel the rooms the staff and the location next time we would probably choose somewhere that at least provided room service , Staff were wonderful gracious polite helpful nothing was too much trouble Room was very comfortable with perfect beds towels etc loved the sitting areas within the hotel 
256806,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Nothing everything was great , Although a small boutique type hotel the decor was elegant and classy Bed very comfortable and the staff are helpful and courteous Lovely complimentary breakfast Close to Trocadero Eiffel Tower High end neighborhood 
256807,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, It sells itself as a 5 star hotel and it is not it is only the quality of a 4 star hotel and the pricing is for a 5 star hotel quite disappointed , The staff were very good
256808,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, I was staying at this hotel not for the first time and previous experiences were not bad Rooms are really small including Junior Suite even in comparison to traditionally small hotel rooms in Paris This time first of all they could not find a 2nd blanket That seemed as a joke in a 5 star hotel For such price they could manage to have a reserve one especially seen that the hotel was far from being full While asking to the reception if they could take a blanket from a non occupied room they said that someone could come and they cannot take blankets from other rooms Time was around midnight Come on there won t be a bus coming full of people at midnight and book all the remaining rooms This time we were staying one night at room 114 which is at the end of the 1st floor It has a view on the small side street named Leo Delibes It is quiet but starting from 6 30am in the morning on Saturday a truck blocked the street to load and unload stuff for the hotel needs This was done by trolleys that made lots of noise both on the street paving stone and inside the building as our room was located just above the service entry They finished at 8am Actually we could not sleep at all because of that Really bad experience unfortunately , Good location and a very nice area 
256809,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The noise the bins were emptied every morning of our stay at Silly O Clock obviously this is nothing to do with the Hotel which is why I have given a high score But due to lack of sleep we were tired throughout our trip , Location was good Breakfast was complimentary Hotel was clean and comfortable staff very helpful Would recommend and return if we could be given more quiet rooms 
256810,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, The bed is not well connected so as a couple we could not sleep very well , The staff are amazing friendly in oppsit of the majority workers at France hotels 
256811,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Our standard room was extremely small for 2 persons It is rather to sleep 1 night alone than 3 nights in 2 The bathroom is not comfortable enough You have no place to put your cosmetics , Everyone is very helpfull Perfect situation 
256812,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Although the actual breakfast food was lovely the breakfast experience was a shambles There was a huge queue the staff were stressed and therefore rude and snappy with guests , The location was excellent and the room was comfortable and clean 
256813,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, They were painting the passage walls in the floor we were sleeping, Nothing
256814,Sofitel Paris Baltimore Tour Eiffel, Staff not friendly at check in and check out, Location and the rooms
