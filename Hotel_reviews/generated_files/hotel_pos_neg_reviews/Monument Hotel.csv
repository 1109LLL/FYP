397532,Monument Hotel, Nothing, Beautiful furnished rooms and hotels amazing services free mini bar they didn t charge us for ordering twice baby milk so helpful with everything Classy hotel 
397533,Monument Hotel, The rooms as a bit small though cousy , The place were situated although the rooms are bit small And expensive as well maybe my arrival was during high season 
397534,Monument Hotel, Housekeeping were a little noisy and started a little too early 9am knock on the door they kind of let everything everyone else down , Incredible 5 star hotel located at the Paris end of Barcelona Staff were amazing the hotel was architecturally stunning the restaurant and lounge bar was magic I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a true 5 star stay in Barcelona 
397535,Monument Hotel, I didn t take more time to enjoy all you had to offer We were exploring morning to night, Loved the extra with slippers Loved the stars Mini bar included Shower was awesome Lighting was great in bathroom The bed and sheets were amazing and pillows
397536,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Loved the location Right in the middle of everything central The service was amazing too and the staff were very courteous All amenities were availabe in the room 
397537,Monument Hotel, Breakfast was not on par with breakfast in 5 European hotels No rooftop bar lounge , Good hotel excellent area classier than other part of Barcelona boutique amazing staff 
397538,Monument Hotel, Unfortunately could not dine at Larsarte as it was closed for the holiday and weekend Personally the hotel restaurant Oria was good but not outstanding in food quality and taste compared to other boutique hotels in the vicinity , Had a good sleep on the very comfortable bed with nice sheets and comfortable pillows Fantastic lighting system in the room and common spaces Very clean and spacious bathroom with sufficient and very good quality pure white towels and amenities Available and convenient power supply for americas and USB ports Excellent climate control system in the room where you do not feel and hear the air from vents The best toilet paper yes it does make a difference 
397539,Monument Hotel, I couldn t try their full side suite because it was all fully booked , This has to be one of the best hotels in all of Barcelona now Besides a great central location their excellent service started before my arrival with personal outreach from their dedicated MyMoExperience team headed by Enora Tilly The very helpful concierge team Alex Juan Alina all gave me wonderful assistances beyond my expectations from a small boutique hotel The property is beautifully done the room is well designed for business or pleasure travelers with high standards The housekeeping bell staff are very responsive to requests I had the pleasure to dine at their three Michelin Star Lasarte it was a memorable experience I look forward to my next stay at Monument soon 
397540,Monument Hotel, Not a thing because THEY thought of everything so we wouldn t need to , Our 2 night stay at Monument Hotel raised the bar we ve always used to measure 5 Star accommodations to a much higher level We have never felt more pampered nor have we ever received the incredible level of personalized service that we received at Monument from ANY other luxury hotel establishment It was a major highlight of our trip and we would recommend this hotel to any traveler business OR personal who expects just a bit more from their hotel experience The very worst you can do is to be satisfied and these days receiving even basic service is becoming rare enough 
397541,Monument Hotel, Finish the pool quickly , The personal service was impeccable Champagne in our room for my birthday compliments of the hotel staff very nice and unexpected 
397542,Monument Hotel,No Negative, I took a junior suite The whole service from phone confirmations to parking and washing my car was perfect Kind and flexible I felt very at home here the restaurant Oria is my secret tip for Barcelona Great food great value and knowledgeable staff I stay in lots of Hotels this is one of my favourites Because you will remember it 
397543,Monument Hotel, The only thing I am not too satisfied is about the breakfast It s not the buffet so you have less choice I feel like it does not have much Spain food And the food option is limited and is not that tasty I tried today Hope the hotel could improve it a bit , It s a really good hotel Great location for shopping and visiting Casa Milan Casa Batllo The room is really clean and comfortable I really like the design of the room They use Jo Malone as the washing tools which is one of my favourite brand And they have the Valmont spa which is also attractive to me The smell around the hotel is element Even though the price is a little bit high it definitively worth it for one of the 5 stars hotels in Barcelona It is the best hotel I ve stayed this time Besides the tall guy in front door who helps us to take the luggages is really nice and helpful I was great experience here and I definitively will choose this hotel for my next Barcelona trip 
397544,Monument Hotel, everything was more than excellent, I had an amazing stay the staff was extremely kind and helpful The services that they provide were of a very high standard as well as the room itself An amazing bathroom with two sinks and separate room for the wc and the shower Towels were extra clean and fresh There was a small but really nice gym at the 1 floor with high tech machines and a clean environment where they provide gym towels and water The breakfast was amazing delicious handmade bread one of the most tasteful omelettes i have ever eaten and of course the decoration of the plates was excellent Very satisfied from the hotel and the service as a whole 
397545,Monument Hotel, The room has a smell of leather everytime we came back to the hotel if the air conditioning was off The Tv doesn t allow to play videos from iPhones it can only connect to laptop , The room is much bigger than we thought the bed is very comfortable Quite a lot of free snacks and drinks Jo Malone shower gel shampoo lotion etc provided Overall it was a very nice experience
397546,Monument Hotel, nothing , this hotel is top class friendly staff great location very comfortable bed very clean and great for value we couldn t recommend highly enough we will visit Barcelona again and we will definitely stay there 
397547,Monument Hotel, The safety of the shower floor was quite dangerous very very slippery when wet possibly supply a non slip mat I think they would need to look into that ASAP, Food was excellent especially Lasarts 3 michelin restaurant wow The location was brilliant for reaching everywhere 
397548,Monument Hotel, The bed was a little too soft but when we told the staff they immediately tried to find a solution , The staff was exceptionally helpful and very friendly The hotel was immaculate and very well kept We would only stay here for our future visits to Barcelona 
397549,Monument Hotel, Nothing everything was perfect Except once we ate at the Oria restaurant which is btw very very good and I ordered a well done meat I m pregnant and they brought me the opposite But wasn t a problem They immediately cooked a new one So at the end was everything good , We liked the style of the hotel very much Our room Junior Suite was very very nice and also the bathroom with the cool bathtub We enjoyed our weekend without the kids although we think kids are welcome Spain in general For us for this kind of category of hotel is also important the smell Very pleasant smell at the entrance and of the rest of the hotel too WIFI top connection everywhere Location very good if you want to go for shopping A lot of shops around the hotel area Just perfect Staff super friendly 
397550,Monument Hotel, booked a suite but it was on ground floor with literally no view so was dark and unappealing to be fair they managed to find us a standard room higher up with balcony etc which was lovely breakfast was only until 1030 so we missed it both days bar is nice but not particularly lively being picky id say the wardrobe space was minimal and there was no bluetooth speaker in room , great location right in the heart of the shopping district and close to all the main tourist locations Staff very professional smart and friendly Very smart contemporary interior design within an elegant traditional building bathrooms very nice back of hotel very very quiet which is good nice little balcony to many rooms and doors allow ventilation 
397551,Monument Hotel, There is no business center If you need to print you must send an email to the concierge It invades your privacy Also if you are expecting a pool to be included in this luxurious boutique hotel don t The hotel does not have a pool Beware There is no value here You are going to pay for luxury , The junior suite rooms are highly accommodating spacious and comfortable Nothing has been spared The location of the hotel is terrific Easy to get around the city Tour buses city buses metros taxis and the train No car required unnecessary 
397552,Monument Hotel, Room very dusty all the time fine particles coming from AC grills Bathroom floor tiles age very poorly for a hotel that is almost new always looking unclean The plastic material covering the couch in the suite, The bed an pillows were excellent
397553,Monument Hotel,No Negative, We stayed at Monument hotel for 3 nights for our romantic weekend gateway Staying at Monument Hotel was a fantastic experience for me and my husband The building has been recently renovated as hotel and the interior design is luxurious cosmopolitan and sylish The location is just perfect walking distance to La Pedrera metro stations shopping many nice restaurants Hotel staff was friendly proactive professional and courteous They accommodate to every request in a genuinely kind way We also had dinner at hotel s 3 Michelin star restaurant La Sarte It was a faboulus experience with wonderful food and amazing service We look forward to going back to Barcelona and staying again at Monument I believe the new roof top terrace and pool will be great additions to already wonderful hotel 
397554,Monument Hotel, Chaotic service especially in the hotel restaurant where we had a nightmare experience and eventually left to eat elsewhere Do not disturb message completely ignored by the staff messages not forwarded even the managements own messages to us Considering all this quite overpriced , New hotel in great location comfy beds super bathroom 
397555,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Loved the concierge Fabian He was so knowledgeable and really took care of all of our restaurant and ticket reservation needs The staff was friendly and welcoming and it was very helpful that everyone spoke English very well The room was spacious and clean and if we asked for extra towels or new robes they brought them in minutes 
397556,Monument Hotel, We loved the hotel but unfortunately a plumbing issue meant we had to change rooms mid visit which wasn t especially convenient The temperature control on the beautiful rain shower was somewhat counter intuitive and hard to regulate , The front of house staff Concierge and Reception are this hotel s greatest asset From beginning to end they were friendly impeccably courteous accommodating and proactive It was such a pleasure to be genuinely welcomed back into the hotel after each outing and to know that every request would be met with charm and efficiency 
397557,Monument Hotel, During our stay we lost one bottle of perfume Keep your thing in your baggage even if you would normally keep your perfume beside your bed We informed the receptionist upon check out but they didnt contact me back to apologize A minor complaint though, Everything from the perfect location to the staff and top notch decor We loved the daily stocked mini bar D
397558,Monument Hotel, Although it is on the corner of Passa De Gracia it s not well enough know by name The main entrance is technically on Carrer De Mallorca worth knowing if you re trying to get their by taxi and have little Spanish, Perfect location for exploring Barcelona Literally a few minutes walk from La Pedrera AND Casa Batl 10 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya and the top end of Los Ramblas Metro station taxi rank on the doorstep 
397559,Monument Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was superb Staff were extremely friendly and attentive The room was top class and we were made to feel so welcome Would definitely return 
397560,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Our stay exceeded all our expectations from the very friendly and incredibly helpful staff to the very comfortable beds We rate our stay as one of the best hotels we have stayed in 
397561,Monument Hotel, We are not big breakfast eaters so a small breakfast at any nearby cafe was our choice, Exceptional service with a hotel with a great location Modern spacious rooms Exceptionally clean and well maintained
397562,Monument Hotel, The only downside was our room was located next to the lift which at times could be noisy , There is so much to like about this property The location is excellent and the perfect base from which to explore the city The hotel itself is stunning We booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a suite on arrival which was a nice touch The room itself was beautiful and the bathroom was a real highlight especially the free standing bath and very large monsoon shower Much bigger than the pictures would suggest The bed was very comfortable and the turn down service at night was a superb extra touch Particularly liked the food and drinks all free in the room except for alcohol which were topped up daily And the Jo Malone toiletries were incredible Sounds odd but the hotel is scented beautifully around the corridors and lobby which oozes a luxury feel every time you walk in 
397563,Monument Hotel, Bathroom could be more comfortable, Location is perfect stuff is professional Special thanks to Fabian Arroyo he is very knowledgeable and guided us throughout our stay 
397564,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Hotel has very small gym and spa facility gym can hardly accommodate 2 person at a time Spa experience was good Breakfast is so so not worse the charged amount The room itself is great I really appreciated warmed up floors in bathrooms and some free snacks in the minibar I definitely will be back Forgot to add staff is very helpfull and positive thank you 
397565,Monument Hotel, The bed s were very small and narrow as were the room s The Spa is ridiculously small the steam room sits only 3 people and the sauna a maximum of 4 6 The only spa shower is also very small and was broken and the whole spa area is limited to a very tiny space without any relaxation area The rates of this hotel are way over the top for the facilities it offers , The staff are very welcoming and were all very helpful and very friendly The reception very kindly gave us a free upgrade when they saw how disappointed we were with our original room and room service kindly gave us a plain yoghurt we had ordered with our coffee for free 
397566,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Everything exceptional service went above and beyond to make our stay for my partners 30th extra special Hotel food was amazing Hotel is top 5 highly recommend and we WILL be back Perfect 
397567,Monument Hotel, Size of suite, The stuff are exceptional from the reception hajjar and Marie From the concierge Alex very helpful and kind he adds value to the hotel also the rest of concierge stuff The cleanness as well
397568,Monument Hotel, Shame there is no pool , Staff were excellent in every way Bed and bathroom exquisite Amazing cocktails and a lovely complimentary bottle of cava for my husband s birthday 
397569,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Really appreciated that hotel found our wallet left in the room after check out even we hadn t noticed by ourselves Also thanks a lot to the reception who helped our non English speaking grandpa smoothly check in one night before our arrival Great service everywhere in Monument Hotel 
397570,Monument Hotel, Can t complain about anything, Excellent staff friendly service modern amenities amazing rooms great location friendly staff always ready to help 5 star luxury without the price tag best stay ever 
397571,Monument Hotel, Room 310 appeared to be directly under a janitor s closet or similar There s very little noise insulation so it s incredibly loud it almost sounds like they re in the room with you and banging on things Minor little design issues like only having one hook to dry towels for two people Other towel racks are attractive but rather narrow for hanging towels Bed was quite soft uncomfortably so for me But all these are minor quibbles only the noise would stop me from coming back and I assume that other rooms are better , Staff was incredibly professional and helpful 
397572,Monument Hotel, The atmosphere at the breakfast area wasn t what you would usually expect dull lighting and no buffet setup and the Breakfast itself was average So make plans to eat out otherwise as mentioned staff were very friendly , Very clean very friendly and helpful staff nice location in the city Rooms were a little on the smaller side but the cleanliness and setup of the rooms made up for it 
397573,Monument Hotel, junior suite was small, Great location Very professional and friendly staff at reception and concierge Good room service Stylish contemporary decor

397577,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location for shopping the designer brands Away from the crowded touristy areas but close enough to walk The hotel is beautiful and the staff were always willing to go the extra mile to accommodate our needs Enjoyed every bit of our stay at the Monument This hotel is ideal for a short stay to explore Barcelona 
397578,Monument Hotel, We took a Suite room was nice and it was very small I mean very very small for classifying it as a suite , Very nice hotel great location and very nice and friendly staff 
397579,Monument Hotel, Sometimes neighboring guests can be noisy and loud where you can actually hear them in your room , Everything from the property itself location and kind friendly staff 
397580,Monument Hotel, Laundry was extraordinarily expensive I think we spent 170 Euro Socks and underwear were 5 Euro pair to clean , Rain shower and bathroom specifically were awesome Free non alcoholic drinks from the minibar were a nice touch They had a pillow menu Staff was unusually attentive to the point of remembering our names days after we checked in Pretty sure they also mailed some postcards for us without charging us for postage This was my favorite hotel on our trip 
397581,Monument Hotel, none, The service is top notched The staffs were much more polite and accommodating than the better known branded hotels The location is excellent We couldn t have asked for a better hotel with reasonable priced in its class Will definitely recommend to friends and family 
397582,Monument Hotel, Although I had booked bed and breakfast I needed to add a few euros per person every day to get a package that includes eggs The double bed rooms are spacious but some of them are converted into a suite Making the suite really small AC was a problem but was fixed , The breakfast and lounge areas is cool and chilled staff are fantastic and friendly Rooms and the hotel were clean Room service is great food is great Toiletries are all Jo Malone and really nice stuff Good attention to details with the deco light and materials used throughout the hotel Enjoyed every bit of it Hotel location is fantastic

397585,Monument Hotel, The breakfast although very good we would have preferred a buffet where we could have helped ourselves We felt obliged to eat what was served bad it was similar each day , The staff were amazing the room was lovely and immaculate and bed very comfy The location was perfect
397586,Monument Hotel, The cost is a little too high The hotel doesn t have a pool , The restaurant was out of this world The staff were among the most attentive we have ever come across The hotel was THE cleanest building you could ever hope to stay in The location is excellent 
397587,Monument Hotel, Space inside the rooms and the gym was smaller than expected Room Service had problems with extra wishes , Perfect breakfast Interior and design great staff in the restaurant and concierge free minibar great bathroom 
397588,Monument Hotel, Nothing, Amazing service Checked in with me before arrival Coming overseas so most appreciated Requested early check in and they got us in early which was SO appreciated as we flew all night and not much sleep Service was so good We had a city view suite with balcony Well worth the extra money Would stay here again Great location Food great too
397589,Monument Hotel, Rooms are not as big But comfortable, Very new and very clean in best location this is more upscale area with high end stores Hermes Rolex Gucci Celine etc It s only 3 blocks from the Ramblas and you can walk to most monuments 10 15 min
397590,Monument Hotel, Some features of the room and hotel served form more than function There was also some loud banging from upstairs when we stayed Breakfast options could also be better , the bed and pillows were the best thing about the hotel The reception staff were very helpful and personalised 
397591,Monument Hotel, Breakfast could have been better , I like every things if you reserve jonior suite I advise to get room in first floor because there is not any wall in the midlle of room and have good view of the street I like the room specially bathroom there is big clean and well design Bed is large and comfort Mini bar is well equipped Iwould like to thank MISS ENORA she was very helpfull And another thinks hotel located in best luxury street in barcelona 
397592,Monument Hotel, The dress cupboard is a tad small i would think but otherwise the room was spacious enough , I loved that there s a rain shower and hot bath also that the toiletries are jo malone one of my favourite The other thing is the fact that you can choose your pillow and the non alcoholic beverages in the mini bar are complimentary which was a very nice touch the breakfast is not a buffet but was very nice and at reception she was very good and helpful in sorting out my reservations
397593,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Everyone was super helpful Fabian did an amazing job with guiding us around this beautiful city Enrique was super informed too and bent over backwards for us Also the hotels location was spot on I ll definitely be coming back 
397594,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Listen to me you want to stay here I got a great deal with booking com almost 80 cheaper per night The best hotel I ve stayed at in my life Beyond exceptionally nice staff Excellent restaurant with an award winning 7 Michelin Chef We ordered the Chefs surprise menu 6 course meal Pillow menu Amazing steam shower Beyond exceptional amenities Beautiful hotel design and lobby Great location

397596,Monument Hotel, Not a dealbreaker but more Hooks in the Bathroom to hang Towels Robes etc , Top Notch Hotel in a fabulous location with Staff professionalism to match
397597,Monument Hotel, The sauna massage parlour is too cramped with no room to relax in and there could have been more hooks in the bathroom to hang wet towels etc , The location is perfect especially for Gaudi the staff are extremely helpful and the Oria restaurant is a hidden gem 
397598,Monument Hotel,No Negative, Almost everything The restaurant was fabulous The staff were very friendly and helpful My room was a junior suite and it was as expected Fantastic The mini bar was complementary which is absolutely great Location in the heart of Barcelona 
397599,Monument Hotel, Lack of external signage made finding it a challenge even for taxi driver Hotel is lost on a street of large signs , Staff very helpful and seemed interested in customer
397600,Monument Hotel, we booked a standard room and when we decided to extend we saw a good offer on booking for a suit with the same price and when we booked it they told us that the room we stayed in is a suite but no one told us we were upgraded in check in the suite was too small to be a suite, The hotel is new and it is perfect clean with EXCELLENT location with shopping and restaurants just outside the hotel My stay was excellent we even extended our stay Staff were very lovely as well
397601,Monument Hotel, The acoustic of the rooms is terrible and I kept on waking up during the night due to the noise on the hall and from other rooms Even when doors close you can hear a loud sound The pool was not ready I tried to make a reservation at the 2 Michelin star restaurant but it was surprisingly closed during the month of August which I found frustrating , Great location beautiful boutique hotel nice rooms comfortable bed very nice staff especially Israel and Cristina from the Auri restaurant but in general try were all very nice Great food Gym open 24 hours 
397602,Monument Hotel, Absolutely nothing , The location is excellent and the staff were absolutely outstanding First class from start to finish Couldn t recommend highly enough 
397603,Monument Hotel, Breakfast is diversified and good but a little expansive , Probably one of the best boutique hotels in Barcelona perfectly located amazing and modern decoration and good quality of service overall Personnel is very efficient and professional The junior suites giving to the patio side are very quite and this is really one of the best aspects of this hotel Rooms are not noisy at all even the air conditioning is not too loud which is very appreciated as that s usually an issue in most of the 5 hotels 
397604,Monument Hotel, That i didnt stay longer , Everything was perfect Staff was like family Accomadations were flawless Drinks at hotel bar were great Location of hotel was perfect 
397605,Monument Hotel, the balcony is not exactly a balcony it s a very tiny space with a dangerous design in my opinion especially for tall people I understand they can t change it but they probably should keep it closed , Very nice staff very clean rooms great location The hotel is perfect 
397606,Monument Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful but more than that the hotel staff couldn t do enough for you They made a us an itinerary that gave us so many sites to see We would definitely go back there 
397607,Monument Hotel, Room wonderful and had a suite as a free upgrade however very little natural light My advice stick with a room with a balcony Continental breakfast 25 Euro pp No terrace pool as advertised on some websites , Staff couldn t do enough Location perfect
