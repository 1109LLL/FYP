327202,Mercure Secession Wien, The tub shower in our room was awkward to get in and out of The glass protruded in an awkward way requiring a bit of gymnastics Hotel is in a great location but does require a tad more walking as it s just outside the Ringstrasse A fantastic location for anyone with solid walking feet highly recommended Also next to the nosh market which is ideal for grabbing breakfast it opens early as hotel breakfast was not included and was a bit pricey but very delicious , Very clean and comfortable and a fantastic price and location We really enjoyed staying there Highly recommended Staff were consistently helpful Be sure to see the wonderful Klimt frieze at the the Secession next door It s also close to the opera and many classic cafes Save at this hotel and splurge on opera tix 
327203,Mercure Secession Wien, The problem with the leak in the bathroom pipe at the washstand was crammed And it s strange that they did not pay attention to this during the daily cleaning room 405 It would be great if the room had a dressing gown and slippers , the bed is comfortable and large the room is bright enough is a good wi fi
327204,Mercure Secession Wien, Cant find anything bad to stay for its price it is what you would expert but with the bonus of helpful staff , I would just like to say the reception staff was one of the best and is one of the main reasons I would stay at this hotel again Sandra and her colleague were very welcoming helpful and always dealt with any of our questions enquiries in a very friendly professional manner The hotel is located near the market where you can find lots of places to eat and drink and a reasonable rate It is also near the Opera house and a small walk away from the city centre and train stations 
327205,Mercure Secession Wien,No Negative, Very good location close to the Opera and to Karls Platz Many nice places for a drink food nearby Quick check in check out Comfortable room 
327206,Mercure Secession Wien, The bathroom was a little om the small side but that is only a very small criticism I have, The property was very convenient for the old city everything was within walking distance Will certainly stay at this hotel again when we come back to Vienna
327207,Mercure Secession Wien, Can t really complain about anything it was pretty much as we had expected and worth paying a little extra than usual to be in such a good location, Excellent location for public transport and only a short walk to many of Vienna s tourist attractions such as the wonderful Naschmarkt and the Museums Quartier
327208,Mercure Secession Wien, We could hear people talking at the neighbor room they were not noisy thank God Always got worries because we travel with kid and she s not quiet one can imagine what time our neighbors might have when she cried , The best breakfast ever Very spasious apartment with lots of furniture Very friendly waiters at the breakfast room 
327209,Mercure Secession Wien, While the connection was OK the wifi bandwidth was painfully slow to the point of being useless , Large rooms with additional entrance area and kitchenette Well situated just minutes from the next metro station museums and shopping strip Good breakfast with an early opening time of 6 30 AM allowing an early meal before heading to the airport Will return 
327210,Mercure Secession Wien, Nobody cleans the coffee cups No help with the luggage, locattion polite stuff possibility for taxi to airport with fixed price not expensive late check out
327211,Mercure Secession Wien, We did not have breakfast way too expensive The value of money is not that good as i stayed in 4 hotels that were cheeper and looked better on the inside as in renovated but then again vienna is a very expensive city , The staff from the hotel is amazing They do a very good client service The location is excellent 50m from metro station Karlsplats and 10 min walk from all the touristic attractions Very clean sheets 
327212,Mercure Secession Wien, The wifi needs to be better It is just to slow and this is for a business traveler an essential part of a good hotel , It is a good business hotel concerning rooms and breakfast The staff gave me a really positive experience 
327213,Mercure Secession Wien, no complaints , did I mention great location 1 3 mins walking to the city s biggest market opera musem quarter Hofburg and one of the Klimt paintings my darling s favourite just accross the street in Secession house parking is not cheap 21 day but reasonable for the location we got parking in the garage accross the street because the hotel s garage was full for the same price kind and helpful staff clean stayed in a suite so got a small kithen no kitchenware really but a real coffee machine and also a kettle to boil the water to make a tea liked that breakfast good plenty of choice maybe not as luxurious as I would expect from 4 hotel but liked the price if it stays that way will stay here again 
327214,Mercure Secession Wien, Very old fashioned outdated Breakfast arrangement not great if not included in your booking My room was dirty Internet speeds match the age and quality of the decor From experience in Vienna I know one can do much better for the price , Location and size of the room Friendly and helpful staff
327215,Mercure Secession Wien, There is no ventilation in the bathroom and in the main room only a mechanical ventilation near the floor sic in the kitchen There is no towels warmer in the bathroom A cover over the tub leaks there was virtually impossible to take a shower without flooding the floor Kitchen utensils on request only very basic set of dishes Daily cleaning but very negligent Air conditioning preset on relatively high temperature it was impossible to set a lower temperature , Friendly staff and good location 
327216,Mercure Secession Wien, There is no slippers in the room , The location is great It s near the Wien Staatoper Musikverein and the Naschmarkt The staffs are also very friendly 
327217,Mercure Secession Wien, Furnitures are old The room view is terrible Small window and less sun shine in the room , Location is really good You can walk everywhere and transportation Bathroom is really good Stuffs are helpful

327219,Mercure Secession Wien, There was no hot water the second day we spent there with no explanation to the customers There was also no offer to compensate me for the cold shower I had to take , I liked the location Easy access to the town and train station 
327220,Mercure Secession Wien, WLAN keeps disconnecting log in required everytime you unlock your mobile device Cleaning staff came knocking every morning at 8 30 no learning curve Carpet floors throughout the building Safe did not work , Convenient location close to Karlsplatz 3 subway lines Naschmarkt many restaurants and the Opera Air condition air flow is not directed towards the bed Friendly staff at check in and check out
327221,Mercure Secession Wien, The room was slightly dark even with all light on It is not comfortable working on the laptop at night It also needed more power sources on the wall, The staff were very nice
327222,Mercure Secession Wien,No Negative, Very friendly helpful staff who all spoke fluent english The hotel is located just a short walk to the Opera House palaces and the other main tourist attractions of Vienna Nearby are taxi ranks and a local farmers market selling cheeses sausages and other local delicacies offering places where you can sit and have a coffee and crossiant or breakfast The suite family room was comfortable and air conditioned with fridge coffee maker kettle and a kitchenette for families with younger children Free wi fi I booked two months in advance and received a good advance booking rate For a main capital city in Europe right in the centre it was very reasonable and in a good location

327227,Mercure Secession Wien, The cafeteria was too crowded for a day or two , Excellent breakfast excellent location quiet the staff promised and provided a room with a balcony important for smokers 
327228,Mercure Secession Wien, I dislike the information sent by the hotel management on the date of our arrival at Vienna Austria We were sent to another Hotel Mercure Josefshof in Vienna which is located far away from the State Opera Building I ll inform this unhappy and non respectful behavior of the hotel management staff to the management of Accor Hotels , We stayed at this hotel few times in recent years as the location of the hotel is close to the State Opera Building where we visited some opera performances before It was easy to reach from the hotel to the State Opera Building by walking 
327229,Mercure Secession Wien, We had a junior suite with kitchenette Utensils were supplied only on request which was fine but comprised a pretty miserable minimal set , Location adjacent to Karlsplatz excellent for U Bahn travel and fairly handy for walking to centre Hotel is located on a busy road Getreidemarkt but our room at the back was quiet

327235,Mercure Secession Wien, Very expensive not value for money Staff not courteous Incredibly pathetic internet that will drive you crazy Two single beds very tiny difficult to sleep Rooms very noisy due to street noise Very difficult to sleep AC is very old and doesn t work properly , Location is the only good thing about this hotel
