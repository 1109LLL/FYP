448013,Hotel Am Schubertring, Although comfortable the beds were very bouncy , For 3 adults the room was spacious with room for 3 large suitcases Loved the opportunity to make tea and coffee and the convenience of having a fridge 
448014,Hotel Am Schubertring, Bed too soft bath towels old some has holes on it The hotel rooms are on the penthouse level window is high can t see the street below, Short walking distance to Opra House and museums plenty to see around
448015,Hotel Am Schubertring, They mention that there is a kitchen in the room but no pans and not allowed to cook Room for family very small no space to walk Very late checkin 16 00 early checkout at 11 00 and 10 euro per hour more if you want later checkout max till 14 00 hours costs 30 euro Small and old elevator small hallways not good if you are claustrophobic , Cleaness and location 
448016,Hotel Am Schubertring, We had two rooms One was very hot and the air conditioning could not cool off In the other room the frigobar did not work The breakfast was very bad In general the hotel is too expensive for the quality it provides I strongly do not reccomend , Location is the only positive aspect 
448017,Hotel Am Schubertring, Thier was a power issue during whole night as breaker trips after every few miniutes and all lights and ac goes off next day it was rectified , Very good location but receiption on ground floor open until 10 pm only rooms are on 5th floor 
448018,Hotel Am Schubertring, There was a bit too much light coming in from the window at night This may be a problem for people who like to sleep in a dark room But this is common in many hotels , The room was comfortable the mattress was also very comfortable The room was clean and cosy 
448019,Hotel Am Schubertring, This review is specific for classic room which we booked The room was very small and felt cramped There was water blockage in shower and it was so small you couldn t move properly The staff was always missing from reception desk and nobody picked up our calls We didn t enjoy our stay at the hotel The only good thing about the hotel is its location but then again that can be said about other hotels in the vicinity and chances are they will be far better than this on winter terms of facilities Avoid ,No Positive
448020,Hotel Am Schubertring, Some days the coffee mugs and spoons were left uncleaned probably forgotten we asked for exchanges for clean ones and they were delivered straight away , Staff were all really helpful and took their time to answer all our questions and gave us introduction to the area Room was comfortable and AC functioned perfectly Location was perfect within walking distance to all the museums restaurants and the main streets in the city centre There were some complimentary drinks for guests by the reception I enjoyed the masala tea Probably the best value for money in the same area 
448021,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, The hotel is well situated with the majority of main sites within a short walking distance Good coffee shop on the opposite side of the road Konzert Cafe Schwarzenberg for breakfast before sight seeing Hotel is fine if on a bit of budget clean comfy good staff just nothing fancy 
448022,Hotel Am Schubertring, We had three rooms two of which the AC hardly worked and it was very hot in Vienna on the last night one room was changed The AC system probably just needs a good service , The hotel was very well located walking distance to many attractions and ideal for three days in Vienna supermarket close by Staff were excellent transfer was seamless 
448023,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room at day time is so bright Cz of the curtain no complimantary water , Clean hotel comfortable walking distance to shopping district and to the train station 
448024,Hotel Am Schubertring, Two single beds side by side rather than a double bed The beds tended to slip away from each other , Wonderfully helpful staff at the front door Luggage storage was available which was very helpful for us Room was spacious and nicely decorated Located conveniently within a few minutes walking of the main shopping street restaurants and saint Stephen s cathedral 
448025,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, After we failed to checkin to another property we booked for our stay as we were running late and the property wasn t answering during their checkin hours we were left out on the street late in the evening We were desperately looking for a last minute shelter in Vienna that won t cost us a fortune I booked this property 10mins before checkin time and phoned them to let them know that we are on our way asked them to please wait for us They actually answered the phone unlike the previous property and waited for us unlike the previous property The receptionist was very nice and helpful we were very happy with the service

448028,Hotel Am Schubertring, The property advertised air conditioning as part of their amenities and room package The room was extremely hot each night even with the AC set on high The unit might need maintenance because the staff at the front desk checked it and lent me their fan , The property was in a very great location It would be a great place to stay during the cooler months of the year The staff were extremely friendly 
448029,Hotel Am Schubertring, The beds are a bit soft which is not great for backs But that seems to be pretty common for pension apartment like facilities in Europe Just wish they had firm bed mattresses there , The location is excellent I would stay there again if I go to Vienna The unit we had room 36 was great for a family of 4 because there is a kichtenette 
448030,Hotel Am Schubertring, Maid didn t clean cups or replenish tea bags sugar etc Advertised with a bar but bar never open , Location friendliness comfortable beds quiet Would stay there again Tea and coffee in room As we were late arrival the hotel texted me a number to put into the lock to get our room keys Very thoughtful as hotel was locked up at 10 30 
448031,Hotel Am Schubertring, We did have a problem with our shower overflowing but the staff was great and let us into another room to shower , We booked two non refundable rooms for ourselves and my husbands parents and then my father in law got very ill in Budapest and couldn t travel The staff were so understanding and let us reschedule the rooms for the next week when we had friends visiting I know they didn t have to do that so I was very appreciative

448035,Hotel Am Schubertring, The windows in some rooms are not opened Sometimes happen some problems with hot water The reception is closed from 22 till 6 30 And the entrance in hotel in this time is possible only with card key So if you loose your key on the street or if something else happens with this key just don t work you risk to spend your night on the street I don t know maybe receptionist is still in the hotel at night and he just has the right to sleep but this moment makes me afraid about the keys all the time I was out of hotel , Nice hotel in the centre of Vienna The location is perfect the staff is friendly rooms are cosy The possibility of late check out till 3 p m for 10 per hour 
448036,Hotel Am Schubertring, Sadly we had troubles with the hot water on the second day of our stay it was slightly warm , Our room was great Comfortable clean and beautiful amazing soft beds neat bathroom having a coffee machine in the room was convenient so we could make coffee and tea in our room As windows cannot be opened as written in the room description there s air conditioner that works pretty good so the temperature was absolutely ok The nearest subway station is few minutes walk from the hotel there re enough of cafes around to have a coffee or lunch and there re also a foodstore and a pharmacy across the street The staff is very friendly and gives all the information you need 
448037,Hotel Am Schubertring, If there s a mini kitchen in the room if would be nice to have some dishes and cutlery too Some items were neglected during housekeeping some days only bins were empties and everything else left untouched , Friendliness helpfulness of staff Cleanliness Mini kitchen in the room
448038,Hotel Am Schubertring, Because of the small size of the hotel there are no staff on duty between 10 30pm and 6am This is not a criticism and we have never had a problem though I sometimes wonder what we would do should a plumbing problem or some other need arise during the late hours , This was our third visit to this property twice for business and once for pleasure The hotel is centrally located to all parts of the old city and has tram and metro stops close by for easy connections to the train station and airport The facility has been updated is clean and works very well as a small hotel There are many charming restaurants and cafes an easy walk in the neighborhood The staff are exceedingly friendly and helpful with all customary requests and readily make suggestions for dining or touring We have not tried the breakfast as there are so many interesting coffee parlors in the immediate neighborhood 
448039,Hotel Am Schubertring, Hot water was temperamental , Great value awesome location and quiet rooms Right on the ring there are tram stops directly outside the hotel A great supermarket across the road We loved it Beds are super comfy Another plus is the small Fridge and tea coffee facilities 
448040,Hotel Am Schubertring, The shower is only a handheld not a huge deal but adding a hook would be a simple fix There s a Nespresso like coffee machine but they do charge 2 euro per pod Again due to the value of the room not a problem , Sweet pension right on Schubertring ten minute walk to Opera Albertina Spanish Riding School Tram to the Hauptbahnhof is one minute walk from hotel Lovely helpful staff who show you to your room help with directions and transportation and keep your bags if you want to explore a bit after check out Room was sizeable with opening window and A C Large bathroom and super comfy bed Very clean and very quiet

448043,Hotel Am Schubertring, It was tricky to turn off the radiator during the warm spell we had during March , The location of this hotel is fantastic It s very close to the Ritz Carlton which of course is much more expensive We picked it because of the proximity to the Musikverein David at the front desk was very helpful Our room was quite comfortable once we got the heat turned off 
448044,Hotel Am Schubertring, Stairs as an option to only ONE elevator Hotel rooms are on top floor , Friendly breakfast Additional cost free service like omelettes eggs and Prosecco Very good location close to the Opera Musikverein Homburg as well as close to excellent restaurants in the Annengasse
448045,Hotel Am Schubertring, Got really excited about Nespresso machine but there is a charge 2 per capsule only tea was free in the room Check in time from 16 00 is a bit late early check in was extra 10 per hour and not available on the spot , Staff were really nice room was quite big loved the pressure in the shower Location was superb 
448046,Hotel Am Schubertring, The water took ages to warm up and when it did it didn t last long and was never hot The spotlights in the bathroom were falling out of the ceiling and the hairdryer didn t work I did call reception who brought up another one and then they realised that actually the socket was broken No shampoo only some generic soap dispenser , Friendly staff large room and comfortable bed with plug sockets next to it 
448047,Hotel Am Schubertring, I was locked outside my room on my last night cz the key card lost its code somehow and it there was no reception from 10 30pm till 6 am and i tried calling the emergency number no one picked up My viennese friend tried and one of the other hotel guest tried no answer so i had to sleep in the lobby till 6 am while people r returning from outside late and i was charged for this night really this ruined my whole vacation specially tht i had yo pack and run to airport by 7 am , I was locked outside my room on my last night cz the key card lost its code somehow and it there was no reception from 10 30pm till 6 am and i tried calling the emergency number no one picked up My viennese friend tried and one of the other hotel guest tried no answer so i had to sleep in the lobby till 6 am while people r returning from outside late and i was charged for this night really this ruined my whole vacation specially tht i had yo pack and run to airport by 7 am 
448048,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, Good location close to the center and available parking in front of the hotel The hotel rooms are clean with comfortable bed It s been a last minute reservation and George from the Front Office has been very helpful welcoming us with a short and efficient check in late at night 
448049,Hotel Am Schubertring, None , Incredibly comfortable bed and very good location The room layout was unique and spacious The WiFi was quick and reliable and the personnel were very kind and helpful Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Vienna 
448050,Hotel Am Schubertring, The bed are not comfortable Going to my room is a maze I think the breakfast is expensive Not even serving a bacon and they don t refill the breakfast table quickly , I really like the location of the Hotel which is very near for tourist attractions and there are tram 100 meters from the hotel Staff are friendly and guide you with the transport system in Vienna 
448051,Hotel Am Schubertring, My 2 year old child was charged 8 euros for breakfast because she was there with us although she basically didn t eat and generally doesn t breakfast That was the only unfair bit but I didn t like about the hotel , The location is perfect Almost everything is within walking distance Lots of spots of interest and restaurants The concert hall is also nearby The room is small but comfortable and offers free capsule coffee Two metro stations and tram stations nearby A good choice

448057,Hotel Am Schubertring, No heating in the rooms Although the room itself was not too cold this is not acceptable for a 4 star hotel especially when it s snowing outside , Position comfort and kindness of staff 
448058,Hotel Am Schubertring, Our room was dirty and hadn t been cleaned Despite requests to staff and promises by them this was not remedied during our stay The rooms only had windows in the ceiling which you couldn t open , Excellent location for visiting Vienna
448059,Hotel Am Schubertring, The only negative I found a large bug crawling on my bed This was not the best thing to find so that was somewhat upsetting , We stayed for six nights and found the location great The staff was very nice in particular we liked David who was great He went the extra mile to make us feel welcome My luggage was lost for three days and the staff tried to help The beds were comfortable and the room we had was spacious and had a large bathroom 
448060,Hotel Am Schubertring, EN Some rooms don t have street view The minibar is not too rich for example there is only one beer bottle The folded out sofa blocks the closet doors The front desk is closed at night You can get inside the hotel but I cannot say if you can check in so if you arrive late ask about this Some electric sockets outlets did not work There was a problem with the hot water sometimes it took long to get warm sometimes it got cold after just one minute The shower is a bit small and the tub lies under the inclined roof you cannot stand in it RO Unele camere nu au vedere la strad Minibarul nu este prea plin numai o bere de exemplu Canapeaua extins blocheaz accesul la dulap Recep ia este nchis noaptea Se poate intra n hotel dar nu tiu dac se poate caza deci aten ie la ce or sosi i Unele prize nu func ionau Apa cald venea uneori greu sau se termina repede Du ul e cam nghesuit iar cada se afl sub partea nclinat a acoperi ului nu se poate sta n picioare n ea , EN Almost perfect location on Ring Street near Schwarzenbergplatz Transportation 5 minutes walk to Stadtpark subway station U4 to Schoenbrunn and Zoo as well as to Wien Mitte raiway station where airport trains arrive 7 minutes walk to Karlsplatz subway station U4 U2 to city hall Rathaus Schottentor tram to Grinzing Prater U1 to main railway station Wien Hauptbahnhof and Danube Just near the hotel tram stations tram 2 on the Ring to the Parliament tram D to Belvedere castle and gardens and Hauptbahnhof as well as to Museums Rathaus Schottentor Votivkirche Freud Museum and to north of the city tram 71 to Rathaus Taxi from the airport around 45 euros Sights 5 minutes walk to Opera Stadtpark iceskating rink concert hall Konzerthaus 10 minutes walk to Karlsplatz Belvedere 15 minutes walk to almost entire city centre Museumsquartier Food and drinks next to the hotel there is a TGI Fridays a McDonalds and a Billa supermarket across the street is a nice classical Vienna cafe with live music and jazz breakfast smoe weekends Cafe Schwarzenberg the oldest on the Ring with the original 19th century interior Breakfast is rich delicious and varied There are 3 or four hot dishes like eggs sausages vegetables there is salmon cheese selection including Brie fruits yoghurt also a blender where you can make your own smoothie choosing from various fruits The hotel rooms are all on the last floor of the building Almost all have street view Some the largest which you will get if you ask for extra bed have views to the atrium The extra bed is a 2 person fold out sofa but is very comfortable These larger rooms also have a small kitchenette consisting of a sink and an electric stove an electric kettle a Nespresso machine some cups and glasses and no other kitchenware There are teabags and coffe capsules The closet is large enough There are also enough electric outlets in the room 
448061,Hotel Am Schubertring, I thought everything was fantastic maybe the fact reception closed at 10pm but otherwise brilliant hotel would recommend to everyone staying in Vienna , The rooms and the beds were fantastic so comfy and the location was amazing so close to everything 
448062,Hotel Am Schubertring, My room did not even have a regular room There was a window on the ceiling which is impossible to open Very heavy smell inside the room and all corridor Old style furnature in room which is my least concern , I really liked the location of the hotel Located in a very central area Friendly staff Clean room 
448063,Hotel Am Schubertring, Unprofessional staff Our window was broken After 10 30 pm there was nobody at the front desk We almost freezed to death Next day they couldn t find a solution for us After quarrels they have fixed the window , Great location
448064,Hotel Am Schubertring, Liked everything , Great location staff were very helpful and friendly nothing was a problem the helpful man on reception even checked in our flights and printed our boarding passes for us in my opinion they went above and beyond for us 
448065,Hotel Am Schubertring, Cleaning lady misunderstood that she should not clean the room Bathroom sink was clogged and drained extremely slowly Breakfast too expensive , Excellent location nice reception hall 
448066,Hotel Am Schubertring, Nothing, Excellent location and the 2 receptionists were fantastic especially on sunday morning when the young lad was dealing with a rude customer he kept his cool and was very professional overall a great hotel and would stop again
448067,Hotel Am Schubertring, They didn t have our booking on their system and only one person on the desk who had to go away and take the lift to an office elsewhere to try and resolve the situation , Probably the most comfortable bed and pillow I have ever slept on in a hotel Large room clean 
448068,Hotel Am Schubertring, They should improve the cleaning service of the room Bathroom was full of long hairs in one corner The cups for the coffee were dirty, The location and very confy beds
448069,Hotel Am Schubertring, Nothing it was a great experince, Lovely Personell Super friendly and forthcomming Great suggestions of what to do an what to eat Great service and ambiance
448070,Hotel Am Schubertring, The lack of an on site person after 2230 hours is a bit concerning in case of some emergent need or early check out While not a problem during our stay there should be a clear policy of who to call should say plumbing break down or other unforeseen event occur Lack of a lobby bar prevents some refreshment after a long day out and would be nice to have on site , I had stayed here 5 years before so came back to see what has changed The location is perfect rooms nicely appointed beds comfortable and staff friendly and helpful Price was within budget 
448071,Hotel Am Schubertring, I ve booked a room with 2bedrooms yet they had a problem with it and did not inform me before And they changed it to a small room stuffed with an extra sofa bed what made it harder to walk by Beside there were bugs showing off even the windows wasn t open In the bathtube a spider showed off in the last day Their clean service wasn t that much just cleaning the bed no more to the floor Neither the bathroom they just dried it off , Nothing
448072,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room had just a window and was on the ceiling and was not possible to open it The shower was little and close to the ceiling i m 1 78cm and was challanging have a shower there also the water was not really warm Breakfast overpriced for the quality, The Hotel is close to the city center and the underground is closed
448073,Hotel Am Schubertring, We could not open the window in our room BIG disadvantage Please make a note on the website Heating was of but the heating pipe behind wall was ticking making noise , Superb location great coffee and very friendly Philippine lady in the restaurant Wonderful beds 
448074,Hotel Am Schubertring, When we got there in a cold rainy evening the heating wasn t working even blowing cold air and the door lock was broken basically the door was ajar whole time of your stay We asked to change our room they said they will do it in the next morning they didn t even when we reminded them And of course they forgot to make us the promised discount Oh it was room 20 , The location 
448075,Hotel Am Schubertring, The hotel was too hot during the night No windows that open Shower inadequate, Location very close to main attractions and the staff were very helpful
448076,Hotel Am Schubertring, There were some issues with the pipes The bathroom had no water for a long time and eahc 10minutes the staff were saying it will be fixed in 10 minutes ,No Positive
448077,Hotel Am Schubertring, To start with we booked standart room with table chair and stand lamp 20 m2 space When we entered the room we were surprised to see no table no chair but stand lamp was there Room is about 13 m2 We applied to the reception to change the room for one we booked but were told that the the hotel doesn t guarantee table and chair and space differs Please do not consider pictures on the web site They could not move us to any other room as all of them were ATTENTION booked since the next day What about us Our neibour room was not occupied and much bigger with all the promised amenities But it is not everything when we came to the room that same night our stand lamp disappeared We again at the reception desk where is our lamp We would never pay attention to the missing lamp but it was 1 of 2 only in the room no ceiling lighting Dark as in a rat hole We were told that some technical inspection unexpectedly took place and exactly our stand lamp was declared broken blah blah blah When we came from the city the next evening stand lamp and chair were provided PS The personnel count on location it definitely makes this hotel 5 star rate no service is needed This is disaster for the 4 star hotel in the heart of my favorite city I have been there for the hundredth time and never experienced anything like this before Would never recommend this hotel to anybody Poor Schubert He would cry on this , Location is just perfect 
448078,Hotel Am Schubertring, I had booked Studio but was given a superior room which was cheaper rental On my enquiry they accepted their mistake but said was not available now Even I was charged for studio but given a lower priced room For housekeeping we have to remind There seemed to be no communication between the morning shift and day shift officials on the requests made by us , Location of the hotel General behavior of staff 
448079,Hotel Am Schubertring, No kettle available Only a percolator for tea making facilities which was not ideal as the tea does not taste good when made through a percolator Not enough tea Also so I bought my own tea bags Only a small thing but important to tea drinkers who don t like coffee No view from our room as the room was in the attic but this didn t spoil the visit, Room was wonderfully quiet Clean Comfy And spacious Staff In particular one receptionist blonde young who we encountered for most of our stay Was very helpful and friendly courteous Hotel was really close to centre without being too busy Great location 
448080,Hotel Am Schubertring, It is not bad thing Just something you need to aware of Even it is next to Ritz Calton it is 20 mins walk from Metro and 30 mins walk or 4 mins tram of EUR2 3 each person EUR20 of taxi to OEBB train station , Staff is super super helpful The photos of the hotel on booking com is very accurate The property was renovated and newly reopened in May 2016 It is located next to tram station and next to Ritz Calton 
448081,Hotel Am Schubertring, very loud noise from a machine maybe air conditioner every 15 20min totally can not sleep at night and the problem can not be solved after complainants to the receiption ,No Positive
448082,Hotel Am Schubertring, The cleaning of the sink wasn t good I cleaned myself around the plug hole and taps and removed the dirt easily Walls could have been wiped down there had obviously been a spillage next to my bed of coffee tea but on the whole for the price it wasn t bad, Bed was very soft but surprisingly didn t aggravate my back air con worked well and wasn t too noisy the young girl with dark hair on reception was lovely extremely helpful replaced our kettle and brought extra tea etc when housekeeping had failed to do so
448083,Hotel Am Schubertring, As it was soffit attic the ceiling was quite short in one side of the room and especially in the bathroom shower So some caution is needed , The excellent price 90 Euros The big room The excellent wifi The free and quite good breakfast
448084,Hotel Am Schubertring, Mirrors were only inside the bathrooms I wish there was at least one long mirror in the room itself as well And the Wifi Connection was almost nonexistent in the room with 3 beds once we close the door between the rooms there will be no Wifi at all But in general the room was perfect , Amazing location the room was well furnished and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful 
448085,Hotel Am Schubertring, It s a good hotel but don t even think about having breakfast in there they ask for EUR 26 Not worth in our opinion as you can go to a very nice place and explore the area for the same price ,No Positive
448086,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, The staff were super nice and helpful They made everything easy The location was perfect Walking distance from main attractions and the main street and a few minutes away from the metro station 
448087,Hotel Am Schubertring, Breakfast too expensive Shower is just a bath with a hose The only window in the room is a skylight which won t open Curtains won t open properly Hotel seems full of refugees No kettle to make tea Lift was broken one day and all rooms are on 4th floor , Friendly and helpful reception staff Location excellent for sightseeing and good choice of places to eat nearby inc breakfast 
448088,Hotel Am Schubertring, The air conditioner at one room was not efficient enough in a hot sunny day The lobby as well as the hallways were not air conditioned The towels smelled weird even after getting new ones The housekeeping needs some improvements , The best thing about this property is the location So it s good value for money The staff were friendly and helpful especially David and Marion Another great thing was the complimentary drinks at the lobby after a long tiring day 
448089,Hotel Am Schubertring, Nth, The evening receptionist was very very helpful and friendly Forgot to ask hger name Location is perfect Taxi ride abt 10 euro from train or bus station Good value for money 
448090,Hotel Am Schubertring, There is no air conditioning in room and no moskito grid so when I opened window bunch of them fly in to my room , the hotel is in beautiful place in the midle of nature
448091,Hotel Am Schubertring, Select your chambermaids with more care Employ those who have no compunctions about service to the Hotel s customers with a smile After all next to the reception they are the Hotel s 2nd line when you tally up all the credits Just a smile goes a long long way in the hospitality business , We stayed for 8 nights All but one of the chambermaids had a sultry look and gave us the impression she did NOT like her job My wife did not like her attitude and told her NOT to clean the room We informed the reception about this 
448092,Hotel Am Schubertring, The day time front desk Roland was rude gave minimal and unfriendly responses and was unapproachable There was only a ski light in our room no window to view the fantastic old town, The beds and air conditioning were great The 2 tram stopped just outside the door 
448093,Hotel Am Schubertring, the price was a little higher at the time of paying than when the booking was made i asked why this was and got no answer, location is brilliant in the middle of everything
448094,Hotel Am Schubertring, Drainage after shower is a bit slow have to slow the water flow to avoid flooding in the bathroom beacuse there is no barrier to stop water in the shower tub But we still enjoy the stay here , Excellent location large room 
448095,Hotel Am Schubertring, The temperature in the room 33 under the roof was not compatible with health requirements The absence of windows made impossible the receiving of fresh air The air conditioning didn t manage to solve the problem The worst sleep in hotels ever Strictly not recommended to families with children ,No Positive
448096,Hotel Am Schubertring, Nothing special, very good location It s in the shubertring which is center of Wien and it took a 15 minutes to the center of Wien shopping center by walk it was very convenient to take a look at Wien 
448097,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room was quite spartan no rugs or pictures on the walls Breakfast was quite expensive The room was along many twists and turns in the corridor , Good location on the Ringstrasse Staff were helpful Bed was comfortable Nice coffee machine in room 
448098,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room was way too small for 3 people, Newly renovated beds were extra comfortable and the staff very friendly and responsive except for one guy who should not be in the hospitality business 
448099,Hotel Am Schubertring, Friendly and knowledgeable, We got a Big two bedroom suite 24 and only booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children It had a kitchenette and two bathrooms Place is beuatifully renovated very clean comfortable and has nice views Location cant be beat 
448100,Hotel Am Schubertring, We arrived during check in hours but there weren t any staff members to greet us or help us However they were prompt to assist us when they returned , Conveniently located near the opera house where the tour buses pick up and drop off We were able to tour the major attractions in a day because of this This hotel is waking distance to several food options down the street and to a couple bars 
448101,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room facilities didn t look like a 4 hotel There was only one person at the front desk and he was overwhelmed We waited one hour for the check in He hardly managed the check in We asked for an ironer it took over 1 h to have it , Location
448102,Hotel Am Schubertring, The lobby was incredibly warm only 5 minutes in and sweat was pouring also other guests had the same issue Beds were incredibly soft marshmellow soft so all 3 our backs were broken the next day We arrived a bit earlier and we asked whether they could assign us a room which was already prepared The receptionist told us he would see what he can do and let us wait 30 minutes until we got our room anyways We would have preferred him just telling us it was not possible , The rooms were nice and clean and rather spacious The hotel was quite conveniently located and the main street in the center of Vienna was easily accessible It s also rather close to the city park Wifi worked sufficiently well 
448103,Hotel Am Schubertring, there should be air con in lobby corridors lift v hot stuffy, Reception staff were all excellent especially Andrei from Sarvar Excellent location space luxury comfort 
448104,Hotel Am Schubertring, It wasn t communicated to us that breakfast was not included in the room fee even when we specifically asked about it We went down late and had only a small coffee slice of bread and a pastry in the windowless basement before heading out to explore When checking out we were informed that breakfast was 23 euros EACH which is completely nuts for what it was Thankfully we were waived the bill in the end but it put a bit of a damper on an otherwise enjoyable stay , Nice room great location clean and quiet Staff was helpful and courteous
448105,Hotel Am Schubertring, Breakfast was adequate but not worth the price avoid , Big room with very comfortable bed great bathroom kitchen Corner friendly staff excellent Wi fi
448106,Hotel Am Schubertring, The receptionist had an attitude about himself which was displeasing I am from the hospitality sector and one thing is common that the guest is always right If we asked a question a second time he was getting irritated We have come for a holiday to an unknown place the least he could have done is be patient This person is the one who checked us in on the 22nd Very condescending behaviour , The location was superb and most of all Europe has been very hot this time around and it was a relief to get an air conditioner in the room Excellent 
448107,Hotel Am Schubertring, There was only one chair in the entire suite no coaches Its really a place to come back to not hang out Also the second bedroom had curtains that would not close very well and given it was a corner suite had a lot of windows This made the room incredibly bright very early in the morning , Location was excellent Staff friendly Our suite had two rooms and two bathrooms quite a deal 
448108,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, Really nice staff the man at reception was really helpful Rowland I think his name was his help was above and beyond the call of duty e g let me make an emergency international call from his own personal phone etc gave great advice on where to eat at obscure times of the night thankyou very much to this guy Also some nice touches with complimentary fruit and drinks in reception The female manager also seemed genuinely nice friendly cute and noticed she was goo with other guests children 
448109,Hotel Am Schubertring, Although hotel had plenty of time for preparing the rooms we didn t checked in until evening our rooms had missing towels and it took a while till we get them Later we learned that our minibar had missing pieces while checking out though it didn t cause a trouble thanks to the reception Also more spacious room was given to single guest while the smaller one was given to the couple There was no double bed in any of the rooms and the single beds put together were not put together tightly so it was impossible to use them as a double bed , We received a warm welcome in the morning and quickly left our luggage for the city tour The hotel is within walking distance to the opera and around where you can reach many attractions I would still recommend the hotel although there were small problems 
448110,Hotel Am Schubertring, No windows with views of Vienna as hotel rooms were in loft A bit short staffed as receptionist also did porter duties Water not consistently hot Room a long twisty way from the lift , Great location most attractions within walking distance Easy to find Tram D runs from the train station and drops you just outside the hotel at Schwarzenbergplatz Clean and fairly comfortable with AC Free Nespresso machine 
448111,Hotel Am Schubertring, Even we wrote that we are traveling with baby there was no offer for baby coat Man at reception told us that because it is after 6pm he is not able to provide us baby coat bucause stuff is not there He did look like he dont care about customers person like this should not work at reception Avilable places for parking that are written on website are not existing you can park your car 200 m from hotel for 40 eur day Also breakfast for 23 Eur person is deffinitly overpriced so we did not have it at hotel , Good location
448112,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, I would love to stay again in this hotel the staff is really friendly and helpful Value for money location is perfect not far from the station and good for shopping the shopping area is within 5 minutes walking distance I love the hotel 
448113,Hotel Am Schubertring, I found the breakfast expensive The hairdryer was useless would be nice to have a light block on the window, Great location comfortable beds Good coffee very clean wonderful staff
448114,Hotel Am Schubertring, Maze of hallways to reach the room Step in room between room entry closet and bedroom level Step depth too short and ripped on metal edging New carpeting in hallways and room the same not high quality , Access to Vienna inner ring Newly finished room Comfortable bed albeit in European style of twins pushed together Our window faced back of hotel toward roof of adjacent church but enjoyed opening and hearing opera aria practice nearby 
448115,Hotel Am Schubertring, Roof windows does not open and cant look outside can only see the sky , Excellent staff Excellent location transportation means very close and all arround 
448116,Hotel Am Schubertring, Breakfast needs improvement bigger choice or price reduction , One of the best possible locations in Vienna just renovated refreshed small just few rooms very good wifi connection Excellent value 
448117,Hotel Am Schubertring,No Negative, The location of the property was ideal Very conveniently located near the State Opera and tram stations the hotel definitely made travelling to sights and around the city easy It would definitely be worth considering for those looking for a comfortable spacious rooms well located clean hotel Not to forget the staff were very helpful and courteous and friendly I would definitely go there another time and recommend it to travelers 
448118,Hotel Am Schubertring, All rooms are in a newly converted attic that is accessible only by a small creaky elevator The hotel was only a couple of weeks old when we stayed and the maids still didn t understand basics such as changing the soap containers and didn t vacuum or tidy the room as thoroughly , Great location New Clean Helpful staff 
448119,Hotel Am Schubertring, False room description Not a four star hotel Impossible to sleep in the morning due to light no real darkening facility in the room and noise coming from the street , Location staff bed pillow 
448120,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room is not at all as in the picture Much smaller The window is above the bed on the roof the curtain is not thick enough therefore light enters the room at 6am already it is impossible to sleep The window cannot be opened there is only airconditioning to change air Without it the room would be too hot Not a 4star hotel , The staff was helpful and the location is excellent The bed is confortable 
448121,Hotel Am Schubertring, Only Nespresso coffee available No food or other drink available in hotel, The receptionists were very pleasant and tried to be as helpful as possible Great location and pleasant room
448122,Hotel Am Schubertring, Room got quite dark at night and the A C was weak Also rooms were at the back of the hotel and in the attic Expect sloping roofs , Good location close to metro Had food nearby to grab a quick bite Soundproofing was also good 
448123,Hotel Am Schubertring, I was unimpressed that a double room was two twin beds pushed together The air con as not particularly effective either While the system for collecting keys for check in after hours does work the hotel were very reluctant to share any details of it in advance despite multiple requests which made the trip very stressful , Clean and excellent location 
448124,Hotel Am Schubertring, The room is small The roof window can be covered properly with blind giving too much light , The location is good Walking distance to tram and metro

448128,Hotel Am Schubertring, Information about the parking place was confusing In fact hotel has no parking place and the city parking is on next door of the hotel and price is around 40 Eur 24 h , Location is really the best room was clean and the hotel is recently refurbished and carpet is new Beds are gorgeous 
448129,Hotel Am Schubertring, I do not understand how this hotel could get 4 stars When booking via site the picture of the hotel room was pretty nice And when arrived we got a completely different room It s a rip off Terrible beds Had to sleep on the floor Strongly advise not to stay in this hotel,No Positive

448133,Hotel Am Schubertring, 1 The hotel rooms are on the roof floor Thus there are no normal windows only roof windows So you feel a bit like in a deep well 2 The corridors leading to rooms are long and narrow Like a labirynth Claustrophobic 3 Since the rooms are on the roof floor During sunny days usage of air condition is neccessary But the air condition is either freezing or not working 4 I was charged 100 of the payment just on arrival Before I managed to put my suitcase on the floor But on departure the reception lady was traying to charge me ones more with additional 60 of the fee Thanks God I had a print from Visa proving I paid all on arrival Moreover the reception staff was unable to prepare a bill for me Really odd 5 The breakfast menu raher poor and plastic coffe terrible Breakfast not worth its price at all , The hotel is just few steps from inner city 
448134,Hotel Am Schubertring, The first night we arrived there was no warm water the next day in the morning they didn t change our towels perhaps we had to drop the used towels on the floor I asked the maid for new ones the room was booked for three guests and there were only two sets of towels for 2 guests very small elevator the rooms of the hotel were all at the last floor of a building A building with a seperate ground floor reception with an elevetor to the rooms on the last floor attic The rest floors of the building had private flats of residences with a seperate entrance from the other side of the building For that reason all of the rooms had a high window on the wall with limited view attic , In the heart of the city centre Very friendly reception actually the girl at the reception desk was very sweet kind and pretty with very beautiful blue eyes Very clean and quiet Mc Donalds Anken bakery TGI Fridays Spar supermarket very close electronic access to rooms and main entrance with magnetic cards recently renovated everything was new
