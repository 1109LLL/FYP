37445,Le Relais Madeleine,No Negative, The hotel is lovely The staff are friendly and helpful The location is wonderful The room was clean and the bed was fantastic We had a room that opened out to the street and there was no noise at all at night The bus to the airport 11 Euros is walking distance It is close to the metro the Madeleine the opera and great shopping 
37446,Le Relais Madeleine, Nothing , Everything quiet and well located hotel with nicely decorated and spacious rooms enjoyable breakfast with fresh juice friendly staff 
37447,Le Relais Madeleine, After booking through Booking com I ve checked hotel s own web site to realize that I ve just overpaid 90 Claims of Booking com about Best price guarantee is not true Next time will check and book directly from the hotels web site Don t bother ordering breakfast in the hotel there are plenty of cafes in a walking distance , Good location walking distance to main attractions Metro stations nearby 
37448,Le Relais Madeleine, Bathroom was small , We had a great experience here They had a pack and play set up for our baby when we arrived The room and bathroom were the smallest we have stayed in but it worked I don t think its any smaller than your typical European bathrooms We had a great experience at this hotel We knew exactly what we were getting prior to arrival with no false advertising 
37449,Le Relais Madeleine, The rooms that are facing to the street are noisy at night because there is a bar next door I stayed on saturday night it was very loud, Location is very good and staff is polite and friendly Room size is good Beds are very comfortable Coffee machine in the room perfect for morning Choclates on the bed side One night we stayed at the suite which has 2 bathrooms was very good
37450,Le Relais Madeleine, Bed could have been a little firmer but thats a personal thing , Location is perfect Small quiet no hazel property Good value nice clean friendly staff Great wifi TV bathroom breakfast was optional but very nice again good value more so if you wanted to pack a picnic lunch out of it which we did so we could enjoy the parks on our daily tours 
37451,Le Relais Madeleine, One of the days we came back to the hotel at 3 pm I was feeling unwell and my only wish was to rest The room has not been cleaned yet so we put on the door knob the do not disturb sign and went to bed At 7 pm the cleaning lady knocked at the door asking if we want her to make the room Of course we said no On the next day she met us in the breakfast room she was working there too apologized for not being able to make our room on time and also inquired after my health I found her behavior very nice and thoughtful I think the hotel is understaffed the same few persons must prepare the rooms for the new clients and also those for the old ones and may be sometimes they do not manage it all on time , The location was excellent close to place de la Madeleine the Grands boulevards the Opera the Louvre Jardin des Tuileries There are concerts in the Madeleine church we had the chance to hear Vivaldi s Four Seasons There are a lot of small restaurants on the street so in the evening we could either take away or eat in a different place we tried a Greek restaurant two Japanese and a Korean The food was nice and not expensive The reception staff was very friendly and helpful 
37452,Le Relais Madeleine, My only complaint is the hairdryer that kept on falling apart and burning your hand had to wrap a towel around it to hold , All the staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful and will return due to their friendliness Breakfast had something of everything and loved the little underground room and that I could make my own toast and boil my egg to my liking The location is just fabulous and the bed wonderfully comfortable 
37453,Le Relais Madeleine, Breakfast needs improvement Rooms are a bit small that sometimes you struggle to find a space for 2 suitcases But are very cosy , Great staff great location Rooms are cosy Highly recommended
37454,Le Relais Madeleine, Room small Shower head was not good , Wifi was great Enough electric outlets in the right place by the bed Separate toilet Comfortable bed Big towels 
37455,Le Relais Madeleine, Breakfast was not inviting but there a lots of caf s in the area so it doesn t matter The rooms are a little small They only have one ion for the entire hotel , Great location Clean rooms with good wifi Very friendly staff

37458,Le Relais Madeleine, In need of refurbishment Room looked different from the pictures on the website and although it was clean we didn t think it deserved a 4 star rating , Very quiet and clean
37459,Le Relais Madeleine, Probably overstretching to say it is top line 4 Star but all the same it was satisfactory clean with good AC and bed linen , A modest hotel in busy Madeleine Opera area but on a quiet street 
37460,Le Relais Madeleine, Staffs are not helpful You need to make sure you know where to travel in Paris where to buy grocery how to get to airport and etc They do not care to answer those question Help yourself Housekeeping is not that good You come back home after a long day question if your room was made or not , Location is excellent Hotel itself is good Breakfast is okay for couple nights stay 
37461,Le Relais Madeleine, I have got a room with window going out but inside the house and it was on the ground floor I could not leave it open to remove not really fresh air from the room I was affraid that somebody can get inside the window was very low The bed was veeeery soft not comfortable Very small bathroom , Tea coffee set Nice arranged room 
37462,Le Relais Madeleine, Very disappointed with Bookings com On arrival we discovered that our accommodation would have been much cheaper if booked direct Bookings com says they offer the cheapest option Very untrue Not happy , Staff were very accommodating when they knew we had paid over and above through bookings com Offered room upgrade and free breakfast however we were still overcharged euros 700 
37463,Le Relais Madeleine, On the second day we were informed that a strange smell came from our room No idea what smell We have been traveling a lot stayed in different hotels in Europe and Asia This is our first time to hear such disturbing news It was not clear whether they were complaining or just providing information and took necessary actions with regard to the smell , Love the surrounding area A lot of shops and restaurants including our favourite Japanese restaurant 
37464,Le Relais Madeleine,No Negative, The suite on the last floor is perfect for a family with young kids We have already recommanded the hotel to friends I also loved the old books and particularly the one covering the period from 1848 to the Second Empire
