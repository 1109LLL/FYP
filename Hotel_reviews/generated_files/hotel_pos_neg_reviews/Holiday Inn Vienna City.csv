376721,Holiday Inn Vienna City, Nothing for this type of hotel 3 Perhaps not very attractive neighborhood , Really nice hotel Very polite and attentive staff breakfast buffet with decent selection of high quality food breakfast buffet kept replenished till very closing time at 10am great for guests who like to sleep long Good location not far from the city center and near a shopping mall 
376722,Holiday Inn Vienna City, We had soup as a starter for one evening meal and it was too salty , The staff were very friendly and helpful The food was good we ate in the restaurant on 3 of the 4 nights And we liked the garden small but very relaxing There were frequent buses from the stop on the parallel street

376724,Holiday Inn Vienna City,No Negative, Nice place very close to city center and subway Very close almost walking distance from many famouse and interesting places Nice and kind personnel in hotel clean and tidy rooms Very pleasant week in Vienna 
376725,Holiday Inn Vienna City, While very efficient the room was very small We would want to request a larger room next time , Perfect location to meet up with friends who live only 4 blocks away and to get to the museums and art galleries we planned to see As an architect liked the informative Vienna Secession displays The hotel was very well appointed and efficient Loved the breakfast 
376726,Holiday Inn Vienna City, In booking com its stated airport shuttle provided but only the service to call for a cab was offered This creates confusion as though airport shuttle is provided Its good to be specific , Friendly Front Desk and good hospitality
376727,Holiday Inn Vienna City, Pillows unnecessarily large even a softer one was not agreeable Good for watching TV in bed but not for sleeping , That aside the staff were extremely welcoming courteous It was so cold outside this particular week I generally ended up eating my evening meals in the hotel as I had been sightseeing most days and lazily couldn t be bothered to go out again It was very comfortable the sea bass was excellent In fact the 3 course set meal was very good indeed Well done chef team I will be returning to this hotel 
376728,Holiday Inn Vienna City, Standard rooms in the second floor of the garden portion of the hotel were really bad that i never recommend them to anyone This part of hotel doesn t have an elevator and rooms are not spacious The floor is very noisy maybe because it s been made from wood We ve been in Holiday Inn for 7 nights We had to change our room and for this change I had to pay 35 euros more for each night Receptionist at the first night of stay didn t welcome us friendly and it was not a pleasant beginning for us but after the first night every thing bacame better , Staff were friendly and fluent in English Family room was spacious enough Room service staff were really friendly
