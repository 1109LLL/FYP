265979,Sir Albert Hotel, Firmer pillows would have been nice Some parts of the hotel were too dark such as stairwells and corridors Extra lighting would help , Liked the toiletries the bluetooth speaker radio the general ambience of the hotel Location is fantastic Staff friendly and helpful 
265980,Sir Albert Hotel, The cleanliness the tray of In Room snacks not sure when it was last wiped down The dust Splash stains on the curtain near the coffee machine Design wise the sinks are stylish but so impractical everything just ends up drying sticking to the basin as there is no slope so that everything can easily run down the drain hole Lots of stain marks scratches around the whole basin too I think a refurb is needed The bath robes did not smell freshly laundered I think they had been worn re hung on the hanger without being washed Lastly I find it strange that bath robes are supplied but no slippers especially when the floor is hard wood , Interesting quirky decor Illy coffee machine in room Lovely Staff Lovely bedding Fragrance diffuser in WC Nice toiletries 
265981,Sir Albert Hotel, So subtle is dutch design that bug american ways were a little challenged by simol, The staff is smart and friendly and has something to add to a conversation besides the usual niceties
265982,Sir Albert Hotel, We thoroughly enjoyed our stay but there were a few niggles There was a muddle about cleaning our room one day Also we were there for four nights but the sheets weren t changed There were marks on the walls and the lights were frustrating they never stayed on in the shower WC unless you kept pressing Otherwise it was fine , The service was excellent they were friendly and efficient More to the point they went the extra mile without being asked 
265983,Sir Albert Hotel, The interiors of the hallways and the rooms was dark and a little bit outdated but the lobby and entrance were nicely designed I upgraded to a room with a balcony which was not a blacony but rather a very small terrace barely big enough to stand in , The bed was extremely comfortable 
265984,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The bed was amazing small but super comfortable and quiet The lobby was chic the front desk people we very inviting and warm and efficient Great breakfast buffet although they forgot to mention that you can actually order a la carte and don t have to eat the buffet loved every aspect of Sir Albert and would def stay there again 
265985,Sir Albert Hotel, Gap between toilet door and wall limited privacy, Welcoming staff hip decor fantastic location surrounded by a variety of excellent restaurants a very short walk to the Rijksmuseum and a short tram ride to the central station
265986,Sir Albert Hotel, Soft bed Room very small First floor room and music blaring from club late at night so unable to sleep, Modern and clean Up and coming area with markets and nice restaurants Good for young people
265987,Sir Albert Hotel, bathroom is disaster ink it was in room not in toilet So whenone person is cleaning hisself secound person is all The time With her Huge minus I will never come back for sure Its Big disadventage I will highly NOT reconend persones witch are traveling in buisness, Very nice staff Proseco during check in
265988,Sir Albert Hotel, Lots of dust in the room cleaners clearly not doing their job properly Also every morning around 10am we d receive loud banging on the door asking if we d left the room so the cleaners could come in Hotel and staff great cleaning system needs to be reviewed fast , Bed was amazingly comfortable 
265989,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Excellent room super comfy bed staff were wonderful we stayed as part of our honeymoon and were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and balloons Sir Albert hotel helped make our stay in Amsterdam unforgettable 
265990,Sir Albert Hotel, Our only small gripe was how late they cleaned our room 5pm both days we kind of wanted to flop after a day cycling around the city So suggest you ensure reception know you want your room cleaned when you head out , We had a wonderful stay Sir Albert is very comfortable excellent staff decent sized rooms for Amsterdam Huge and delicious breakfast Super stylish bar and restaurant Amazing location between Museum district and De Pijp which is a trendy area with great boutiques and places to eat and drink Bike hire was excellent 
265991,Sir Albert Hotel, Toilet and shower doors barely close all the way little privacy if there s someone else in the room , Lovely boutique hotel incredibly helpful and professional staff nice sized room with very comfortable bed and excellent shower Hotel is centrally located so you can easily walk to most areas of the city 
265992,Sir Albert Hotel, The pillows in the bed were very big tall and hence uncomfortable We asked for the smallest pillow available and it was still too tall We stayed in room 140 which was tucked away in a corner on the first floor the floor above the Izakaya hotel bar The music from the bar was faintly audible at night friday saturday night especially until late , Location is great for exploring Amsterdam and recommend the Pijp area for bars and restaurants The ambience is great and we enjoyed drinks at the Izakaya hotel bar 
265993,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, What didn t we like First off the Staff are beyond amazing They go above and beyond to make you feel at home The beds the bathrooms the breakfast JUST BOOK IT Yes it s a little extra but who cares you will be glad you did 
265994,Sir Albert Hotel, Bed too soft for us Surface of the room was presented to be 25sqm on Booking the room was definitely smaller than this Expensive but this is Amsterdam On going works on the road and on the nearby canal Next building there is a brothel perhaps not appropriate to see if you travel with family Not the greatest location , Service friendly staff willing to help Weather was very warm and we were assigned initially a room on top floor which was too hot We asked to change room and this was done swiftly but then we also had an issue with the electricity in the bathroom We were offered a complimentary bottle of lemonade and also we were offered to change again the room Staff writes nice personalized notes all signed Sir Albert which gives a pleasant and personal touch Very good shower good quality of toiletries Very clean 10min walk to Rijksmuseum and Museumplein You can rent bikes at the hotel 
265995,Sir Albert Hotel, Room lacked drawers and closet had 3 hangars We had to live out of the suitcase The worst problem is the ventilation system of the ground floor restaurant The room smelled like bacon and meat until 1 2 am , Room was clean 
265996,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Had a lovely minibreak in Amsterdam staying at the Sir Albert The bed was comfortable and the room was clean plus the shower was amazing We were on the ground floor so we didn t have a great view out of the window but there is a bar restaurant downstairs that is really buzzy and we didn t hear a thing The staff were helpful and accomodating gave us great tips for where to go in the city and helped us booking restaurants Highly highly recommend it 
265997,Sir Albert Hotel, No slippers in the room Windows of the rooms on the ground floor are too high It s almost like you don t have a window in the room , Hotel s design was great Stuff is very friendly and helpfull Bed is extremly comfortable Room is clean Location is good because it s not over cowded by tourists so that you can feel a real local atmosphere yet not far to walk to the central atractions Hotel s restaurant is very cool Especially at night it s a great place to have a drink 
265998,Sir Albert Hotel, The room is kinda small comparing to the pictures i saw online light didn t work at the shower and bathroom However the reception staff tried their best to fix it they offered a move to another room but i was checking out the next day so they offered a late checkout the noises coming from Izakaya restaurant is kinda annoying as it stays out till late but overall it wasn t a bad experience it s a good hotel in general i just had a bad luck during my stay , Great location next to Albert cuyp market pubs and restaurants and a bakery nearby 5 minutes walk to museumplein staff are extremely nice they are doing their best to make you feel home they offer drinks when you check in which is a quick process WiFi is good nice and modern decor i liked the black glass walls in the room coffee machine and tea kettle provided also in the room 
265999,Sir Albert Hotel, We loved being half a mile from the congested part of the city This location is close to the museums but also quirky streets with lovely restaurants and cafes Delicious coffee Fruit and flower markets The restaurant is very popular and a little noisy but all that stops at 11pm on the dot We happened to be staying in the ground floor room closest to the noise However I loved having a bathtub We will stay here again The service staff is fabulous , We did not eat at the hotel but it was packed from lunch to dinner and the food smelled great We wanted to explore the city s ethnic and international food so we never got around to eating in the hotel The restaurant is very pretty Many people patronized the breakfast option The spread looked lovely and at 17 very reasonable We don t eat that early 
266000,Sir Albert Hotel, So this was our second time staying at Sir Albert and I must say that we had a completely diferent experience This time by my own mistake I chose a smaller room than the last time and we noticed some diferences that really impacted in our opinion of the hotel The room was so small that we couldn t pull our MEDIUM SIZED suitcase past the entrance we had to carry it to the other side of the room and don t ask me how we walked around The cleaniness of the room was also really lacking the room didn t have the courtesy water skimping on water is just sad and other minor details Overall I think that this is still a good hotel but if you have a look around you can find better rooms in the same price range , Most of the staff is still quite nice and acomodating the view from the room was really pretty and the location of the hotel is really good walking distance to many tourist attractions nice restaurants and public transport 
266001,Sir Albert Hotel, Except for arranging the bed and changing the towels they didn t clean the room Just the very basic I was there for 3 nights Such as crumbs on the table etc also it s a bit dark in the room elevator and hallway , The most valuable thing is the staff Always with a smile nice and polite and eager to help The location is good 10 minutes walking from the Museum area 20 minutes from the shopping district 
266002,Sir Albert Hotel, There was no non dairy milk at breakfast and the a la carte breakfast items could have been prepared with a little more flavour considering the EUR 23 price tag , The first thing that stood out was the warm welcome on check in we were asked about our specific Amsterdam interests and given personalised recommendations of how to spend our time It was my birthday during the stay and I came home to balloons on my bed The bed was super comfy the room was cosy and quiet despite the buzzing restaurant downstairs and all the interior design elements were thoughtful and pleasing The bike rental allowed us tremendous freedom 
266003,Sir Albert Hotel, The restaurant is turned into a nigthclub on Fridays and Saturdays the music was deafening when we entered the lobby area Luckily we had a room on the third floor but we could still faintly hear the music , We had a de luxe room which was a bit small but worked very well Nice contemporary design great shower and toiletries Staff was helpful and made us feel welcome 
266004,Sir Albert Hotel, I wasn t too impressed by the fact we tried twice to get a table at the restaurant in the hotel for two different nights and was unsuccessful They should be giving hotel guests priority for tables which is what other hotels do , Lovely hotel in a good area with only ten minutes walk to Leidensplein Square and a tram stop 5 minutes away that will take you 15 mins to Centraal Station Room was a bit small but clean and bed was very comfortable Staff was lovely and accommodating as they could be even ordered us a pizza at 5am after our night out 
266005,Sir Albert Hotel, More lighting in the shower , The staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinely welcoming friendly We visited for just two nights for our 20th anniversary which they made very special for us with a great view over the canal If you re travelling hand luggage like us the room is well furnished with shampoo conditioner and shower gel and a great little coffee machine you may wish to take English tea bags We didn t try the restaurant as we re not fish lovers but it was busy and vibrant and gave off a great vibe Plenty of places to choose from locally for food from around the world Good location just a short walk into the centre Highly recommended 
266006,Sir Albert Hotel, Hotel is in a nice quiet area we stayed in room 413 shower was great but toilet is separate from shower and sink in room was a bit odd as used to them being altogether bit of a tight squeeze in toilet and not very private but apart from that everything else was great would definitely recommend this hotel, Loved hiring the bikes and boat trip breakfast was great the staff were very obliging and polite hopping on and off trams was fun too great city to visit
266007,Sir Albert Hotel, Disappointed that there was no complimentary water in a room which cost us just 800 for 3 nights before we left the hotel we said it to a staff member and they said that we could have drank the tap water in the room which was the hand basin , The Restaurant
266008,Sir Albert Hotel, Ground floor room was too dark and noisy because of proximity to hotel entrance and restaurant Lighting in bathroom not adequate and no place to hang towels in bathroom , Nice breakfast buffet
266009,Sir Albert Hotel, Cleanliness of the room the floor was dusty I don t think it had been cleaned or brushed since we arrived we stayed for 4 nights Not a fan of having the shower in like a cupboard Would prefer a separate bathroom , The beds are super comfy Room is a decent size with everything you need You are about a 5 minute walk away from many attractions and tram lines Room service was good too 
266010,Sir Albert Hotel, All was good , Great selection of food at breakfast The staff were always on hand to help The location was convenient for getting to all the major sites and the hotel is situated in a nice part of the City 
266011,Sir Albert Hotel, the restaurant music was to loud for a quiet meal , The rooms were small but felt spacious the bed was very comfortable and the shower was excellent Upon arrival we were welcomed with a glass of Prosecco the staff were friendly helpful and smart The room we were given was over the restaurant and the music was too loud but the night manager moved us to a quiet room It was my wifes birthday and the staff put balloons in the room gave complimentary drinks The only downside was the tram had been diverted due to roadworks but will be back to normal soon 
266012,Sir Albert Hotel, Mixed bag on staff all friendly enough but not always the most efficient e g forgetting drinks order and not being organised when you are checking in to the same room but arriving at different times , Very comfy bed Rooms are cosy but perfectly formed 
266013,Sir Albert Hotel, Room was not ready after 5pm on day of check in Upgraded room lights faulty in shower Final room we got was twin beds not double as booked, Good shower Good pillow

266015,Sir Albert Hotel, Nothing comes to mind, The greeting from Ghizlane was probably the best I ve had at any hotel Fantastic info and super friendly all the recommendations were great and felt like good local spots Hotel is close to markets and bars etc and a 10 min tram to the main station etc Great hotel and experience
266016,Sir Albert Hotel, The room was very small for the price we paid Didn t like the shower in the wardrobe scenario was weird Other than that would recommend , The vibe in this place is very cool and the breakfast is really great although quite expensive The bar is very cool with a dj playing most nights 
266017,Sir Albert Hotel, I cannot find one bad thing to say , Staff were welcoming everything was carefully explained and we were offered refreshments Melvin showed us to our room and explained everything there to us We were so lucky to be given a free breakfast as we were guests of the day how fortunate The room was quiet and the bed was so very comfortable The breakfast staff were so great too 
266018,Sir Albert Hotel, All facilities were unavailable during our stay due to cleaning renovating so the amazing study and restaurant were closed with absolutely no mention or notice given to us the service was terrible I ordered a bottle of prosseco to the room bit they didn t have any ice and said they couldn t get any so I could only have it warm which I obviously refused I would suggest to anyone wanting to stay here to save themselves the money and go elsewhere as this ruined by partners Birthday Also asked the receptionist about the city spa mentioned on the website and they had no idea what I was talking about , The beds were amazing modern room beautiful waterfall shower head 
266019,Sir Albert Hotel, It s a struggle to think of anything, The staff here are just so welcoming If you want quirky but stunningly elegant boutique hotel this is for you I visit around four times a year and am never disappointed 
266020,Sir Albert Hotel, We had to get used to the small room but eventually it was OK No robe and slippers , The location is excellent and the bed is really comfortable The museums are just 10 minutes walk away Fair value for fair price 
266021,Sir Albert Hotel, Room very dusty Don t buy museum tickets through hotels in busy periods Non timed tickets meant we queued for 2 hours in the freezing cold , Excellent service from concierge staff Carry comfortable room 
266022,Sir Albert Hotel, Room was one of the smaller rooms in the hotel Wardrobe unlit and could not always see my clothes easily , I was allowed to check in early without charge Staff charming to deal with Common areas very comfortable upmarket It was a birthday trip for me and staff put balloons on the bed with complimentary cocktails card Very handy location for areas to visit TV had BBC programs which was particularly nice as we were away over Christmas Will be back to stay this year

266026,Sir Albert Hotel, The room I had was designed to be shareable with next door I assume with a door in the dividing wall not necessarily providing much sound reduction privacy In hindsight I should have asked for an alternate room Room service burgers and chips chosen was a little pricey Realizing this maybe should be expected with the luxury of having food delivered to your room , The hotel is in a great location from which to explore the many neighbourhoods districts of Amsterdam The hotel is a 15 20min walk from the central area museum district Oud West Nine Streets etc There are also a number of lovely cafes shops in the immediate area There is a tram line immediately outside the hotel with tram steps east west within a short walk The staff were extremely friendly helpful on checkin with bubbles maps helpful hints Room had a view to outside and an openable window which was appreciated Room was always nicely refreshed during the day whilst I was out

266034,Sir Albert Hotel, Staff tried to ignore aborted fire alarm with a joke even if the situation wasn t serious it is a very very unprofessional behavior Breakfast staff stressed and orders often had to be placed more than once to arrive In the evening somewhat noisy from the restaurant so perhaps better to opt for room on the second floor or higher , Staff in general in friendly and flexibel in finding solutions
266035,Sir Albert Hotel, A lot of mistake with my reservation fake name messages for other people wich come in my room even a wrong birthday voucher to much noise with the aeration of the wc and shower My rate price was very to expensive 230 00 euros per night for a deluxe room without breakfast its small and I don t feel the difference with another one , Good situation design and modern

266038,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The friendliness of the staff Our room was warm and cosy and perfect for us and our two children The location is great De Pijp is a wonderful area to explore because of the range of shops bars and restaurants and of course it is not too far from the museums especially the Van Gogh museum which is a must for any visitor to Amsterdam

266080,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was situated in the most ideal location it was close to the centre of town and beautiful bars shops and restaurants However don t feel the need to wonder too far for delicious food as the Sir Albert is home to Izakaya restaurant which was some of the most exquisitely tasting Asian cuisine that I have experienced throughout my extensive travels through Europe The hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating ensuring that we were well accommodated and helped with whatever we may need The rooms were immaculate and clean with the most comfortable beds We could not have asked for a better hotel to stay in whilst traveling in Amsterdam I highly recommend the Sir Albert Hotel 
266081,Sir Albert Hotel, Bathrooms are tiny and nowhere to hang towels but for a short stay this wasn t an issue , Superb location Comfortable rooms we were able to fit a toddler bed in Great team appreciated the correspondence ahead of our arrival 
266082,Sir Albert Hotel, The staff wasnt so friendly when we arrived at 12 at night , The beds are one of the best we ever had and we stayed allready in 100 of hotels Says enough 
266083,Sir Albert Hotel, Response to a broken TV poor although we were told someone would come and review noone did , Very comfy bed Fab location Amazing G T s Very light and modern hotel Great staff
266084,Sir Albert Hotel, Room on G floor booked on Booking com are in a service corridor opppsite 3 service doors used by staff day and night very noisy and interrupted sleep Loud music every night from restaurant bar on ground floor did not match hotel description portrayed on Booking com Is this a hotel or a party spot Therefore not good value for money , Location was good clean and modern with good wifi and excellent breakfast 
266085,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Warm reception on arrival Welcome drink and help with luggage Coffee machine in room and rain shower Very comfortable bed It is easy to catch Tram 16 into city centre 
266086,Sir Albert Hotel, Breakfast service disorganised you have to ask for things several times before you get them Simple fix write orders down , Good Location nice decoration 
266087,Sir Albert Hotel, Really loud and disturbing music and noise from the restaurant Make sure not to get a room on the first floor Also don t be surprised by the red light district row in the next door buildings , Great design and very cozy rooms The staff is friendly and very helpful 
266088,Sir Albert Hotel, Coffe machine in the room didn t work properly , Very comfortable beds and the room in the back was incredibly quiet Great location for museums Definitely a younger crowd but being older we didn t feel out of place Very professionally run hotel 
266089,Sir Albert Hotel, The breakfast was a little on the expensive side but nothing out of the usual for hotel prices, I booked for our company away weekend for 10 people The rooms were very well designed The shower was lovely The beds were very comfortable The staff were very helpful The breakfasts were tasty
266090,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, We stayed in 3 hotels during our 10 day stay at Amsterdam this May and our stay at Sir Albert was by far the most comfortable and pleasing for all The rooms are impeccable the decor riveting the staff most helpful and friendly and the location perfect My permanent choice for Amstedam Stayed May 2016 travelled with family
266091,Sir Albert Hotel, the room was very small, warm welcome charming place outside the busiest obvious tourist areas The characterisic atmosphere in the lobby with a fire comfortable sofas and books make you feel at home 
266092,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The bed room was lovely very comfortable bed room does not realy have any where to hang your wet towels but saying that they change the towels everyday There soap shampoo and cream as lovely You feel special on arrival with a bottle of champagne being in your room Service was excellent great 3 day stay would definitely go back Excellent location for tram and eating places 
266093,Sir Albert Hotel, there s not much to complain about here I d happily return , Very much enjoyed this location It is an easy 10 minute walk to Concertbouw major museums through pretty neighborhoods We felt entirely safe walking day or night Location not as touristy as others which suit us well Fun staff at front desk offered very on point recommendations for dining and we thank them very much Welcoming bubbly nice touch Comfortable room 
266094,Sir Albert Hotel, I didnt like the pillows very big and uncomfortable though we asked for feather pillows but not of good quality The houskeeping needs a lot of improvement the overall cleanliness is bad i m a hotelier and i know wbat im talking about I felt there is no value for money we paid a very high price Euro2143 plus 5 city tax for 8 nights and the room that was allocated for us wasnt with a nice view it was overlooking backyard though hotel had availability i used to check booking com It would have been nice to have a room with nice view during our stay 8 nights , The receptionist staff are the best Manuele is such a wonderful professional guy he is such a superb person and Helen is very nice too If i decide to come back and stay at hotel it will be because of them The amenities in the room are excellent shampoo cream etc 
266095,Sir Albert Hotel, That we couldn t stay longer , Amazing attentive helpful staff Fantastic location Treated well from prosecco while checking in special touches throughout our stay dinner reservations local recommendations and a general atmosphere of sincere caring for the customer And the MOST heavenly bedding 
266096,Sir Albert Hotel, Rooms a bit snug for the money Bit dark on stairs with dark tiles as is the bathroom in the lobby, De pijp area lovely Beds very comfy Staff helpful and smiley
266097,Sir Albert Hotel, Could have stayed longer , Room staff location food were amazing Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Funky but classy boutique hotel in a great spot Highly recommended 
266098,Sir Albert Hotel, The dark hallway do not give a good feel as one walks to the room Like going to a cinema at night , The bed was certainly a plus to soothe the the body from a tiring day Real comfy even the sound of tram outside seems so far away We had lunch at the Japanese fusion restaurant and love the Salmon and the Unagi Bento set It is pretty authentic considering it is in Europe 
266099,Sir Albert Hotel, The section where the bathroom is is a little bit to dark Putting makeup on is impossible although they offer a small illuminated mirror which in my case didn t work This could for sure be better we used the parking service of our car which costs 35 Euro per day When we arrived they asked us about the time we would like to have our car back When we decided to leave earlier because of the really bad weather they initially said it would take 1 5 2 hours until they would bring the car which they didn t said when we arrived It finally took only 1 hour and 15 minutes but still you have to know that in advance Comparing to other hotels where I have been I think it is a little bit overpriced but I think that in general hotels in Amsterdam are expensive, Location close to the center you can walk or even take the metro metro station next to the hotel The bed was extremely comfy never slept that well in a hotel Nice room and shower with nice furniture Izakaya restaurant with very friend stuff and good not extraordinary food with really fresh fish The breakfast with 18 Euros including all the beverages like coffee champagne fresh juices etc was very good
266100,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Friendly hotel staff lovely welcome Didn t have breakfast as seemed quite expensive very comfy rooms Would also recommend the French restaurant directly opposite the hotel
266101,Sir Albert Hotel, Restaurant rather noisy at the weekend , Extra comfy beds Staff were extremely kind helpful and considerate after our 18mo old daughter threw up on arrival 
266102,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Location was great for us close to many attractions but outside the crowded city center Staff extremely helpful about tickets and directions to tourist spots and shared good ideas about transportation to outlying areas Room was perfect beds and bedding very comfortable loved the shower 
266103,Sir Albert Hotel, could be a slightly lower price , Attention to detail the requested tulips were there on arrival and a bottle of sparkling was added gratis The welcome was very warm and gracious and the staff understood the need for a balance between sincerity and discretion 
266104,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Customer service beyond 5 star A home away from home Superb location outstanding restaurant and bar Just a very classy quirky fun and sophisticated gem of a hotel in Amsterdam 
266105,Sir Albert Hotel, On the first Sunday of every month there is a special event in the restaurant from 1 6 pm with a live dj We didn t know and found it difficult to relax in our room during that time as the bass was thumping through the house The room was comfortable if a little cosy no ensuite bathroom pillows a little too big to sleep on Can t open a window so depend on air con so you have a whirring sound all night I prefer the breakfast to be included in a 4 star hotel , Very stylish and classy exterior as well as interior friendly staff good location in a lovely area Ideal for a city break in Amsterdam Tram stop very close by 
266106,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Quite simply a fantastic Hotel with an amazing restaurant and even better staff Having lived in Amsterdam for 3 years I had previously used the restaurant IZAKAYA but had never had the need to use the hotel My experience with the team who greeted me and looked after my every need was simply amazing Hellen Sandra Britt and Audrey epitomised the excellent standards of the hotel and did so with wonderful smiles I will return both for business and pleasure when back in Amsterdam 5 STAR SERVICE 
266107,Sir Albert Hotel, The bathroom had a glass door and it felt like there was no door at all , Staff was very friendly location is good not far from the city centre and in a relatively quiet area the room was clean and bright 
266108,Sir Albert Hotel, The room was a bit small the beatiful sink in the room Beware of the loud bar , I liked the neighbourhood clean rooms Intresting but strange decote in the room 
266109,Sir Albert Hotel, Would have like the room to be a little bigger It also needed more hanging space for your clothes , From the moment we arrived and until the day we left the staff were very good professional so attentive and very friendly Excellent service 
266110,Sir Albert Hotel, This hotel is not very traditional as it look from outside Inside is very modern but maybe too modern with interesting setting of room facilities WC shower sink all separated etc I found it not convenient I am as young as 30 The restaurant Izakaya was really expensive with small portion of food The atmosphere would be plus for the place but only if you like the posh style nicely dressed people Overall I didn t like the too much fancy posh atmosphere , I think it s good value for money but only if you get secret deal or something similar considering you pay over 200 Euro for a double room inside Amsterdam center Location is in the nice area in Amsterdam tram stop 1 min from the hotel many good restaurants pubs nearby Bed was comfortable Nice amenity in the room shower gown indoor slippers cotton buds etc
266111,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, I was greeted with a lovely set of balloons and free bottle of prosecco due to it being my birthday during my stay The bed and shower were particular highlights of the room for me along with the fabulous decor
266112,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, When I first went to Amsterdam I was an impoverished student staying in the cheapest hostels and now returning as an adult I loved staying at the Sir Albert The staff are extremely helpful and courteous the service is exceptional The location is great near museums great restaurants transit and the outdoor market The decor is elegant and minimal Excellent value and highly comfortable The service we got included umbrellas lots of ice brought to the room for us extra coffee brought to the room reservations made for us at local spots by the desk staff etc 
266113,Sir Albert Hotel, Better lighting needed in the lift and in the bathroom , Staff went out if their way to help Excellent restaurant good ambiance in the evening and top rate fusion cooking 
266114,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The second we walked through the door the staff were brilliant A great welcome that immediately put us in a great mood The beds were amazing so much so that my partner and I went as far as to say they were the comfiest bed we ve ever slept in ever The small touches and attention to detail went a long way also we booked our trip over the Easter weekend and the staff set up an Easter egg hunt in the room with complimentary prosecco Rooms were amazing hotel in general was amazing Free wifi for those of you who can t part with your phone We only had the breakfast there during our stay and it was equally as amazing as the comfortable beds I especially loved how the breakfast buffet had fresh smoothies to drink as well as a great selection in both the buffet and main dishes We fell in love with Amsterdam in its entirerity and will no doubt be back and soon we can 100 we will stay here again it made our trip even better Also if a lot like my partner and I you like to be in the less busier but much quirkier parts of town location wise it couldn t be better Small walk away from the museums and a tram stops right outside the hotel It s also right next to a canal as well as being on a street full of lovely Dutch bakeries bars cafes and coffee shops 
266115,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Excellent staff we felt extremely well looked after without any intrusion Great bath and shower in room comfortable bed Room was cosey light and peaceful with everything you need The Asian restaurant downstairs is remarkable and worth visiting even if you are not staying at the hotel try the sweet corn tempura 
266116,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Staffs are so helpful and accommodating initially booked four 4 nights for a business trip but suddenly had changes in my itinerary that I have to check out early they personally assisted me by contacting Booking com to have the amendments in my reservation Thank you 
266117,Sir Albert Hotel, The room is not very practical and the extras expensive Not recommended for travel with a toddler , Beautiful hotel and stylish room Located in a nice area 
266118,Sir Albert Hotel, The drinks were very expensive and only coffee was available in the room Also the bar was always too busy with non guests to be able to get a seat , The hotel looked amazing and the beds were incredibly comfortable The shower was also lovely as were the bathroom products provided
266119,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to help with advice on what to see in Amsterdam The offer of tea coffee whilst checking in was a nice touch and the rooms were really nice The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in 
266120,Sir Albert Hotel, Everything about this hotel is fantastic EXCEPT the noise If you are staying in a room above the restaurant do not expect to sleep Could still hear it when moved two floors above it but managed to sleep It s ridiculously loud and therefore only renders this hotel feasible if you are going to Amsterdam to party If not Stay somewhere else , Excellent staff Beautiful hotel with lots of attention to detail Lovely bathroom products 
266121,Sir Albert Hotel, Freezing cold room and nothing I did with the heating controls made it any better Freezing draft from behind the light switches bizarrely , Stylish and contemporary Very warm welcome 
266122,Sir Albert Hotel, That I couldn t stay there longer or transport the bed and pillows to my house , This really will go down as one of our favourite hotels we ve stayed at Beautiful light spacious funky loft room Staff can t do enough for you and treat you like old friends Very stylish boutique hotel a lot of thought had gone into the d cor and design Perfect location in young and trendy part of Amsterdam
266123,Sir Albert Hotel, Loud lobby no place pleasant to sit in the lobby and read or talk Expensive hotel and there are no convenient electric outlets Very stuffy hotel but not as good as its pretense The wifi is lousy poor speed and you have to renew the password access everyday total nuisance , The location is good away from the center near museums and Concertgebouw 
266124,Sir Albert Hotel, The lighting especially common areas like corridors and lift and bathrooms is poor and the colours of brown black did not really help , The hotel is located close to the centre The staff are very pleasant and always smiling and willing to help The facilities are clean and the bed very comfortable The hotel restaurant is a good evening out option and the study area with its fire place and book shelves around very cosy 
266125,Sir Albert Hotel, The only thing that was not excellent was the hotel breakfast We had to send it back as the first time it arrived it was cold However the staff were happy to return it to the kitchen and bring it back hot They were very apologetic I did think it was quite expensive at 21 50 though , The bed was definitely the most comfortable I have ever stayed in The hotel room was lovely with a great shower and quality toiletries The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly As it was my partners birthday they also put balloons and a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine in our room which was a lovely touch 
266126,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, good hotel with a fantastic restaurant service at the reception splendid we were client of the day so I could choose for an upgrade late check out or free breakfast nice detail 
266127,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, We stayed 2 nights at the Sir Albert during New Year and loved it Staff is very friendly and supportive Rooms are on the small side but have everything you need comfortable beds coffee and tea making equipment and large shower Location is good with public transport around the corner The restaurant serves excellent breakfast and dinner 
266128,Sir Albert Hotel, Some of the staff at breakfast could have been a bit more responsive , Great location in an authentic neighbourhood but still close to the centre museums etc Good design not overdone All comforts great breakfast 
266129,Sir Albert Hotel, We weren t able to turn off the bathroom fan which was quite noisy We asked the reception to turn it off and said they would take care of it but it was still on later that day Maybe you just can t turn it off , The staff was super friendly and really helpful The beds were very comfortable breakfast was good and overall it was a great stay 
266130,Sir Albert Hotel, Hotel restaurant was closed for 2 3 nights of our stay which was disappointing as would have loved to have visited Would have visited on first night if we were aware , Staff were great made us feel so welcome providing us plenty of ideas of places to go and things to do Could not do enough for you from welcome drinks to ordering taxis and food from restaurants for room service Bed was amazing the comfiest we ve ever slept in Shower great too had a lovely room with roof terrace shame about the bad weather Would absolutely go back 
266131,Sir Albert Hotel, The unfriendly reception of the hotel very rude and not even polite staff Very shaby small room with poor shower Was defenitely wrong decission to book this hotel Will never stay again and not recommend to anybody also Not the value for the cost , The hotel was much better for my previous stay that was the reason to choose it again but pure dissapointment 
266132,Sir Albert Hotel, Very few tv Chanels and some rooms can be noisy they have a very live restaurant and also play music on the halls , Great hotel Very welcoming and helpful staff Comfy rooms loved the comforter Would stay again
266133,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Excellent Ily Coffee Great location close to Museum Plein Staff helpful with bookings and directions Has excellent restaurant and nice lounge for relaxing Nice touch having high quality Christmas decorations making a nice festive feel 
266134,Sir Albert Hotel, No bath and wifi did not work , Gorgeous boutique hotel with incredibly nice staff Room and premises very beautifully decorated Super comfortable bed 
266135,Sir Albert Hotel, A minor gripe but they didn t explain the pre authorisation they put on my card when checking in properly We had been advised that it would be 50 a night but over 500 was held on my card without warning I then was charged again on check out , Hotel was in a fantastic location and the staff were excellent Beds were seriously comfortable also 
266136,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, I made this booking for my brother and sister in law for a weekend treat and the staff couldn t have been more thoughtful towards them It s exactly the kind of hotel where the attention goes into the smallest detail and nothing is too much trouble Fantastic 
266137,Sir Albert Hotel, Drink prices in the bar were a bit high Check in out took a bit longer than usual , Location was perfect Staff was very friendly and helpful Quality of toiletries was excellent Room was clean and the bed was very comfortable 
266138,Sir Albert Hotel, My room was above the Izakaya restaurant so I had to deal with a huge noise issue but I was moved to another room , The design of the hotel so much in keeping with my own aesthetic The marvelous Izakaya restaurant The mostly attentive staff 
266139,Sir Albert Hotel, Style over substance at front desk although I d emailed called prior to arrival re twin beds there was no reference made to it by desk staff when checking in no note made on system General lack of clarity around my alternative options bigger bed Bigger room Etc Ended up upgrading by my own initiative after checking in My other friends had total fiasco re room as they d been offered a twin but upon arrival none available All v messy No one knew who to blame staff v uninformed manager had to be called Finally additional room offered but bad way to start a short city break holiday , Amazing location in trendy part of town Beds v comfortable Bar restaurant lively at night great buzz Staff v helpful with regard to a lost passport

266141,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Loved our stay at Sir Albert staff were all so helpful and friendly When we arrived we had a minor issue with our aircon but this was quickly resolved The hotel is in a great location with easy access to and from the centre of Amsterdam Tip It s worth getting a 24 hour tram pass if you plan on exploring the city you can purchase these at reception 
266142,Sir Albert Hotel, Noise I didn t understand corridor music being played from 7am I could hear it and it kept me from sleeping in I wanted rest Should kick in from 11am to be fair I asked for quiet room and was put on 2nd floor at the front and could hear trams and traffic They moved us to a room opposite the lift Hallway carpet a bit tired now and raised in areas so tripped up Room service has to come from neighbouring burger bar limited on choice although very nice quality Hotel restaurant is Sushi so again a required taste rather than choices But it s always busy Just not my cuisine , The location is great slightly out of town but close enough to walk or tram Great restaurants around The staff are all friendly and helpful Nice greeting and lobby area 
266143,Sir Albert Hotel, rooms are small for the price complex wifi log in breakfast expensive, close to city center and Albert Cuyp market nice design of the rooms friendly staff
266144,Sir Albert Hotel, Room is a bit cramped but actually it s design makes up for any size issues , Beautiful design and personal attention And the restaurant Izakaya is outstanding 
266145,Sir Albert Hotel, In line with many European hotels the room was on the small side Bar drinks quite expensive The weather was terrible , Room facilities were high quality Reception staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with Hotel location was good for museums Complimentary glass of wine on arrival was nice touch and supply of umbrellas came in very useful 
266146,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very welcoming and helpful when asked about local tourist attractions and hotel enquiries overall stay was excellent the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed Very good location near the museums and close to tram stops into the central area Loads of places to eat near by at reasonable prices We loved the hotel and will definitely stay there again 
266147,Sir Albert Hotel, Hotel staff keep asking if you want a glass of wine Great game avoiding eye contact with them , The location was perfect just by the Albert Market and within walking distance for all attractions Book tickets for Anne Frank s house well in advance from their website to avoid the queues Park at the Olympic Stadium if you are coming by car use the park and ride ticket queue then catch the tram into the centre and keep your ticket This means you ll pay 1 euro per day to park We stayed for 48 hours and it only cost 2 euros to park You need to keep your original tram ticket from the park and ride to get the discount Great mini break 
266148,Sir Albert Hotel, The standard room we had was very small and had very little room to move around especially with luggages in the way It s worth spending that little extra to upgrade to the deluxe room , The location the hotel concept decor and the architecture of the hotel is amazing The staff were so welcoming right from the emails they send out prior to check in The beds are so comfortable The tram stop is only 5 minute walk away Would definitely stay here again 
266149,Sir Albert Hotel, i felt the breakfast and the bar prices were too high , The staff especially Ronan were amazing Nothing was a bother I just don t know the names of the other staff members

266152,Sir Albert Hotel, The room was a little bit small In our room with a double bed the shower was like a cupboard It didn t bother me but for some people they might not like the idea of no where to dress in privacy It might have also just been our room , Staff were excellent and well informed on what to do in the local area where to eat were happy to arrange taxi s etc The room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable 
266153,Sir Albert Hotel,No Negative, Celebrating my sisters 50th Birthday as a family the hotel had her room all decorated with Ballons etc staff could not do enough for you 10 out of 10 from me
