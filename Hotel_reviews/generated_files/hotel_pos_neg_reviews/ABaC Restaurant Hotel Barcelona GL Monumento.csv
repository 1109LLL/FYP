280541,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, The room looks nice in the pictures with the big windows but in reality it is surrounded by wooden bars that make it feel like a cage windows give on the street so if the curtains are open everyone can see you especially with the tourist bus stopping right in front of the room There was dust in the room and the corridor was only cleaned once when we were there a week There is a big plasma tv in the room but no channel in English so we only watched youtube videos the staff was cold and made us feel unwelcome every day even if we stayed a week and even if the hotel was empty they didn t know our name and we had twice the reception staff looking at us and asking what we were doing there and if we were staying at the hotel each time we said seriously we think that because this is one of the most famous restaurants in Barcelona they care more about the restaurant guests than the hotel ones one evening we went to the lounge and the staff told us we dont serve food and we have no drinks menu when i asked if we can have a drink he said what do you want and we will prepare it then his colleague came with a drink menu we later saw them distributing food and understood that the lounge is used for the starters of the restaurant tasting menu and as we were not going to the restaurant we disturbed their service and were not welcome after 2 days we asked if we can cancel the rest of the stay but they said that even if we had a free cancellation rate that is only applicable if we cancel before a week and that we would need to pay for the rest of the days anyway as it s the hotel policy so not negotiable so we finished our stay there feeling trapped in prison and were shocked that no one asked us not even once why we thought about leaving and how was our experience even when we checked out they didnt ask for any feedback which confirmed that they didnt care , The room size was bigger than average Barcelona rooms
280542,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, Some of the aperitifs were not to my taste but all part of the a la carte experience, The hotel was excellent with little extras like chocolate on pillow Staff were welcoming and nothing was a problem for them Knowledgeable and friendly The meal was an experience and enhanced the family occasion which was my husbands 60th birthday 
280543,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, We paid extra for a room with a private terrace but the terrace is anything but private There are windows overlooking the terrace from all angles there is a public walkway with a bench directly opposite the terrace and a direct view from a bus stop where open top hop on hop off tour buses stop every few minutes We didn t use the sun loungers on our terrace because of this This was described as a quiet location but it s right next to a busy and noisy main road and junction Again we didn t use the terrace to relax because of this and I had to shut the terrace door at night because the traffic sounds woke me up We had read reviews of the restaurant and splashed out on a tasting menu with wine pairing This was beyond disappointing The food was so bad that we felt we were forcing ourselves to eat it out of politeness and on some of the courses we just couldn t finish it at all The menu is very fish dominated I love fish but the taste of the fish here was strong and pungent For example the first course came with a soup of plankton The extreme fishiness of the plankton was so overpowering that that s all i could taste for the next 3 courses Then the corn tacos had such an extreme saltiness it tasted like someone had dropped the top off the salt when they were preparing it I could go on As a general rule i prefer not to feel like i m gagging when eating a meal On the plus side the wine pairings were awesome I think it was this fact alone that got me through the meal And the presentation of the food was very nicely done The quality of service at the hotel was varied The lady who checked us in was very accommodating friendly and professional But when we ordered room service and dealt with someone else we asked for a drink and were told No just take something from the mini bar which wasn t very helpful as this didn t have the drink we wanted , In general the service was great the room was beautiful the bed was so comfortable the rain forest shower was incredibly relaxing the two way mirrors were fun the water left your skin feel really soft the wine at the restaurant was outstanding the room service food was tasty including a wonderful gormet breakfast and the chocolate truffles were delicious The hotel is well placed for getting into the mountains and there are good and easy transport connections to central Barcelona Overall a very nice romantic experience 
280544,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, Nothing, A very attractive garden offering peace and tranquility in the city Helpful staff and a fantastic meal in the restaurant The taste of the food was amongst the best ever eaten 
280545,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, The Spa was a little small and it only has one room to change , The room was excellent clean and luxurious as one should expect from this hotel level the breakfast was also really good the Spa was good to relax for a few hours The most amazing thing is nature coming in through the big windows and the quietness of the neighborhood 
280546,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, The location is a bit far from city center which costs about 10 euros each way If you want to go to the lobby you will need to go through the kitchen which I think isn t a good thing Other than this everything was amazing, The Attic suite was amazing It s on the rooftop floor witha huge terrace Also all glass windows which is just perfect The breakfast was included in the room rate and it is up to you to have it downstairs or in your room The staff were friendly and great 
280547,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, Wanted a room with balcony as stated in my booking got a room without they wanted 300 extra per night to upgrade me and I was paying 300 a night I offered a 100 They didn t seem to care , Breakfast gourmet hotel in excellent shape
280548,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, Massage therapy booking confused confusing which led to me countering a slightly chalenging confrontational behaviour of the receptionist on the day You have to walk through the working kitchen to get to and from rooms which is good to see but means that youre confronted by strong fish stock smells at all times Prolonged fire alarm sounded twice around 3am on first night No explanation from staff the following day or apology , Rooms very nice architecture very modern Food at the high end of the spectrum Menu adjusted for my vegetarian partner Breakfasts strong have eggs parmentier if you stay its stunning tasting menu had some high notes and some flat notes 
280549,ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento, Spa very disappointing as jacuzzi water lukewarm and steam room also cold, Very clean and most of staff very friendly and helpful Breakfasts included in price were excellent
