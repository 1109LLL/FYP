134762,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, I booked two more days which they verbally agreed to and said it was confirmed Two hours later they told me I had to leave early as they had double booked Very poor form for any hotel let alone such a relatively expensive one An experience I have not had before in all my travels , Very clean albeit very small
134763,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, all of it should be condemed, over priced asylum seeking accommodation total rip off Asked to move the 2nd night into the hotel over the road which was cheaper and got a refund on my first night
134764,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, Asked for a room with a view and got a basement room Not impressed Woken early next morning because of room renovations Not impressed Single room I booked was on second level and no elevator Not impressed , Good location 
134765,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, Check in reception very badly organised and poorly staffed Long waits poor facilities in terms of waiting area as small reception which then got packed out Hotel was fully booked but clearly not set up to manage it Despite the room clearly having been upgraded there was significant damp in the shower which meant the whole bathroom smelt of it , Room was well presented clean Excellent location
134766,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, The only thing I don t like was the small size of the room but I understand that in London this is very common to have small rooms in hotels , The bed was comfy although was small The staff were friendly and accommodating The room was made clean everyday Location was very close to Paddington station which has easy access to Heathrow airport and other train stations 
134767,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, Room and Bath were too small for the price and you ll need to go through a maze of stairs to get to your room not very comfortable , Staff were very courteous and helpful The rooms and facility are very clean good quality 
134768,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, I would never return to this hotel first point the hotel is advertised with parking facility s for the hotel in the residential area I rang the hotel the day before arriving the receptionist instructed me to ring up 1 hour before arriving at the hotel so when I did this the receptionist told me there was no car parking facility s for the hotel I was already on my way to London this upset me massively and made me angry when I arrived I parked in the area and approached the hotel I was checked in by a trainee who didn t tell me what time breakfast was just handed me my key and that was that and placed us on the highest floor with no elevator this should be stated on the add as it s absolutely shocking how many stairs you have to climb I m 26 years old which is fine but anyone older would struggle massively, Being close to Hyde park that s all that is good about this hotel
134769,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, I wish that there had been a lift to the room because there were quite a few stairs to trudge up There was also a bit of early morning construction going on outside but that can t be helped , The staff was really wonderful the room was clean and cozy and the room service was great

134772,Paddington Court Executive Rooms, When I first arrived and checked in the person helping me was not experienced but tried to be very accommodating The other lady who she had to refer to was rude condescending and very unhelpful and Untruthful The room was a closet that I could barely move around and she told me it was above a premium single When she tried to get the bell man to agree he was polite but he wasn t going to lie I was most unhappy with the room facing a brick wall bathroom was behind a fire door most inconvenient It was only after trying to heat the room for an hour with no luck it was freezing that they moved me to a slightly larger but much more comfortable room They did send a kind note afterwards with a fruit plate which made me happier but I still couldn t shake off the rudeness of the desk duty clerk If I were management I would move her to a position of less interaction with customers Other than that all was good nice place in a great location I was even able to overlook the noise of construction next building over but not the rudeness , Bell men restaurant were very helpful and courteous
