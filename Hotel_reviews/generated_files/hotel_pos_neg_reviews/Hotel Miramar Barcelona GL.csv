414166,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Nothing But if you want to be in the heart of the city it might not be for you however its only a ten minute taxi , The property was perfect for a relaxing getaway away from the busy city Very comfortable and beautiful facilities especially the bath spa and pool 
414167,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The view wasn t great in my room and the room service was very limited The breakfast in extremely overpriced, The hotel pool and grounds are amazing
414168,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, the location is a bit far from the action as for someone who wants to go around the city then it s a bit far except if you book a city tour buss ticket as it passes by next to the hotel, The view is magnificent from upper floors I didn t leave my room balcony for more than an hour for relaxing its a perfect choice
414169,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, We had a fantastic stay at Miramar I would not say it is a five star hotel but definitely a good four star Things were getting a bit tired at the edges and there seemed to be a lack of attention to detail That said the pool and the pool bar was fabulous despite closing super early 
414170,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Location would not suit everybody It is a bit out of the city but taxis are plentiful and only take about 10 minutes to most sites , Staff were excellent room was fantastic with great views over the city and sea Valet parking Breakfast was plentiful and fresh 
414171,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, You basically have to take a taxi wherever you want to go in the city otherwise you re walking up down a pretty steep hill Restaurant is very overpriced, Beautiful clean and well designed hotel It has a great view of Barcelona below especially if you go for a walk run up and around the hill it s on We stayed here on our last night in Spain because the location made it super easy to get to the airport 15 mins 
414172,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The location and having to wait up to an hour for a cab to go out at night Bar by the pool was always closed as were the toilets Not enough seating you the pool if the hotel was busy in high season Room 422 shower door hits the shower head and so can only half open the door The glass WC door does not close properly as the hinges are too tight so no privacy The cushions for the outside seats were missing and never replaced even though we asked The nearby cable car which takes you to the beach is just one car in each direction meaning the queues were very long and VERY slow took us 45 minutes not in high season Hotel should have complimentary shuttle service to and from the hotel in the evening A local bar closes at 8pm , The staff were very helpful kind and considerate Breakfast was good Room 422 was good and clean but expensive but the tiny window 60x60cm facing the sea was ridiculous 
414173,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Very noisy band playing close by until 4 am one day resulting in no sleep Too many superfluous lights in bedroom that could not be turned off Smelly drainage in bathroom Failure of wake up call possibly because telephone was unplugged the alternative knock on the door was an hour late Occasional missed supplies for bathroom and tea coffee making , Very helpful concierge services Great view from balcony Very clean 
414174,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, A bit of a walk to the nearest train station Not as central as some other hotels , Beautiful room with excellent facilities Huge bed and super comfortable We arrived early 9am and they had a room ready for us which was really nice of them Service staff were warm and welcoming Great views from the hotel 
414175,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Some of the soft furnishings are tired , The staff were exceptionally friendly everywhere in the hotel The hotel is tired in places but the location quality of food and friendliness make up for it It s only a short taxi ride from town centre and away from the noisy crowds The bed is very comfortable 
414176,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Two things arriving at the room and finding some sort of cereals vomit looking like thing dropping down my window They did come and cleaned it within less than 10 min though the fountain outside our window which made noise all night I called asking if they could turn it off but they didn t manage to do it basically keeping me awake all night There s also a club next door so if you re more or less sensitive to noise ask for a quiet room on the other end of the hotel , The overall facilities are amazingly comfortable super for relaxing Away from the whole hustle and bustle of the city center Also 15 min taxi trip to the airport when you have to fly at 6h30am it s great 
414177,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, They gave me a room that did not look anything like in the pictures of my premium room I said this to receptionist and she told me there are no other rooms available So I called booking com they sorted this out and I got a better room Still the magical feeling about having a good holiday mood was gone Would never recommend to anyone until they train their staff W is much better option and almost same price , They have their own mountain with gardens which is impressive just like the city view
414178,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Steep walk down to the town but we like walking so no problem for us , The hotel and its staff were impeccable So friendly and perfect you will not be disappointed staying here 
414179,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Would have been good if they have coffee making facilities but i asked and they gladly accommodate my request , The location is perfect close to the city centre It is located up on the hill overlooking barcelona city and the pier also surrounded by beautiful park The room is big and nice The bathroom amenities exceed my expectation The staffs are really helpful 
414180,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Unable to reduce Air Conditioning below 20 Celsius No CD player in room and very limited english speaking TV channels, Breakfast variety was extremely good Staff were always excellent Very quiet although Seat were having a conference downstairs We were upgraded on arrival to a premium Double with large terrace balcony Wow View
414181,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Location very close to City Centre but owing to its situation on top of Montjuic access to the city was difficult , Staff and panoramic views Double edged sword re views see what didn t like 
414182,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, i didnt like that the room wasnt quite fair compared to the pictures in booking especially bathroom eventhough really comfortable room , the swimming pool 
414183,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Was nearly hit In the room by parts of the ceiling Please be aware if you stay with children as these parts are heavy , The design of the hotel is perfect
414184,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Location is a bit far from city center 10 12 euro by taxi however excellent for people looking for nice view of the city and quite neighborhoods room service prices are higher than average , friendly reception staff spacious room In general excellent hotel
414185,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The bed is very soft and used the rooms need to be reworked but you forget about everything looking out of the window , If you ever visit Barcelona book this Hotel with a room to the Harbor side no matter what you will be excited I cannot imagine to stay anywhere else and would move my travel schedule if there would not be an available room Thanks to all staff members especially to Martin the recommondations he gave us were great 
414186,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, the sheet was not very clean The location is not so good need around 15 20 minutes to walk down to the metro, best view to look the full view of Barcelona and also the harbour the room is comfortable the staff was nice friendly helpful it is quiet best for holiday resort
414187,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, There was a wedding in the gardens directly behind my room I stayed at the hotel for a good rest but was kept up by the after party till around 1am I called reception 3 times Stayed here 3 4 times and never had any issues but when you spend a lot on 2 nights you expect a good nights sleep at least ,No Positive
414188,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The hotel is just starting to show its age a little bit though everything worked fine Drivers especially Tesla drivers be very careful entering the garage there s a nasty ramp which hit our battery raise your air suspension , The location of the hotel is pretty spectacular and the facilities are very good including 2 Tesla chargers one in the garage and one outside We particularly liked the very stylish bar area with very comfortable chairs and books The bed was really comfortable 
414189,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The spa was very nice and treatments were perfectly standard was just hopinging for more of a wow experience , Loved the room with a terrace Loved the location felt like we were staying in a park overlooking the city 
414190,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, There were some problems with the comming water and shower temperature and one time water stopped Repairmen come immediately what we appreciated As well count on it that it is a bit far away to centre from hotel by walk , The hotel staff was very helpful Room has great terrace with nice view Bed is really large and comfortable 
414191,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, A little disappointed in the room Poorly laid out Poor lighting especially in the bathroom Bed linen could be improved and the terrace lacked privacy and protection from the wind , Fantastic view Excellent Restaurant and bar 
414192,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, I would have preferred that the bed in my room was one double bed and not the two joined types , The staff were excellent They are responsive and offer assistance beyond what they are asked for The bathrooms are wonderful The breakfast too was great 
414193,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, General maintenance of doors walls etc to be improved Taxy availability at nigth and raining days very poor , Location top class Quality of food at breakfast really high level 
414194,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Breakfast is just ridiculously expensive We only want a coffee and croissant but this was not available Their restaurant at night served lovely food with great staff BUT if you don t like cats asking for food don t eat here This is supposed to be an up market hotel and restaurant but this really let the place down No international press either , Staff were welcoming and friendly The views from our room were excellent and the restaurant food good Bedroom was large and comfortable and clean The hotel is isolated There are only a couple of other restaurants nearby and both were expensive Good for an overnight but a longer stay would be restrictive 
414195,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The mattress wasn t to comfortable it took a few nights to get used to it I needed to lean my body to use the magnifying mirror in the bathroom because it was to close to the wall , The location was great the views were beautiful The Hotel entrance has a nice water fountain and we liked the lilies in all the rooms around the reception The housekeeping cleaned the room until late We always find all the staff very friendly polite and helpful 
414196,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Horrible staff They simply ly to you and do not give the booked room suite with a bath becomes normal room without a bath At the terrace it feels like you have to beg for something to drink or eat and horrible loud music until late every night The only exception is the personel at the pool and the spa they are great This was our second time en we will never come back there ,No Positive
414197,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The worst part was that money was stolen from my room the second day of my stay I only exchange a few hundred euros and only those got stolen I didnt put my wallet in the safe and that was the excuse for not recognizing the fact that my money was gone I didnt thought that in a expensive place like this I had to take extreme actions to secure my belongings The main security guy Diego was rude and deny the fact that an event like that could happen there but there is always a first time The manager was a little more understanding however they didnt take any responsibility Barcelona is city that you can easily get pickpocketed in the metro in the plazas with lots of tourists in fact one morning i woke up and from my room at Miramar Ive heard lots of commission in the plaza down below some people were running and screaming calling the police The food in the restaurant took more than 40 minutes to arrive and it was only a couple of salads and a plate of nachos , Beautiful location nice staff
414198,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Room Service Food Menue was not that good unfortunately We got little options in it and no PIZZA which is our main meal in Non Muslim Country and the Pasta was not well cooked Still the great staff makes you accept that , Outstanding customer service and guests needs followup by all hotel employees specially the below guys should have special thanks with regards Jonathan Front Desk S Visor Alejandro Front Desk Marcello Bellboy Louis Trainee Since they were very cooperative and doing well not only with us we saw them dealing with all guests Shortly The hotel knew how to choose their employees perfecrly It was our 1st visit to them but sure it wont be the last one we really enjoyed our stay Swimming pool area was great in all areas Thanks alot guys 
414199,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Sorry Miramar but it has to be repeated and it s what the other reviewers keep mentioning the pool area and lack of sunbeds Please listen to your reviewers there is a grassy area there begging for some decking and sunbeds which would be far more comfy for the guests than having to lie on towels on the grass where there were lots of wasps lurking That was my only minus in an otherwise flawless report , I choose our hotel properties based on other reviews hotel websites pictures and I guess a bit of intuition It is always a pleasure to find that the intensive research pays off and Hotel Miramar is no exception It delivers all it promises and the staff are a credit particularly the very hardworking pool bar and restaurant staff who diligently look after you fetching and carrying in the baking heat whilst always smiling The bedrooms are exceptional and without doubt possibly the best for all round comfort and location the views from our balcony of practically everywhere including port beach sea were simply stunning Lovely Molton Brown toiletries and the comfiest bed and pillows Awesome location property and staff Oh and the breakfasts Pricy at 28 euro per person there were 6 of us but it was delicious and beautifully presented and provided by yet another set of amazing staff Just a tip if you are more than a party or family of 4 it is going to be difficult hailing a roadside cab to accommodate extra people so better to give reception some due notice if you need transport 
414200,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Just the breakfast it didn t have any taste and not a lot of options, Me and fianc loved the pool and the bartenders there So relaxing and the pool has a nice view of the sea side and some of the city it was so chilled and amazing to relax in the pool Loved it We will return for sure 
414201,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, Peaceful atmosphere with great views from the hotel The staff were excellent on reception and in the hotel Staff around the pool bar were overworked but did very well to meet our needs We had massages in the spa and all staff in the spa were very good The massages were fantastic A great experience and we will be back 
414202,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Broken shower which took all day to fix despite multiple calls request for ice took a trip down to reception after 4 calls to room service and already used condiments with our room service we had to request more as all were nearly empty took away some of the sparkle , Amazing views over Barcelona you cannot beat them from the hotels position on the hill top Super friendly people Beautiful hotel
414203,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Everything, Fantastic hotel I dont say this lightly as I have travelled a bit but one of the best hotel and locations I have ever stayed All staff were superb we will be back Great location for nice break Danny Lillington
414204,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Unfortunately they don t seem to have enough sun beds and their new umbrellas are useless as they are too light in any wind My friend got hit by a falling one on the arm Staff are apologetic but don t seem too concerned , Bed was extremely comfy Great location above Barcelona so if you want to relax rather than be a complete tourist then it s a perfect location 
414205,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The poolside bar food could have been a little better for the beautiful quality of the hotel and the three staff seemed a little overwhelmed with a full guest load in the sunshine, Reception Staff were lovely rooms the spa and the hotel itself loaction incredible and it felt like you had the space of being in the country with gardens grass and endless views of the port and city of Barcelona Drinks On the terrace at sunset the room service rigatoni bolognese was one of the best ive tasted
414206,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Breakfast is really nothing special for the price The decoration of the rooms is ok but could be better kind of cold Level of service is really standard for a 5 , Located is a little remoted but the view is outstanding make sure to get rooms with sea view or really not worth the location Rooms have a really nice size 
414207,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Pre paid almost 500 a night and then realized when I got there the rate had gone down over 100 a day Also concierge was helpful in booking specific tickets but didn t advise that we might want to prebook other exhibits which would have been helpful , Nice hotel but a bit out of the way Would have been a good couples hotel Very nice view from the balcony 
414208,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, No metro stop at this location since it is on Montjuic Rooms are a little pricey, Great views of the whole port from room balcony nearly all rooms have balcony Nearby attractions on Montjuic including Castle which also had great views Wide variety of food at breakfast for 20 a day Very quiet peacefull facility 20 minute walk to Las Ramblas Awesome room service try the Iberian Ham or croquettes Bring a Intl power adapter for U S plugs
414209,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Being mugged in the Barcelona Olymipic Park So a strange women walked up to my partner and asked us to fill in a petition to get disabled access to go up the stairs Before I knew it a man came out of no where and asked me to do the same Then as we were walking away the pair came with their piece of paper and started banging it saying a donation X as I went to get the loose change out of my wallet the man started banging even hard on the paper and what was very clever the woman must have taken all of my cash because when I got back to my hotel my wallet was empty So be careful do not get caught out Another review point that I worried about was the fact that there was a shooting range right next door If you have a room around the back and side I imagine that it would have been loud but if you pay to stay at the front it has hardly noticeable , The hotels situated up on Mount Juce and over looks the harbour We had paid the extra for a suite that was at the front of the hotel with a gorgeous balcony 519 I had read lots of reviews about paying the extra for the suite and I can honestly say it was worth it The staff were so helpful I had a really bad headache in the middle of the night and with no paracetamol the porter had organised a taxi to go to the local pharmacy and brought me paracetamol within 20mins The smellies in the room were loccitaine and the there was a little spa shop where you could buy goods The bar food room service and restaurant were all yummy I would go back and recommend this hotel to anyone The open top bus trip stop is right out front A taxi down into the Center was only 10 12 euros and the walk is not too bad down the hill 
414210,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, We asked for a late checkout on a Monday and we were told the hotel was fully booked and they needed all the rooms However we stayed at the hotel until 3pm and the hotel didn t seem full at all We had the feeling the answer was quite mechanical The lady who did our check in seemed to be totally uninterested in what we had to say Some of the personnel at the restaurant was very attentive though Very limited amount of amenities in the bathroom Having a L Occitane spa I would have expected to have some bath salts or bath oil at the bath Just one of each in the shower The furniture in the room was in need of touch ups Most of the big double sunbeds at the pool had a reserved sign but nobody was around Music was too loud and commercial for the morning Pool service only spoke English and not very friendly Some personnel should be told to smile , Glass of very good cava on arrival Luggage taken to the room while having a drink Huge bed good linen Terrace with views of the park and the port of Barcelona Good selection of food at breakfast and good service Good service at dinner time too The pool area was nice but lacking shade Bottle of water courtesy of the hotel with nice chocolates 
414211,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The shower could have been cleaner under the concrete slabs They needed more beds by the pool One of the pool bar staff maybe needed more training, Generally very attentive and helpful staff who went out of their way to give information and help Comfortable room
414212,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The young blonde lady working a the pool bar could have been more professional by not outwardly showing her stress and annoyance , The bed was very comfortable
414213,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Expensive area for food and drinks Few restaurants in immediate vicinity Renovation in bar area meant bar closed early and we were not made aware of this beforehand Noise from shooting range at back of hotel and hotel should make customers aware this is what the noise is , Massive beautiful room with large patio Very attentive staff Lots of choice for breakfast even dim sums Location perfect for us as we were going to a concert in the Olympic stadium Also excellent location for cable car to Barceloneta Scenic cafe bar overlooking port area Pleasant downhill walk to city Beautiful pool area 
414214,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Service both for room service and restaurant was very slow but fortunately we were not in a rush , Bed was super comfy and room well appointed I asked to borrow a kettle as none was provided so that I could have tea in the room Great location with fantastic views room 605 has enormous balcony with views of port and city Food at breakfast and dinner was delicious 
414215,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Entrance area of the hotel is very industrial looking and don t fit with the rest of the hotel The food in the restaurant is great but very expensive They could do with a bit more choice on the bar menu , Pool area is great
414216,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Remote location meant some effort in getting to and from the nighttime action Some aspects of the hotel rooms are a little tired and almost threadbare , Staff were great Very attentive polite and helpful Remote location meant quiet and privacy 
414217,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, 2 corporate bookings a wedding and a prom meant two sleepless nights we would have expected to be told beforehand especially as these events went on until 3 30am , Staff were excellent and having stayed before we know they are consistent
414218,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Sauna not on Builders tiling in the indoor pool Ants in our room dealt with Price of accommodation food drinks extortionate , View from the huge balcony was second to none Room 605 Comfy Bed and lovely room Staff dealt well with a problem we encountered Good Breakfast Clean 
414219,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The toilet door was very noisy which isn t good when you have a 5 month old Could do with a pillow selection , The bath was excellent The gardens beautiful The views of barcelona are unbelievable but you are ontop of a mountain 
414220,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The room was not what I expected when I booked The image on the Booking com website was misleading and I ended up in a small room I booked it because it specified it was spacious but when checking in the hotel said the price was linked to the view I was disappointed and as the hotel was full I couldn t be moved , Good location peaceful nice atmosphere Really lovely staff who couldn t be more helpful 
414221,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The water in the swimming pool was dirty , the room was nice and quiet The view on the mountain was amazing you can have a panorama of the Barcelona harbor 
414222,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The spa needs a brush up Atmosphere not very friendly and old fashioned Missed a room to chill , Location is fantastic We had a nice and quiet room with view on the harbor and the city Lounge bar and restaurant are excellent 
414223,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Spa and pool is tired and needs a refit Without a car it may feel a little remote but is only a 10min drive to pretty much everywhere , Beautiful suite with 270 degree view over Barcelona Huge private terrace with sun loungers and chairs to relax Large room with large sliding doors windows facing the sea Friendly hotel staff Excellent quality breakfast with a lovely terrace overlooking the park at Montjuic Good 5 course degustation dinner as well Also enjoyed the Nespresso machine in the room and at breakfast A sanctuary of peace and quiet with the energy and diversity of Barcelona on the door step
414224,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, This is 5 stars hotel so expectations are adequate to this Unfortunately the hotel did not meet them The list of shortcomings could be very long but I ll mention the most important Untrained staff not speaking English and not capable to answer any questions Tragic service restaurant during breakfast or lunch lack of products on breakfast but they pull your plate to finish faster Room cleaning lasts forever we were leaving about 12 and coming back at 17 to untidy room After leaving for pool outside the door shuts automatically you can not return unless passing the restaurant In conclusion hotel in need of renewal and with incompetent service which pretends 5 stars Curiosity was to block double money on my card which I failed so far to recover Definitely avoid this place , localization bar
414225,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Was very happy , Great location great views amazing room with bath situated in room friendly staff super comfortable beds and nice breakfast Lucky to get a special price on booking com and made a great 3 days in barcelona The staff were even able to assist with checking in early and also able to help book tours and advise for dinner spots etc Highly recommend 
414226,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Hotel lounge background music , The staff were always very professional helpful and friendly The location is great close to the city centre but peace and calm at the end of the day The views are superb 
414227,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, The breakfast included was fantastic and hugely helpful loooooooved my room with a super comfy bed and gorgeous view with a terrace overlooking the port Beautiful decor and loved the pool Easy access to taxis as well Great staff that were extremely helpful 
414228,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Having to leave the position of the hotel is on a hill top with great views stunning this could be an issue for less mobile people however if you love the views you can t have it all not an issue for us we loved it, Outstanding service from the moment we arrived until we left premium room definitely worth the plump do breakfast as well as its very tasty
414229,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Can t say I had anything to complain about, Personal touch all staff are so freindly We had dinner in the hotel which we found to be outstanding if you are looking at the booking and think I won t bother with breakfast DONT pay that small fee and enjoy so good
414230,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, They counted me the item from the minibar which I did not use but I noticed after arrival home , Very nice wiew from the executive room upstairs nice breakfast
414231,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Staf staff staff is very rude specially managers such Xavi the manager when I asked him I check in hotel midnight and my flight is departing at 18 00 next day I request late check out and he advice cannot extend and very disappointing and he is not up the the level of 5 start Hotel manager , Room is very comfortable and clean and the size of the room so big 
414232,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, It is out of the main town very hard to access steep steps we counted 280 steps very dusty and impossible with luggage thank god we didn t bring the kids If you come for the city and want to be eating out and exploring then this is a little too off the beaten track for my liking Also the hotel is a 5 but didn t refresh towels or water toiletry s in the rooms which I would expect at any hotel especially one of this standing , A lovely setting and a very nice hotel on first glance Spa is in need of a good lick of paint walls peeling shabby locker rooms the staff in the spa very good but just looked tired Hotel View amazing originally placed in the gardens asked for a sea view we got a city sea view which was lovely Food and drinks very expensive in comparison to the city itself but within 5 prices so not too bad 
414233,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The climb up to the hotel is quite steep but we chose to do it There are plentiful taxis if you re not up to it Great views of the city , Fabulous hotel and staff We were offered an upgrade of room at a reasonable price but stuck with the Luxe room Room was great couldn t fault it Staff were helpful and very friendly 
414234,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, We used the lounge area quite a lot during our stay Very comfortable The Hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla but conveniently located in the park where there is lots to explore and discover Great views over Barcelona 
414235,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, I stayed at the hotel 3 nights and I am very pleased with my choice of the hotel The hotel staff was utmost helpful professional yet not intrusive Every little request I made was attended to immediately I was hesitating whether to order breakfast or not because it is on the expensive side but I am glad that I chose to have breakfast at the hotel what you get is definitely worth the money you pay for it and it includes good quality traditional Spanish food 
414236,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The rooms are a little bit old Needs to be renovated , Very friendly Staff Super Service I can highly recommend the restaurant I will come back again Dutch service crew did an amazing job 
414237,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The breakfast is bad Not equivalent to such cost of room breakfast Very little shower gel in the room only 1 small bottle , Location atmosphere and the balcony
414238,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, Perfect location and a great view over the city Modern furniture and comfortable beds Nice restaurant and spa center Staff kind and helpful Special thanks to Manuel from the Reception desk a man with a personality 
414239,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, you need taxi to go to the center but not worth to be angry about if you feel home in an quiet charming place, Just a great view over the city and quiet stay on the hill surrounded by an amazing park
414240,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The room next door to me was being renovated which meant I woke up to builders on my balcony one morning The reception were great and got them to stop right away There was also drilling next door on my last day I understand hotels have to keep up with maintenance but it was a little disappointing , The view was amazing the bed massive and comfy The shower was like being in a monsoon in a good way The indoor pool was lovely and warm and everywhere was clean and well looked after 
414241,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, I booked a premium room and expected to have a bathtub in the middle of the room just like in the picture but we just got a normal room with a good view I called the reception about this and they told me that a premium room means a room at the front of the hotel unlike what was promised when I booked the room They promised to give us another premium room the next morning There was a huge difference between the two rooms which I don t think is fair for customers who both book a premium room The service was helpful but i wish the whole misunderstanding could have been prefented in the first place , I liked the view and the location
414242,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, There s a shooting club at the back of the hotel and the noise can be heard but it s not too loud May get annoying if you have a room at the back and wish to spend time on your balcony , The staff were so friendly and inviting The spa facilities were lovely and the rooms extremely clean The breakfast was extensive and the chef will cook specific items to order if they are not generally available 
414243,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Check in at 3pm but that s just my personal dislike I understand most places over the weekends are booked up and don t have availability for early check in , Very friendly and accommodating staff
414244,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The only downside was a constant background engine rumble from the Port This was NOT a problem in the room but was a bit annoying on the balcony, Beautiful setting overlooking port Very comfy room and nice breakfast Easy access to reasonably priced terrace bar serving Sandwiches to Pizza and Pasta Superb Wifi if you need to keep in touch 
414245,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Be aware of sport shooting gallery before your windows Shoot every 15 sec all day long from 8 am non comparable impression, 75 discount in offseason made price smart
414246,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, Great 5 star hotel one of the best in Barcelona Is out of the way great views and isolated from English tourist noise but a 5 minute walk to La Rambla
414247,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The garden view room is extremely noisy in the morning afternoon times due to the close proximity of the shooting field You would hear every single bullet from different weapons like if it was next to your room , Friendly staff at the reception polite smiles everywhere beautiful views garden see spacious rooms 
414248,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The room we booked was not available for the first night The hotel warned us 2 hours before our plane took off This is not acceptable for such an hotel They couldn t arrange for another room in the same hotel even for a lower standard one They finally find a room in another hotel When we arrived at the hotel the front desk people seem to be unaware of our situation They finally upgraded our room where restroom had no door and offered the breakfast for the morning after Again the people in the breakfast room was not aware that we ve been offered the breakfast What a surprising lack of communication for such an hotel , The room was comfortable except the restroom had no door 
414249,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, The hotel was just fabulous is in an amazing position overlooking the city marina port We stayed in a suite could not not fault a thing The staff were extremely friendly particularly young Roberto The service was fantastic We will definitely return in the near future 
414250,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The hot buffet breakfast was the worst I have ever had At 9 45 each morning the heater under the containers were all out The bacon was freezing Could not eat it Did not see anyone take the hot items but the rest of the breakfast was fine , The room and balcony were exceptional One of the best I have stayed in 
414251,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, there is no water heater and tea you have to ask them for water heater but with charge no near supermarket, the view to the city and balcony very nice quit location
414252,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL,No Negative, Loved the location a little way out of town on Mont Juic with beautiful views over Barcelona yet just a short walk from LasRambelas Hotel very luxurious and special nice and quiet 
414253,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Lack on sunbeds around the pool guests had to use towels on the grass not very 5 star Other than that it was perfect , The location was fantastic with the most amazing views 
414254,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, The staff does not have enough knowledge on touristic areas within Barcelona They are not flexible enough and too slow In other words they are NOT helpful whether it s regarding to your hotel service system taxi to anything about Barcelona It s a five start hotel but definitely not worth four stars , The bed and the view was nice
414255,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Washing room utility not user friendly two very big washing basin with no place for facial care or cleansing utensils Bath tub too large and slippery cannot sit probably and if not careful can drown you and very difficult to get out of the tub No hanger to put your underwear or cloth in the washroom Air conditioner outlet in the corridor take a very long time to cool down the room Very near ship terminal with a bit sound and air pollutio, Good location best view in Barcelona Very classy interior Staff very friendly and helpfull

414260,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Bathroom floor was not clean It was difficult to communicate with some of the staff ok they were not really client facing staff but you still may need to ask things from them as they did not speak any English It is a bit far from the old town you may not see it from maps when booking but they are on a fairly steep hill , Luxury just as a five star hotel should be We loved the outside pool the friendly staff there the views from the hotel and that we received a lot of attention whatever our request was 
414261,Hotel Miramar Barcelona GL, Room was not as clean as one would expect for the star rating some bathroom facilities were broken and were not fixed as promised Not enough sun loungers to accommodate even half the guests no shaded areas for those who wished to stay out of sun 28 Euros per day for buffet breakfast which was very basic and not worth 10 Euros unless you want to eat copious amounts of bread products , Staff were friendly and and the location was good
