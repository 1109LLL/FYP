145816,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, rooms a bit worn out housekeepers warehouse next to my room and every morning and evening too much noise poor gym, Great location nice staff breakfast good
145817,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Too small bed for a couple large double bed is just 151x180 queen size there was no other nice room left at the time and nobody did so much for offering something better along our stage Every day exactly the same food at breakfast and we stayed there for six days , The location and the kindness of employees at the restaurant
145818,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Open doorway to street from breakfast area created quite a draught when opened , Friendly and helpful staff Hotel very comfortable Expensive but easy access to everything we wanted to visit 
145819,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, N A, The location was great Near to all the BARs on SOHO china town 2 min from the hotel Excellent B F very good buffet Go out from the hotel directlly to the square and its look like time square on mini The staff in the hotel was amazing every question they help 5min walk to the casino
145820,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Double and twin rooms are small bathroom easy to flood as the shower is over the bath and the screen moves Access to hotel is via the pedestrian square so transfer drivers we did not fit in the taxi do not know how to come to front door Hotel staff can solve that but you need to know to contact them , Location is excellent and staff reception and concierge are very helpful Did not try restaurant but bar downstairs had very good service and small meals 2 tube stations and all West End attractions close by Overall had very good time during our stay
145821,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The bar could be separate from the restaurant , Location in Leicester square and staff very friendly and helpful very clean and tidy and nothing was ever a problem for the staff
145822,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The breakfast was nice but not enough variety No fresh vegetables at all The room was small and so was the bed , Staff was nice and helpful location was great
145823,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Being short I would have preferred a low table at breakfast but only the tall ones were available, Everything we asked for was given with a smile The concierge in particular Rooms very comfy and clean 
145824,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Room doors made a loud noise when closing it disturbed us every time people in other rooms nearby went in or out The key cards to make the elevator go and also open the room were a HUGE pain they kept malfunctioning no matter how we stored them I went through at least 5 during our 4 night stay This was extremely irritating when we returned late at night and had to keep going back to the front desk for new keys They need a better system so as not to annoy their guests , Location very friendly staff spacious room for central London clean comfortable good bar restaurant 
145825,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Bed and pillows very comfy staff very helpful and friendly view from room amazing Breakfast delicious Great location I would highly recommend this Hotel
145826,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Shame my partner couldn t get a coffee in the bar after returning from a theatre show not even a real complaint that s how good the stay was , The staff were superb Friendly professional and accommodating The hotel is amazing Great room overlooking Leicester Square Large comfy bed 
145827,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Only complaint is the mattresses seemed slightly worn out there was a slight dip in mine and I had to rotate and flip the mattress which helped My daughter loved hers though , Great location and great service The staff were exceptional and very accommodating We used the Underground Tube to get around London very easy to figure out and the hotel was beside of the Leicester Square station so perfect location Also within walking distance of SOHO and theatres Perfect location really 
145828,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Pricey as we only booked a couple of weeks in advance for the price of breakfast it would be nice to have full size plates rather than a side plate Rooms are showing a little wear and tear and for a king deluxe room I would have expected a walk in shower and not a shower over bath , Excellent location quiet and clean rooms great staff Would stay again 
145829,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Happy with everything, The hotel is in a fabulously central location the staff were all very friendly and welcoming Our room on the 6th floor had great views of London the Leicester Square restaurant in the hotel is newly opened and the food is fantastic

145831,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The rooms are starting to look quite tired and in need of refurbishing , The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly Nothing was too much trouble 
145832,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, room keys not working we kept changing the keys all the time construction on site fitness centre was closed due to construction was not mentioned prior to my visit fire alarm went on 05am and no explanation from the management bathroom extremely hot no vantilation , location breakfast staff
145833,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Staff In General was very very courteous Reception was very professional and make us feel welcome Specially Dimitris the barman What a wonderful guy he was we will def go back to the same hotel next time we visit London Thank You very much all of you I wish every success to owner management 
145834,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The photos of the rooms as advertised on Booking are misleading The photos used for specifically our superior room turned out to be photos of suites Our superior room was very different a o much smaller and completely different bathroom old The whole room interior was old outdated the paint in the windows was old and the door to our room could not even open completeley because a table was in the way the room was that small The whole hallway was also outdated and the elevators are the slowest elevators I have ever experienced When we complained about the room not matching the photos used on Booking and therefore not being worth the money the hotel offered us an upgrade to the nicest suite they had for the next night This suite turned out to be on the first floor with as view the Tkts ticket office for cheap theater shows and the cue in front of it We fealt like we were literally in the display window of a store no privacy whatsoever so we closed the curtains even though it was still day The suite turned out to be directly above the bar restaurant and at night it felt like they were playing the music from the bar restaurant IN our room that loud eventhough it was a Sunday night We had to call the reception twice and finally around midnight they shut down the music As said it was a Sunday night and that was probably the reason why there was no music noise from the square but on Fridays Saturdays you will probably have a lot of noise we heard the noise on the 6th floor in a room at the back of the hotel the night before , Breakfast was great 
145835,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Too small size of double bedroom Only the bigger size of upper thin mattress which is very inconvienient, Wonderful beakfast feeling of very special treatment in dining room Modern design of dining room Very friendly doorman Wonderful location to visit several theaters in tha area 
145836,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, We were happy with our whole experience but there is no doubt the staff stood out to us They were INCREDIBLY helpful and went out of there way to accomodate our needs The food breakfast and dinner were delicious 
145837,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, We asked for a disabled room was told room was not available when checking in so was offered another room on first floor with a walk in shower or a room on 7th floor looked at both decided on 1st floor room but started unpacking only to have drilling going on so loud and then jack hammering told reception was told it was not going on long but went on for a while so decided to go to 7th floor room which was not what I class as a superior which we should have had the tv was stuck in the corner on top of a chest of draws which was actually a mini bar all furniture looked dated no draws to fit clothes in shower over bath which you could not hold onto the handle in the bath to get out as the half glass shower screen opened right on top of the toilet so had to get out down the end of the bath so nothing to hold on to my wife has joint problems so was not easy for her at all Then you had the bathroom door in the way This was a belated birthday present for my wife was not impressed as I thought for the price I paid it would have been a lot lot better did speak to hotel but was told they was full so could not do anything gave us a bottle of wine for problems we had hardly a good return for the price I paid this room did not even have a fridge in to store medication or water , Location
145838,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Drawer space a little limited Closet taken up with an overlarge ironing board not necessary My one concern was the bath While water was hot and plentiful the tub was much too deep Being a senior although still fairly agile I had difficulty getting out of the tub and thought it was dangerous The bars on the tub itself were inadequate Hand bars need to be set in the wall I m actually surprised nobody s been injured although maybe they have , Most of all I would say the staff especially the front desk Would like to mention two members Philippe and Monika They were so charming helpful and good humoured We enjoyed chatting with them It was also very quiet in our room which was perfect but I understand another guest staying at the front of the hotel wasn t so lucky I know London well and that s why I picked Leicester Square as base location to show my granddaughter the city where I came from 
145839,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Great location very central close to galleries theatres and shops The breakfast selection was good and beautifully presented All the staff were very helpful and friendly the bar was modern and crisp looking with a nice calm atmosphere 
145840,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I specifically booked a twin room since it was a business trip but upon check in I was advised all twin rooms were booked out and would a double be ok and I advised that I booked a twin room They put a spare pull out bed in the room which was like a camping bed Very uncomfortable and not what I had paid for so extremelly disappointing and feel mislead Would expect a refund based on the fact I was not provided with the room advertised and paid for , Friendly and great staff Great location Great breakfast 
145841,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Some complimentary biscuits or nibbles along with a wider tea coffee selection would have been nice , Very comfortable bed Excellent breakfast Friendly reception staff

145849,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, It was undergoing refurbishment and no breakfast was available therefore we had to go elsewhere I think the price we paid was too much for what we actually got and used , Very friendly helpful staff The hotel was very clean and fragrant The location is hard to beat 
145850,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Our room was the worst nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel room We use hotels a lot and travel extensively The noise from the street went on until 4am in the morning followed by a half Hour of comparative peace before the loud morning noises Our windows were fully closed They should NEVER book that room We felt conned we told reception when we checked out who said they would look into it and email me We have not had any feedback This can not be first complaint perhaps they give the very worst room to 1 night stays , Staff helpful and pleasant breakfast very good Breakfast room very overcrowded

145863,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I really feel that rooms should have been on a vastly reduced rate absolutely awful building noise drilling banging etc no bar or breakfast room no room service horribly dusty lifts not working , The reception staff particularly Annaise and Sonny on the door were excellent She moved us from an terrible noisy room to a higher floor so we could nearly hear ourselves think over building work Annaise was the ONLY person who apologised to us for all the inconvenience

145865,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Due to renovations there was just a very simple breakfast We were informed about this by email and stayed only for 1 night so it wasn t so bad , The location was absolutely perfect Staff were very friendly and very helpful The room and the bed were small but comfortable We arrived early but were already able to check in

145867,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Not informed of a massive building project next door at time of booking very noisy Restaurant bar closed on our last night due to refurbishment without any notice to the guests No cooked breakfast on the last day due to the closure the only option was a continental breakfast grab bag delivered to the room , Location is perfect for theatre land and exploring London
145868,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, A little exposed in the suite overlooking the park square due to the level of the park in regards to the big curved windows at the front of the room Wanted to keep the curtains closed to keep half of london looking in on us , Helpful staff city centre location with good access to bars and transport

145871,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Not being informed prior to booking about the building works going on Cramped room Not being given the room we reserved The most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on Would have found sleeping on the floor more comfortable Bed was like concrete and pillows were too big with no cushioning , Nothing stood out Overshadowed but such poor value for money the cramped room and extremely uncomfortable bed Overall a bad experience 
145872,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, A male member of staff entered the room without any warning without knocking to retrieve items used by previous guests in the minibar I asked the reception staff to remind staff to knock before walking in on guests and they weren t interested They didn t even ask for my room number It left me feeling really uncomfortable and uneasy in the room Very disappointed , Location 
145873,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The noise levels from the bars and clubs were dreadful through the night In hindsight we should have requested a quiet room Sound proofing could be improved , Extremely friendly attentive and helpful staff 
145874,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Bathroom was showing its age the bath taps were very stiff and not intuitive, Location fantastic staff friendly and very helpful Would have liked a slightly larger room with a view over the square But our room was clean and very pleasant We will stay here again
145875,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Noise from adjacent building and modifications to kitchen Whilst these were unavoidable we should have been advised during booking process Bed extremely hard and uncomfortable Dinner was disappointing the breaded pork belly smelt of fish possibly fried in same oil as fish dishes however pork inside was ok Fish and chips was poor compared to previous time we stayed and the fish appeared in a similar manner to that of frozen packaged fish , All staff were exceptional 
145876,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The room given had a smell and the bathtub was not clean they did upgrade us eventually but the room given was overlooking buildings rather than the square , The location is the best thing about this hotel

145883,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Fish chips Fri 17 overcooked did not enjoy In Room dining overcooked chips with pannini uninspiring not good value for money Having to pay for the tray used to bring the food to room is one we have not come across before What next will appear as a charge use of napkin or cutlery Access to safe in room was difficult for someone of my stature might be ok for a six footer , Breakfast
145884,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Bar staff not very good Had to keep going up to the bar for drinks Then when I paid the bill I was charged a service charge The bacon was cremated So I didn t have any Didn t seem to have enough staff Kept having to wait and ask for drinks cereal etc at Breakfast My latte came in a small tea cup and was Luke warm no one about to get it changed , The staff at check in were very friendly A nice location The hash browns and sausages were great A nice view from our room 
145885,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I would have appreciated a greater variety of teas in the room the lift required room keys to be inserted into a slot to work and this was temperamental Restaurant was out of the only gluten free vegetarian option The double glazing wasn t enough to keep the noise of the Leicester Square crowds out , Bed was very comfortable staff were helpful location was excellent 
145886,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, There is a massive construction site next door They are still working underground at the moment so wasn t too disturbing but I can imagine it being a bit louder in a few months time , Amazing location directly on Leicester Square a short walk from Picadilly Chinatown Covent Gardens Trafalgar Square We stayed in the very spacious 1 bedroom suite perfect for families Room was clean and modern Staff friendly and accommodating would definitely book again

145888,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, There was no space for a drink before dinner they told me they had converted the bar area to restaurant space as it was a Saturday and the front of bar staff were very disengaged in this area better elesewhere Some of the breakfast hot food was cold as was my burger at dinner The dining room was crammed with tables it just felt that they were trying get to get every last pound out of the area with customer service and comfort unimportant , Bed was very comfortable and room was a good size Concierge was pleasant and helpful 
145889,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I would have liked to turn off the air conditioning in order to get some natural ventilation and cooler fresh air Unfortunately the windows were locked so we had to use the air conditioning not very green Also I would have liked the option of various grapefruit at breakfast , The bed was very comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean On arrival the staff were very welcoming and the iced fruited water was most refreshing Soon after arrival we had an unexpected birthday cake which was lovely The view of Leicester Square from our room on the third floor was spectacular especially at night Several times one of the Concierge staff went out in the cold and rain to get a taxi to collect us from the hotel entrance which was much appreciated I travel all over the world and have stayed in some magnificent hotels including the Radisson Blu in Berlin Kahalla Hilton in Hawaii and Dusit Thani in Bangkok We had a pleasant stay in your hotel and must say your biggest asset is your staff who absolutely understand the meaning of excellent personal customer service they are to be commended A special mention for Ryan in the restaurant who went above and beyond our expectations 
145890,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, The room fantastic with view over square Bed magnificent best nights sleep on this trip to uk Dining room meals adequate for price but perhaps a little more upmarket would make dining in more appealing overall no complaints only good memories
145891,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Food disappointing not a big choice for breakfast and it was cold Had dinner one evening poor choice and the gammon was burnt black The taxies do not come to the door you have to walk from the end of the street which is annoying when it is raining , Room very comfortable with a lovely view over Leicester Square 
145892,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The lifts were very slow The bed mattress was very stiff and the pillows too The room was a bit smaller than we expected , The free wi fi had a strong signal big plus Location excellent 
145893,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Breakfast wasn t great beans were hard and cold no sourdough fries bread though we got the best crossoints ever and egg was cold and like rubber , We arrived early and left our bags before exploring we checked in early and our bags were in our room already the bed was so comfy the shower was the best ever and it was so quiet and peaceful 
145894,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, If I had to say anything negative I would say the mattress was a bit hard for my liking but was lovely And a bit warm which can t be too bad as I could open the window , Staff super friendly and lovely place Nice touches like sweets in the reception and fruit flavoured water We left our bags there for the day as we arrived early and they were put in our rooms by the time we got there

145900,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Put in a very awkward situation booked twin room 2 ladies sharing but not available offer of a single camp bed added to room but would have been tight to move around or single bedding x2 not at all what was expected paying 244 a night can not trust to stay with Radison again, Lovely building good decor
145901,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Had to wait for the lift for about half an hour in the morning to go out Our room was next to a very noisy private staff service room there was constant noise all night from people coming and going and things falling , Good location
145902,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The decor is a bit out dated and please turn down the volume of the music in the reception Sounded like a night club and it was very difficult to hear what the staff was saying , Friendly staff who very accommodating to our needs

145916,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Not a lot of food variety however the food is good , This hotel has a great location Is at a walking distance from all the important things to do and see There are a lot of restaurants around it and the underground is just half of a mile The hotel is clean and comfortable the staff super helpful Food is good Great Hotel 
145917,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The mini bar prices where quite high to say how much you pay for the room The shower switched from hot to cold in room 412, The room was amazing so homely and the view was unreal The staff were to friendly and welcoming
145918,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Room was not warm Rather cold even set the air condition system to the highest temperature Suppose as window has been getting old and worn out sealing was not good enough and outside air was into the room , This was our 2nd time to stay here Good location Center of the city and easy to move around London Could see New Year s fireworks from our room 
145919,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, A bit expensive but perhaps that s just London , Concierge staff and front desk all very helpful and pleasant Great location for soho Covent Garden etc

145921,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Room service was rather slow on occasions , Amazingly central location enhanced by the presence of the Christmas Market Very attentive and friendly staff 
145922,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The hotel facilities are very old I was assigned to room 319 but the whole room seems not updated for long time For example the bathtub finish is flaking off So I asked to switch to a new room Guess what Room 419 same thing bathtub finish is flaking off So I switch to room 621 at least the bathtub seems repaired , I really like the location
145923,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I was told I couldn t have a hot plate for the hot buffet food at breakfast as there was a cold plate on my table No marmite, View over London Quiet Smiley staff
145924,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Firstly the breakfast service was really poor Rude staff ordered eggs didn t arrive until an hour later second morning ordered a vegetarian breakfast did not arrive we had Christmas dinner for 12 really small portions for 75 per head and our starter bruschetta was full of salt not tasty at all We paid over 800 for a Christmas meal which was awful will never be returning to yourselves, Nothing
145925,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Building site outside my window but that wasn t their fault Also a lot of dust in the air in the bedroom , Fantastic location Great staff Nice room with comfy beds

145929,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, There was building work going on next to the hotel and a generator appeared to be left on through the night which kept waking us up , Location really good comfortable clean rooms and upgraded on arrival which was unexpected 
145930,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The Breakfast was not very good little choice and not everyone wants all the healthy foods especially if you are on a leisure break The hot buffet left a lot to be desired tomatoes tossed in with the beans as one example staff should keep a check on the hot buffet We didn t find a lot of the staff in the restaurant particularly helpful no one smiled felt pretty miserable really as if we were an inconvenience No where to sit in the evening if you just wanted a drink Seats very minimal , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful Room was good 
145931,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Bed was a bit small but that s only because I m used to a 6ft bed , The room was very comfortable I checked in online and went straight up to the room with no hassle Excellent location as we were at a premiere in Leicester Square so couldn t get any closer 
145932,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Booked to stay with my mum in a signature suite for our Xmas shopping weekend in London staff were fantastic room was amazing location was great we had a great time I ve actually already booked for a few weeks time with my husband and requested the same room number 
145933,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Both twon singles beds in our room were very old with sagging uncomfortable mattresses We both left like we were sleeping in camp cots , The staff were fantastic and the location was very convenient 
145934,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Booked a twin room was told there was none available I would not except a double so eventually they found me a twin Stained Sheets on one bed Water in Shower not very Hot TV did not work Room unbearably HOT Had to wait approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour for my breakfast order Key to room did not work on the second day Used Tea and Coffee cups left in room and were not replaced , Location
145935,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The pillows were too well filled for my liking giving me a pain in my neck in the end I had to use a cushion with my nightie over it so as not to spoil it with any grease from my hair I tried the others that were in the wardrobe but they weren t much better ,No Positive
145936,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Would prefer bigger shower with detachable head but that s being picky , Excellent hotel in the heart of the square Lovely rooms excellent staff and service Not much more to say really excellent 
145937,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The bedroom was small with a double bed which felt like a small double although I admit to having a king size at home therefore from a five star would not expect it Also the two chairs and round table in the bedroom was a trip hazed as there was no walking room from that side of the bed a person had to walk sideways The bathroom was lovely but also too small whereby if you were not forever treading on the doorstop when you tried to climb out of bath tub I nearly slipped trying to climb out as there was nothing to hold on to as the tub was high however make no mistake only a midget could take a bath in that tub Powerful shower though This was my second stay but first stay was in a suite , Location perfect as were staff 
145938,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The food on the breakfast buffet was not hot although you could order fresh so it wasn t such a big deal Using the room key to get up the lift was a bit of a pain , Very comfortable room The bed was huge and well made The bathroom was luxurious 
145939,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I requested 2 single beds when I made the booking however at check in I was told this was not available We were given a room with a double and pull down bed Not the ideal for the price we paid, Room was clean 
145940,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Building work going on next door Woke us early and builders were an eye level and able to look into our room Moved to a better room but only after complaining , Fantastic location
145941,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Nothing , Fantastic location just a short hop to Chinatown and shows Room was lovely if a little on the small side but to be fair it is pot luck rather than design as on our last two stays we had huge rooms Again a little pricy at 23 per head for full on breakfast 14 for continental but I have to say it is one of the best I have had anywhere you can eat up and not feel hungry till 4 or 5pm so probably works out ok Staff were lovely as always and could not have been more helpful giving us a later check out with no drama or cost Also can I recommend a little place to eat just across from the hotel behind the M and M Shop and W Hotel a restaurant called Lobster and Hamburger fantastic Lobster roll Try it 
145942,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Rooms could do with a bit of updating Didn t get the room we originally booked as when we got there they told us it was taken not very impressed with that , The location was wonderful very friendly staff and very helpful Room was comfortable for my daughter and i 
145943,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Poor reception staff generally stern confused unfriendly Upon arrival I was asked abruptly if I was pre checked to which I replied I don t know what that is I just arrived to check in I was also asked if I prefer to pay on check out to which I replied yes and then the reception lady said that I had to pay upfront and I didn t have a choice So why did she offer me the choice to begin with I had booked 2 rooms as we were three traveling A single room and a double room Had to explain this 4 times I was told that breakfast wasn t included and I produced the booking document confirming breakfast was indeed included Just a general feeling of cluelessness among the reception staff Also the decor of this hotel is in need of refurbishment even if it is only a 4 star hotel Bland brown burgundy and beige it is depressing and old fashioned , Good concierge staff wonderful doorman comfy bed although we had requested 2 for our double room 
145944,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, In desperate need of some sort of car park staff were very helpful but took nearly an hour to get car from car park in chinatown , Excellent staff high level of cleanliness in rooms varied selection of food at breakfast

145946,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Nothing, All the staff were helpful from reception concierge restaurant staff all adding to make our stay for our Wedding Anniversary very pleasant and enjoyable On arrival we were upgraded to a studio suite and the hotel sent up cake and fruit on a plate with Happy Anniversary piped in chocolate on the plate along with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversay a very nice touch which started the mini break off to a good start 
145947,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The superior room that I saw online had a sofa and was slightly bigger As soon as we arrived they said they upgraded our room But to me it was the other way round Pity we had scaffolding as soon as you put the blinds up but you couldn t do anything about that, Poached eggs on a daily basis Scrambled are not good for everyone
145948,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, We clearly ordered one omelette with a side order of bacon and the other without This was reiterated but both were served with bacon which was rather off putting for my husband who is a vegetarian , Omlettes were great 
145949,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Shame the breakfast was buffet style and not available to order , Friendly staff great location fantastic welcome from the concierge Excellent clean rooms with a great view over Leicester Square I would definitely stay here again 
145950,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, the cleaners from housekeeping are very annoying during the cleaning does not observe guests in other rooms when they need to sleep more and despite complaining several times to the reception but they do not listen to them 2 the beds not comfortable for the body like they didn t change the mattress long time 3 so many constructions near the hotel and they start early morning at 7 00 am that destroy our sleeping time 4 the windows are not soundproof and you can hear all sounds come from outside the room 5 the GYM was very small and not much sports Equipment 6 the double bed very small 7 they don t follow the requests I put in your website when I made the reservation 8 the price was very high if you compare it with the facilities in the hotel it like 3 star hotel not even 4 star 9 very hard to go by car because not allowed to stop the car near the hotel and need to walk to arrive the hotel 10 the rating for this hotel is only 7 not 8 6 as I saw it in your website, The location was good The recepion staff
145951,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The suite was a little dated and in need of a little TLC however it was very spacious , The breakfast was excellent Bar service good The staff were very helpful We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment Bed was comfortable and the pillows gave good support 
145952,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The fact we only had the one night with you, We found our visits was more than we could of wished for the staff were outstanding especially the gentleman on the desk when we arrived unfortunately I didn t get his name but outstanding service very professional but gave it a familiar feeling All the staff were very attentive including the doorman and the staff at breakfast were exceptional We will definitely be coming back hopefully next time for longer

145955,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Room was claustrophobic and there were two men screaming at each other outside of our window until well after midnight for the one night that we stayed , Front desk service and porters were good 
145956,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, No hairdryer in the room , The staff were so friendly knowledgeable and happy to help They took really good care of us Hotel itself is gorgeous rooms are lovely location is second to none 
145957,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The hotel is old and the lobby and restaurant are the same We see rats running around in the restaurant close to midnight The breakfast was identical everyday with no vegetables of any sort , Staff was very friendly the bed was comfortable
145958,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The double bed room 606 was too small for two tall people 6ft 6ft 4 we need a minimum of a king size bed , The concierge was fantastic went that extra mile for us bringing a black cab to the front door through Leicester Square so that we didn t have to walk in ball gown and heels at 4 40pm The salmon at breakfast was lovely tasting and fresh I was most pleasantly surprised with the lack of any noise whatsoever from Leicester Square we could see it but couldn t hear it 
145959,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Nothing to dislike, The staff and the view from our room it was Exceptional would recommend this hotel to all my frends The location to all theatres was fantastic
145960,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Bar expensive particularly given the poor environment and the fact that one bar staff member served the wrong drinks because they could not understand what we ordered apparently , Room and the restaurant service

145963,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Website misleading re what was included in family room esp breakfast Why say 2 children under 1 year old are included when they dont even eat breakfast And a room for 2 adults only includes 1 breakfast , Great location close to everything Staff friendly and excellent service 
145964,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Amazing hotel Brilliant location Breakfast was excellent the staff were very helpful and friendly bed sheets were really comfy and soft extra attention paid to my girlfriend s birthday for that special touch 
145965,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I did find the lighting a little difficult at times since there was no lamp on the desk so to use it all the overhead lights had to be on My only complaint about the bathroom was that since I am petite the bathtub was high for me to climb into Everything else was wonderful , The room was well located just off the elevator and was very comfortable There was even a separate WiFi router for the room Bathroom facilities were luxurious This was our second stay and the location is perfect The staff couldn t have been more courteous and helpful We will be back the next time we visit London 
145966,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, We had a one night stay and the staff made us feel very welcome Location of hotel was excellent Bed was very comfortable and facilities were ideal for what we needed 
145967,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, My 274 a night room faced a brick wall with scaffolding up but was only staying the one night so didn t make a fuss as I was hardly in the room and the English breakfast was very disappointing although I was given it as a complimentary freebie I didn t complain but if I d had to pay the 23 per person I would have most definitely complained the selection was good lovely croissants and pastries but my cooked breakfast was very poor I would stay there again but not eat the breakfast it s vastly overpriced and there s loads of places to eat right on the doorstep , The bed was sooooo comfy nice decor and the staff were all lovely Very polite and nothing was too much trouble Great location too I would return to stay again

145971,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Rooms were a little disappointing I expected more for the price we paid Very high bath which made it difficult to get in and out of shower and shower screen allowed water to drip on floor also making it unsafe, The staff were helpful and friendly

145980,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Nothing was bad at all the only small complaint would be that the pillows on the bed were a little to fat for us and not quite soft enough but then you can t please everyone , This hotel is in one of the best locations in London the staff are very helpful friendly and approachable especially Andreae and Annaise on Reception The food we had in Scoff and Banter was second to none really delicious and again the staff are brilliant in particular Ryan who was particularly helpful in securing us a dinner table before we went to the theatre and looked after us at breakfast 
145981,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Didn t like the construction outside a little bit of noise but there is a growing city, Great staff really made the visit great We booked an extra day and they took care of it even though the travel agent messed it up

145985,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Double room 105 was tiny and had two swivel seats to sit at round a small table but not possible to move once you were seated or get past the bed First night the Air Conditioning didn t work and Receptionist gave us a Fan We had a Wardrobe but no chest of drawers or anywhere to store clothes so had to lift case on to bed to get clean teashirts etc put away dirty clothes etc Having stayed before was surprised at size of room for the 300 per night Try somewhere else next time , Staff were really helpful and friendly
145986,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The view from the room, Visited London on many occasions and can honestly say I only used the metro from the airport This hotel is literally central it s perfect Arrived late Friday and was given room 209 First impressions we thought the room was small for the price But was happy with the decor and cleanliness Decided to ask if all the rooms were this size and was kindly moved to the next room room 210 Was very happy with this upgrade and the staff were super helpful Didn t have much of a view but didn t really care and didn t opt for the breakfast either But really this hotel alone should be picked on location It s the best Sleep comfort excellent

145988,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The room wasn t quite ready when we were 3pm but the staff simply re roomed us and it really wasn t a hassle We wanted a twin but only a double was available for my sister and me but they put an extra quilt in the room for us , The staff were superb courteous efficient and with a sense of humour 
145989,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Mix up at check in time over type of room booked The Hotel is noisy just now with a construction site next door Noisy neighbours arguing for hours in the early morning hours , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
145990,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Perhaps 2 double beds instead of a king in the family room plus the sofa bed, The central location being close to all the tourist landmarks and tube plus Chinatown and London theatres not to forget also the fantastic breakfast spread charming old exterior design but we ll renovated rooms with ultra modern toilet and bathroom
145991,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, they gave me the worse room and that was not my reservation They gave me a free cafe card to apologize Hope next time I can have my reserved room , personnel was very friendly
145992,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, There is construction going on next door which was irritating just outside my window I eventually was moved to another room Although I do understand that nothing can be done about it as it has to be done , The bed was very comfortable sheets are of the best quality and the bathroom is very clean with fluffy soft hot towels The King size room was large and beautiful I loved the whole experience 
145993,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The only let down was the shower not very strong and the view was less than desired but that may have been my fault as I requested a quiet room , The breakfast was wonderful so fresh and a wide variety the location was awesome and so much to see and great restaurants dotted around And the receptionist was delightful and helpful The positives FAR OUTWAY the negatives
145994,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Reception Staff very poor the mixture between experienced and in experienced was weighed too heavily in favour of the in experienced and to refuse my partner access to the room on the grounds she never had a Credit card when you had my full details is inexcusable, Location
145995,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire,No Negative, Liva Polakova made my daughters stay very special She was amazingly helpful after being swept aside by 3 other staff telephonically Much appreciated Liva Michelle Hall South Africa
145996,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Breakfast room still looked like a bar in the morning with unsuitable chairs and layout Room was a little small considering the cost, Very friendly staff Quick and efficient check in out 
145997,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The rooms Tired tatty and not spotless Our room a superior double with a requested king bed Tiny Didn t even have room to sit and do my hair and make up comfortably The room service after 23 00hrs very limited and extremely pricey , The Staff amazing Location great Food delicious 
145998,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Expensive and compared to other hotels I have stayed in whilst travelling around Europe this one is all style and no substance, Good central location and close to many museums and galleries and main tourist sights 
145999,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, None, Was my birthday over the weekend and a member of staff arranged to have some cake sent to my room for me and my guest On arrival my room was upgraded due to there being some building work happening next door 
146000,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The bed gave me a bit of backache But I think that s just sleeping in an unfamiliar bed A bigger variety of cocktails on the menu would have been nice but the Pisco Flower Sour and the Gin Sherbet were particularly good , The friendly helpful and professional staff on reception they were lovely Beautifully appointed room with comfy firm pillows Quality toiletries in the bathroom Good cocktails in the bar 
146001,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Breakfast plates and food not hot enough Dining chairs not comfortable for eating just got away with the bed as it had a good mattress topper Otherwise would have been too hard for our old bones , Location excellent No noticeable traffic noise Good security 
146002,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The size of the bed and room was tight and uncomfortable to a certain point if you re used to bigger mattress sizes but otherwise a good experience , Amazing location in the heart of leicester square tasty breakfast 
146003,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, For the price paid the room could be a bit larger , The hotel staff were great and eager to help The breakfast was delicious The location could not be better 
146004,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Absolutely nothing, The room was amazing marble bathroom massive bed with gorgeous bedding pure bliss The staff were so friendly and professional nothing was too much trouble 
146005,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Nothing to report, Very conveniently situated for Theatreland Covent Garden with all other London attractions a few minutes walk or short ride on the tube Good variety for breakfast excellent cocktails 
146006,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Next to construction site very noisy and the hot water in one of the rooms we had booked didn t work was fixed but not good enough for the price you pay , Beds were nice staff friendly
146007,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, We had one of the 17 better rooms But it seemed to smell very musty and as if someone had been smoking in the room Asked if a window could be opened but told they would take steps to refresh the room It did not improve and was unpleasant sleeping in the room , Food was very good Staff excellent Location great
146008,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The d cor is a little dated and tired but this did not detract from the warmth of the welcome There was only one bedside table in our room therefore water book etc had to be placed on the floor but apart from this the room was spacious with a terrific view of Leicester Square , The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and check in was excellent We had requested an early check in only the previous evening and were delighted when on arrival we were immediately allocated a room The concierge was very helpful and had good knowledge of the area which helped us find our way around 
146009,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, for the waiter to explain about the self service option for breakfast as we had the full English but was too much for most of us , The location was fab
146010,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Given that this was a double room I found having three chairs in the confined space a little cramped There was external noise but without very expensive glazing it is the price you pay for the location , I reserved a de luxe room It was compact d cor was good the bed was comfortable and the downstairs restaurant provided good food with efficient service 
146011,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Room not ready issue with payment sent email to company but no reply stated all requirements clearly in booking form but ibviously not checked by staff , Central location stay here all time in london always seems problem with rooms
146012,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, Rooms are small and uncomfortable compared to the high room cost Frequency of cleaning is not up to level of 5 stars Hotels Remarkable delay of check in till after 5 pm Although early check in was requested in the booking done more than a month before arrival and confirmed again one day before day of arrival , The lopcation
146013,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, I guess the view because of the construction site However that is only temporary , All the staff were excellent reception bar and housekeeping were efficient friendly and helpful 
146014,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, We could hear music from Leicester Square till the early hours of the morning even with windows closed , Clean comfortable room Good situation for visiting London Staff very helpful Paying in advance made price reasonable for the quality and location

146106,Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire, The late night food was very horrible As the room service stops at 10 and from then you only get these tasteless sandwiches and a weird service Also windows do not open if they fear suicides they could atlas make them open an inch or two The TV kept shutting down and disconnecting after every 20 minutes or so , The staff was very accommodating especially Ana and a bone woman with her she s slim and tall Also the location and breakfast
