201116,Le Relais M dicis, This property would be an absolute gold mine if it was run with passion and commitment However the decor is tired the breakfast was barely adequate and some issues with our room meant our overall experience was underwhelming , The Odeon area proved to be an excellent location close to Luxembourg Gardens restaurants buses metro restaurants and boutique shopping district 
201117,Le Relais M dicis, there were ants in the toilet and other insects on the carpet The wifi did not work well in the room I requested a refund due to the problem but the owner and directors denied it , the location
201118,Le Relais M dicis, Only one staff was serving in the so called four star hotel Impolite disrespectful ignorant of the savoir vivre manners In addition the safe was not closing and we had to carry our stuff with us all the way The bathroom was horrible my little daughter was about to literally break her leg in the bathtub They do not have cap showers nor slippers the list is endless , Nothing We left the hotel after the first horrible night we spent there 
201119,Le Relais M dicis, Breakfast very basic same every day Would be great if they could start offering a breakfast buffet The breakfast room was however nice , Great location next to the Odeon and Jardin du Luxembourg Very friendly staff Had a room with French windows into very nice green little courtyard 
201120,Le Relais M dicis, NOTHING , Great location 2 blocks from Luxembourg RER 2 which goes to Chas DeGaulle Airport and Gard du Nord without transfer Waking distance to buses on Blvd San Michel Quiet area good continental breakfast in a charming area Desk is staffed throughout the night Great bistro within a block Allother needed amenities bank pharmacy laundromat within walking distance 
201121,Le Relais M dicis, We stay for four nights breakfast are included We are three people and comes to the same table at a few minute apart we have to keep asking things that they should provide like water milk for tea if you don t asks they will not give another pot of tea for second or third person but we could hear they talk and talk in the kitchen and a few time we have to go approach them for services It is such a shame it is a lovely hotel and great location , the front desk staffs are all very nice and helpful but the two kitchen room cleaning staffs are bad attitude and the rooms are not as clean as it should be 
201122,Le Relais M dicis, The bathtop is very high and the shower top a bit unsteady so it is impossible not to soak the bathroom floor when having a shower A bit hard to get in and out of the bathtop another rail would have made it easier , The room had a very Parisian feel and was quite large room 24 The staff were very nice and friendly and helpful the location perfect and the very adequate breakfast was included Also there was proper aircon as well as French balcony door windows which could be opened We would come back to this hotel 
201123,Le Relais M dicis, I can t think of anything, The room was very charming The staff was helpful friendly and added to the atmosphere of the hotel I can t say enough good things about the professionalism and helpfulness of the staff 
201124,Le Relais M dicis, The breakfast was not up to the level of the hotel without any choice except for tea or coffee as hot beverage There is no buffet , The hotel is very quiet but located centrally in Quartier Latin close to Palais Luxembourg 
201125,Le Relais M dicis, Room was very small absolutely no ventilation no air condition despite it says so on booking com Not possible to sleep at all in a room w o oxygen Extemely dirty window facing a backyard Answer from the staff You are in the middle of Paris Very arrogant DO NOT book this place , Location
201126,Le Relais M dicis, I had asked for a quiet room as I am a very light sleeper and was given a back room facing the inner stone square which was lovely and quiet for all but the last night of my stay As bad luck had it that s when the next door neighbor decided to throw a dancing party Until then I wasn t aware that my bathroom wall marked the limit of the hotel and that the next apartment belonged to a regular Paris old building no isolation In retrospect it seems safer to ask for a room facing the street which isn t very noisy to begin with , The Relais Medicis is a lovely cozy little hotel in the best imaginable location in Paris It is right next to the Luxembourg Garden to the Odeon theatre surrounded by lovely art galleries and numerous restaurants and boutiques The hotel lobby is very welcoming and charming the staff is wonderful and the room quite big by Paris standards well heated the bed was very comfortable It was well cleaned too Breakfast which can be had in the room next to the open window is your basic Paris chrome tray loaded with fresh croissant and baguette butter jams yogurt and delicious coffee Bathroom is separate from roomy WC both were very clean and comfortable I enjoyed my stay so much I extended it for an extra two nights 
201127,Le Relais M dicis, The historic decor is obviously intentional but the room and the facilities look and feel quite outdated not to say dilapidated The room and the bathroom were as small as you can expect them to be in Paris and everything is very basic with the exception of bathrobes The breakfast was thoroughly pitiful in every respect if you can get a room with no meal plan I suggest you do , The location is as good as it gets Place d Odeon a short walk from the Odeon metro station that however has no escalators which is important if you have heavy luggage The front desk staff were nice and friendly and helpful even if you can get better dinner from your homework than from their recommendations 
201128,Le Relais M dicis,No Negative, My room was not overlooking the street so it was really quiet To have a great sleep in a European city is not always easy to do I also liked the fact that I could walk everywhere 24 hr staff at the front desk was also appreciated and gave a sense of security 
201129,Le Relais M dicis, I cannot think of anything that might be improved this is one of our favorite hotels on any continent , The room was spacious and perfectly decorated as is every room in this lovely boutique hotel the breakfast perfect and yes the pastries the most flaky and the new entrance very stylish
