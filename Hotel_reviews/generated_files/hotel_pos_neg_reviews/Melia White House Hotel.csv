265323,Melia White House Hotel, The room was the size of a small cupboard and the bathroom the size of a shoe box a small one You could sit on the loo and wash your feet in the bath at the same time if you are over 6 foot tall and over the age of 60 upgrade to a king size room they ask you when you book in if you want to upgrade the room for 18 per night wish we had You wont get in and out of the shower shower over the bath had to be a contortionist to get in and out The bathroom was not very clean the shampoo bottles had dust on the door had smears on and we found a hair or two on the sink not ours Take your own hairdryer At 180 a night I thought at least there will be a good hairdryer and mirror to do my hair in think again The hair dryer was one of those permeant wall mounted ones you used to find in the 1970 s in swimming pool changing rooms and it was situated over the loo I had no control over the power or heat and it went off half way through as it over heated spent my weekend looking like I had put my fingers in an electric socket , The bar area and reception were fantastic martini bar was great for meeting friends the hotel reception smelt amazing and the staff were ultra helpful The facilities were very good and location great 
265324,Melia White House Hotel, There were 2 things the kettle in our room didnt work and there were hairs in the bath and on the bathroom floor when i first went into the bathroom so i had to clean the bath before i used it shame , The bed was huge staff were lovely even offering to take a photo for me and my daughter when she was stood in reception the offer of children eating free was a bonus as it was raining on the evening so we didnt need to go out
265325,Melia White House Hotel, Nothing really only thing would be perhaps a little more choice on the buffet , We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive room obviously recently refurbished and really lovely Spacious and elegantly furnished with an enormous and very comfortable bed and every amenity you could wish for We had dinner on the first night a buffet which was very nice but rather limited as although there were many dishes to choose from most of them contained chicken Service charming throughout the hotel and breakfast was excellent the croissants passed my husbands test 
265326,Melia White House Hotel, We were very disappointed in the restaurant there was not a lot of choice we ended up eating both nights of our stay in our hotel ordering room service which was more of a varied menu Breakfast was very good with lots of choice, We arrived and was offered a upgrade which was very nice and the room was very quiet
265327,Melia White House Hotel, A less overtly commercial attitude and aggressive marketing through the WiFi system needs to be reviewed Unhappy Staff and lack of a sense of welcome or Hospitality needs addressing in reviews The Security staff are excellent however , The convenience of location for my work and the special discount offer were essentially behind my Choice I would not otherwise choose to stay there again However security was good and found my laptop sending it to my work by taxi which was the best part 
265328,Melia White House Hotel, The price of drinks was on the high side and could easily be reduced to accommodate all guests, Nice hotel with friendly staff and nothing seemed to be a problem Really enjoyable stay with the location just outside the hustle of main town Breakfast was very good with excellent choices 
265329,Melia White House Hotel, nothing, nice comfortable room Excellent front office very friendly and helpful I had great time in the Dry martini bar and I believe it was because of the staff Great idea the welcome healthy drinks in the lobby
265330,Melia White House Hotel, I will contact Melia directly to express my concern but glad there is such a great service as booking com which allows to book rooms in a sec, Location and decent price
265331,Melia White House Hotel, The checking in was shocking I had booked a large double bed for self and wife but was given two single beds I rejected that offer The next event or non event was horrible I requested for a wake up call for 3am on Thursday the 20th by speaking with the telephone operator The call never came At about 3 45 am somebody called the room to check if our wake up call was honored That was 15 minutes before we checked out for the airport If I had not woken up spontaneously at 2 45 am we would have missed our flight That was a really shocking experience the worst I have experienced in all my travels across four continents The service staff need more training Many of those at the concierge barely spoke or understood English Three of them in succession did not know how to check from an airline if flight re confirmation was necessary I had to teach one of them what to do I have stayed in the Melia on and off since 1999 The quality of service has declined and my most recent stay was the least enjoyed , The location was good Some of the staff were pleasant and helpful but some needed more service oriented training 
265332,Melia White House Hotel, Hotel lifts kept breaking down , Friendly and helpful staff Hotel was located in good location and it was nice to have flavoured water and juice in lobby 
265333,Melia White House Hotel, shower was faulty, fabulous breakfast loads of choice checking in and out very simple room lovely and tv easy to work great lift system fabulous location
265334,Melia White House Hotel,No Negative, Slightly faded grandeur but with definite charm and originality Very clean and staff were superb The bar served the best martini I have ever tasted and the food and service in the restaurant were excellent An enjoyable place to stay 
265335,Melia White House Hotel, Breakfast line was chaotic guests paying for a continental breakfast 12 also had free access to the full English buffet 23 no waitress service even for coffee refills No so good for disabled people , Rooms excellent very theatrical Public areas spotless DRY bar welcoming 
265336,Melia White House Hotel, Room and the bathroom were both very small and the room was much too hot Getting in and out of the shower was difficult as the bathroom was so small and the shower door which was over the bath had no room to move to allow access to the shower , Location was good and check in was swift and easy
265337,Melia White House Hotel, The room I had booked months in advance wasn t available so had to wait around whilst the duty manager sorted the problem out He was very professional helpful found us a room but it would ve been nice to not have the stress in the first place Only one member of staff available at check in desk at a busy time , Easy to access tubes trains to travel around London
265338,Melia White House Hotel, Hotel is quite large and daunting at first with an odd though reasonably successful lift operating process The large bed left the floor area at its foot a bit tight single file only The electrics though of high standard were a bit worn Queues at reception were a bit frustrating when checking out although the guest experience worker did his best to ease things along sorting bag storage etc Only minor quibbles on what was a generally good stay , Large comfortable bed Good amenities Breakfast both fruit and cooked buffet were very good quality Staff were very helpful and friendly Seemed to be very popular with Spanish guests Air con worked well in what was a bit of a London heat wave Room was lovely and quiet 
265339,Melia White House Hotel, 4 hotel superior room expected more Breakfast only at price advertised in my Booking com reservation if booked at check in otherwise 6 more on the day 15 service charge automatically added to bar and restaurant bills , Location great walking distance to Tube station and Oxford Street Staff pleasant and helpful Quiet room 
265340,Melia White House Hotel, Long wait for check in due to understaffing Staff are all non native speakers which sometimes can make communication difficult Loud music en too much perfume at hotel entrance Housekeeping knocking at 8 30h on a Saturday Only one big towel for two persons Badly cleaned bathroom mirror Loud aircon , Easy accessible location Good beds Clean Friendly staff Good price value ratio for London standards 
265341,Melia White House Hotel,No Negative, the hotel was in walking distance from Euston station and was very easy to walk to Oxford Road there are lots of little eating places around the hotel and local pubs all in all a very good location
265342,Melia White House Hotel, Hotel is in a great location and is generally good but the noise from the lobby music was audible ALL NIGHT through the floor in my first floor room Unacceptable ,No Positive
265343,Melia White House Hotel, The door to the room wouldn t open so every time I went out I had to mess about up and down to reception to get into my room The room was noisy with traffic The bed not that comfortable , The breakfast was great The staff were lovely 
265344,Melia White House Hotel, We were in a twin room which we felt was a little bijou Although it had everything in it and was clean the bedroom area and bathroom was very small Didn t hamper our stay as it was only an overnighter , The hotel gave a very good impression on arrival Staff were friendly and their was a bar restaurants on site although it is situated very close to an area of restaurants Regent s Park was 5 mins away and you were extremely handy for two tube stations giving you quite a chose of tube lines for travel 
265345,Melia White House Hotel, The rooms did not supply decaffeinated tea we called reception requesting some and after 20 mins we still hadn t received any so when we called again we were told they didn t have any Was disappointed they couldn t have called the room to let us know this but equally disappointed that a hotel did not supply this , The location and the cleanliness 
265346,Melia White House Hotel, Bath too high to get in and out of Am not an invalid but of the older generation whose joints are not so flexible therefore dangerous, Bed comfortable although didn t like the plastic under sheet made you sweat
265347,Melia White House Hotel, Staff at breakfast were not good and even tried to refuse one of our party That person had to go to the front desk and tell the same thing 5 times just to get breakfast Service was then not good , The location was excellent with ease of access to underground Rooms are well appointed although space in a twin room was at a premium 
265348,Melia White House Hotel, A tad on the step side, The staff are super friendly and helpful The room very clean I think it was pretty expensive but I guess due to the time of year The room service burger is v good 
265349,Melia White House Hotel, Need more staffs in check in desk Some time staffs weren t enough had to wait in the line around 20 minutes in the front desk, The room is very clean and bigger than i expected The hotel is in a very good location only around 15 minutes walk to oxford street and one minute walk to tube station
265350,Melia White House Hotel, Bed was too firm Could have been a bit cleaner in the bathroom , good location next to tube station Air con during heatwave Didnt have hotel breakfast as it was way too expensive Tesco express a minutes walk away served us well for this Friendly helpful staff 
265351,Melia White House Hotel, Only thing was that a circuit breaker for a US style outlet kept tripping even when charging a phone Room was pretty cozy but they have more expensive but larger rooms available , Excellent location near the Underground station Walkable to Islington Mayfair Fitzroy Belgravia and adjacent to Regents Parks and a short walk to Hyde Park 
265352,Melia White House Hotel, The rooms were a bit small but that was to be expected in a city like London Still very comfortable , This hotel was great The breakfast was amazing the glazed donuts were especially tasty almost too much hehe Used the room service two times in total both during the late evening night and the food was good and delivered fast The staff was very helpful in finding and ordering tickets for attractions such as the city tour bus and the London Dungeon A short walk away from the underground stations Great Portland Street and Regent Street making it possible for us to go pretty much anywhere in the city centre I would definitely stay here again 
265353,Melia White House Hotel, The breakfast buffet is superb and the serving staff work very hard But on many days the seating is congested the room is noisy and the service of coffee etc is overwhelmed Probably nothing can be done about this until the next hotel renovation The lobby is noisy with loud music , The reception staff especially Mr Blanco were very professional and helpful Location is good for me not glamorous but near major transport hubs 
265354,Melia White House Hotel, The room was too small compared to the description and the photos on booking The Gym was poorly equipped , Location is extremely perfect Staff is friendly Breakfast was pretty good 
265355,Melia White House Hotel, Single room felt a bit of an afterthought but couldn t quibble at the price paid , Style The bar is outstanding and the hotel seems to have addressed some earlier criticism about speed at the front desk well done to them 
265356,Melia White House Hotel, As the bed was very large there was not a lot of room move around it as it was almost against the window Room 520 and the bathroom was very small for the size of room which was a junior suite Overpriced bar drinks Service added to everything including the breakfast which was self service , Welcoming staff very large bed which was really comfortable Breakfast was good with a large choice Surprise of a birthday cake for our group on arrival in the room thank you
265357,Melia White House Hotel, The front desk Check In process and long lines Needs to be streamlined automated and more personel Also Check Out for PrePaid room Should be speedy check out with box to deposit key I just left it on a desk Rooms are small , Price Clean rooms Bed was comfortable Was quiet a night Close location for eating and tube stations 
265358,Melia White House Hotel, The only thing that I had an issue with was our room was facing the room The noise level was very high it felt like the windows were open So the beds were very comfortable but not much sleep due to the noise Other than that the hotel was amazing, Reception was amazing very clean and bright
265359,Melia White House Hotel, Mis communication of hotel rate detail to include breakfast, Ok food but I don t think it was clear from booking com that breakfast was not inclusive of rate
265360,Melia White House Hotel, To warm , The great reception staff excellent customer service Very clean and nice room it was a little to warm but we opened the windows Walking distance to theatres about 30 minutes an easy walk Great connections to train and underground 
265361,Melia White House Hotel, poor cleaning in this property, The room they give me first very very small and not clean enough for 4 start hotel very poor after they change the room for bigger but still cleaning same problem i have stayed here for the location thats why i have to extend my stay and not change the hotel other wise i wouldnt stay here at all
265362,Melia White House Hotel, The room service was done very late 4pm even when the sign for a early cleaning was at the door since early morning , The location was good and easy to find and then to travel around 
265363,Melia White House Hotel,No Negative, I stayed for three nights The location is excellent easy walking distance from Marylebone High Street and also many other local restaurants The thing that really makes this hotel stand out is the customer service I felt really looked after and safe which is important to me as a single female I loved the cocktail lounge the live music was really good and the cocktails excellent and some were quite unique not just the usual suspects The bedroom and the whole hotel was immaculately clean and well presented The coffee at breakfast is very good nice and strong and there was a good buffet breakfast very multicultural choice My only bug bear with this hotel is that I found the bed to be extremely uncomfortable I mentioned this to the reception supervisor after my first night and she went to great lengths to try to resolve the situation but regrettably is was not possible On night 2 I was dancing till 4 in the morning so would have slept on a washing line and I wouldn t have noticed but night 3 was still terribly uncomfortable Now this could just be me being fussy about my bed and the hotel did try hard to resolve it but nonetheless I do stay at a lot of hotels and don t have this problem I would love to make this my hotel of choice when down in London as it is so brilliant in all other aspects but a bed is a pretty fundamental thing to get right in a hotel I would have given this hotel a 10 if the bed had been comfortable
265364,Melia White House Hotel, Check in process and staff not really can make quick decision Everything need to be escalate to manager or so whom s he didnt present af that moment, Bed is big and nice quite spacious with spacious bathroom as well nice bed sheet and good amnenities

265372,Melia White House Hotel, Check in was delayed due to an influx of people and the process took over half an hour The room was nice but wasn t to my taste also I would recommend taking your own hairdryer as the one in the bathroom felt like someone was gently blowing on my head , The mattress was incredible The staff were lovely and were happy to help with anything we needed

265379,Melia White House Hotel, The fact that the Concierge is not a true Londoner who knows about everything going on The old ones used to help us get Football tickets theter music jazee evrything The current ones mean well but are CLUELESS , Smiling faces Helpful Fantastic Breakfast and Dry Martini 
265380,Melia White House Hotel, Check in took ages Standard room and bath are quite small not claustrophobic but not far off either Aircon was only heating and took a while to get it fixed Other than that everything fine and professionally managed , Excellent Location right next to Great Portland Street Tube Station and Regents Park Good breakfast Overall very good place to stay 
265381,Melia White House Hotel, Upon arrival we were shown to our room and it was far to small check in took around an hour so was very disappointing when we had to complain about the room However once we had we were shown to another room which was far bigger and what we were expecting ,No Positive
265382,Melia White House Hotel, Room too cold air heater was not heating enough and after complaining two times they finally brought us electric heaters This was supposed to be a family room it s unacceptable to make small children and babies sleep in a cold environment Badly isolated windows cold air infiltrating inside Kids gift pack was supposed to be waiting for them in the room but there was nothing when we arrived When I asked Francesco at the concierge s desk he told me in a rather rude manner that they will come but for the next 3 days until we left we did not receive anything , Proximity to shopping area Oxford Circus Regent Street Friendly staff Great Wifi Good breakfast Quiet room Underground stations and bus stops nearby

265387,Melia White House Hotel, The hotel was a little busy being the week before Christmas which meant a short wait for breakfast if you were late coming down Breakfast was worth waiting for though with loads of choice , This was my second visit to the hotel having taken my son 4 years earlier for his 21st Birthday visit to the city I had always promised myself I would go back with my Husband of 2 years I was not disappointed the experience was every bit as good albeit the room was somewhat smaller than the one I had occupied previously The hotel bar was fabulous and the Jazz singer on the Saturday evening was superb Great location to get around London My son does not like using the subway and we were able to visit all the places we wished to mainly on foot It is definitley on my favorite Hotels in London list

265401,Melia White House Hotel, Finding my room was a little difficult because of the closed fire doors as this also hid the signs to my room , Breakfast was good and I was not rushed out of the restaurant even though I had breakfast at the end of the sitting I thought the room would be noisy as I arrived in the middle of the Friday Brunch which looked amazing The room however was very quiet as the hotel management had closed the fire doors 
265402,Melia White House Hotel, Prices in bar are to high for what i got If i go to Montague i pay same price but i get a lot of extra s with my drink I left my lugage at reception and got a tag with unique number on it but also with room number where i stayed When i returned staff only looked at roomnumber so i got the wrong suitcase Suitcase belonged to people who just checked in to the room It took the two members off staff quit some time to figer out what was my suitcase and if you only have like 60min to go to the station that creates a lot of stress The elevator isn t userfriendly it took us some time to figure out how this system works Elevataros have allways had buttons with the floors on it inside this works why change it , Clean rooms with all posible facilities Nice bar chic design Very nice breakfast

265415,Melia White House Hotel, depending on the time of your arrival be aware that you might have to stand in queue for 20 min at your check in one if the first things they asked us was if we want to upgrade our room felt more like a sales pitch then a check in , great connections from the hotel into the city nice rooms very polite stuff 
265416,Melia White House Hotel, The only 2 criticisms I would have is the room was very cold on one side the heating could be turned up but it was due to the windows being old that let in a draft and the bathroom itself could do with a bit of a revamp new grouting and bath sealant etc other than that no other complaints at all , Staff were amazing we stayed for my boyfriends birthday and they made it very special beautiful hotel the beds were the comfiest I ve slept in the dry bar is full of vintage feel and the hotel itself is in a great location next to regents park

265542,Melia White House Hotel, Room a little on the small side but this wouldn t stop us coming back , Staff so very helpful and polite Excellent location for all the Londn activities we did 
265543,Melia White House Hotel, we all thought that the beds were just a tad too hard , Beautiful hotel On a business trip coming back to hotel after a day of hard work was a pleasure Perfect choice for business or leisure 
265544,Melia White House Hotel, Everything, The room was too small the price paid for a 4 star hotel was ridiculous when you can barely swing a cat the bed sheets smelt old and the buffet breakfast was cold So much money spent on reception and landing of room levels if only the rooms were extended by 10 inches more 
265545,Melia White House Hotel, quite pricy long queue at checkout slow programmable lift system, upgrade to exec room altogether very comfortable and just what was needed for a business trip 
265546,Melia White House Hotel, They took ages to find my booking typed in wrongly by them sent me to a room with 5 cases in it no bathrobe which was part of the deal no room service menu and tho told by reception I could order from the restaurant menu no sign of it either and the wifi connection wasn t robust till I called up about it Smiley good natured staff don t make up for so many basics not in place I lost an hour of my time getting all this sorted So unlikely to consider this hotel again , Location plus staff willingness and good humour
265547,Melia White House Hotel, Every day I was told that I hadn t paid for breakfast and every day I had to insist otherwise Embarrassing and annoying Also beds were poor and bathroom seals were blackened , The facilities and interior of the hotel were both impressive 
265548,Melia White House Hotel, Beds too small room bathroom tiny didnt bother with breakfast after first day as felt food well below average Feel like too many people are fitted into hotel so reception always crowded, Location friendly staff although I felt like I was an invisible woman I booked the hotel but all conversation from staff was aimed at my husband 
265549,Melia White House Hotel, The room was a little dark The room was also a little dusty I wish I had raised this with the hotel at the time as I m sure they would have rectified it D cor is a little worn in places , The reception is very impressive The staff are excellent The breakfast is great 
265550,Melia White House Hotel, apparently booking made a mistake and said the breakfast was included while the hotel never intended that so upon arrival we were asked to prove that the order included breakfast we thought they should have relied on our statement since they already knew booking had this problem another thing they can improve is the loby hardly no sofas or chairs anywhere , breakfast was nice comfy beds clean rooms close to tube stations rooms are tight but comfortable
265551,Melia White House Hotel, Nothing , The relaxing atmosphere in all the hotel which is a relief in a busy city as London Also the friendly staff and their willingness to help the guests is a plus point 
265552,Melia White House Hotel, One small thing bath was very high had to be careful after having a shower to clear the top of the bath , I loved the Dry Martini experience made us feel extremely welcolme and they took time to explain all the cocktails and to find out our taste and ensured at all times that we were happy with everything also offered to help to make our stay more memorable All Bar staff so friendly and could understand our Scottish accent I am looking forward to our next visit 
265553,Melia White House Hotel, Restaurant ambient temperature was a little bit too cold during breakfast in one of the two days of my stay , Excellent and comfortable bed king size Very good breakfast buffet Plenty of choices well prepared and organized Very helpful and friendly staff
265554,Melia White House Hotel, There was a synchronization error with my booking and the receptionists made me call Booking com to ask to confirm the booking instead of suggesting that they ll call themselves and sort this out And as I was in roaming in the foreign country it was even more inconvenient for me to make this phone call , Very nice room interior 
265555,Melia White House Hotel, Wasn t that we didn t like the canap s it was just the timing for our stay was wrong so we never got the pleasure as we were out when they were available Needs to be on offer longer say 4pm to 11 30 pm, Very helpful staff Speedy check and out Really nice breakfast 
265556,Melia White House Hotel, The mattress on the bed was too firm for our liking Also the temperature in the bedroom was too warm during the night and the fan system didn t cool it down enough , Very friendly swift and efficient service from all the staff gave the hotel a special feel with a very nice atmosphere The quality and choice of food was excellent at dinner and breakfast The bar was comfortable and had a good atmosphere making a great place to relax 
265557,Melia White House Hotel, After arriving from a late flight And long trip we still had to wait on a line to check in for 15 20 minutes with super loud music in the reception , Nice breakfast and very good location 3 min from Great Portland Street Metro station The staff also gave great tips of places to visit in London besides the classic 
265558,Melia White House Hotel, A little bit high priced, Good location for using euro star and city tour bus Facilities with high quality fresh and delicious breakfast and very clean room
265559,Melia White House Hotel, Apart from the bed which was very comfortable the bedrooms were disappointing quite sparse and apart from a hard seat at the dressing table there was nt another seat and the room just felt very plain for the money and being a 4 would not stay there again , The public rooms were very pleasant and the breakfast was exceptional with so muc seslection and quality
265560,Melia White House Hotel,No Negative, We genuinely loved everything Firstly the Spanish girl on reception who checked us in was wonderful and welcoming we discussed some places I had travelled in Spain and the foods and then the fresh home made Sangria that was on the reception desk and our love of Spain s culture and scenery I explained it was my birthday and we needed a late checkout and after a brief discussion with her colleague we were blissfully granted an upgrade to a more spacious room as a treat from the hotel Wonderful The room was very smart and the shower was amazing but what we loved most was the original art that decorated all the corridors if we had more time we would have viewed them all as the hotel could humbly compete with many an art gallery Of course the hotel was also beautiful throughout 
265561,Melia White House Hotel, The check in process took for ages 30 mins some members of staff in my opinion were also rude I must stress Miguel was the exception he was extremely polite and most helpful throughout my stay The room turn down was very poor Failed to replenish coffee and tea supplies and only a half used toilet role was added on my second day The size of the bath is also a joke All my stays across London I have never seen such a minature bathroom literally 2 steps in and your against the sink Also the mini bar had thick black dirt food around the door hinges , The hotel looks very modern and the food was very good
265562,Melia White House Hotel, The room size cramped space in room but otherwise good, All staff welcoming and helpful Parking easy and outside congestion zone yet close to west end shops and amenities Cocktail bar has been redecorated since my last visit
265563,Melia White House Hotel, 1 The bathroom in 648 was awful shower hose had huge leakage so almost no water was flowing from the shower head the bathtub drain was not clean so when you take shower you stand in 5 10 cm of dirty water very tiny space no place to keep clean towels and a very inconvenient way to get to the bathtub 2 The fitness center have only cardio training equipment run bike 3 No AC outlets near the bed normally people charge mobile phones in the night so it s inconvenient 4 The room was very tiny narrow space to move across the room very tiny closet , Very close to Regents Park I could run every day 
265564,Melia White House Hotel, The pullout sofa bed was not so good for the third adult and complimentary water would have been appreciated on the second night also , Spacious room for 3 adults with complimentary water and biscuits on the first night 
265565,Melia White House Hotel, Good size room large bed But the sofa bed for the kids was not comfortable and very much in the way , Location was great as we wanted to go to the Zoo and the theatre Arrived at Kings Cross so again convenient Staff were very welcoming 
265566,Melia White House Hotel, Concierge too busy to explain service patiently to a tourist I was seeking advice to book extra night since email request before I left country of origin was not replied the answer is will take some time before he can attend as he is the only person on duty and a lot to do Not friendly to help a tourist in need , Staff very helpful and provided the much needed USB plug Useful to have it as basic facility in each room 
265567,Melia White House Hotel, Booked the hotel as a family room but they provided me with a double room Asked to cancel the booking and they said no even though it was their mistake Totally outrageous and I will never recommend this place to anyone , Nothing 
265568,Melia White House Hotel, I didn t like the fact that it was a connection Executive double bedroom and you could hear the people next door as if they were inside your room behind the wardrobe To make matters worse they woke up really early around 6 30am and were quite loud , Great location good value for money clean comfortable bed in good taste well kept all around Would recommend it 
265569,Melia White House Hotel, There was no car park and we had to drive around the hotel for half an hour trying to find a space the hotel staff just said when asked where to park there should be a space around the corner We then had to walk back to the hotel , The breakfast was amazing you there were six types of pillows to choose from to cater any special requirements Bed was extremely comfy 
265570,Melia White House Hotel, Took a long time to check in Also after I have checked in later in the evening when my card key couldn t work I had to wait in line again for a long while before I could get my card key sorted out , Location 
265571,Melia White House Hotel, The room smelled of damp which was rather unpleasant Otherwise the hotel was very nicely decorated an impressive building The food in The Place was disgusting ,No Positive
265572,Melia White House Hotel, Duvets more suitable for the arctic in winter than London in late summer left us hot and cold all night as we threw them on and off , Mostly comfortable 
265573,Melia White House Hotel, Only part that could be improved is perhaps the restaurant I know it has a Spanish theme however a selection of different meals could be provided but saying this it s just down the road to plenty bars restaurants etc , Friendly nothing is too much trouble for the staff everyone including the cleaners were friendly helpful accommodating Near enough to the city yet far enough away to avoid the traffic noise would definitely recommend 
265574,Melia White House Hotel, Just the bathroom window was a bit of a let down they were original and it showed compared with the great cleanliness and quality of everything else It was a little pricey too , Great booking arrangement quickly booked in using booking com email and straight to room for a quick turnaround Ideal venue for Body Control Pilates Development Weekend and minutes from the tube Great breakfast Staff swapped roles when guests started to queue to accommodate us quickly and efficiently Room was well appointed double 
265575,Melia White House Hotel, Reception staff were uncooperative as we have booked through booking com a superior double room and we got a small room with one bed They charged us more to move us to what should have been what we booked This is not the first time this happens with a booking com reservation Listening to the staff at the reception desk they were doing the same thing with all the guest saying this is what you booked and you have to pay more I was upset because he first said you booked a standard room and this is a standard room when I showed him the booking and that it is for a superior room he changed his words and said I mean superior I had the same exact experience in Catalonia hotel in Madrid and had to pay more to move to a normal room , The location was very good The room was pleasant and convenient Housekeeping staff were very efficient Room amenities were not bad 
265576,Melia White House Hotel, Very tiny room and the bathroom with narrow paths e g between the wall and the bed The air condition didn t work properly just noise producing The reception stuff was very formal and unhelpful without any wish to solve the problem with my accomodation documents I was not provided the payment receipt it looks like they lost it Very poor wi fi in the room , Regent s park and the tube are very close Polite concierge 
265577,Melia White House Hotel, Long wait to check out No apology optional service charge added to bar bill 12 5 for pouring an overpriced wine Parking not available , Good breakfast and nice bar though pricey 
265578,Melia White House Hotel, Room only a little space to get past bed Bathroom also a little cramped , Excellent location and very handy for underground Staff and service very good 
265579,Melia White House Hotel, The room was too cool for us initially no way to activate the heating Toilet seat broken so nearly unusable Window locks too loose In a disabled room with use of only one arm it is difficult to operate the 2 levers needed for the windows , The evening buffet was very good although expensive Enjoyed the breakfasts A special thank you to those at the entrance for operating the lift calling taxis The bar was very comfortable 
265580,Melia White House Hotel, My flight was delayed so I emailed the hotel to let them know I would be a day late via the Booking com website They said they never got the message and cancelled my reservation as a no show I had to get my friend who booked several rooms for her wedding to intervene to get me a room , Great location Friendly staff Nice amenities 
265581,Melia White House Hotel, we did have to wait over an hour to check in however the staff upgraded us to the executive room so overall wasnt too bad , The hotel was really clean staff were friendly excellent location 
265582,Melia White House Hotel, Room very tired Bathroom too small should just have shower It is dangerous getting in out of bath Have stayed in much better hotels in London with breakfast included for the same cost Wont stay at the Melia again , Staff were very helpful pleasant Check in was good Reception area is very nice Location good

265587,Melia White House Hotel, The room is very dark since window is very small and a bit noisy since just next to elevetor hole 7th floor , Location access to the center of London 
265588,Melia White House Hotel, One of the restaurants and bar was closed during our stay We would probably have chosen to eat at the hotel on our first night and it would have been nice to have a few drinks in the bar The Level Bar which you have to pre pay for drinks and snacks was odd not welcoming at all , Location near to tube station Helpful efficient staff Nice clean room 
265589,Melia White House Hotel,No Negative, Easy to find good location real ale pubs nearby two tube stations within 5 minutes walk bus stop outside C2 takes you straight to Victoria Station near the B T tower staff were excellent upgraded us to a queen sized room as it was my wife s Birthday and we were members of club Melia so comfortable altogether a wonderful weekend well done Melia
