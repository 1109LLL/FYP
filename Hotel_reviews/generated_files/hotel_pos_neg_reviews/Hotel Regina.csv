285884,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The center of the center Everything is in a walk distance The bad is the most comfortable one I had in an hotel room The body shampoo is extremely good 
285885,Hotel Regina, I asked a queen size bed but received two twin size The bed was comfortable but it wasn t comfortable to sleep with my partner in the middle This is was the only thing that bothered me, The room was pretty and clear facilities were new and in good shape The crew was perfect and gave an excellent service
285886,Hotel Regina, The 3rd bed is a sofa bed not as good as a real bed though ok They only ever left 2 cups and saucers for hot drinks a 3rd would have been useful , Clean tidy room with comfy beds Staff knew who we were and even that we d been there last year Nothing was any trouble to them and they were attentive but unobtrusive Attention to detail very good and we were made to feel like they were glad to have us staying with them 
285887,Hotel Regina,No Negative, balcony rooms are terrific super staff ask them for assistance they will gladly help you great breakfast close to everywhere along Las Ramblas easy access to car rentals airport museums and points of interest all close highly recommended 
285888,Hotel Regina, The door stop for the bathroom in the middle of the floor that I fell over and hit the floor hard and the dirt coffee cup that they set back on our tray , Location 
285889,Hotel Regina, Originally I was checked into an internal room with no natural light with a stag do next door depending on the purpose of our stay it would be calling the hotel directly to request a room that suits your needs prior to arrival , The Staff especially Elena who was very helpful and accommodating when I requested my room to be changed when I realised I was staying next door to a Stag do They were at capacity and I know that I was lucky that they were able to find me another room 
285890,Hotel Regina, The room was a bit small compared to what I am use to , The location was great the staff was very friendly and it was exactly what was needed for our stay 
285891,Hotel Regina, Everything was excellent, Very friendly and helpfull staff I checked in at night 2 am i was not happy with my room and hotel was completely full but they helped me and changed my room Also they have arranged special morning early breakfast for me 
285892,Hotel Regina, The last day I was there I had to checkout and come back in the afternoon for freshing up before I go to the airport They told me they had a bathroom in the lobby floor the I could use for that purpose When I came back in the afternoon I found out that this bathroom was just a small toilet booth was very smelly in there and very clustrofobic with a sink next to it which faces the bar Needless to say it was very uncomfortable and left me with a bad taste Maybe it s just me but I really expected more I felt dirty all the way home after that , In general the hotel is pretty much ordinary nothing too special The room was nice and the service was good But by far the best thing about the hotel were the staff All the desk people were very kind and helpful Especially one girl called Marta She was absolutely great Very helpful with everything I asked Great advice and suggestions And she s just so nice and charming 
285893,Hotel Regina, Wasn t happy that it didn t have a pool or gym to which booking com said it did which prompted the booking Will have to look at other sites in the future for reliability , Staff were great Food is healthy with no extra sugars
285894,Hotel Regina, At the morning around 9 you can hear people in the corridor since the door was not sound proofed at all , The location close to Placa Catalunya makes it so easy for transport and meeting point for the tours The aerobus from the airport drop you directly there so its cheap to come and go from the airport to the hotel We got welcoming cookies at the arriving It was my birthday during the stay and they bring a cake and a birthday card to the room The room was cleaned each day 
285895,Hotel Regina, No complaints there wasn t anything we didn t like , Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Regina Hotel We had 3 adults in our room and we could not fault our 7 night stay Staff bedding breakfast location facilities absolutely excellent 
285896,Hotel Regina, The view and access to ugly inner unfinished area , Wonderful comfortable bed extremely quiet room perfect for sleeping Room small by North American standards but very comfortable
285897,Hotel Regina, exoensive breakfast in next door facility compensated a bit by good tea coffee equipment in the room barhroom was somewhat cramped though fairly modern the beds were comfy the hotel is probably due for an update , central location practically on Catalunia Squ friendly staff
285898,Hotel Regina, The bed was extremely small The bed was really old so my back was killing me Also the pillows were the worst bathroom floor with dark stains, Location
285899,Hotel Regina, Really noisy in the room on the first night because of a live music event at the hotel No soundproof of the room walls at all can clearly hear people talking in the corridor especially annoying during the night, Almost perfect location within walking distance to loads of sights and good restaurants Really friendly and helpful staff
285900,Hotel Regina, The only bad thing I would say was that the room wasn t totally sound proof whilst it wasn t super noisy no traffic or anything it was a bit noisier than other hotels I ve stayed in , The staff were very helpful friendly And the breakfast had a good selection of food The room wasn t huge but enough space for the amount of time you are in it 
285901,Hotel Regina,No Negative, great location next to pla a catalunya Close to Metro station and buses Many restaurants and shops around the hotel Right at the beginning of the Rambla street Tasty breakfast Clean and comfort room free wifi and printer nice staff very recommended 
285902,Hotel Regina, You can use the pool but it costs extra Room service could be betterand more water should be provided as the tap water is awful , The family room was HUGE The staff fpund out it was my son s birthday and had a birthday card cake and candle waiting for him in our room after a day out sighseeing The staff are super friendly and helpful they arranged a fantastic night out to see some authentic flamenco 
285903,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Most of the rooms do not have windows to the exterior that make them very dark last day it was a problem with the odor of the water excess of Clorox I was wearing a silver ring that became dark and took me a week to get rid of the smell mostly in my hair Other customers were complaining too 
285904,Hotel Regina,No Negative, We asked to change the room after our first night as we couldn t see out of the window The staff were very accommodating and changed our room without fuss There is a really good breakfast with a selection of cold meats fresh fruit pastries and hot food The bar in the hotel is pleasant and is nice and comfortable after a long day 
285905,Hotel Regina,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay at Hotal Regina The location was excellent with easy access to various sights and transport options The staff was friendly and attentive from greeting the kids with balloon animals on arrival to providing excellent restaurant recommendations the breakfast was great best bacon we ve ever had Would certainly stay here again if visiting Barcelona 
285906,Hotel Regina, Has very thin wall and sometimes it s become very noisy depending on who s staying at next room , Very very good location friendly staff and nice choice of breakfast
285907,Hotel Regina, The bar downstairs is a little quiet and quite brightly lit at night, The room was comfortable and the hotel staff were very helpful They booked a trip to Montserrat for us over the phone and it was all very smooth The location is also excellent both for transport from the airport and local exploring 
285908,Hotel Regina, Our room was on the First floor we could hear noise from the Metro and from the street but great location though The water had chlorine smell like from the pool and isn t good for drinking , The room was thorougly cleaned with fresh towels every day We got coffee and tea in the room loved the bathroom

285913,Hotel Regina, You can hear everything outside of the hotel room , The bed was amazing I wish I could take it back to London with me The tea was delicious Best cups of tea I ve ever had Perfect distance from all attractions Staff were beautiful people 
285914,Hotel Regina, Preferred carpet in bedroom rather than wooden floor as a little clinical with all white pale soft furnishings bedding but that s being rather picky I suppose and appreciate easier to keep clean , Lovely room fragrance and chillout music in Reception areas Very good variety quality of food at breakfast Very clean nice room decent size and good bathroom 
285915,Hotel Regina, Can t think of any , Great location near the Placa Catalunya area Walking distance to La Ramblas Gothic quarter La Bouqeria and other tourist spots Cheapest and comfortable way to arrive is to take the Aerobus from the aiport to get to Placa Catalunya and walk 3 min to the hotel Underground metro bus station etc is very nearby with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from You can contact the hotel and they will arrange a rental car if you need one for your Monserat trip 
285916,Hotel Regina, Nothing to complaint , The room was spacious clean and comfortable Internet is fast Location is great near to subway and La Rambla Right in front of the hotel there is a taxi stand with lots of taxi queuing 
285917,Hotel Regina, Room had no view only 1 small frosted window that looked at a wall not a lot of light got into the room so needed the lights on all the time as was quite dark The Hotel did not have a restaurant and though you could order food the choice was quite limited and I think came from an outside source it was quite expensive as well , Location was perfect we got the Aerobes from the Airport which stopped at the back of the Hotel The hotel was lovely clean and room was nice staff were friendly and helpful 
285918,Hotel Regina, Hallways were a little dirty with remodeling shower smelled a little weird , Very comfortable bed excellent location and friendly staff Good value overall 
285919,Hotel Regina, The lack of view our room looked out over the rear of five storey hoardings could only just see the sky very disappointing , Staff and location were perfect

285921,Hotel Regina, No extra blankets It got cold at night The bathroom didn t have any shelf space Very dark room For the price I expect better , Very friendly staff 
285922,Hotel Regina, Most of the staff was restless inpatient Though two young guys at the front desk were OK so sorry their impression was left unfelt There were rennovations at and around the hotel which made it very noisy during the day The single room was tiny and the desk and chair were uncomfortable to work on , Location Lobby is nicely done 
285923,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Perfect location beautiful hotel comfortable bed and the friendliest most helpful staff I ve encountered at any hotel especially Laura Absolute fantastic hotel 
285924,Hotel Regina, Really need to be freshened up Especially the bathroom Don t get me wrong it is clean But the cabin should be changed , The location Really great next to subway lines the rambla shops the tourist busses 
285925,Hotel Regina, Nothing, Hotel location is amazing right in centre of Barcelona everything is walking distance Public Transport facilities are superb Hotel itself is very clean staff is polite very good breakfast

285930,Hotel Regina, Room size was a little bit smaller than what was expected from the pictures , The location was absolutely perfect Right by Plaza Catalunya with taxi rank outside and near main stores restaurants and close to local markets The free wifi was fast and didn t have any problems with it Staff were friendly and very accommodating and I would definitely stay here again 
285931,Hotel Regina, Slow wifi, There are few hotels in Barcelona having family suites Hotel Regina is a perfect choice for families with its great location and friendly staff 
285932,Hotel Regina, We would have liked the hotel to offer a variety of pillows and perhaps some more storage space the room got very messy , The staff was very friendly The location was perfect for us A street away from the middle The room was modern and minimalistic We were 3 people staying in one room and we didn t feel overly crowded 
285933,Hotel Regina,No Negative, I ve been to Barcelona multiple time and to different hotels all in the center but this stay was from far THE best the hotel has the perfect location for shopping visiting brunch restaurant bars The rooms are cosy and clean and the staff is adorable and helpful The couches at the reception are just perfectly comfortable I highly recommend it 
285934,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Room was good plenty of choice for breakfast although the hot selection could have been slightly better E G Baked Bean s rather than steamed veg But apart from that it was perfectly adequate Staff were very helpful and the hotel was in a great location Would definitely recommend hotel 
285935,Hotel Regina, Rooms are really small and cold should be renovated , Perfect location very nice staff excellent breakfast nice and cosy interior in lobby bar Greetings to barman from lobby bar so kind and helpful person real gentleman 
285936,Hotel Regina, The room had a very small window to the back, I loved the lobby and bar area really great to sit for a cup of tea or a drink and tapas felt like home 
285937,Hotel Regina, Lack of English breakfast tea bags at breakfast time, Bedroom nice and comfy bed and pillows Good choice at breakfast Polite and friendly staff Nice bar area
285938,Hotel Regina, I booked a double room i was told I d booked a single the man was quite rude we were put in a single room I had booked in Mr Mrs We did change to another room which was bigger The triple room I d booked did not have an over head shower so was difficult to only have the hand held shower , The bar staff were lovely 
285939,Hotel Regina, No complaints, Overall a great stay Hotel was in a good Central location Hop On Hop Off Bus stops just across the road 25 Rooms had a traditional and interesting layout Staff were very friendly and helpful Being opposite Plaza Catalunya metro was handy when travelling to and from office and also to many other attractions like port and la ramblas Breakfast was very good 
285940,Hotel Regina, Room TV Systems but outdated live egg station for breakfast would have been nice to have some fresh cooked breakfast , Lovely staff service location 
285941,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Staff were good same as previous trip Even helped with request for balcony view Much appreciated I travel to Barcelona every year Regina is now my hotel of choice 
285942,Hotel Regina, there s a bit of soundproof issue , 1 very friendly staffs they ve been extremely helpful 2 location is amazing it takes about 1 2 minutes from plaza catalunya by foot 3 very clean cozy room 
285943,Hotel Regina, Price should incl wz breakfast Although Excellent the hotel rate should b 3Stars not 4 Stars , Location Wifi Staffs Excellent Will stay there again 
285944,Hotel Regina, We were lucky to get upgraded to a superior room but the ensuite was quite small with the sink being in the bedroom a little odd we thought for a superior room , Fabulous location room with a Juliette balcony Staff very accommodating and helpful Perfect location 
285945,Hotel Regina, really a small detail but if a negative detail can be given it would be the windows of the rooms It would have been good that with the renewal of the rooms they also had changed the windows But as said a detail , I ve been going here for 8 years now and they have very nicely renewed the hotel I know that I ll be going there again at least 2 times a year D
285946,Hotel Regina, Breakfast was not great no hot food left with 2 hours to go before breakfast finished scrambled egg was cold Only 3 choices of cereal bit disappointing due to price we paid Not enough coffee tea milk etc in room especially the room for three people was not three of everything, Lovely hotel in fantastic spot beds very comfortable
285947,Hotel Regina, The room was awful designed by a man for a man probably No dressing table or anywhere to sit and put on makeup as you have to stand to attention in the bathroom and there is no shelf over the sink You have to keep bending down to pick up things from the little unit underneath the sink The spare loo roll holder is in the doorway of the shower The toilet has a little platform halfway down it which catches everything double gross There is no sanitary provision ladies just a gross open bin underneath a light There is a glass topped table in the bedroom with a lethal sharp corner in the dark The kettle flex is too short you have to unplug it to use which means bending low beneath the table and banging your head on the pendant light fitting each time you stand up you can t avoid it , The staff were lovely 
285948,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The staff at the reception was very helful the hotel is at great location I couldn t choose better Next time I will be staying at the same place 
285949,Hotel Regina, tiny but practical bathroom could have done with a shelf in the shower to hold toiletries and perhaps mirror over the table in the bedroom as more than one female would fight over the make up room I m nit picking here and not complaining , nicest gluten free bread cooked fresh on request at breakfast Location perfect room lovely and bed so so comfy struggled to get out of bed in the morning Dressing gown and slippers were a nice touch Shame toiletries were not replenished daily clean towels daily which was heaven
285950,Hotel Regina, Everything was perfect , The staff was super helpful and kind and friendly the location is just amazing It s close to almost everything I really liked it 
285951,Hotel Regina, Nothing, The position is excellent The breakfast was excellent You can use the hotel wi fi from the coffee shop on the corner The staff were helpful and pleasant 
285952,Hotel Regina, MoreTV choices i e news information channels needs improvement Is there at least one english lang entertainment channel available Also needed a softer thinner pillow choice and perhaps a duvet on the bed Asked for the pillow but did not arrive Found the bed hard to get warm A good english language newspaper The times Globe and Mail or the Guardian available at least to purchase Perhaps you could have told us about the aerporter bus from the airport Very prompt clean close to the hotel and very cost effective , Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely consider staying there again and recommending it to our friends
285953,Hotel Regina, Perfect location in city center but depending on room you will hear street noise as this hotel is on the corner too a vety busy street, Location is great friendly efficient staff
285954,Hotel Regina, We shared a patio with the room next door and they would sit on their phone right outside of the window were our children were sleeping Could hear everyone in the hallway , Staff was super friendly Location was great Hotel was clean and beds comfy Close to the shopping and the hop on hop off bus was 2 minutes up the street The breakfast that was included was very good 
285955,Hotel Regina, Tiny elevators 3 night stay no maid service on second day Still waiting for refund from Booking com Short staffed 16 for Breakfast not included after paying a 250 a day Concierge booked excursion but not a lot of information about it Door man on duty never opened the door or acknowledged us Wouldn t let us use a converter for a few hours but happy to sell us one , Location Clean lobby 
285956,Hotel Regina, The rooms are not uniform in size There are large rooms and very small rooms In Bath there is only soap , Courteous staff newly renovated rooms great location good breakfast 
285957,Hotel Regina,No Negative, It was a beautiful Hotel and it was in the perfect location to walk where we wanted to go The staff was very friendly and helpful I was traveling with my sister and we both had an excellent time We shopped a lot and did some sightseeing We loved it 
285958,Hotel Regina, The room for 4 was a bit of a tight squeeze They did not have any multi region wall sockets and so as American British Australian tourists must bring their own adapters , My Daughter has a wheat allergy and for breakfast they went out of their way to make her gluten free breakfast items The staff were excellent and always helpful
285959,Hotel Regina, Superior room located at the first floor is very loud and next to the garbage bins 4 of them infront of the window creating no comfort at all i had to keep continuously the curtains pulled and no daylight in the room is not pleasant at all Pitty as the staff is nice and helpful and the hotel seems to be generally alright , Very good location friendly and helpful staff
285960,Hotel Regina, Everyting, Bad reception dirty room 9 square meters no heating super noisy bed for kids and certainly not two adults all in all not worth more that a cheap economic hotel we lost our money and came out sick b cause of the smell and the freezing room
285961,Hotel Regina, Very disappointed that we could hear water running down the pipes in our room We did ask to be moved but were told they couldn t guarantee that that wouldn t happen in another room as they were in an older building, Loved it was close to everthing very central to the city centre
285962,Hotel Regina, Very expensive front of house presented as really up market but the actual room was poor with no window small and cramped and 2nd and 3rd beds were roll out temporary and uncomfortable I paid for four beds for four adults I feel that what was advertised on line and in fotos was not accurate , Location great
285963,Hotel Regina, Paper thin walls provided no sound insulation from noises emanating from neighbouring rooms or people in the main floor lobby Fortunately things quieted down after 11 pm and we managed a comfortable and restful night s sleep , Central location 2 minutes walk from La Rambla and hop on hop off bus stop Hotel staff and porter were very helpful in providing guidance to keep attraction Good selection on Continental Breakfast and plenty of food 
285964,Hotel Regina, People in adjacent room very loud Most hotels could improve their sound reductions , Very helpful staff Well appointed room perfect for my sister and me traveling together 
285965,Hotel Regina, The room is not well isolated and everything was very loud You could hear the metro passing in the underground and all neighbours moving The room located in the 1st floor and at the street corner did make the stay very uncomfortable as you could hear everything on the street like being next to the people on the nearby terrace Very uncomfortable bathroom as you could not realise how much it could be seen from outside The room was superior only by the dimension otherwise a 3 room to raise it to a 4 standard some investments should be made By far too expensive for it s offering apart location , The hotel is very well located and staff is indeed friendly and helpful one can count on them Comfortable bed and clean bathroom
285966,Hotel Regina, i think i overpaid i think i could have had a hotel in as good a location which was excellent which was maybe a little more luxurious My room was noisy I suppose understandable given location and quite small , Breakfast buffet was good staff very helpful and room was impeccably cleaned each day 
285967,Hotel Regina, Door to the hallway was not as soundproof as it perhaps could have been could hear other doors opening and closing occassionally , Staff were extremely helpful rooms were spacious clean and well serviced Have stayed here before and will definitely stay again and recommend it to others 
285968,Hotel Regina, Just because the staff had the style of an elegant hotel doesn t make them one Nice hotel but nothing special if it has to be a 4 hotel it must be judged by details Breakfast could have been better noisy street especially at night i could hear a man snoring no blankets overpriced for what it provides It made me a bad impression that they asked me to pay the minute I arrived and not at the check out , Nice comfortable bed good location good wifi signal
285969,Hotel Regina, The seal on the shower wasn t very good but the issue could be avoided by being careful not to point the showerhead at the door when washing my hair Otherwise this hotel was perfect , The buffet breakfast had great variety delicious and excellent coffee The bedroom was spacious very quiet even though overlooking the front street air conditioning was very good and the beds very comfy Can t wait to go back 
285970,Hotel Regina, The room was large and had everything we needed but frugally decorated The odd tasteful wall hanging would not go amiss , Fabulous location just off the Plata de Catalunya and the Rambles The staff were all very friendly Included breakfast was much appreciated 
285971,Hotel Regina, It was a double room with twin wash basins but as with all hotels we stayed at only ONE luggage rack Also a hook for the hand towels would be helpful , Clean comfortable room twin wash basins plenty of space we did book a superior room 
285972,Hotel Regina, Nothing i can fault on this hotel, Central location right next to Plaza Catalunya easy access to everything Modern and clean hotel room with a shower cladded in marbles to die for prompt service and grand looking Loved and enjoyed the stay thoroughly will definitely stay back at the same hotel the next time we are visiting Metro bus and taxi right on your doorstep
285973,Hotel Regina, nothing, Really good location for transport to and from airport and around the city Room spacious quiet and air con worked like a dream which is how we slept 
285974,Hotel Regina, Sound insulation could have been better We could hear guests talking along the corridor There is some kind of government agency next door unemployment office and a long line of young people opposite the entrance to the hotel interfering with easy access and exit Not the fault of the hotel though , Staff friendly and helpful We got upgraded to a better room with no cost involved 
285975,Hotel Regina, Price a little bit high , Great location Very close to all public transports like bus metro taxi or city tours 24 hour open reseption Also breakfast is very good Personel is very helpful 
285976,Hotel Regina, None, Location is just steps away from Plaza Catalunya and the train line Very convenient Very clean simple yet comfortable facility Staff is very helpful accommodating and can speak English There were 4 of us in one room and the hotel prepared the details down from extra beds made ready to number of towels and bottled water We didn t have to call the front desk for any additional request We were well taken care of from quick and easy check in to a ready room for rest and relaxation Big plus after a very long day of traveling Would love to stay here again when in town 
285977,Hotel Regina, The location is good but not in the center of the old city , Staff was helpful and very pleasant room was comfortable for the money Very family positive feeling Breakfast was good 
285978,Hotel Regina, The air conditioning sistem was outside our room and we couldn t use the balcony but being so central wasn t that bad just be out and about The room in very quiet , Confort staff and location were excelent 
285979,Hotel Regina, Could have had more pillows for the bed , Excellent location at the head of la rambla within easy reach of the metro and tourist buses at place de cataluyna Nice sized room with very effective air con which was very welcome 
285980,Hotel Regina, The room was at the back and at night was very noisy Room for 3 needs to have all items for 3 such as 3 glasses teacups etc , The property is in an excellent location to LA Rambla and other places of interest Hotel good value for money and staff very friendly professional and he pful 
285981,Hotel Regina, All the staff were wonderful apart from the miserable waitress in the breakfast room who completely ruined our morning Rest of the the reception team were wonderful and very apologetic, Excellent location
285982,Hotel Regina, Liked it all highly recommend , From the attentive and well informed staff to the bartender the simple and clean decor of rooms and spaces to the well appointed breakfast buffet our stay was marvelous Will be back in November Can t leave out the great lovation as well as the reasonable costs We had two rooms I was envious of our teenagers double room the wife and I opted for the queen bed albeit a bit smaller room 
285983,Hotel Regina, Apart from noise coming from outside transports there is another noise that sounds like someone is pulling the cart Given that hotel is in central management shoulld consider having sound proof windows celebrated my birthday and even have to pay for upgrade didnt do a little special gesture for me , Location
285984,Hotel Regina, the house keeping kept coming into the room with out knocking the door every day more than once in the morning now we did not have the dont disturb sign on but still they should knock , The Staff are the most helpful in the reception and they do it with pleasure to help you find locations or transport etc 
285985,Hotel Regina, Room a little on small side , Very comfortable stay two nights Great location for getting around Barcelona Wouldn t hesitate to stay again Recommended 
285986,Hotel Regina, No space in bathroom for my own toiletries and make up this wound up on the floor Light in internal bathroom not good for putting make up on Quite masculine set up and colours Regina has had a Scandi stripped back and grey makeover BUT Pleasant stay in excellent location with good facilities otherwise,No Positive
285987,Hotel Regina, On the 1st floor and there is a rumbling noise every 5 mins during the day which we later found our was the metro trains as we were over the station Didn t really bother us too much once we found out what it was Breakfast was good but as right in the centre there are lots of cheaper options close by Does sound like this is a negative review but it is not really , Great location Comfortable bed and pillows Friendly staff Good facilities Clean 
285988,Hotel Regina, My friend was able to check in early however the staff had to change his room Mine was great however his was pretty rough Zero view bad carpets and a stain in the plaster I had a lovely view newer laminant wood floors and no plaster stains ,No Positive
285989,Hotel Regina, We could easily hear other people in the hallway or other rooms nearby Not a huge problem in our opinion as it didn t bother us very much , The cleanliness of the place no carpet wood floor loved it The room design was totally our style It was apparently renovated earlier this year they did a great job Staff was very helpful anytime 
285990,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The Staff are very friendly and accommodating Reception assisted with making dinner reservations and arranged shuttles to La Rocca shopping village They also provided us with valuable information to get around the city with ease and also provided great tips on the best beaches in Barcelona The hotel is located in a quieter part of Plaka Catalunya but conveniently situated near la ramblas and all boutique stores and restaurants The hotel still maintained its Spanish authenticity while still creating a modern feel 
285991,Hotel Regina, Hotel was a bit tired and there was often the smell of sewage in Bergara , Hard to beat the location just off Plaza Catalunya within easy walking distance of many of Barcelonas main attractions and this more than compensated for small shortcomings Taxis are quite cheap and plentiful and are a good way to save tired legs
285992,Hotel Regina, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be Also did not appreciate that the window was broken and herd noises for the whole night , it had facilities that I have not had at other hotels
285993,Hotel Regina, I cannot fault my stay, I will have opportunity to highly recommend your hotel Particularly friendly staff and much appreciated as senior solo guest Excellent service and very professional and will stay again in future Excellent location Lovely breakfast and good value for rate Personal cheers to you all Patricia australia
285994,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Helpful staff especially Michel Very central Great rooms comfy beds good size rooms Very quiet and fabulous air con Breakfast tortilla espanyol delicious 
285995,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Close to the gothic quarter but not on top of it so less noisy A quaint little cafe around the corner great for breakfast The hotel has been retrofitted to be totally modern inside A taxi stand outside the hotel made getting to the port easy 
285996,Hotel Regina, Everything else The room was not ready by check in and I had been sitting there waiting Other hotels would make sure your room was done before guests who hadn t even shown up yet The room was super tiny and the one small window opened into a shaft It was claustrophobic No 4 star hotel I have ever been in has ever been so small and uncomfortable The pillows were flat and the walking space was so small The gym and pool were 5 blocks away and for a pretty high fee While the location is fantastic I m sure there must be better places to stay in that area , The location and the staff were very nice 
285997,Hotel Regina, Our room had the most awful view of the hotel s AC heating equipment We could not look out onto the street due to a massive grill that covers the hotel s facade , Staff very helpful and well informed about the city and local events Appreciated the hotel s proximity to restaurants shopping metro stations and airport shuttle Great breakfast buffet Quiet comfortable and clean accommodations 
285998,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The hotel is at a very good location At the heart of Barcelona The toilets showers were clean also they were renovated The hotel was very clean and the staff was over welcomed My friends had the best holidays Highly recommended 
285999,Hotel Regina, Nothing We were very happy with our stay at hotel Regina We will be back if staying in Barcelona again , Clean modern hotel in excellent location close to all main transport links in Barcelona Very comfy beds with lots of space in bedrooms Staff on reception desk very helpful with checking us in and answering any questions 
286000,Hotel Regina, had to wait for 2PM to get in the room after flying from the US Was hoping since they had our flights before hand we would have a room available but instead had to wait in the lobby until 2PM exhausted from the overnight flight , perfect location 
286001,Hotel Regina, nothing, Staffs are very helpful I booked this hotel for my parents trip to EU They don t speak any English and I am not with them I asked the hotel staffs to help them finding taxi to airport and lead them to restaurant by a simple phone call and they showed me what a good hotel service is 
286002,Hotel Regina, some staff racism towards arab i notice the hotel doesn t welcome arab tourist one resptionest was really not friendly if he has bad experince with one guest he shouldn t blame other , location clean family hotel
286003,Hotel Regina, Hard pressed to find negatives about Hotel Regina I suppose it would be nice to include breakfast in the rate although there is a place across the street that serves a reasonable priced breakfast plus there are 2 cafes half a block from the hotel This is minor but I would rather have less drinks stocked in the room fridge at high prices and allow more room in the fridge for the guest to store water or other foods we may purchase at the Boqueria market or other nearby stores that is just my opinion others may like having beverages and snacks available for purchase in the room The above were minor issues Highly recommend Hotel Regina and would stay again , Hotel Regina is a gem located in the perfect spot for a few days in Barcelona whether coming in for a cruise or just to visit this great city on your own The beds were very comfortable best on our trip The cubby for hanging clothes and shelving cubes were great for getting organized The bathroom was large and nice to have 2 separate sinks outside the tub toilet area Nice high quality soap dispensers with upgraded soaps Also liked having a bathtub to relax after a full day of sightseeing The pull out sofa bed was newer and had a decent mattress for our teen The hotel had a lobby to relax upon return and a bar Staff were very pleasant 
286004,Hotel Regina, None, Location is very centre Room is very good size Like the his and her sink Coffee tea maker safe and fridge are all very usurious Free wifi is definitely a must Reception staff are so friendly 
286005,Hotel Regina, Breakfast would have been 16 euros each which is outrageous though they did offer a deal of 11 each per day but we had to eat there every morning Perfectly good and more affordable breakfasts available nearby , I have never seen such a large bed in my entire life And it was comfy too We had a triple room and our son had a little privacy being in an alcove area off the main room Sheets and towels changed often and lovely toiletries provided 
286006,Hotel Regina, My view out of the balcony was not very nice kind of back side construction of a bill board , Excellent breakfast though it had to be paid extra Very helpful and friendly staff Right in the centre off Plaza Catalunya Many interesting places in walking distance 
286007,Hotel Regina,No Negative, excellent location and the hotel was very beautiful the room was a nice size bathroom was modern with marble and decor was great which made for a comfortable stay 
286008,Hotel Regina, Our room temp was in the mid 80s when we checked in and it took the AC nearly 24 hrs running continuously to bring it to a manageable level Also surprised by the 10 different large cracks in the walls as the building has settled , Breakfast setup was very good
286009,Hotel Regina, There is no toothbrush toothpaste We stayed for 3 nights but there is no water bottles at the second and the third night which is not fair , Receptionist at the hotel is very friendly 
286010,Hotel Regina, The walls are thin and you can hear a lot of noise from adjoining rooms and out in the hallways , Great location Nice modern hotel great bar breakfast area also 
286011,Hotel Regina, Nothing , Great location so close to Plaza Catalu a and the Ramblas Buses and taxis are available all the time Also Paseo de Gracia is within walking distance There s a Starbuck s right around the corner and many good places to eat are also within walking distance 
286012,Hotel Regina, Breakfast is a bit overpriced better take a coffee sandwich scramble eggs at a small cafe next door Just a hint, Great location modern minimalistic room design great old style lobby excellent service at the reception friendly helpfull Superb beds like a cloud and exquisite marble bathrooms mmmm
286013,Hotel Regina, Very noisy could here the 3 people partying in the room next door all night , Location is amazing Right in the heart of the best shopping restaurants and transport within 2 min walk Breakfast was good 
286014,Hotel Regina, Staff in the lobby bar was rude No bike renting possibility or place to keep your rented bike in store , Great location room was clean staff at the reception was lovely Breakfast was ok 
286015,Hotel Regina, I paid for a 4 stars hotel the hotel deserves 3 stars maximum here s what I saw there Old building Old and slow elevator The shower has a small head but was okay Bathroom was poor Air conditioning was very difficult to adjust When you walk on the floor it makes noise They didn t provide tissues and toilet papers unless we ask for it Free water just for the first day small mini bottles should be for all the days The reception I called them around 10 times they picked up twice When I complained about the issues I m facing the front desk manager rude and not even wearing a name badge told me if you don t like our hotel you can leave it and you shouldn t compare it to hotels in Europe Someone remind me where is spain He didn t even try to satisfy me way too too expensive poor value for money I don t recommend this hotel, The location is perfect Superior room size was big 
286016,Hotel Regina, The bathroom counters surprised me at how old they are There are two elevators but only one of them is accessible by a small ramp big you have heavy luggage you only have this option But the elevators are pretty quick and not crowded so it is not really a prblem , Hotel Regina is the sister hotel to Hotel Pulitzer and right next door Regina presents a beautiful lobby as well as Pulitzer and staff are just as professional Regina s rooms are a bit larger bit slightly older The hotel has all the comforts you need and get next door The location cannot be beat for being central in Barcelona We could get to even the beach with 10 15 minutes walking Plus most tours start near the Placa Catalunya so it s convenient when meeting up As well the Metro and train is easily accessible from this hotel 
286017,Hotel Regina, We didn t come in hopes to get a swim in a pool but if we had we would have been disappointed as there is no pool here Check in was 2 o clock and I got there at 2 05 the room was not ready but in their defense they did make up our room with a little anniversary present inside for us could have taken longer for the attention to detail , We live 20 minutes away in a town and we spent a night here for our anniversary to get some alone time from our children and busy lifestyle Even though we are very familiar with the city our one night stay here really felt like a great little vacation It is in a great spot very central and we had a room that looked over a very busy street but it was very well insulated from the noise The bed was very comfortable room was very clean the staff was really friendly we didn t try the restaurant because we had reservations elsewhere at night and we tried a great little breakfast joint that was a short walk away Barcelona is full of great restaurants and there are so many close by to Hotel Regina but we did take a look in the restaurant and it looked like a comfortable setting 
286018,Hotel Regina, I asked for a place to eat where the locals would enjoy the hotel recommended a place called trocaderos about 10 minute walk away Food was terrible must be a partner of the hotel because they gave us a voucher for a free cava Don t trust their advice look on Yelp prior to going Breakfast was 16 per person and with a family of four would have totaled 64 for breakfast pretty pricey Starbucks and cafes and la boqueria really close by so we didn t waste our money on the hotel food The window on our room went directly to an outside access for maintenance This didn t really make me feel secure because you could literally walk out the window and go to other room windows and break in etc won t be back, Great location next to placa de catalunya 
286019,Hotel Regina, Dirty scuff marks all over the bedroom wall No Sky TV so limited English channels Toaster remained broken in dining room throughout our stay , The location and the friendliness of the staff The room was adequate 
286020,Hotel Regina, Rooms too small bathrooms too tiny Poor breakfast selection Policy on children that you cannot add a extra bed even if room is big enough to accommodate it , Very warm and helpful staff Best possible location bang in the centre of everything 
286021,Hotel Regina, Tatty dirty carpets poor condition of facilities broken glass in lift Expensive poor value Room cramped and badly layed out small space around bed TV high on wall , Staff so nice Location super Super quiet room as requested 
286022,Hotel Regina, The description of the hotel was misleading The room was described as having x3 beds however the third bed was a sofa bed this should have been specified , Location was central near the hop on and hop off buses 
286023,Hotel Regina, The banging of the doors all the time could hear other people using there bathrooms and the house keeper using the vacuum cleaner outside our room at 8am in the morning one of the noisest rooms we have ever stayed in , Location
286024,Hotel Regina, The door to the toilet i room 411 was not working We couldn t close it And we heard the doors to all the other hotelsrooms all the time because they were hard to close aswell so it was quite noisy , The beds and the interiers in the room was modern and very nice We 4 girls would recomend this hotel to others that want a pleasant stay at a beautiful hotel in Barcelona 
286025,Hotel Regina, Had a bit of a mix up with them charging us extra for breakfast but that could be attributed to a language barrier It all got sorted in the end and the staff was pleasant and accommodating , Wonderful location and lovely rooms Everything was clean Staff helped us get a rental car for two days when we couldn t find a good deal online Very helpful and cheerful 
286026,Hotel Regina, The elevators are a little slow , The location just off the square greatly contributed to the peaceful character of the hotel The staff was friendly and helpful without being overly informative 
286027,Hotel Regina, Taxi support to tell how much from airport to destination hotel The town was empty no need to cheat, All was very good staff excellent helpful even though several rainy days taxi driver from airport ripped us off he added and added to 47 Europe Took my credit card since did not have euros And made it come up to 47 Pouring rain did not get receipt and could not get to change it Hotel was very sad 
286028,Hotel Regina, The dark colour scheme of the bedrooms , 1st class location handy for shopping and La Rambla Extremely helpful and friendly staff very welcoming Great breakfast Comfy bed 
286029,Hotel Regina, The view from the balcony was the worst My room was on the backside of the hotel and you are basically just staring at a giant metal construction I also didn t care much for the hallway on the 5th floor Looked very old and cheap , Very comfy Nice warm shower bathrobe and slippers The bed was great Personal was very polite and nice 
286030,Hotel Regina, The only fault I could find during our stay was the lack of any shelving in the bathroom for wash bags etc There was space to fit one so why not do it I would also say that while there was a good choice of foods and excellent coffee at breakfast the hot items were not great and didn t appeal at all which was disappointing , We liked the location which was absolutely perfect and the hotel kindly upgraded our room 219 because the one we had booked wasn t ready when we arrived which was well before the official check in time It was spacious spotlessly clean had a very large comfortable bed and excellent bed linen It didn t have a view but there was a fantastic shower in the clean bright marble bathroom and very efficient quiet air con so all in all we were pleased with our room 
286031,Hotel Regina, Air conditioning was not very effective in our room Sink was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom which was caused inconvenience in the morning for our family of three as the noise of running water one of us brushing teeth would wake up the other two Breakfast was very ordinary the breakfast area has a feeling of a cheap restaurant , Excellent location cannot beat it Staff was very friendly beds were comfortable Room size was good we were a family of three 
286032,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Regina is well located with just a minute walk to the city square P Catalunya Hotel room was cozy and clean Our special thanks to David San Nicol s for helping us with early check in Breakfast was a sufficient spread and good We enjoyed Barcelona and recommend this hotel highly 
286033,Hotel Regina, We had to have breakfast at the sister hotel next door and the breakfast there was much nicer than at Hotel Regina, We loved the room the fact that even though we were sharing a room there was a sliding door between the kids and us 
286034,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The concierge was extremely helpful in advising us how to plan our weekend with what we wanted to do extra consideration taken due to St George s book day in Barcelona 
286035,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly They catered to the needs of the travellers The location of the hotel is great It s close to the subway station and numerous bus stops The restaurants and shopping areas around the hotel was great I highly recommend this hotel 
286036,Hotel Regina, The room was slightly on the small side but not to the extent I wouldn t return , Central location with a central location noise All round a good hotel for weekend break 
286037,Hotel Regina, I previously stayed at this hotel in a larger room at a better rate This time I d say it was not value for money , Location accessible to transport and to main areas in center of the city e g Ramblas Gothic neighborhood The hotel is very clean and comfortable and staff is friendly and helpful 
286038,Hotel Regina, The elevator appeared to be ancient It was slow but worked OK , The Regina is an old hotel but very well kept up The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable The ceiling was unusually high which lent it an elegant air The location was great about 100 yards from La Rambla The bartender made these wonderful sangria drinks for us We highly recommend them 
286039,Hotel Regina, That I only stayed one night , The check in is Quick and professional The room was clean proportionate to its space and the TV and internet services worked great
286040,Hotel Regina, my wife would have liked a mirror above the table in the room as there was only a full length one next to the wardrobe otherwise spot on , really nice clean hotel comfortable bed excellent bathroom little balcony with no view but nice to be able to step outside 
286041,Hotel Regina, 1 The rooms aer not the same at booking so i was enpecting something better 2 they try to let me pay the breakfast and i didnt went for the breakfast 3 theire is no privecy between the rooms i can hear even the room behind me when he was snoring , The location
286042,Hotel Regina, I liked everything about this hotel , the family room was spacious and designed in such a way as to be almost in two parts which was perfect for the two that wanted to watch tv and the two that didn t 
286043,Hotel Regina, Noise between rooms is to high U can hear practicly all the conversations from ur next room neighburs Room on a 5th floor I was in the 1st night was not good and after talking to the reception they moved me to a much better one on a 1st floor , Modern rooms with an old touch Location is very central Satff id very helpfull
286044,Hotel Regina, There is no way this is a 4 hotel Very indifferent person an the check in The carpet in the hall is dirty The room was very small and not well maintained Cash deposit needed if you do not provide a credit card Noise , Location Very nice person at the check out

286046,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The position close to Plaza de Catalunya The Room was confortable and quiet The staff was very professional and helpfull Very good ratio quality money
286047,Hotel Regina, Nothing of any importance, Reception staff most helpful with booking football tickets and advising us on trips and the Metro Other staff very pleasant and friendly Excellent shower Location near to Place de Catalunya hop on off buses shops taxis Metro and La Rambla
286048,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from La Rambla and is in a very central location without being disturbed by traffic noise Reception staff were extremely helpful the room was large comfortable and cleaned beautifully each day Can t comment on the food here as we ate out 
286049,Hotel Regina, Indifferent personel Very loud slamming doors In general we had the impression that we where in a max 3 stars hotel, Nice breakfast Close to Ramble and city center 
286050,Hotel Regina, Common areas outside of rooms need significant improvement I am not sure if they were replacing carpet or or was just dirty and stained , Excellent location Room updated and clean Fairly good but basic breakfast
286051,Hotel Regina, Room is rather basic and lacks a little atmosphere Breakfast lacks a little Spanish specialties like Spanish cheeses ham and the likes , Perfect location for a spending a few days in Barcelona Friendly staff Room is very clean 
286052,Hotel Regina, Noisy neighbors but I guess that s not the hotel s fault , Accesible location to the best parts of town Walking distance from the Ramblas Old Town restaurants etc Wonderful staff Room service was good Room was refurbished in good taste 
286053,Hotel Regina, Don t stay in room 207 it was noisy it sounded like the room was next to a water works Not very comfortable beds very hard , This hotel was in a great location and friendly staff 
286054,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Excellent location very close to Placa Catalunya Friendly staff who gave us a free upgrade to a spacious room on the top floor Great breakfast and trendy interior Also the room was suprisingly quiet for such a prime location and busy square close by 
286055,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The hotel staff are courteous and helpful the reception staff are exceptionally helpful and they all speak good English the cleaning ladies clean the room s every day leaving fresh clean towels bed linen and the room immaculate 
286056,Hotel Regina, The room had no soundproofing could hear everything from other rooms embarrassing when you have you kids with you We booked for two adults and two kids however there was only two glasses for water essentially two of everything no consideration for more occupants Two lifts and one was antique NO atmosphere in hotel bar lounge no music not even background The parking is an external car park however linked to hotel for payment and despite asking multiple times how to get into it early in the morning they would not come and show us we ended up walking down the ramp with suitcases and kids in pouring rain Very Disappointing stay , The Staff were welcoming on arrival The building is pretty 
286057,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Location is fantastic 2 mins walk from the Plaza Catalunya metro station and the bus stops for the aerobus to from the airport Nice modern rooms currently refurbishing the rooms but the work is only done during the day when you are out exploring Staff were friendly and gave us advice map to help us 
286058,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The staff is absolutely the best and friendliest The rooms are clean and the quad is huge with 4 real and comfortable beds Location is perfect near Plaza Catalu a were all transportation buses depart It is at the top of La Rambla but not too close which was perfect 
286059,Hotel Regina, There wasn t a duvet or blanket on the bed so I had to go and get one from housekeeping It was February and cold , The location was great Right by the square 
286060,Hotel Regina, During the night ca 01 00 AM there was some noise Like knocking on my room door or from the neighbour room Strange Ramblas isn t the best place in the late evening early night , Location close to Placa Catalunya Excellent breakfast Fresh juice lots of sweets and savoury dishes Nice bathroom with rain shower nice view kind staff Have a cocktail at Milano Cocktail bar just 3 minutes away from the Regina Live music pefect drinks and to an affordable price Favorite restaurant Les Quinze Nits Placa Reial I booked with high discount there was some maintenance painting no problem for me 
286061,Hotel Regina, breakfast was expensive at 16 50 euro per person therefore we went out for brunch instead, hotel location is just off Placa de Catalunya and central to bus underground train stations all shops sites etc rooms spacious spacious lounge area
286062,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Location best Staff attitude excellent For person persons who come to visit Barcelona for business or for tour if they can afford Regina hotel is best at reasonable price its location at the Catalu a place is fantastic The hotel is very clean 
286063,Hotel Regina, The hotel facilities and its general look are approperiate to 3 star and not 4 star Do not except for anything beside good location and friendly staff I already hosted in hotel in barcelona with better breakfast , The location of the hotel is very good The reception employies were very helpfull and kind
286064,Hotel Regina, The room looked a bit older there were scratches on the wall and the level of cleaning service was not at the highest in my opinion, The staff is extremely helpful and always happy to help us with reccommendations of places where to go not to go I asked for an extra welcoming upon the arrival and everything went extra smoothly thanks to Jose at the reception The location is perfect within walking distance to heart of the city so you do not need to travel a lot to see the sights
286065,Hotel Regina, When looking out of the window there was only the back of billboards but I think this might have been because of the renovation works , The location is perfect you are in the centre and close to public transport The breakfast is delicious and the breakfast room is in lovely design and staff is friendly and helpful 
286066,Hotel Regina, The noise and mess due to the work being carried out was very disappointing We were told they would not be working over the weekend but were woken very early Saturday morning with constant banging , It was a great location Staff were very helpful and friendly 
286067,Hotel Regina,No Negative, All the staff were very helpful and happy to help you with anything the hotel was very clean and tidy which I thought was exceptional due to them having a renervation work The location was perfect You are walking distance to las rambles sight seeing buses and shops 
286068,Hotel Regina,No Negative, We stayed at Regina 1 night as there were renovation works Management was kind to shift us to the next door hotel as the noise was unbearable We stayed the 4 remaining nights there Location is great staff are helpful rooms are good 
286069,Hotel Regina, Could have been more generous with the tea coffee milk facilities , Very central close to buses and metro Staff friendly and helpful on arrival 
286070,Hotel Regina, The upper floor rooms are renovation A bit noisy , The staff was friendley and helped us a lot They know alot about the city and recommenedd us about a lot of cool places to eat and see 
286071,Hotel Regina, Hotel is definitely not 4 star as shown in the stars category More a struggling 3 star furnishing in room looks tired elevator mirror is broken and door badly damaged , Location was good Room was reasonably clean 
286072,Hotel Regina, only spanish channels on tv and the sink is in the main room and not in the bathroom, the staff is very pleasant and helping they even upgraded us to a better room because of our honeymoon location is super good and the rooms are great
286073,Hotel Regina, I have registered to 5 nights although I knew I will need only 4 This is due to our flight that was late and I didn t wanted running the risk to conduct the checkout early at the last day Problem is that I paid by mistake for the breakfast for two for the 5th day and they didn t agreed to cancel nor to give any discount or even to give us some voucher for next time and for that I will not arrive again As for the hotel facilities the rooms are very old fashion and this is different than reflected in the hotel s website The hotel location is excellent but the hotel is expensive only due to that , Great location
286074,Hotel Regina, Room is a bit small but once you get used to it you don t notice If you keep your balcony door window open it could get a bit loud as there are few restaurants or bars across the streets, Good location only few steps from Catalunia Plaza Nice and clean room with a small balcony Good breakfast buffet Helpful and friendly staff 
286075,Hotel Regina, Not really a four star hotel I had a superior room clean but stark not very welcoming for a four night stay No touches you expect from a four star superior property It s really a decent three star Rickety lift very noisy during day from building work I was in Barcelona working at an Expo and had a half day to explore popped back to hotel and it was constant hammering Ive read since there s a spa Really Wasn t told about it no info at all in room so didn t know Very mean with one v small bottle of water on first day , Excellent location for exploring city Near busses and metro 
286076,Hotel Regina, Spoke to the front desk about doing Laundry He told me just to put everything in the laundry bag in the room didn t see any price list was utterly shocked when the laundry came back that I had to pay more for the Laundry than for a day s accomodation in the hotel My wife spoke to a lady at the front desk and she was very impolite regarding this issue ,No Positive
286077,Hotel Regina, Due to the fact that they are re newing the hotel there is the obvious amount of dust that the staff try to clean as much of possible but if you want to rest between 8 00 am and 7 pm you better take another hotel because of the noise , The price was good for the location being very close to the ramblas This was also due to the fact that they just started to re new the hotel for the next 3 months 
286078,Hotel Regina, Not 4 standard Staff helpful if approached BUT didn t seem involved Superior rooms booked were very basic Everything needed an update No atmosphere, Location Clean
286079,Hotel Regina, Internal colors of hotel lobby are dull, It s location is ideal since it is just a little walking distance from plaze de catslunyia All tourist coaches start and end there 
286080,Hotel Regina, Well the only thing that I have problem with is the extra bed I just hope it was more comfortable , The location is super fantastic the stuff are really helpful when there s anything you need from them They ll give you the right places to visit the right restaurants to go and the right decisions to make Really enjoyed my stay 
286081,Hotel Regina, I was upgraded to a deluxe room which was a good size room So there s nothing I can fault this establishment A bit pricey but for the location and 4 stars It is the normal price, Easy and fast check in Friendly and very helpful staff Good buffet breakfast
286082,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The location was excellent for us Really central and very convenient and as our room was in the back very quiet at night which is unusual in a city centre hotel 
286083,Hotel Regina, There was some building work in the hotel which started early in the morning which was slightly annoying Obviously this will be time limited The hallways could do with new carpets and a lick of paint I thought it was a little expensive for a basic double room for 4 nights 120 per night midweek in October with out breakfast included There are plenty places nearby though to eat both better and cheaper Would I stay again Probably not mainly because there are better options nearby for the same money , Exceptionally close to the La Ramblas Great places to visit eat and drink within a short walk The staff are friendly and helpful The double room was very clean and comfortable 
286084,Hotel Regina, Feels like the common areas need a bit of updating In room safe instructions were not correct but helpful staff quickly sorted me out If you re after a view this probably isn t the place for you , Location is unbeatable Barman was attentive and friendly Felt safe and secure as solo female traveling alone 
286085,Hotel Regina, I saw there the cockroach and walls in the corridor was really dirty And food there was really bad and room service working how they want case they bring 2 cold sandwiches 55 minuet in room Wi fi connection was bad like everything all , There s is nothing good in this hotel 
286086,Hotel Regina, The rooms and hotel itself was old and old looking The rooms were not same as the photos Some of the furnitures were same but at least 10 years older than photo The walls were dirty needs to be paint In the morning there was a smell in whole hotel from breakfast room , The staffed were very kind and they try to help for any request The location was very central 
286087,Hotel Regina, I stayed at Regina hotel for two separate days and the room I stayed for the first stay was tiny smelly and not renovated though the prices were same Slow lifts , The location was great safe and very central The room I had was recently renovated very clean and modern All the staffs were kind 
286088,Hotel Regina, Veryyyyyy Noisy The people responsible for clean the rooms they really don t care for who is sleeping at the hotel in the morning It is an old hotel , Localization
286089,Hotel Regina, The room was dirty and stains were still there after cleaning was done Rooms are very noisy you can hear everything Room doors jam and close with a lot of noise Breakfast is sober helpfull staff but there isn t a lot of choice WiFi quality is very poor , Location near Plaza Cataluyna is perfect metro taxi bars and restaurants are around every corner Lots of sites are in walking distance 
286090,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Very nice hotel just in the middle of the city centre We have been in many hotels in Barcelona and this we liked Good service nica bar nice surroundings 
286091,Hotel Regina, Although it is spacious the rooms need to be a little more luxurious to qualify for 4 stars and the house keeping not changing bed sheets every day, location wifi staff very nice and helpful the air conditioning is very good advanced climate control system supermarkets including 24 hrs and restaurants everywhere and nearby
286092,Hotel Regina, The noise coming from building works under the hotel I was planning to sleep in the morning being on Holidays but impossible from 10am onward , The location
286093,Hotel Regina, The room and bathroom were somewhat small and the lighting a bit dim , Excellent location The beds were very comfortable airconditioning good Bathroom well equipped Excellent breakfast Staff helped to book tickets but no help with luggage 
286094,Hotel Regina, The air condition wasn t cool enough Problems with electrical appliances Current not strong enough, the staff was very cordial and professional especially Guillermo who was extremely helpful with the air conditioning issue
286095,Hotel Regina, The rooms are small they don t have a gym onsite you have to go to Holmes Place 10 min walking , Excellent location Perfect to catch public transport and many nice restaurants nearby
286096,Hotel Regina, Rooms are on the small side however this was our first trip to Europe we are from Canada and not used to this , The front desk staff were amazing They were so helpful and provided us with all of the information we needed and more

433920,Hotel Regina, Given the central location near a busy road there can be noise The hotel is also illuminated at night until 9 or 10pm and the light might come into your room however there are good shutters and dark curtains that help , Many breakfast choices with table service for coffee Caught a sunny day and was sitting outside with a view on the park nothing too spectacular but much better than sitting indoors Friendly staff and central location only some 2 minutes from a U Bahn U2 line subway stop which made arrival via Wien Hauptbahnhof Vienna Central Station easy From the hotel it is also only minutes to walk into the 1 Bezirk First District downtown to enjoy coffee and Sachertorte at Hotel Cafe Sacher Cafe Demel or other Kaffeehaeuser coffee shops and to visit museums or just stroll through the streets Around the corner is the Charly P s Irish Pub which has fantastic food with several awards The fish chips are stunning 
433921,Hotel Regina,No Negative, My favorite Wien hotel in the moment superb localization super professional and freandly stuff and something really unusual in that kind of hotel atmosphere 
433922,Hotel Regina, Cleanliness did not reflect the 4 star Rating Room did not appear the same as advertised on the booking com site Expected older style furniture fittings for a period hotel, Location was great right next to the U Bahn Easy walking to the centre of the city Overall freindly and knowledgable staff Easy and discounted car parking Prices at the bar and resturant reaaly good for a 4 star Hotel not overpriced 
433923,Hotel Regina, Only one tiny nitpicking complaint They have so many staff working at breakfast but it s really hard to get coffee Either your table doesn t have a pot or it s empty or cold and they re all running around flipping tables and clearing plates , The atmosphere is lovely like stepping back in history Hallways are twisty and filled with old family photos Rooms had long windows dark drapes plenty of space Staff recognizes faces of guests Great location seriously right next to the Votivekirche and 2 3 blocks from metro I would tell friends to stay and stay here again myself 
433924,Hotel Regina, Everything pefect , Good location and easy to find by driving to hotel The hotel is historic and comforable our room is on the top with spacious space to put extra bed for our 4years kid bathroom is a bit small but very clean breakfast is fabulous and many options to choose We arrived hotel at Friday evening and good to know it s free parking from 10pm till next monday morning I specially thanks for hotel manager Mr Daniel I left 2pairs shoes in hotel and he s very helpful and easy to communicate he called UPS team on behalf of me requested them to collect the shoes and sent it to my next journey hotel propertly so that I d received them in short time and bring back home 
433925,Hotel Regina, The A C was too noisy, This was a hotel with all an excellent complete breakfast buffe a nice restaurant high ceiling comfort beds minibar etc Close to public transports U2 38 1 etc The silent surroundings with the park and the church was nice Almost direct access to the garage
433926,Hotel Regina, Although all staff are very polite and professional during my last day and my breakfast whilst I was already checked out and waiting for my ride to airport one of the waiters approached me and ask where I am from I am not from Ukraine as it shows only working there After my response he started to make offensive and political statements namely against my country or the name of my country His country of origin was Greece I had no time to report him to reception or to the manager due to rushing to the airport I felt uncomfortable and it was inappropriate by him to even start such conversation with hotel guests especially if particular customer is often a guest of the Hotel Hope the hotel manager advises staff to be correct and not to get involved in political discussions with guests , As usual I like staying in Regina always was positive experience 
433927,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Room was tiny but perfect tiny because the hotel is old and I think these rooms were the old servants quarters The room was modern but you still had the feeling you were staying in a part of history Personally I really liked it 
433928,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Loved everything about this hotel the room was very nice clean and cosy I had a beautiful view from my windows overlooking the Volkskirche The location was very good some waking distance from the centre but that was a pleasant walk and the metro station just 3 min away 
433929,Hotel Regina, Windows of the room 424 given to me were facing a concrete wall but nothing else It was so nunpleasent experience I guess any customer should be directed to this room ever , Location was great 
433930,Hotel Regina, Little more noisy street and small shower , Hotel is close enough to the city centre Personnel is friendly room was big enough and comfortable Breakfast was very good 
433931,Hotel Regina,No Negative, loved the opening door to veranda in room breakfast plentiful and tasty dinner in restaurant excellent staff very nice and advised on menu and wine 
433932,Hotel Regina, No full size mirror in the room No any facilities in the rooms like sewing kit for example The towels were too threadbare The guests on the 6th floor need to change the elevator Not acceptable for 4 star hotel not to have any fitness facility ,No Positive
433933,Hotel Regina, Nothing to say I would be glad to see it a bit cheaper, The place is great The accessibility to the transportation is very good The staff is ausgezeichnet They are just great Everything is all right including neighbooring with the Beatidul Votivkirche The restaurant is good and the special chokolate tort is worth to taste
433934,Hotel Regina, the smell of toilet was awful at very first moment when we arrived the smell of urine welcomed us it came out from toilet and also the floor was made of wood that made sound when you walked around, location
433935,Hotel Regina, I booked a double room for single use but I was disappointed how small the room I got was Nothing like in the pictures on the hotel website or booking com I guess they gave me one of the smaller rooms just because it was single use The bathroom was also tiny although well equipped and the noise you heard in the room when somebody upstairs or in the neighboring rooms flushed a toilet or was having a shower was very loud Generally not 4 stars in my books the hotel is in a need of a face lift so I think it s slightly over priced Breakfast was very nice but it was served only until 10 am although it was a bank holiday weekend and it was very difficult to find a seat because of course everyone wanted to come as late as possible , The staff at the hotel was very friendly Lovely breakfast lot of choice Room was very clean Good location public transport close by and you can even walk to a lot of sights like Rathaus Parlament Hofsburg and Maria Theresien Platz 
433936,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The room had a comfortable bed a desk a chair a tea table an armchair can be opened sofa and kettle Wardrobe was large enough The bathroom had enough shelf Good breakfast Easy connection to metro tram and bus 
433937,Hotel Regina, Airport transfer when booked through the hotel are about 50 more than another company we sourced through google The single rooms are very small but adequate The single room wardrobe was tiny , We booked at a time we knew the hotel was being refurbished but we had zero disruption to our break Staff are exceptional The bed was extremely comfortable The linen and towels were fresh and soft The receptionist was hugely helpful and polite booking restaurants for us showing us routes and explaining transport links 
433938,Hotel Regina, Although I had a really really nice room my friend who had booked a single room just as I had got a tiny room which felt like a closet So be ware and make sure you have a double room for single use ,No Positive
433939,Hotel Regina, Do not expect abt coffee I was supposed to pay in cash so i exchanged money for it but they just got paid with my credit card without asking or even mentioning it at all The hotel and the cathedral church right next to the hotel are under construction So one of our window was useless , The beds were the most comfortable one among all what i used before Enough space good view and nice breakfast The tram and subway stations are located like 5 minutes away by feet Not all staffs were kind but mostly they were helpful 
433940,Hotel Regina, hotel decorations and furnishing felt pretty old but so is the entire neighborhood but yet again this is the Viena charm, location footsteps from Rathaus K rtnerstra e Medizinische Uni Wien elegant Staff memorizing which room to every guest
433941,Hotel Regina, The only thing that could of been a little better was the breakfast as the coffee was not hot enough and the bacon and eggs i did not enjoy The rest of the food on offer was very good though , The location was good although not right in the centre of the city everything was easy to get to The hotel was also very clean and good value for money 
433942,Hotel Regina, To soft bed for me but I m used to rock like beds so To much Difference betwen some rooms at the same price , Localization best professional staff pet friendliness overall feeling nice place to relax
433943,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Staff was cooperative Hotel was nicely decorated as 4 star facility Nice location Reception staff mr jeremy and ms Maria were similing and available at all times to assist in best manner I will visit again and recommend too 
433944,Hotel Regina, Towels left in my room carpeted floor and no slippers very small room not suitable for in room work , Breakfast water pressure steady water heat steady clean wifi reasonably fast and signal strong 
433945,Hotel Regina, Rooms were rather small Parking was available but 3 min walk , Located next to the City Hall Very nice staff Interior and exterior looked imperialistic 
433946,Hotel Regina, The hotel and the rooms are quite outdated and worn out The room decoration was sparse and had a cheap feel to it The shower was installed in a old bath tub which made it uncomfortable to shower Cleanliness was poor as I often found hairs from the cleaning staff on the floor and towels Also there was mold growing near the ceiling in the bathroom because of inadequate ventilation Breakfast seemed elaborate but the quality of the products was mediocre All in all this is not a 4 star hotel , I chose this hotel because of its location close to public transport and because of the substantial discount that was offered Wifi open and free without any fuss The staff was reasonably friendly 
433947,Hotel Regina, the room given to me was on the fifth floor and it had only a tiny window at top it would be better to have a bigger window and chance to see the beautiful buildings of Vienna, room was given to me before the checkin hour due to the time of my flight
433948,Hotel Regina, Double bed was two singles pushed together with gap low to the ground solid mattresses and with single duvets so not very comfortable , Good location adjacent to Ringstrasse and transport connections 10 min walk into town centre stop for hop on bus Excellent breakfast Very clean and very helpful staff 
433949,Hotel Regina, Found my bed a little uncomfortable and terrible pillow Also hate those hairdryers Take forever to dry hair and don t do it well Also hotel too warm even though we had no heating on in our room , Restaurant was excellent for both breakfast and dinner Fantastic staff in both restaurant and desk Very clean
433950,Hotel Regina, On the bed both mattresses were drifting apart during the night creating 15cm gap in between till morning , Big and clean bathroom with all needed stuff like dryer Delicious breakfirst with a lot of food options Friendly and helpfull staff We stayed during December and the hotel had amazing and beatiful Christmas decorations in the lobby and in the restaurant Short walk to the metro station which brings you accross the city 
433951,Hotel Regina, the gentleman at the front desk was unfriendly at every time our room was very very small the small window was looking at the fire stairs the bathroom door opened almost to bed, breakfast comfortable bed excellent location nice cozy building
433952,Hotel Regina, There were no tea making facilities in the room and not possible to get from the restaurant or bar if you come in after 10p m , Cleanliness and location
433953,Hotel Regina, Pillows are bad absolutely no support flat down onto bed when you lay your head on top Hot shower will turn cold after a while Location is a bit far from old city centre Breakfast is overcrowded food is lacking However restaurant food served for dinner was good Staffs service attitude not warm and helpful They recommended Big Bus which has a stop in front of the hotel Big Bus routes are restrictive frequency is few half an hour apart and waited once for 40 mins but not showing up Unworthy experience on Big Bus , Given half an hour more for late checkout request 
433954,Hotel Regina, It would be good to have a boiling machine for a tea or a coffee machine in the room , Rich breakfast very polite personnel Great location next to the Votivkirche 
433955,Hotel Regina, Basic and outdate furniture hotel requires some refreshment to be rated 4 stars, Nice location 5 10 min walk to Stephan dom and Rathaus Friendly staff they changed the room per our request with better view Restaurant was also good 
433956,Hotel Regina, Coffee was not very strong when eating breakfast , The rooms were nice and reasonably big Bathroom was very nice We had one with a bath tub Our hotel was on the first floor with view on the courtyard not so nice but nothing to complain about Breakfast was good Serving personnel was friendly and there was never the issue of too less food The room was clean and very nicely heated Personnel in general was very friendly and helpful The location of the hotel is very good About 200 meters away from the underground and bus station I can recommend this hotel for shorter and longer visits 
433957,Hotel Regina, Staff gave us other guests room key so we entered to an occupied room full of other people stuff Breakfast is way below even the half priced hotels Many kind of things but mainly average and cheapest kind of them Ragarding cheese only two kind of average cheap Location is overpriced ,No Positive
433958,Hotel Regina, There was nothing that I did not like , Hotel was well heated and room comfortable Generous breakfast buffet and efficient staff Central location and hotel had style and elegance 
433959,Hotel Regina, No complaints I saw some people complained about the lack of a gym but that just won t happen That s not the kind of experience Hotel regine will offer This is a 100 year hotel proud of its tradition and that s the best part of it , I ve had a great time at Hotel Regina this year The hotel has a unique timeless and classical charm to it The staff and the facilities are very warm and welcoming The breakfast is a highlight the best I ve ever had in a hotel in Europe 
433960,Hotel Regina, Our room was at a very good price and therefore a bit small , Great location Very close to the Rathaus Christmas market and the metro station Within walking distance to the city centre Great breakfast but too crowded at times 
433961,Hotel Regina, The rooms are Vienna standard very small and not so cozy Keys are large no key cards Missing small amenities in the room slippers and similar Small working table , Good breakfast The WiFi was reasonably fast good for work Chocolate on the pillow Small cake at entrance 
433962,Hotel Regina, The deluxe room is very old had cracks on the ceiling windows were old and not closing definitely the room needs to be entirely refurbished In top of the above the room was cold had dust on the cupboards the duvet was ragged and stained there were bags all over the place they told me that were from the park The comfort room given as replacement is small bathroom is small , The historic building
433963,Hotel Regina, Room was not very spacious , Everything was perfect Rooms was not that big but clean and comfortable Breakfast was good and the staff also helpful 
433964,Hotel Regina, As it is kind of an old building you could hear the foot steps from the upper floor Other than this everything was perfect for my trip , Staff was very kind and the breakfast was great Free wifi worked quite well too Subway tram are 3 minute s walking distance from the hotel If you like walking you could also walk to the most tourists places too 
433965,Hotel Regina, Hotel blocked all money sum at credit card for stay well in advance although reservation was with free cancellation Staff is generally nice but some of them behave as if you are annoying them by staying in their hotel , Location is good breakfast also good although no sparkling wine or fresh juices on breakfast Wi Fi was good Room were quite big and well furnished My windows were looking right on Sigmund Freud park and it was not noisy 
433966,Hotel Regina, Coffee at breakfast was horrible Reception was always smelly like dust specially near the elevator There was no kettle in the room and when i asked for team i was sent a mug not a proper tea pot , Location is amazing and 10 minutes away from every thing Breakfast was lots of varieties and very fresh with a good selection of Tea 
433967,Hotel Regina,No Negative, I am globally satisfied by the stay at Hotel Regina it represents a good compromise between quality and price The standard double room was not very big and the one in which we stayed had just a view on an internal cavedio but it was clean and quiet Breakfast is more than appropriate The Hotel is in a very good location to reach the city center well connected to metro and tram at walking distance A car parking is at a walking distance as well The wifi sometimes does not work properly but it is ok for a short stay
433968,Hotel Regina, Ok breakfasts very European good food and variety but not as fresh as I d like , Beautiful 1920s style hotel All speak in German and English perfectly Offered to store luggage on your last day Very clean 
433969,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Perfectly placed for exploring Vienna The underground station is a few minutes from the hotel Wonderful view of the votiv church from our window The taxi we booked to take us to the airport phoned to say it was a little behind time and actually arrived bang on time Excellent restaurant too 
433970,Hotel Regina, Complicated and quite expensive parking I had a problem to drive out The staff is cold comparing with other hotels in Vienna , In city center close to the famouse places
433971,Hotel Regina, The first night I had guest my sister and I paid extra but nobody bothered to give us extra pillow and blanket and tissues Also it was a really cold room The first morning we went down to the coffee shop and the waitress told us that the breakfast is until 10 30 We just asked to bring us sth and that i was happy to pay extra She was really rood and that behaviour was the same the next day Also in the reception only one person was smiling and was ready to help I am totally disappointed with the staff, The location Close to city centre
433972,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Location The location is perfect its in the center and just next to a magnificent Cathedral Votivkirche Breathtaking The hotel is very clean and the staff are nice and helpful 
433973,Hotel Regina, Room was small and had no desk to work at and although I booked a soundproof room I woke up the first morning from the person above me showering , Bed was comfortable airconditioned room was well appreciated shower was very good as was also the breakfast and last but not least the staff was really friendly 
433974,Hotel Regina, I thought that breakfast in the restaurant was a little chaotic People were swarming back and forth people were hunting around for tables and it wasn t clear if they were free or not , Best air conditioning for a hotel ever I would sleep in a freezer if I could and the fact that I could cool my room right down was aces Quality of the food in the restaurant was great the museum like displays on all the floors were interesting beds were comfortable location was right next to Sigmund Freud Park and was just out of the way of the main hustle so as to make the nights quiet for a city centre Would definitely come back 
433975,Hotel Regina, The first room I got faced the courtyard terrible view and there was a horrible stale smell in the bathroom coming from the ventilation system probably has something to do with the courtyard Second room was fine but the flush button of the toilet was not completely working fine and shower s warm water setting was unreliable , breakfast was fine
433976,Hotel Regina, The hotel is dated The rooms need to be redone Bathrooms updated It s the 21st century time to catch up , The staff were helpful That makes your stay and your trip 
433977,Hotel Regina, Breakfast was a little chaotic with a very small area for the food and not enough tables for all the guests when we were there Food was really good though just go early , Excellent location ideal for exploring the city 
433978,Hotel Regina, Was disappointed that we didn t have facilities to make a cup of tea in the room And the bathroom was on the small side , Location was perfect for access to the old town of Vienna Breakfast the odd evening meals we had were very good excellent choice 
433979,Hotel Regina, The side round table was a bit small to be used as a desk , The location is centric and well communicated the room was clean and the bed comfortable the facilities small fridge Wifi etc were useful The staff is efficient and helpful 
433980,Hotel Regina, The room was on the small side and the hotel felt a little dated but also added to the charm , We stayed in August 2016 We enjoyed the location view from the room and old world charm of the hotel Eating breakfast outside was a pleasure 
433981,Hotel Regina, , The staff is very polite and helpful breakfast was very good room was very big and clean Wireless works great and it s for free We told them it is our honeymoon and they baked us a cake very nice of them 
433982,Hotel Regina, I wish there was a fitness room But a park is nearby and that was good enough , Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed the meals at the restaurant Staff were also very helpful and knowledgeable 
433983,Hotel Regina, Very pleased with the stay , Grand building Staff very helpful Pickup from hotel for trips Convenient to transport Great selection for breakfast Restaurant served good food for dinner 
433984,Hotel Regina, View out of the window The window faced a wall although I had been promised the city view on my booking The staff was not helpful in this issue , location room service and breakfast
433985,Hotel Regina, The furniture is stuck in the 70s comfy but looking a little worn and outdated , The location was excellent for a conference at the University as well as for walking or taking a very convenient tram to major sights The breakfast buffet was good The hotel was comfortable and I would certainly stay again 
433986,Hotel Regina, There was no good service , From the outside the hotel looked very well Even though the rooms were nicely decorated the baths were very small The hotel was well located
433987,Hotel Regina, I forget my pants Prada in wardrope and i understood after one day and called hotel reception 2day looked and had check all workers and guest also And answer we didnt find anything I am asking now where it can go this pants So i say first housekeeping should see it there And they took , I forget my pants Prada in wardrope and i understood after one day and called hotel reception 2day looked and had check all workers and guest also And answer we didnt find anything I am asking now where it can go this pants So i say first housekeeping should see it there And they took 
433988,Hotel Regina, This is an older more traditional hotel and would not suit those who prefer a more standard modern hotel , We booked early and got a cheap deal for this hotel which is a standard we would not normally stay in for leisure Good location for accessing trams and the Ubahn Great breakfast in elegant surroundings 
433989,Hotel Regina, The bed was terrible extremely flat pillows and too soft Air conditioning was a bit noisy There were hairs from the previous visitor or staff in bathroom , The hotel is almost in the city center 15 min from town hall and 20 from the opera The breakfest was rich 
433990,Hotel Regina, I found hairs in my bed on the blanket as well as in the bathroom in tube and also on towels The hotel tries to look old fashioned and luxurious but the truth is it is more timeworn shabby and obsolete The corridors are smelly and the wardrobe is stinky , The only one advantage of this hotel is its location 
433991,Hotel Regina, It seems to be geared to travel groups and the buffet is set up accordingly The coffee in the morning is undrinkable unless you like yours very watered down I was staying on the top floor and kept banging my head on the slanted ceiling and I am not a tall person , Location location location Walking distance to the center of town public transport right in front For that alone the hotel prices are reasonable Nice staff a little bit run down and old fashioned But one does get free wifi 
433992,Hotel Regina, Bed was a bit on a hard side It might be my preference though I did not sleep as well as I would like to , Very good breakfasts Very close to tram underground stations Good location ideal for exploring old city on a foot Clean Quiet Good view from the window in my case 
433993,Hotel Regina, The staff could be more friendly and helpful The staff in the breakfast were rude and one told me to hurry up as they were closing soon when I arrived for breakfast The male reception staff did not help me with my bags as I was leaving and I had to get a taxi in the street with all my bags in the rain The review does not apply to all staff but left an image that was negative , the position was good I also liked the historical nature of the hotel The staff in the resturant at night were good 
433994,Hotel Regina, No coffee tea making facility Room entry was with key which needs to be left with reception Seemed old fashioned but has some advantages , Breakfast was good and well organised 
433995,Hotel Regina,No Negative, It is good for the money I paid They give only one pillow if you book single They need new pillows I ordered two extra to make it feel like one You only get one small soap You need to call if it is used by the end of the day Good breakfast Location is good Walking distance to most places Metro is close too I would stay again 
433996,Hotel Regina, Not sure if all the rooms in the hotel were as good as ours Beds pillows were not that comfy , Very convenient location Nice old style hotel with clean wooden floors instead of dirty carpets Good breakfast We got a room with view and sufficient space Decent bathroom
433997,Hotel Regina, Staff was very unfriendly they sometimes would not even look at me while handing me the key to my room Room was ok but noisy and the bathroom was tiny , Location is excellent breakfast was very good 
433998,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Generally I got all what I expected I did not have a feeling it was something very special but I would not mind to go back there The was ok I would rather use the term professional then friendly 
433999,Hotel Regina, An electric kettle in the room would have been helpful A nasty smell when going down the stairs from the first floor to the reception The coffee at breakfast , Nice decor Nice staff Good location close to public transport and just 10 minutes straight walking to Hofburg Michaelerplatz Very good breakfast except for the coffee The room was totally soundproofed The view from my window was the courtyard but I had only booked a standard room The restaurant in the hotel Roth serves very good Wiener Schnitzel at an average price You really don t have to look elsewhere to try the Wiener Schnitzel I have tried quite a few hotels in Vienna So far this has been the best 
434000,Hotel Regina, Hotel very old fashioned Breakfast was very poor Night porter extremely unhelpful wouldn t give us a glass of water going to bed told us to purchase it from the mini bar, Good location friendly staff on reception 
434001,Hotel Regina, Used to be a palace victim of cheap renewals which destroyed a nice place But if fully renewed to the original level I could not afford I do not know what was visible through the window which was obscured by protections during outside facade cleaning , Location acceptable rate Breakfast Restaurant Overall standing of common areas
434002,Hotel Regina, The style of the room is very old but that s kind of the old Viennese atmosphere as well , The staff was very nice giving good tips for the surrounding we forgot our adaptator so they borrowed us one very kindly The breakfast is great the rooms are very clean the location is perfect 
434003,Hotel Regina, Dont book a taxi to the airport through the hotel We got a taxi from the airport for 42 euros when we asked if the hotel could prebook a taxi for our return they quoted us 55 euros even though the information pack in the room states that they offer a discount You can get one from the taxi rank right in front of the hotel for a set price of 40 euros , Great location a 2 minute walk from tube and tram station and a 10 minute walk from the museum quarter and city centre Room was clean and quiet breakfast good and staff friendly Would definately stay here again 
434004,Hotel Regina, Generally the hotel looks it needs an overall restoration but there is always something nostalgic when you have to use an actual key to enter your room The quality of the bed was poor , Satisfactory rich breakfast in a nice and decent setting The extra padded door prevents much of the noise otherwise would come from the corridors Very close to the metro station 
434005,Hotel Regina, From approximately 7 a m in our room we head quite loud sound of flowing water in the water pipes It was very long sound hours , Location interior staff breakfast view from window 
434006,Hotel Regina, to much differences of the 160 and 120 rooms, style and climate of regina hotel if you like saher but you think its to much for every stay just chose regina 
434007,Hotel Regina, Our double bed had a gap , Pleasure to stay there smallish but really comfortable room under the roof with a stunning view over the inner city of Vienna Really friendly forthcoming and we ll trained staff who fulfilled all our wishes 
434008,Hotel Regina, I didn t like that I couldn t find anything to eat after 23 00 in the hotel , Staff was very helpful and polite Hotel was very clean and the size of the room for 3 persons was very good Breakfast with lots of variations 
434009,Hotel Regina, While the hotel is listed as 4 star it s a good 20 years past it s prime We stayed in an impressive junior suite chandelier and view of the Rooseveltplatz and all the big room was haphazardly under furnished with dusty furniture and ageing rugs which made sitting on anything but the beds impossible for a hay fever sufferer Breakfast was tasty when you could get it but the rush to get a table in the last hour before they stopped serving made for stressed out staff and a less than relaxed start to any day , Lovely location beside the beautiful Votivkirche and a 5 minute walk to the Rathaus Ready access to the trams and Ubahn making getting around the city a breeze 
434010,Hotel Regina, The interior did not seem like a 4 star The pillows were horrible and our double room was outdated and quite small , We loved the location especially next to the beautiful Votive church and within walking distance to the Inner Stadt We did like the breakfast 
434011,Hotel Regina, Our double bed was actually two singles pushed together which was not comfortable , Lovely hotel helpful and kind staff room had a great view of a beautiful Gothic church brilliant location 
434012,Hotel Regina, The rooms need new sheets , The location is key and you can walk anywhere in the city center This hotel has that viennese royal charm plus a nice breakfast 
434013,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The building is great Breakfast great also Try the marmalade in a jar with a guy with a big moustache awesome Subway is very close 10 min walking to 2 of the greatest coffees The Landtmann and Cafe Central Viena is not so big in 20 to 30 min walking you can get everywhere I m sure I would be back to Vienna and to The Regina Hotel 
434014,Hotel Regina, The sister restaurant il settimo cielo is not so careful with their guests Though advertised in the hotel as one of the places to be no attention was give to complaints , Excellent location restaurant staff and cleanliness If you like old chique and good cake this really is the place to be The bell boy even is aware of the police checking for wrong parking The hotel offers specials rates for the public parking just across 
434015,Hotel Regina, Fridge was locked with a keyhole really Staff fulfil the requirement for high floor room but it was very small for value paid No espresso coffee at breakfast and general poor variety of fruits and vegetables In the room baroque style chairs mixed with contemporary art picture on the wall , Very clean room and bathroom Outstanding view from the window to the church If you are with a car you can park sunday and saturday around the hotel for free there are sufficient parking places and not to use the offered closed paid parking 
434016,Hotel Regina, Rooms were a little small for yhenprice, Location was excellent and the rooms were clean They were a little small but that was ok All else was excellent The staff was very nice and helpful
434017,Hotel Regina, Small camera and breakfast the same every morning for 4 days For 4 star could be exigent at cleaning corners but generally was very clean , Location and the staff very friendly 
434018,Hotel Regina, Loved it all, We where working at the Messe and this hotel is a 5 minute walk to the underground Uber and 4 stops Excellent location for us Bar staff were also ace 
434019,Hotel Regina, Nothing really , Characterful quite grand old hotel nicely located on a busy street but not particularly noisy even with top window open Good bar restaurant and breakfast clean with helpful staff I booked a single but was given a large double with a bath and a soundproofing door to the corridor Very pleasant stay 
434020,Hotel Regina, The hospitality of the hotel is way under four stars We kept having issues about hygiene even at the end of a four night stay The mattresses were probably 30 years old and we had to insist first night at 10 00 PM that they were replaced metal spirals poking out instead of leaving the nice room for another We had so much complaints and we visit a lot of hotels and almost never have an issue and we never spoke a manager during the whole 5 days we stayed there Annoying and incredible They gave us a little pie at our leave thanks Regina , The Regina Hotel has a long history and is still part of the Krenslehner Family which owns 4 Hotels in Vienna nowadays The Deluxe room was more than lovely And the breakfast was OK Here stops our positive experience 
434021,Hotel Regina, If I have to say something it would probably be that the room is not very beautiful , Convenient location helpful staff high quality breakfast and cleanness 
434022,Hotel Regina, I booked a delux double room and put me in single room which was tiny They then gave me my room and tried to convince me that its the same, The Location and the hotel
434023,Hotel Regina, Single room was tiny and shabby Mould marks in the bathroom Everything feels old and used Lobby too crowded does not feel invading Besides the tiny space it was cramped with stuff , The Location is perfect Everything else was not so important 
434024,Hotel Regina, the wi fi was free but not so good, The room was nice daily room service fantastic view from our room towards the town center The hotel is in a nice location only 5 10 walk from town center all the sights are around and there is tram and metro station 2 walk only I never had in my life so far so good quality of food the breakfast was superb and the staff very friendly I definitely recommend this hotel and if I go to Vienna again I will stay in hotel Regina 
434025,Hotel Regina, Wifi didn t really work brilliantly but compared to all the pro s of this hotel wasn t a big issue, Location was brilliant nice restaurants nearby and metro station nearby Area also feels very safe at night 
434026,Hotel Regina, I was disappointed when I couldn t find electric kettle or teapot inside the room as all places in Europe and gulf I found kettle inside room As I had come there for an exam I wanted to have coffee of my taste frequently , Location Also very helpful staff I had no problem in communication with any of them unlike other places outside the hotel where English speaking people were very less
434027,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Firstly the location was excellent and secondly the staff was very friendly and helpful It was my first time in Vienna the staff patiently listened to all the questions I had and happily helped me with whatever I needed This made my visit to Vienna even more enjoyable and comfortable 
434028,Hotel Regina, Toilet room without ventilation neither window only method to ventilate fumes is into bedroom Furniture needs serious restoration sharp edges of paint afraid to rest hand on table next to bed Key system based on cylinder lock , Great location retro style friendly stuff AC airconditioner Smooth Wifi network 
434029,Hotel Regina, Too much dust I suggest food to be covered since due to the very hot weather during breakfast there were flies that occasionally lied on the food , The hotel was amazing and the staff polite and helpful 
434030,Hotel Regina, Previous guests before me had already complained about low quality pillows Nothing has been done to put things right I had a similar pillow If I have such a pillow it gets donated to my friend s dog I used a spare blanket as second pillow , I liked best that there was a restaurant in the hotel with very good food and excellent customer service 
434031,Hotel Regina, I didn t like the room without no boiled of water sometime I need drinks especially warm water it was great if you could put it a pitcher of hot water or empty electricity pitcher so i could boiled the water with my own , I like the view of my window I like the food even though for the breakfast is the same everyday but it was find cause I loved it I need to get those vegetables 
434032,Hotel Regina,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location close to metro and walking distance to many monuments and churches It was a little old but clean We got an older room maybe because we stayed only one night We had already been in Vienna and stayed at another hotel which was to my opinion much better The photos on the internet look great Maybe if it was for a longer stay the hotel would have giving me a larger room But for one night it was fine The staff was nice and the breakfast was nice also 
434033,Hotel Regina, There was no WiFi reception in my room at all despite the promise on Booking com The staff claimed it was a temporary problem but as a matter of fact WiFi coverage doesn t cover all the rooms and if yours is further down the corridor you won t get the signal Since I was on a business trip that was a real dealbreaker And it goes without saying that the hotel refused to give me a different room with working wireless internet The room was rather tidy yet it definitely needed a renovation in certain areas Power outlets were rather wobbly and tended to follow the plug when I pulled it out Flush buttons in the restroom also were not properly secured in the wall Finally the hotel froze the full amount of money for my stay on my credit card four days before I even arrived despite the fact that the free cancellation was until one day before arrival And the money were released only after two weeks so for a period of time I was effectively double charged To summarize I would not recommend this hotel There are much cheaper and better offers in the area , The location is the best thing by far about this hotel Close to the Schottentor subway station Vienna University Votiv kirche and generally within the walking distance from many landmarks The room is quite small yet clean However it is highly overpriced for Vienna 
434034,Hotel Regina, 1 The WiFi was rather weak and slowing working For serious work it is not suitable 2 The room was not comfortable 3 No facilities to prepare tee or coffee just in the room 4 No table in the room beside a minor round table for journals and flowers 5 The organization of breakfast area was rather strange and this area itself was not comfortable The breakfast was OK but I did not enjoy coming there to take it , The location of the Hotel is perfect 
434035,Hotel Regina, The beds were springy and the pillows were stuffed with cotton balls sparingly , The location is great Very close to the metro and other public transport Our room had an amazing view of the church and park 
434036,Hotel Regina, Great breakfast but very very simple, Ideal location Old style like you are in a film Friendly and helpful staff Great breakfast View from the window wonderful cathedral Clean and comfortable room Wi Fi Good signal I think they have improved it in August Perfect Air conditioning
434037,Hotel Regina, The bathroom was lovely but the bath could be problematic for older people like myself and quite a few others I would have welcomed a handle to aid in stepping out of bath and a non slip mat for bath , It felt spacious well ordered comfortable no unnecessary frills Big windows view over park Warm smooth wooden floors 
434038,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Excellent location Old style but comfy Breakfast is good albeit a standard hotel breakfast which doesn t change much Price also good if booked well in advance 
434039,Hotel Regina, Ugly wifi It worked only late in the night All other time it was impossible even to check email I booked standard double room It is too small even for single traveler There was no table inside so I had to work seeting in bad Room images doesn t math real room Real rooms are much more older and with dusty carpets , Friendly staff breakfast was good but nothing special location was convenient for me but it s far from city center 
434040,Hotel Regina,No Negative, Great place to stay The staff is very friendly and helpful I asked in advanced about gluten free bread for my breakfast and they provided Great breakfast buffet with some traditional choices and home made delicious marmalades Good food also in their restaurant The room was comfortable and clean Also free good speed WiFi

472198,Hotel Regina, All three room safes failed at some point during our visit but management redponded immediately and rectified Cups provided for tea are plastic not nice too drink from and too hot and awkward to hold No milk provided in rooms , We picked this hotel for its central location and were able to walk to all the major sites Nice size rooms even the single rooms and the beds were comfy Trams do run outside the hotel but our rooms overlooked the courtyard so were nice and quiet Staff were very friendly and helpful
