111389,Royal Saint Honore, Construction on the hotel building was loud but it s clearly temporary renovating , Staff were all lovely helpful They were so personable Very clean Great location a block or two off of the Rue de Rivoli at the Tuileries Hotel rooms were quiet Double windows opened to offer fresh air and a beautiful view 
111390,Royal Saint Honore, The hotel is under renovations which we were not told at booking Bummer Quite noisy during the day starting before 9am , Staff were quite friendly and accommodating Loved having double windows that opened onto a courtyard below of sorts The location is utterly perfect 
111391,Royal Saint Honore, Cleanliness is poor Rooms are old , Location is excellent but the rooms need to be renovated Cleanliness is poor The location made up for everything The rooms are old and not clean 
111392,Royal Saint Honore, Breakfast was mediocre limited selection had one evening meal which was awful Alcoholic drinks VERY expensive , Staff really friendly great location great facilities 
111393,Royal Saint Honore, The hotel was renovating and our room was on the exact floor the building activity was going on within 20m there was a lot of noise drilling hacking and there was a smell of an open sewer in the hallway The room was small the view was poor on a small soil littered roof When booking a good deal one does not expect to enter a building site , The location is excellent around the corner of Place Vendome within walking distance of Galeries Lafayette The bed was good bathroom small but clean the breakfast was fine The staff was good and courteous 
111394,Royal Saint Honore, Breakfast room is a little small and only bread products available , Great service Very friendly and helpful staff Wonderful location if visiting Monet s gardens 
111395,Royal Saint Honore, The bar was not open in the evening They are remodeling and it seems to have the staff working very hard to maintain a pleasant guest experience , Wonderful location Nice breakfast 
111396,Royal Saint Honore, The scrambled eggs tasted like egg glue , The hotel is well situated near the Louvre Tuilleries Gardens metro Champs Elysee etc The staff was very nice We stayed in a renovated room which was lovely There were still some renovations going on so the hotel was not as it will be I would definitely recommend this hotel to others 
111397,Royal Saint Honore, The fact major renovation work was taking place There was no view from the room due to plastic sheeting covering the windows I was still charged full price for the room ,No Positive
111398,Royal Saint Honore, Hotel was under construction due to renovations We didn t get any information about it until we got there It was kind of surprising because we had so many expectations and ended up staying at the hotel when it was so how messy due to the renovations We had to take the stairs to get to the staff elevator to get to the room , Location
111399,Royal Saint Honore, Really petty but extra milk sachets in the room would have been nice, Very very helpful and pleasant staff Lovely firm bed Very central for all sights shops metro restaurants and bars would definitely stay here again 
111400,Royal Saint Honore, Broken elevator room s external doors wrapped in construction plastic denying me use of balcony and view If you want to pay full price for a room in a construction zone without offer of a refund be their guest Awful and disgusting experience and this review is from a person who has never complained about a hotel ,No Positive
111401,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, Excellent location just a few steps from Tuleries gardens or Place Vendome Hotel itself flawless room and bathroom spacious compared to Paris standard Definitely recommended 
111402,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, Staffs were kind and accommodating Ask for a map and where to get tours You can walk to Louvre museum and park Beside that is paris city vision tours 
111403,Royal Saint Honore, The breakfast was not as I expected There were fewer varieties than I thought that a 19 00 breakfast would offer But the food was good though , The room was really clean Although the Hotel is very central the room was quiet and suitable for a good rest 
111404,Royal Saint Honore, Bar and restaurant is nice but not a lively hangout location , Helpful staff in excellent location and the upgrade level rooms are nice sized for Paris Clean and very nicely appointed and decorated 
111405,Royal Saint Honore, Housekeeping staff wasn t as attentive to maintaining supplies in the bathroom, Excellent location Very friendly and accommodating staff Quiet comfortable rooms 
111406,Royal Saint Honore, I would have liked more choice in the breakfast eggs poached and fried as well as the scrambled provided The waiters did not always bring milk with the tea automatically The cafe choices were also a little limited , The room was large by European standards and the position so close to many of Paris highlights is fantastic The reception staff were really welcoming and helpful I would stay at this hotel again and again 
111407,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, the staff was very welcoming helpful and lovely the hotel is right in the centre of rue saint honore a wonderful shopping street away from the tourists areas
111408,Royal Saint Honore, Everything was perfect , Warm treating by hotel staff and they led us to a gorgeous room with high ceilings and large windows They helped us with teapots turns and reservations Excellent location for shopping and very safe We were out late every night and securit let us in Love this place Will be staying again 
111409,Royal Saint Honore, The last two times I stayed there I had to move from room on a 6 floor to room on the first There was a foul smell of sewer on the room on the 6 floor, Location
111410,Royal Saint Honore, The breakfast buffet was charged to us even when we didn t eat it Easily resolved Removed without a problem , Friendly staff Well versed in many languages 
111411,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, The concierge was extremely helpful and booked us a different restaurant each night for a week The room was nice and quiet The location central to the metro and other attractions We will go back 
111412,Royal Saint Honore, Room was a bit tight for two with large suitcases The kettle in our room wasn t working that was really the only issue so clearly a non issue , Location is excellent and you pay for it I wish we would have asked the staff for guidance a day earlier re transportation Once we did they were amazing the staff made the stay worth every penny 
111413,Royal Saint Honore, The Booking com made us belive we would get a big balcony but only few room have , The staff tryed to solve the problem with the balcony got it for three days and enjoyed it The last two days we had a nice cornerroom with big windows 
111414,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, Very good location with plenty of cafe and restaurant around the area The hotel is located on the high end shopping strip and within walking distance to all attractions or a short taxi ride or train ride
111415,Royal Saint Honore, The room could have been a little larger and the advertised free wifi was very slow there was a charge for decent wifi, The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room although very small was nicely decorated and clean
111416,Royal Saint Honore, Problems with the wi fi front desk staff wasn t too friendly Breakfast was too expensive , Upscale neighborhood walkable to all sights The room was comfortable The bellhop was very helpful and friendly 
111417,Royal Saint Honore, The cleaner on the penultimate day was not as good as the previous two days Breakfast was too expensive at near 20 as we got fruit croissant for about half, We liked the location the hotel itself the room was good size the ensuite was good size although with the usual shower over the bath The atmosphere was great
111418,Royal Saint Honore, Because of my feminist nature I noticed all of the front of house staff were men the only women were the room cleaners Would like to see some women in positions of authority more visible , Our room 506 was quiet and the AC worked perfectly Staff were great too Location couldn t be faulted 
111419,Royal Saint Honore, Nothing, Wonderful staff with perfect English Great location and the transport system is excellent Yes a bit daunting at the start but no matter where you go people will help 3 80 will take two people anywhere with the metro system We had a balcony room looking over the street and it was quiet at night and well sound proofed 
111420,Royal Saint Honore, When booking Deluxe room and all the pictures about it shows balcony terrace and I ask for it it still was t possible to offer a room with balcony And the booking was 4 months ago , Very nice room and perfect location 
111421,Royal Saint Honore, rooms are small but I understand the idea of space I was told i would get a view to the outside but there were none other than that perfect , Your front desk staff is FANTASTIC Friendly and knowledgable They went out of their way for me I know its a small property But Larence was just fantastic I normally stay at Intercontinental but it was booked I tried Your property and it was great SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE with a smile
111422,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, Staff were excellent during my stay and they were very helpful Location was perfect for a solo 1 night stay and the room was large for Paris and well appointed modern and even had a bathtub 
111423,Royal Saint Honore, The concierge was very helpful and willing but didn t always give the correct information He did however provide details of a very good bureau de change and was excellent on directions Be sure to check on the internet too for information re restaurants and sightseeing We used the trip advisor reviews a lot and they were all very reliable Also when we took a taxi to the airport on the way back we were told it would be a flat fate of 50 but it was 55 plus a call out fee of 7 We were not told about the call out fee and in fact it was totally unnecessary to call for a cab as there were always plenty of cabs outside the hotel The area was very expensive but that s what you would expect staying in the heart of Paris , The location was the best thing about this hotel plus the staff were very helpful The rooms were clean and modern with excellent air conditioning and they were very quiet Our room was facing rue st Honore The bathrooms were great with lovely natural bath products The bedrooms were a little small but typical for Paris It was just a few minutes walk to Tuileries metro and there were always lots of cabs available Small and convenient We didn t eat in the hotel There is a Carrefour down the road where you can buy provisions bottled water etc As a mother and daughter travelling alone we always felt very safe in this hotel which is important in these troubled times 
111424,Royal Saint Honore, House keeping is not the hotel s strongest point Room service closes at 11pm There is only one elevator in this small building hotel , The furniture and fittings are good and staff are helpful and quick 
111425,Royal Saint Honore, I was sick and asked them for the nearest pharmacy but they sent me to a pharmacy which they thought was open late but found out was only true during weekends It certainly needs a furnisher upgrade Excellent location , Staff made all the difference Very friendly Excellent location and quiet room
111426,Royal Saint Honore, Really nothing at all , Room extremely convenient and clean Very calm yet in the heart of the city The location is absolutely fabulous 2min walk from Tuilleries metro station The staff is very very nice and helpful Highly recommend it to everyone 
111427,Royal Saint Honore, Some of the furniture feels a little bit dated and could do with an upgrade , Great location clean rooms and very helpful staff Good value for money in central Paris

111430,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, We stayed for 5 nights and were warmly welcomed by Paul Our room was well appointed and insulated from the busy Rue St Honore The breakfast room is very pleasant with good food choices The hotel bistro also offers a good meal selection at reasonable prices The location suited us perfectly Wifi is excellent 
111431,Royal Saint Honore, Again staff very rude When I questioned them about the confirmed upgrade they stiff armed me By looking at the well posted room map it was easy to see we had been stuck in a small room, Cleanest hotel in many years But staff a bit stuck up and not helpful They did NOT give us the upgrade we earned w booking Com When I asked the front desk to break a large bill they told me to go to the bar Will not stay there again Too many other nice hotels in same area
111432,Royal Saint Honore,No Negative, Location is great just off place Vendome and within walking distance to lovely bistros cafes and other sights Really great value for money for Paris and it was a small inviting hotel with spacious and clean rooms 
111433,Royal Saint Honore, There was nothing i did not like , The best thing about this hotel is the service It really is surprising Staff are friendly attentive efficient proactive They make you feel comfortable without you even noticing their hard work Rooms GENEROUS size by Paris standards are very well laid out and have everything you need Decor is not luxurious but very tasteful and agreeable Beds are very comfortable Breakfast is good too All round good hotel 
111434,Royal Saint Honore, Wanted the air conditioning on as it got a bit warm in the room But that was all, Great Location easy access to shops and event venue Staff were extremely kind Food was lovely I was almost put off by some comments I read but so glad I didn t cancel I certainly will go back to Paris and will stay here again and again Great value for money 
111435,Royal Saint Honore, Bath a bit difficult for old people bedroom slippers would have been good , Location decor friendly staff view from room 604 kettle tea and coffee supplies 
111436,Royal Saint Honore, The restaurant was empty in the evening which was a bit of a shame but the food was good, We stayed in a suite as we were travelling with a 2 5 year old and wanted an area to sit in the evening once she had gone to bed This worked really well The suite had two bathrooms and was ample space The staff were very helpful and followed us up to our room on several occasions with various items we had left in the restaurant Location was superb Absolutely brilliant Concierge recommended a child friendly restaurant just round the corner for our last evening He booked it for us and let us borrow the Hotel s baby chair to take with us It was perfect 
111437,Royal Saint Honore, Even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door we still had a maid knock on the door twice Once when we had only just walked into the room then before we had got out of bed in the morning , Good location hotel looks great and the room is stylish and comfortable With polite and professional staff The view from the room was great with a balcony which would be lovely for a summer evening to unwind just before bed
