365817,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, Convenient location clean rooms sufficient breakfast buffet with good coffee Bus stop 150 meters from hotel line 74A Enough number of parking places so as hotel declares no need to book it in advance I would probably stay there again during my next visit to Vienna 
365818,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Breakfast option was expensive but bakeries nearby , Easy access by public transportation from train station to hotel location and to tourist areas Grocery stores nearby 
365819,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Noise from the street can be heard in the rooms on the lower floors , Clean and spacious room Comfortable and big bed Facilities Small SPA on the 6th floor Sauna and Steam Bath Near to groceries a bus and a tram station 
365820,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, There is no lock for the bathroom door a little bit lack of privacy , It was a nice stay in this hotel Although the hotel is not located near the Vienna s Ringstrasse it has a very easy access to the public transport nearby Metro U3 can take you to from city centre tram 18 can take you to from the Wien Hauptbahnhof and bus 77A can take you to from Stadion for coaches directly And there are lots of large supermarket near the hotel which is convenient for us though they usually close at 8pm 
365821,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, There were no slippers nor hair shampoo conditioner ear buds etc There were only soap and shower gel shampoo attached to the bathroom wall I have not experienced something like this at a four stars hotel , It was clean and quiet
365822,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, The Wellness area could be larger with space for changing clothes etc There s also currently no gymn , Having the Sauna on the top floor is awesome 
365823,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, In order to connect to Wi Fi you have to go to your room then back down again wait and after tireless efforts they connect it manually because you receive a SMS code if your phone is not able to receive this SMS forget about connecting it easily This would happen every time you leave the hotel Totally useless ,No Positive
365824,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Even though the room and the bathroom were perfectly clean the windows and window sill were dusty and there was even a spider web in the top corner of the window frame , The hotel is situated in a nice location not far from one of Vienna s business districts Wien Mitte The room is quite spacious with combined bathroom toilet all the necesseties presented The bed is comfortable though consisting of 2 separate matresses placed on a double bed foundation Pillows and blankes are comfortable and soft Another positive thing the air conditioning continues working even without the key card meaning that one does not return to a hot room 
365825,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Overall the stay was fine for after all we only needed the place for one night The ladies at the desk were pleasant and helpful when we checked in In the morning I asked a person at the front desk to please get us a taxi to the airport which he proceeded to do and it arrived in less than 10 minutes Great The airport is 15KM from the hotel and linked directly to it via the A4 highway and it took less than 15 minutes to get there Fine But he charged us 48 Euros WOW We took other taxis in Vienna and Budapest and Prague but not at these prices Now I can not blame Best Western for this but I would advise all BW Amedia guests DO NOT have the front desk call you taxi Better just go out and hail a cab any cab it will be way cheaper , we were only there for one night therefore it is difficult to comment here
365826,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, Very nice and comfortable hotel Located close to the inner city walking distance Many supermarkets were located in the proximity of the hotel The breakfast was also very good and it had a rich variety of food 
365827,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, Best Western Plus Amedia is a nice hotel close to the company I had business with during this trip in Vienna I felt cosy the room was very clean the comfort of it is at high standards Good breakfast kind personnel Definitely a solid option for future travel in Vienna 
365828,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Tv has limited channels and the only thing in english is news The staff is almost bored to even talk to us Absolutely no help with even getting the luggage to the room Hospitality at bets western amedia vienna is an overstatement, There are supermarkets real close by in fact one is next door 
365829,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, The staff is not nice Their treat is unpleasant specially from the staff in the reception The atmosphere is not nice and you don t feel welcome The best are the clean personal ,No Positive
365830,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, First of all the hotel is really good But the room is magnificent The bed was awesome and the pillows where great The bathroom was 10 clean as well as the room and the Internet connection was satisfying Although we made our reservation 30 before our appearance to the reception there was not problem at all The neighborhood is very nice to stay with lots of stores in just a few steps distance The distance of the metro station depends on the weather If it s cold and snowy you gonna think it s too far but in normal circumstances the distance is just fine 
365831,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Pillows need to be replaced Maids didn t leave coffee tea and sugar on a daily basis in the room just the first day and only for one person even though we had a triple room , The room was a decent size clean breakfast was good Underground station is 10 12 minutes walk away while Stephan Platz is 40 minutes walk 
365832,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, A little bit far away from metro station but acceptable I personally don t like two single beds put together as a King bed The price is much expensive , Hotel color was nice warm 
365833,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, main road at the front of the hotel could be noisy early morning did nt realise we could have used the window shutters to block out the sound , scrambled eggs on rye bread fresh fruit salad and good coffee made a perfect breakfast 
365834,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, Good location close to the bus stops The triple room was of a good size Lidl store right next to the Hotel lots of other little shops restaurants around for a quick bite 
365835,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Prior to my initial experience I wasn t that impressed with the staff They offered minimal help on how to travel around the area didn t seem to know bus or train schedule and didn t recommend walking routes Location is also quite a ways from downtown , The morning I left I forgot to set my alarm but the staff had scheduled a taxi to pick me up then called and knocked on my door to make sure I was awake and had my bill prepped to close out my room I would have missed my flight without there help 
365836,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Some of the staff were quite unhelpful The check in time of 3 pm was far too late even though we had asked if we could check in a couple of hours earlier as we had been driving through the night ,No Positive
365837,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, It would have been nice to have breakfast included in the price but Lidl is next door so it s not the end of the world The hotel was also uncomfortably hot when I couldn t figure out how to make the heating settings cooler we just turned the whole thing off and opened the window for 4 nights much better , From leaving the airport to reaching the hotel it took us 30 minutes using the train and a short walk It was great to have the added bonus of the sauna to warm up after cold days exploring Walking into town was perhaps a 20 minute stroll longer when you get distracted by the yummy bakeries Our room was clean and nicely decorated 
365838,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, The bed was so comfy I stayed with my boyfriend we had a double bed Also transportation is excellent the hotel is very very close to Old City Once you exit the hotel just turn right about 50m away there is a bus stop get off on Stubentor it is the last stop It only takes 10min Also you can take the same bus back to the hotel The bus name is 74A St Marx The hotel was very clean and the room that we accomidated in was nice and roomy 
365839,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, I smoke so I was totally fine with the smell but I could see if someone very sensitive would be troubled There is a strong smell of smoke in the entrance great value, If you don t care to stay right downtown of Vienna this hotel is a great choice Located just a short walk from S Train OBB train system from airport to St Marx and some bus stops rides from downtown Downstairs a caffe opened till 00 00 and a grocery store Lidle Across is bakery with great breakfast snacks Also EuroSpar and Billa 
365840,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien,No Negative, The hotel is located in a very accessible area The staff is very friendly and helpful The rooms are clean quite and nice Around the hotel there are some markets pastry shop restaurants To the Belvedere Palace you can go by walk The closest Metro station is at 700 meters but there is a Tram station at around 200 meters distance so you can take the tram to the metro because you can use the same ticket for both of them 
365841,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, WI fi connection was not secure and did not seem to require the password Also we would have spent more time in the bar in hotel if it had had a non smoking section, Rooms were clean and comfortable with good facilities
365842,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Room was not clean as per the normal Standards Questionable if I will choose it next time , Location only this time I had a single room with 3 beds that was not smelling very clean comparing with my previous rooms that I ve stayed in the same hotel 
365843,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, I forgot a few cosmetics and thought there may be some shampoo conditioner and shower gel instead of just hand wash in the shower I ve stayed in 2 3 star hotels that provide this so feel it is expected from a 4 star Apart from this it was lovely , The bed was very comfortable and the fridge was handy The staff were very polite helpful and friendly 
365844,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, may is garage too expensive no any other complain , excellent hotel great position for find restaurant nearby comfortable and very clean fully for recommend 
365845,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Everithing was perfect except cleaning , The hotel located not far from the city center Probably you need to spend approximately 15 20 minutes to get to Stephansplatz Room is comfortable with nice bed and shower Staff is friendly and hospitable

365847,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, We had to stay in a studio not in the hotel It wasn t too far from the hotel but inconvenient to go to the hotel every morning just to have breakfast So we didn t have any breakfast there even though it included in our room s price , The staff was really good clean room with big bathroom 
365848,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, A little off center but a bus 74A line that passes in front of the hotel all the time brings you down town in 5 10 mins so not really a problem , Nice 4 hotel at a fantastic price Stylish clean well proportioned and well equipped rooms with comfortable beds All the personnel was extremely polite and helpful Marina deserving our special thanks 
365849,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, The area where the elevators are was very cold Maybe amp up the heating in that area Close to the city we walked pretty much everywhere , The staff was exceptionally helpful From restaurant recommendations to separating our bed 
365850,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Julius Meiln coffe made on home like coffe machine disaster for 3 5 euro , The room was spotlessly clean super fast internet and kind and helpful staf For our visit hotel had a perfect location 
365851,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, No English channels apart from the news channels Bath soap smelt like detergent Triple Room was stuffy Sliding door does not provide sufficient privacy due to gap and inability to lock , Bed was comfortable 
365852,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Absolut all is perfect I stay here time to time , Note 10 plus Perfect cleaning Pure crystal Peace comfort warm in the room Wifi works very well Rich breakfast Public transportation in front of the hotel 74a bus from the hotel will take you to the center of Vienna 4 large grocery stores near the hotel The friendly reception staff Spa area is very useful All modern clean and functional If you find it on sale do not hesitate I recommend 
365853,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Some of the reception staff were more helpful than others one of the female receptionists was most unhelpful and did not look like she wanted to help us either We had an issue with a tour we had booked to Salzburg when asking for help all she did was pass us a booklet to ring the tour company ourself We did however get 2 more helpful receptionists in the morning that were more helpful and actually rang the tour company for us to help us sort out our issue Overall if the staff were nicer I would have rated this hotel much higher Also one other little thing is that they did not provide slippers to use in the room this would have been a nice touch and would have been a good icing on the cake , The location of the hotel was great there was everything you needed right on the door step with 3 supermarkets bakery boots Superdrug type shop and pharmacy within minutes of the hotel Although hotel was not right in the centre public transport was amazing easy to use and extremely cheap we had no issues getting around at all Tip getting the bus if you can get your bearings is actually quicker than the train After arriving at the airport if going to this hotel do not get the fast city train as that s a waste of money ask at information for details of getting the local S7 train to St Marx for this hotel then once off hotel jump on the bus right outside and get off at the 2nd stop and hotel is literally right outside for th first time there it s easier to get the bus but its actually only 5 10mins walk from the station The rooms were nice and spacious and comfortable nice bathroom comfy bed If you have time definitely visit Salzburg it was an amazing place 
365854,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Television set switching itself on during the night quite weird , Good location to reach from motorway expecially from North and East or if you come from Airport You get several restaurants and caf s along the main road so you can get a late dinner Bus metro very near to get to town centre Friendly staff own covered garage plenty of space 
365855,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Nothing bothered me, Comfortable Close to the centre metro train and bus a few steps away Easy to find lots of groceries shops bakeries around There is also a small spa in the hotel
365856,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, The staff As soon as I walked in the woman at the desk wasn t friendly When I left and needed help finding the bus station I wish the person who helped me would have told me I could walk 10 minutes to the train and then take it two stops I ended up missing an earlier bus to my next destination because I didn t think I would make it in time I found out on my own that it was two stops on the train or rather U Bahn Customer service is everything and it would be nice if the staff was friendlier and more helpful , The hotel is nice and my room was big with a big bathroom which is a nice change since a lot of rooms in Europe are small The hotel is clean and in an okay location Not too much around but there s a grocery store next door and one a few blocks away There s a good little bakery also a block up and the bus to take you into the city center is also close I will say again I really liked my room The bed was so comfortable and I was pleasantly surprised 
365857,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Very expensive breakfast We asked if we can do late checkout a few days before the actual check out The girl at the desk said no problem so I came ine day before the leaving to book the late check out and all of a sudden I cannot do it since the hotel is full When I said the othe girl said it was ok I got a shrug and that s how it is ,No Positive

365864,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Very little to moan about the shower screen made it very difficult putting plug in bath and turning water on the bath for a short person which I am This was just a small annoyance The charge for breakfast was rather high but if you have a large appetite in the morning I am sure it is justified , Room was fine spotlessly clean and comfortable Tea and coffee with kettle and bottled water Copious hot water in a pristine bath Reception extremely helpful and happy to answer all our questions Taxis ordered by hotel always took about three minutes to arrive Breakfast was excellent Lots of variety well presented and mouthwatering 
365865,BEST WESTERN PLUS Amedia Wien, Parking is possible but too expensive we parked at P R Erdberg instead The heating was waaay too hot at nights despite i m always cold , We enjoyed the location 10 mins from city centre bus or u bahn close to supermarket rooms are fine we used the sauna one time this is a plus even if its really really small
