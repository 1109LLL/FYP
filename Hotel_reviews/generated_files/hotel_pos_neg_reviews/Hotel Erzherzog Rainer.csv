511319,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Lack of air conditioning however the room is equipped with a really nice chrome table fan Also an insect net for the window would have made the night more comfortable The bathroom was a bit small Not a deal breaker and I will probably book it again , It s a very nice hotel with good connections by both tram and metro The room was comfortable and clean The breakfast was delicious and varied I especially liked the veal sausages with omelette and the home made cake The staff were very friendly and kind 
511320,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Although clean bathroom was in need of several repairs shower door was a folding device that missed a hinge or two and collapsed into one s standing room while showering No outlet in bathroom no mirror in room itself No air conditioner although fan provided View of courtyard just a hallow area between buildings nothing scenic Not an overly comfortable bed neither of us slept well Note that restaurant while reputedly very good closes for a month each summer as of about 23 July Parking in their underground garage must be reserved in advanced If you don t see this option when booking your hotel room consider calling the hotel to arrange as nearest parking garage cost us a fixed fee of 35 Euro and the garage only opens each morning at 9 am , Hotel is a period piece that is well situated near a metro stop It is very clean and in overall good shape if dated Staff reasonably friendly 
511321,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Unfortunately there was no air condition in the room A hardly working ventilator is not enough in summer , Location of the hotel the breakfast and the staff were great 
511322,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Absolutely loved staying in this hotel Friendly and helpful staff cozy room with a very comfortable bed amazing breakfast Looking forward to coming back soon 
511323,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room was a bit noisy As it was very hot we would have liked free bottled drinking water in the room not the expensive water in the mini bar , Excellent location with a number of restaurants and good public transport connections near by
511324,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I would have expected tea and coffee making facilities to be in the room although they could be requested if you read the hotel guide book The room was quite small even though it was a single It was a fair walk in to the centre of Vienna although there are regular trams and buses , The bed was comfortable the bed linen good quality and the bathroom clean with good quality towels The room itself was quite and one could not hear noise from the next rooms or those above Breakfast was very good and the breakfast room was tastefully decorated with good quality crockery and cutlery The staff were very helpful at all times and very polite and cheerful 
511325,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Due to missing air condition was not told before we were expecting it in hotel we must have opened windows in the streets but from there we were every night disturbed by public transport , Great location hotel is in walking distance from Karlsplatz Nashmarkt or Belvedere 
511326,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air conditioners and I had to open the windows The room was on the street side so it was noisy , Location is great 300 meters walk to metro station and Karlsplatz station is only 15 min walk Near is a tram stop Staff was very pleasant always ready to help Breakfast was excellent good variety of food I loved yogurts a lot 
511327,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Accepted that with do old hotel no air con means rooms are warm hotel provided fans noting rest of excellence too much made by many travellers re air con Not enthusiastic over dining in hotel for evening meal can do better exploring all the places to eat within short walk, The lovely character of the hotel the location and breakfast rooms were lovely and spacious
511328,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There was no air conditioning in the room and the heat overnight was extremely uncomfortable Better fans are needed if air con can t be installed , The staff were very friendly
511329,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The main problem is the lack of air conditioning in the rooms which they kindly inform you about on check in We were lucky enough to be in Vienna when temperatures were over 30 and although there was a ventilator in the room it was very little help The other problem is the noise outside We had two choices sweat with closed windows or don t sleep because of the noise We chose sweating All this wouldn t have been a problem if there had been air conditioning in the room and this would be a 5 star review I wouldn t have booked here if it were made obvious on the website that there s no air conditioning I think it s a basic expectation to have air conditioning in a hotel that s supposed to be 4star accommodation We had an okay stay but I ll never book here again , A stylish hotel which opened in the grand days of Austria Hungary 100 years ago The place is well located It s just a few min walk from the main railway station and the centre is also quite near Staff are very friendly and nice The room was clean Breakfast is very good and so is food at the restaurant 
511330,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Could have done with air conditioning but it is a very old hotel so I understand why this is not available , The breakfast was lovely The staff were all very friendly Very good location for public transport 
511331,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No AC during a 90 degree heat wave was not pleasant Although they did offer a 2nd fan which we accepted We supposedly got an upgraded room to the courtyard but the one window looked into another hotel on all 4 sides We think a courtyard should have some flowers or greenery but you couldn t even see the ground as we were on the 5th floor Also the room was small but we weren t in it much Also no one told us that the tram would take us right to the Opera which would have saved us a 15 minute walk twice a day it took us 2 days to figure that out , Breakfast was good bread was wonderful staff was friendly location was good Everything was fine except no AC 
511332,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Air conditioning There was none Exceptionally hot weather meant windows had to be left open in my 1st floor room and traffic noise kept me awake Other rooms may have a c and higher floors may be less noisy My original courtyard room was stifingly hot and I had to move to a road side room more air but traffic noise Staff very helpful with room move View from 1st floor Courtyard room disappointing see pic I was expecting something a bit more rustic , Free wi fi great breakfast friendly and helpful staff Good range of TV channels in English Nice restaurant able to sit outside Reasonably easy to get to from airport by public transport train to Vienna Hbf and one stop on U bahn or walk 
511333,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Internet speed could be faster Some rooms really suffer with slower wifi speeds at least in the past Staff is sometimes not flexible about changing my room because of slow speed when hotel is booked full I ve been here 4 times These are my only negatives NO AC but usually not a problem , Good location about 1 km walk to State Opera house straight up the street Easy with metro in front of hotel There are a couple of small grocery stores on same street withing 2 300 meters Staff will call taxi and it will arrive in 3 4 minutes There is an Irish pub across and down the street about 6 7 minute walk Plenty of restaurants in any direction I take the CAT from airport to central metro station From there take a subway to Karlplatz which is 2 stops From here I walk about 10 12 min to hotel towing a bag on wheels Works for me Staff helpful with local advice Staff is professional 
511334,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room was warm at night somewhat noisy because of the street below bring earplugs if you want to keep the window open , Close to T pleasant neighborhood very nice room clean and comfortable delicious free breakfast staff is polite and welcoming 
511335,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, It would be nice if the staff would look a bit more happy , Very nice and clean room Very nice location Breakfast had a good selection of meals Hotel restaurant serves really nice food 
511336,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Lack of power supplies in the room hard to recharge 1 gadget No ventilation in the bathroom No air conditioning in the room Poor wi fi signal in the room, Good breakfast Quite good location
511337,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, When temperature is over 25 deg C rooms become very hot and fans cannot longer help The hotel MUST think about installing air conditioning system , I like this hotel because of its location very close to the old town and at the same time is far from a touristic area Very polite and helpful receptionists Very good breakfasts Also a good restaurant with a nice selection of Austrian meal and wines Although the rooms are not big they are well enough for a short business travel 
511338,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Very good service but staff are not so helpful to get solution for us to change booking date then we have to pay one night without stay , Very good service but staff are not so helpful to help us to
511339,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing I was very pleased with everything , The staff are all lovely people friendly helpful professional The WiFi is reliable and fast The breakfast is excellent a wide selection fresh and tasty The room was quiet Everything in the room worked well the shower was good as was the television The hotel has a welcoming homely atmosphere which is nice to return to after a day out It retains a historic charm while being fully modern I certainly intend to stay here again and I fully recommend this excellent hotel 
511340,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The hotel building is old and needs better maintenance The carpets and furnishings were elderly and worn The lack of air conditioning on an early summer night made the room uncomfortably warm , The breakfast was superb both in quality and atmosphere The location is convenient to public transportation and close to the city center 
511341,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, the room was terrible hot like sauna So there wasnt aircontition Just fan and they gave me smll extra fan but it didnt help And cleaner colosed windows of fans when they cleaned so room was really hot when i came back If this hotel is fours stars hotell they should have aircondition not only at reception and restaurant , Everything was Great but 
511342,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The area is very noisy and we felt the traffic starting 6 30 The air conditioning was missing This is terrible if you go on summer holiday , Good location 2 metro stations from city center Breakfast was for all tastes Room very cosy 
511343,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, The staff were friendly efficient and helpful Great breakfast with plenty of choice We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and the food was lovely The room was very comfortable and although there were no tea and coffee making facilities we asked at reception and these were provided Location was good near to the Opera House and the Naschmarkt and within walking distance of all the other attractions in the city All positive 
511344,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air conditioning at all in the rooms only a fan Rooms were really hot during the day night and the fan was helpful only to some extent making it really hard to sleep at night Basically my wife and I had nearly no sleep during our stay because of the hot rooms We brought up the lack of air conditioning and sleep due to hot rooms at the check out but the response was that they are planning to install a c in 2019 Nobody really cared how we felt I would really NOT recommend staying at this place if air conditioning is a real factor for you otherwise I would recommend it if you are not really picky about where you stay in Vienna Location to the shopping area is about a 20 min walk breakfast and staff were really good , Breakfast 
511345,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room was small and very very hot We had one fan and was not enough By asking at the reception we could get another fan but even so it wa very hot , The breakfast was very good 
511346,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Restaurant breakfast service price we re all as in the past excellent We ve stayed there several times All of that plus location 5 minutes walk to Karl s Platz and Ring 3 minutes to an U1 subway station are excellent 
511347,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, In the rooms there is no air condition and the fan is very noisy If your room faced the main road and you are noise sensitive you will have problem to have the window open , The location of the hotel was perfect The breakfast was very nice and with a lot of things to select The room was a big one and cleaned every day The staff was very helpful and gave us a lot of useful information on everything we asked 
511348,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing really If being really picky I d suggest full air conditioning in the room rather than the fan provided although that did keep the room pleasantly cool Outside temperatures were in the high 20 s , Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly Very knowledgeable about what was on offer helped to give us the best deals going on entertainments and attractions advised on other eating places when we fancied something different It felt as though they would be able to sort out any problem or wish that we presented to them Breakfast was one of the best we ve had an amazing selection of continental and English dishes on offer Decor felt luxurious whilst very tradionally Austrian in style
511349,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, When I booked there was a question asking if I wanted a quiet room Given that quite a few reviews mentioned noise I said yes I was then told I would have to pay an extra 15euros per night which I agreed to However on arrival I realized I would have been better off with a regular room as they had better natural light and air flow Our room was very stuffy as the windows opened onto a courtyard There was a small fan in the room but it didn t work Also I didn t think it was in a noisy location anyway , The location is great as was the breakfast 
511350,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I asked a girl at reception desk to call a taxi to the airport giving a card with taxi details one day before check out The taxi did not come An another taxi was called for me Since I always go to the airport in advance there was no problem , A very nice hotel with always smiling amiable staff The room was clean and quite spacious Cleaning was at a high level An Early check in was arranged without problem Breakfast was great a large selection of cheeses milk products fruits croissants and even sparkling wine I recommend this hotel to everyone
511351,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing , One of the best values I ve found in nearly 45 years of travel Old style European hotel with many fine touches Excellent staff outstanding gourmet breakfast 15 minute walk to the museum distrct lovely updated rooms 
511352,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Our room was on the street with excessive noise late into the night from vehicles and trains It was also unseasonably warm so we got too warm if we kept the windows closed so we didn t get very good sleep , Room and breakfast were very nice and the restaurant was also good 
511353,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We found the lack of air conditioning a slight problem traffic trams in particularly was too loud to have windows open at night and though the central heating was off the room was always very warm with a window open the trams went past like high speed army tanks but if closed the noise was a rumble like an underground tube station with the train arriving before you get to the platform The room had a stand alone fan but this was too noisy to use all night I m not sure what we would have done had it been the middle of summer A second problem for my wife and I both preferring to use the shower rather than bath was the shower over the bath the bath was relatively narrow and therefor more curved on the bottom resulting in uneven standing area with a high risk of slipping even without soap Perhaps a non slip bath mat to place in the bath may solve the problem Also the safety rail needs to be higher for showering than for bathing , The location and to the inner ring tourist attractions by foot bus U bahn or tram The nearest stops being a five minute walk away The hotel breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of foods from different breads to cheeses and cakes cereals and a variety of yogurts We had a nicely appointed room facing onto the main road on the second floor Having a full week to explore we managed to cover most of the major attractions including 3 of the 4 Vienna Yellow Bus tours in one day The complementary bottle of wine from management was well appreciated after a hard days sight seeing 
511354,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Although being in Vienna a 4 star hotel should offer air condition An electric fan is not acceptable Fitness facilities become essential , Very comfortable hotel Kind staff and great breakfast
511355,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I have only positive things to say about Hotel Erzherzog Rainer , The location of Hotel Erzherzog Rainer was very good for everything we wanted to see and do in Vienna The staff was always friendly and helpful and the laundry service was very convenient The breakfast was enjoyable and the room was lovely 
511356,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room floor looked very shabby which spoiled the impression a bit Single rooms are quite small but that s fine, The hotel is pretty easy to find Situated near the city centre it is some of the best locations for those wishing to explore the heart of Vienna Breakfasts were delicious There was a good choice of food enough to satisfy different tastes It was nice to have a glass of sparkling wine for free for breakfast as well The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful 
511357,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, A bit old fashioned design staff has proposed early check in into upper category room which was ready by the time if arrival for additional 40EUR we didn t feel the upgrade really just paid it not to wait another hour , Breakfast location are great
511358,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Noisy Vacuum cleaning at 6am people talking on hallways elevator Small room and bed , Excelent breakfast Amazing staff Good location atmosphere 
511359,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Couldn t get the soap bottle in tub area to work when squeezed , Accomodations cleanliness were perfect Enjoyed the excellent variety of choices at the breakfast buffet Also enjoyed the lunch dinner options in the on site restaurant Wait staff very friendly Glad we tried the local Muskateller wine The dense dark bread at breakfast was awesome with your choices of cheese All staff were very helpful pleasant Hotel arrangement with taxi service was impressive immediate response 
511360,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room was hot and right above a busy road Fortunately we d got earplugs with us , Reception staff were so friendly and helpful printing off maps and directions to places we wanted to visit Nothing was too much trouble all done with a smile and politeness Breakfast was very good fresh fruit scrambled eggs bacon and sausage as well as nice bread and the usual continental breakfast foods Unheard of in European countries soft boiled eggs 
511361,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing in particular , The reception staff were very helpful the buffet breakfast excellent the Hotel decor very homely and welcoming the daily cleanliness of the room and I must remark it is one of the very few hotels that chambermaids follows the changing of towels rules on the floor change the rest leave as is and the proximity of the hotel to the the city center public transport The hotel policy to issue a card with room number to show to the receptionist is excellent as reception staff rotates 
511362,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Service was ok but nothing special younger staff members especially could be trained a bit more to reach the level of service you expect in this kind of a hotel , Location was great easy access to city by trams and U bahn Good quality breakfast peaceful atmosphere Very nice neighbourhood 04 Wieden 
511363,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Guests are given a paper card at reception with the room number and I had to show it every time I came back to hotel This was a bit odd , Great hotel historical building walking distance from Opera and city center The room was good size very comfortable bed good wi fi signal The breakfast was excellent and the breakfast room is spacious there are 2 rooms Excellent value for money The staff was professional and attentive 
511364,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, The hotel is very beautiful and comfortable the breakfast is excellent and includes fresh fruits and rich choice of dishes The location is perfect and very close to all important attractions The stuff is professional and very friendly The rooms are comfortable clean and quite I will go to this hotel for sure again 
511365,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Flachsp ler shallow flush toilet Small bathroom , Excellent breakfast Professional and welcoming staff Good internet connection Easy access to public transportation 
511366,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room was warm visited early April and so to sleep keep cool the windows had to be opened no air conditioning and the noise from the street trams kept us awake late at night early in the morning , The breakfast was lovely wide selection of food drink Friendly helpful staff throughout The room doesn t automatically come with tea coffee making facilities you have to request it but that is simple as the staff efficiently delivered it to the room 
511367,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The bacon at breakfast it s not bacon please stop calling it that Everything else at the breakfast was excellent though , This is very good and clean hotel The staff are very good and always have a smile even at 06 30 in the morning It s close to a tram stop and close to main train station and has a restaurant attached for meals and beer when you get in Close to other restaurants if you fancy a change or something different 
511368,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Location is a bit far from the city center take around 15 minutes walk , The single room is very comfortable and room is clean Breakfast was good with lots of options 
511369,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Excellent location could walk to all the sites restaurants bars etc right by underground too Hotel was very nice we had a large room on the 4th floor Lots of options for breakfast hot and cold good tea coffee and even sparkling wine if you wanted that Would recommend 
511370,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The bed was OK Very firm I normally like firm but this was firm enough to give me a bruise on my hip and leave me with back troubles After walking a lot a bed with a memory foam topper would have been an absolutely fantastic touch , Breakfast was amazing The room was classy 
511371,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing The whole place staff facilities food rooms and service were excellent , Superb breakfast beautifully presented It was such a treat to linger in comfort over the delicious eggs bread fruit salad and pastries The room was spacious warm and well furnished Gorgeous curtains hung at the huge bow windows The room was so peaceful I took earplugs but they were not necessary o the hotel must be soundproofed 
511372,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, the room equipement looks a bit tired expensive garage, very good location quiet room oriented to the inner yard very good breakfast helpful and attentive staff
511373,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We do not know the European summer because we only travel there in the winter but the hotel does not have air conditioning which can generate discomfort on the hottest days We have been to the hotel twice in the same period The first time we stayed on the fifth floor but on the second time there was only room on the first floor and we noticed the lack of acoustic insulation because the floor is made of wood and we heard the footsteps of who is above The building is old but very well maintained , Breakfast and hotel location fine The hotel is close to the underground station Taubstummengasse which gives access to the Hbf train station Karlsplatz station and the Vienna State Opera 
511374,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing, Fabulous hotel staff were amazing rooms lovely and comfortable everything you could want for a few days sightseeing Breakfast excellent great choice of food and really comfy beds
511375,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, If you like fresh air in your room and you are sensitive to noise you may consider ordering a quite room Because of the tram passing in front of the hotel rooms facing the main road are a bit noisy when window is open Or you can simply close the window at night , For the price paid it was a great deal Hotel location is great Underground train station is 5 minutes walking from the hotel via Line 1 red line and one two stations from the city center Rooms were very clean and breakfast was tasty and rich We enjoyed our stay and will consider visiting here again 
511376,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, A beautiful hotel where time seems to have stopped It was so quiet and peaceful that only at breakfast did I notice that the hotel was full Very friendly staff 
511377,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, super good breakfast with lots of vegetable and fruit staff are very helpful to prepare breakfast box for us when we leave hotel quite early in the morning 
511378,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, So called library could use a bigger selection with a few more English language books, Brings you back to early 20th century overflowing with charming details original prints uber helpful staff satisfyingly heavy keys It s like staying in a miniature downtown version of the Grand Budapest Hotel 
511379,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Our double room maybe coulda been a bit bigger but it was totally fine for one night , The breakfast was excellent with a nice variety The location is quite central between main station and karlsplatz with metro station within 5min walking distance Personnel was very helpful and friendly We could also leave our bags for a whole day after our check out Very comfortable bed 
511380,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, In our room toilet was separated from the bathroom it was not even close to bathroom Very uncomfortable On the 2nd day we ran out of shampoo and had to go and pick it up because they didn t have anyone to bring it to the room Also we ran out of soap on the 4th day they use big bottles of shampoo and soap so probably no one checked if there is enough before we arrived , Clean hotel with very good breakfast comfortable beds and pillows good location Staff is friendly and almost always helpful 
511381,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The bedroom turned out to be a little smaller than expected I had requested a quiet room at the time of booking but was given one overlooking the main road Wiedner Hauptstrasse The hotel had emailed me after booking to offer a quiet room facing the courtyard for an additional 10 euros per night but in order to keep in budget I declined the offer The trams run right outside the hotel but they become less frequent at night and seem to stop completely between around midnight and 6am so it wasn t excessively noisy It was freezing cold outside but the hotel is very well heated in fact our room was small and possibly a little too well heated and insulated There was no air con in the room so had to turn the radiatiors off and open the windows to let some heat out also took the duvet out of its cover and used that as a sheet over me instead of sleeping under the duvet At least the hotel was well heated though far better to be too hot than too cold Just small points to note really they didn t impact too much on our stay , Great buffet breakfast lots of variety and swift service Clean and comfortable bedroom and ensuite bathroom Good hotel restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and good range of traditional Austrian dishes at reasonable prices The hotel s location is ideal most things are within a walkable distance of about 20mins but there are bus and tram stops right outside the hotel if you don t want to walk and Taubstummengasse underground station is just 2 minutes walk round a corner behind the hotel The hotel sells 48hr and 72hr Vienna Cards from their reception desk covers free transport and discounted admission fees to attractions The Wieden area is ideal plenty of cafes restaurants takeaways supermarkets pharmacies it feels like a proper community with everything you might need within a stone s throw of the hotel There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom but reception will provide them free of charge if you ask The hotel s staff really shine so friendly helpful and accommodating yet extremely professional I would definitely recommend this hotel great location and excellent value for money A very enjoyable stay thankyou 
511382,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No slippers , Great location close to Metro large classy clean warm room comfortable beds amazing breakfast friendly stuff They even gave us a bottle of wine for our honeymoon 
511383,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The single room was rather small and the bed too Not uncomfortable but still a bit tight , Exceptional breakfast selection Warm and classy looking hotel Helpful staff although I didn t ask for much Reasonably clean overall 
511384,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, The location is good Comfortable bed clean bathroom service of the tea set etc The restaurant is good and is reasonable The staff is very kind and friendly 
511385,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Lift was a bit small if travelling with a lot of luggage as we were , Lovely traditional style hotel Breakfast was tasty good selection Staff were friendly Had an excellent Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve Close to the Ring Road and the trams into the City 
511386,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Maybe air conditioning for summer time although thick old walls and drapes with blinds perform nicely , Our second time here Wonderful staff and location very fresh and tasty breakfast Quiet and homely atmosphere At the end we ve got a discount for the next stay 
511387,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, This was the best hotel for location and value for money The facilities were excellent and you really felt like you are in Vienna and it is at least 4 stars Compared to other 4 star hotels we stayed in Austria this one was like 5 stars The restaurant under the hotel and the food were yet another great experience for our evenings 
511388,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Location was good but not really in walking distance with luggage to the metro in the snowy weather In summer it would probably be OK , Breakfast was very good Room is nice and comfy big bed and on suite bath with a shower 
511389,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, First of all the breakfast is just excellent The location of the hotel is very good near to Karlplatz And one metro stop is also very near to hotel The room was very cozy and clean we really enjoyed being in this hotel The excellent value for your money 
511390,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The location leaves a lot to be desired we took a taxi to the hotel from the main railway station for 13 eur by local taxi and 6 eur backward by Uber and there is 20 minutes to get to the old town on foot from the hotel Some decades ago the hotel was on its top but now it is rather old fashioned There are no queen king size beds in the hotel just only two single beds split together Take care of your money when the hotel charges the sum after you book a room They charged us 3 times the required amount within 6 hours and returned our money back only after long negotiations with the hotel , Good breakfast but the same one every day 
511391,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The bathroom was vey small and shower head didn t work very well , The breakfasts were great with a very good selection of healthy foods Staff were very friendly 
511392,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I liked everything , This most wonderful hotel You will not regret choosing it It is very very clean wonderful on the inside as well as on the outside We will certanly come back again The best location

511395,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, In 4 nights we ve spent there Absolutely nothing , First of all the location Perfect easy access to the subway right in the center close to everywhere and located in a beautiful area surrounded by exellent restaurants shops and supermarkets The hotel looks really good Better then in photos beautifully designed and built with vintage style forniture in the lobby area The room was amazing the bed super comfortable well furnished cozy and warm Bathroom with fantastic shower perfect after a day out in the cold of the winter Room and bathroom always cleaned in the morning excellent housekeeping service The staff very professional always helping us and friendly Everyone working there from the gentleman at the reception at night to the housekeepers or the waiters at the breakfast buffet were the best expression of customer service People always friendly always smiling and always polite The breakfast buffet was great Rich with all you can desire All kind of good food hot and cold dishes always refilled when necessary It was amazing Book at the Erzherzog Rainer Hotel You won t regret it 
511396,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, WiFi issues I have 2 devices which normally connect to Wifi and work well They didn t work in my room and variably in reception Either my devices aren t up to it or the hotel s WiFi facility isn t Both devices connected up drama free subsequently to Vienna airport which answered my question for me Restaurant attached to the hotel works well but probably need to book on arrival Saturday night told well it s Vienna and it s a Saturday night when no room Fair enough but I felt less esteemed by the tenor of the delivery of this message Lounge area of the hotel limited and the bar area is in the restaurant which is busy as a restaurant , My second visit the first as a couple with lady companion this time solo The location of the Erzherhog Rainer is spot on being a short walk from Karlsplatz U Bahn which is a hub connecting to a very efficient Metro system Stefansdom and the Museum Quarter are 15 20 minutes walk away In the opposite direction the Belvedere Palace is a short walk away The hotel itself has efficient and attentive staff My bedroom was functional and comfortable Breakfast is excellent served between 0630 and 1030 The first day I arrived for breakfast solo at 0900 to find there was no room bar an uncomfortable looking high table which a member of bar staff tried to fob me off with Issue resolved by arriving for breakfast at 0930 the remaining days and 0700 on my final day There are some very good eateries within walking distance of the hotel if the hotel s restaurant is busy 
511397,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Location was excellent The room was very comfortable and breakfast was superb The restaurant is also very good and cheap I would recommend this hotel to everyone 
511398,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Location works very well if you are comfortable using public transport with a choice between metro or trams either side of the hotel The 3 day ticket from the metro station was easy to purchase 
511399,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Absolutely nothing, The breakfasts staff location all were superb it was a charming smallish hotel that had everything great value for money Just go stay there you won t be disappointed 
511400,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing to complain about Suited our needs perfectly Would gladly stay there again , A very clean comfortable and well equipped hotel very close to the centre of Vienna All the staff we encountered were extremely courteous welcoming and helpful 
511401,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing was bad about this hotel We would stay here again in a heartbeat , Location of hotel excellent On quiet street with a small park on one end with a nice Italian restaurant on the side Short walk to the Taubstummengasse stop closest to the hotel with easy access to the whole excellent subway system Delicious buffet breakfast with wide variety of foods and efficient friendly service Would have liked better croissants but assortment was good The room was clean beds very comfortable and bath was small but efficient with a nice heated towel rack perfect for drying even heavy winter socks Temperature control for the room was perfect as we prefer a cool bedroom for sleeping but a nice warm bathroom when we get up Excellent bargain for the price 
511402,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Not much of a view from our room I think it was in one of the quiet rooms with a view of a central courtyard But then it is what we asked for when given the option , Breakfast was a great start to the day lots of choices all very fresh with even the option of a glass of wine Staff were excellent and always helpful General pride in serving the customer throughout the hotel 
511403,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The bed could have been bigger as we booked a queen size room, Friendly staff and great location Not too far away from the city centre walking distance Good breakfast too 
511404,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing really Perhaps only the carpeted floor which I personally do not favour because of the difficulty cleaning them In our room it was a little worn but seemed well vacuumed , Comfortable bed and pillows Good that they use duvets and not just the fold over the quilt sheets Very clean rooms not a spot anywhere Wonderful breakfast with lots of choices Both hot and cold alternatives scrambled eggs bacon boiled eggs different fresh fruit three different yogurts a selection of different cheese and ham vegetables juices coffee th croisants with different jams other sweet cakes Friendly helpful staff who mad us feel welcome Convenient to leave the baggage at the hotel the last day when we were not leaving Vienna until the evening We tried the restaurant adjoined to the hotel one evening and it was also nice They served several Viennese specialities All in all a very good stay We will definitely come back if we visit Vienna again

511408,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I truly can t think of a thing it was great perfect spot to stay, The breakfasts were great the only thing I would suggest I like my bacon crispy and it was more underdone maybe that is a European preferance
511409,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No free bottle of water for welcome Croissants for breakfast were not too tasty and orange juice could be better , Great location 15 20min walk from Belwedere Opera Museums Cool old style rooms with these heavy key chains Very nice breakfast with fresh fruits and good coffee Free wifi 
511410,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The first room i got had interior windows was small and dark Then i asked to change and i got a great room , Everything Great location great breakfast 
511411,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The hotel is bit old so you miss some commodities like having an iron in the room they don t have much information about services or transport network in the city , Amazing breakfast Kind people WiFi ok if you re going to visit Vienna this place is great 
511412,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Lovely old world style hotel with great breakfast friendly staff and terrific location Our room was not large but it had all one could need minibar safe TV wifi Would recommend to anyone going to Vienna 
511413,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, no nighttable reading lamp far from the bed too small bathroom uneasy to use the bath, Friendly staff good breakfast comfortable mattress perfect location
511414,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Felt a bit cramped in a very small though efficient single room , Great location just a few blocks outside the Ringstrasse with easy walk to transit Friendly and helpful staff Delicious and bountiful breakfast Restaurant was also very good for dinner one night Delighted to find the New York Times in the lounge 
511415,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, We stayed for nine very enjoyable days The charming staff were efficient and helpful Room service was excellent The breakfasts were varied and substantial 
511416,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Single room very small but everything was there Could have been refreshed for furniture and paper colour , Nice staff very friendly Impressive breakfast buffet Not far from downtown 10 15 mn by foot 
511417,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Perhaps the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Plus noisy from the street and from next door I had to enjoy a long call home at 3 30 am at night Hard to sleep especially at a price of EUR 100 for these pleasures , Location good breakfast OK 
511418,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, My room a single room was somewhat small , A hotel in a perfect location near to the Karlsplatz with an historic atmosphere they say it is the oldest hotel in Vienna 1912 Very good breakfast ans friendly staff 
511419,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing negative to say this is our second visit and we would have no hesitation booking here again , The bed was very comfortable room very clean staff very friendly and helpful As we were visiting family we didn t need to be right in the centre of town however it s only a 20 minute walk to the centre with buses trams and underground on the doorstep 
511420,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Everything was fine , Comfortable hotel very well placed for the centre of the city albeit a 15 minute walk via K rntnerstra e and an easy walk to the Belvedere Palace Gustav Klimt collection Close to nearby tube stations and good eateries The reception staff were very accommodating breakfast was excellent for choice including hot food choices cold fresh meat and cheese and even sparkling chilled wine The breakfast staff were friendly 
511421,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Orange juice could have been freshly squeezed but no t important, Itwas great to be able to have grilled tomatoes and scrambled eggs cooked extremely well and then top it off with some muesli and your wonderful Austrian berries 
511422,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Climate control in the room was limited but because the weather was cool we weren t affected too much by it , Friendly and helpful front desk and restaurant staff excellent wifi plentiful breakfast in a historic setting 
511423,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, A bit small room for breakfast Some rooms looking at the street are noisy due to the tram line , Breafast is good wifi is fast A good location not far from the centre 
511424,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Wi Fi connection wasn t very reliable , Staff were welcoming and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable with everything I needed Hotel itself has lots of character which seems fitting for a trip to Vienna I enjoyed the breakfasts good food lots of choice and attentive service The location is also very good Not in the centre so not too noisy but with good tram and underground connections close by If you re happy walking its maybe 30 45 minutes to the centre and you can easily detour through other interesting areas such as the Naschmarkt Schloss Belvedere is also within easy walking distance and its easy to get to the main train station for trips further afield The room was very warm but it was easy enough to cool it with the provided fan 
511425,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There was nothing to dislike , The breakfast was phenomenal Very delicious and so much to choose from There were six of us in our party and we all thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast One morning we had to leave the hotel very early to go on a tour We were permitted to have our breakfast before the designated time which we thought very considerate of management 
511426,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, To have had air conditioning because the temperature outside was over 30 C So we slept with an opened window and a fan , The location is excellent with both bus and U Bahn very close and within 10 minutes walking distance from the Opera We very much enjoyed the way the lobby and breakfast room were decorated The breakfast was excellent and the restaurant was also very good The Hotel staff were very charming and helpful For example my computer had a problem and the receptionist provided me with the address of a Computer Arzt where my problem was solved I would very much like to go back to this hotel for a future visit to Vienna
511427,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I paid a room with courtyard view which was the most expensive one on Booking asking for a double bed also When we check in we received room 220 which had a strange bathroom the toillet and the rest of the bathroom are in separate rooms meaning that if you go to the toillet you have to wash your hands in the other bathroom but only after you pass through the bedroom I ask for another room and i received one only the next morning after one unpleasant discussion with the male receptionist who tried to convince me an Eastern Europe doctor that this bathroom is something very common for their country and also hygienic This is unacceptable for a four star hotel in Wien , Excellent location near tram and subway station Good breakfast althought the same every day Excellent beds and pillows The courtyard view rooms are really quiet 
511428,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Personally we would have preferred a walk in shower to a bath but this is only because we find it difficult to get out of a bath The convenient position of the hotel also means that there is quite a bit of traffic noise , The breakfast was really very good and varied the Kranzkuchen was very special 
511429,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Just one unusual for this hotel drawback I found a peanut and some hypertension tablets under my bed , I arrived quite early in the morning and was checked in immediately despite the early arrival into a better room than the one I had reserved This was a wonderful surprise the staff certainly know how to make hotel guests happy 
511430,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Not enough tourist brochures at front desk Air con was minimal showers excellent quality douches View up on floor 7 was awful but room quiet , Breakfasts were hearty and flavorful fruits to take along for the day quality jams and cold cuts Hotel staff polite and friendly at this traditional high rise hotel Very busy district just south of main drags of Innerer Stadt Lots of fast foodies here Half a mile away on same street is a Gelato bar 
511431,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room had no air conditioning and weather was hot We did have a fan Room was smaller than expected , There is easy access to the transport system Underground system is only 5mns away on one side of hotel and trams run regularly on the other side of hotel linking up with a major bus tram system at the front of the Opera House Staff were extremely helpful 
511432,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing, Good Location walking distance to centre and excellent public transport very Clean large room nicely furnished Good breakfast Staff very pleasant and helpful Very happy to recommend and would use again
511433,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room very small No ventilation in the bathroom and toilet No air conditioning and unpleasant when the weather is hot No toiletries In the bathroom , Breakfast nice although staff need to be more organized Smile on their faces would be nice 
511434,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Very noisy the noise of tram right next to the room woke me up every 10 minutes or so We asked for a quiet room and got the room facing the street so I think other rooms are even worse No airconditioner It was the end of August and still very hot throughout the night , breakfast
511435,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No AC not a problem if the temperature outside below 28 C and cool at night Carpet is worned The bathroom equipment is cheap not for 4 star hotel , Location Staff and breakfast 
511436,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There is no air conditioning in the room so we have to open the window during night This allowed traffic noise to disturb our sleep The window faces quiet street but is very close to busy road , Excellent location Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice 
511437,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing to mention , Excellent hotel within easy 10 minute walk to the very center of Vienna Spacious and comfortable room the bed was super nice Large bathroom Cleaned and resupplied daily Breakfast was amazing rich selection and great variety to start a day Great thanks to all the staff we had a very pleasant stay 
511438,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air condition in the rooms and the electric fan was not enough to ease our very hot first night stay in spite of being one family our three rooms were separated in different floors , Location is great just a few minutes walk to Nachmarket and city center The breakfast has a lot of varieties to meet all tastes and the food was very delicious the hotel is very clean and has a good restricted non smoking policy
511439,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing to complain about , Lavish breakfast the breakfast room was opened for us a bit earlier as our check out was before the normal opening Very helpful 24 hour front desk Excellent location 
511440,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Location was ok but nor perfect rooms didn t had AC and the street was quite noisy to keep windows open Restaurant was closed At the breakfast croissants were finished and the sparkling wine was flat already but they had it Rooms were quite ok but there was for example old bag of chips under the bed , Breakfats was OK rooms were quite clean and staff was helpful and friendly Tram stop was really near to hotel 
511441,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Only the fact that there is NO Air Con although Fan in the room but doesn t really suffice specially when in the height of Summer had to leave Windows open all night which meant it was rather noisy , Welcoming Smiley Staff FAB breakfast selection excellent quality Very close walking distance to Opera City Various Trams practically right outside Hotel even the Blue Tram to Baden 
511442,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Noise from the nearby trams but they don t run throughout the night and there is no air con it was mid to late 20 s Celsius and we were ok but any hotter would be difficult , Good choice of food at breakfast lovely friendly staff nice clean room 
511443,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air conditioner Luckily the weather was not that hot I feel sorry for them who have to be there with 30 degrees outside , Breakfast was excellent Room was quiet Good location 
511444,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, there s no Air cond in the rooms and that is a huge downfall for 4 stars hotel they were provided a fan but that s not the same thing , We like the premises very much with typical Vienna patina in every corner and the breakfast is OMG we enjoyed glass of champagne every morning that was really a clever move to serve champagne with that meal 
511445,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Little remark Air conditioning in the room could be better however mechanical equivement was available and has fitted us really well , Vert clean room very polite and obliging staff perfect breakfast food very good location The price is reasonable
511446,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing, I loved the old world feeling of this hotel The monogrammed towels were gorgeous Staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was excellent even sparkling white wine for those that want a champagne type breakfast 
511447,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There was no air conditioning I booked a double and it was two twin beds put together I might have just as well booked and paid for a single , The breakfast was good but the plates were very small like they didn t want you to eat too much 
511448,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The street view was a bit noisy which made it problematic during our summer visit since there is no air conditioning however it did not prevent us from getting a good nights sleep , The staff is wonderful and speaks very good English Location is great just a 3 block walk to the Night Market and a 10 minute walk to the city center Best of all the included breakfast is amazing eggs meats fruit bread and rolls cereals yogurts pastries coffee tea juice and much more 
511449,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Probably a bit noisy at night because of the trams when you open window , Location is great just next to N1 tram stop which is going to the Opera Rathaus even to the Hundertwasserhaus Also you can get to the Opera on foot Very easy just straight walk It will take some 10 minutes Great breakfast polite staff 
511450,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, It was a pity that a single room does not have a bathtub, The breakfast is delicious and varied It is excellent for starting The room is a peace of beauty I like my stay in the hotel every time
511451,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, At 4 hotel there is no air conditioning Durnig my stay in Vienna there was temp about 34 C No possibility to get to sleep and rest after hot day in small airless room It was horror , Nothing special
511452,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No a c , Location is very good the metro station is within 5 minutes walk We were able to walk to the touristic areas as well There were no noises at night The room was clean and comfortable However it was very hot and keep in mind that there is no a c Breakfast was suprisingly very good If the price is good donot hesitate to book 
511453,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The weather was hot and the hotel has no air conditioner Having had a fan was good but it was not enough for the hot weather when we were there We booked a Courtyard view room and we paid extra for it and it turns out the room overlooks literally a tin roof no view of any kind at all and when we mentioned this the first time to the night shift receptionist he told us we need to talk to his colleagues in the morning When we mentioned it again while paying for our stay at check out they said that what we had was in fact the Courtyard view In my opinion this is a rip off and a big fail on their part , The breakfast has a good variety and the restaurant is spacious The bed and pillow are comfy and the bathroom and shower are well maintained and clean The water pressure was excellent 
511454,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Not a thing , Everything at this hotel was brilliant it has now joined the list as one of our favourite hotels The hotel itself has a very interesting history The staff were excellent from check in to breakfast to servicing the room We had a lovely comfortable and spacious room at the back of the hotel so nice and quiet The hotel is about 15 mins walk from the centre very close There are plenty of lovely restaurants around if you d like to eat locally Lots of shops and supermarkets too if you want to pick up snacks Breakfast was excellent with a great variety of fresh food My favourite thing was the fact that if you wanted you could have a tea and coffee making facilities tray brought to your room I was disappointed as an Irish tea drinker not to find one when I arrived but on reading the Guest Information found out that I could ask for one Happy caffeine days 
511455,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The first night horrible No A C and street noises when we asked for a quiet room and had paid six months before our 7 nights stay Room changed the next morning , Perfect location Room and bathroom very comfotable
511456,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The only thing that could be improved upon is the air conditioning Ordinarily I expect this would not be a problem but the weather was particularly hot and my room had no form of air conditioning only an electric fan not particularly effective , The breakfast was excellent with a good amount of choice The staff were very attentive and helpful and could not do enough for me The hotel is only 15 mins from the Staatsoper and there is plenty of public transport in the vicinity 
511457,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The staff was friendly but we pre booked a car park for two nights which we ended up not needing and we were disappointed they werent able to refund us at all They didn t offer any type of compensation for this out of pocket payment we couldn t get back which was very disappointing to us Even a small discount on the restaurant or something little would ve been nice for that money we spent and weren t able to get back The room is also incredibly hot at night to be expected for July when we stayed but no AC is something to be aware of and the fan in the room wasn t super helpful , The breakfast selection is incredible with our new favorite Nutella filled croissants Location is within walking distance from the Vienna state opera house but a little further from other sites 
511458,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air condition in the room was big disapointment as it was 33 degrees un Vienna Hotel with 4 stars should have air condition as basic standard , Good breakfast 
511459,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I was told there was a shuttle to the hotel from the airport Could not find it Was told I could get there by train but there was nobody to talk to and find out which one Took several hours to get to the hotel after arriving , The staff were incredibly good and so helpful I had to get up very early the next morning to catch a flight At 0330 I was in the lobby trying to keep my eyes open when the gentleman behind the desk took one look at me and asked if I would like a cup of coffee but thinking I needed at least a dozen cups He went and made me coffee and served it to me in the lobby with that wonderful Austrian graciousness The room was perfect Lovely hotel 
511460,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The crunchy sound of the floor and location of sockets can be improved , I love their chocolate croissants it s quite difficult to eat them without leaking out the filling x Staffs are willing to help and hotel locates at great location close to Karlsplatz which serves as the intersection of three metro lines 
511461,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We didn t check that there is no air conditioning in this hotel It was really warm when we were in Vienna so our stay was rather uncomfortable There was a ceiling fan though it didn t help much We opened the window but there was much noise outside , Staffs were friendly Breakfast was awesome 
511462,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We had a room on the fourth floor with no aircon and only a very small and old fashioned fan available with temperatures over 30 we could hardly sleep at night The toiletries consisted of a small bar of soap for the two of us and liquid soap shampoo in the shower the former wasn t replaced with a new one and the latter run out and wasn t filled up when the room was redone after the first night , Breakfast was amazing Good location nice room 
511463,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, None, I liked the location of this hotel because the venue was very near The breakfast was good serving a variety of hot foods and some dessert as well The rate was also affordable a value for money 
511464,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No air conditioning in July there is a fan but it s hard to sleep with a choice of heat or fan noise , Excellent breakfast buffet close to TU Wien 15 min walk to town
511465,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There is a ventilator instead of air conditioner consiquently there was stiflingly hot in the room The room was too small , Great breakfast with good cheese omelet sausages lots of bread nuts and so on Friendly staff Location is good in two stops to opera
511466,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There is no air conditioning and it was 90 degrees outside and in , Very nice staff willing to speak English for us Also the complementary breakfast was lovely A very quaint and elegant stay 
511467,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room was noisy due to the its location so we had to close the windows but unfortunately there was no air condition , Clean hotel Good breakfast Hospitality of the stuff You can barrow an umbrella from the reception 
511468,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, There is no air conditioning in the room just fan When opening the window the noice of the street is irritiated me , Room is big and clean and breakfast is better than I expected Staff is helpful and polite 
511469,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No a c and slightly stuffy in the summer nothing critical though , Amazing location 10 15 min on foot to the Opera or Naschmarkt Mariahilfer Stra e in either direction good public transport Taubstummengasse metro within 5 min walk tram in 3 mins walk lavish breakfast although gets a bit boring on the 4 5 day of one s stay friendly and accommodating staff lovely interior incredible price quality ratio
511470,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, It was very warm while we were there and not having air conditioning other than a couple of fans made our stay a little less enjoyable , Location was very good and room was very clean Staff were quite friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good Free WiFi was a plus 
511471,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing, Our room was special located at the corner breakfast was fabulous the hotel is very well located and it was very flexible with the check out time
511472,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The furniture is a bit shabby some renovation could be used The bathroom is quite small , A very nice hotel situated just in the city center 3 min walk to a metro station We had a queen room it was spacious enough clean bed was comfy Breakfast was really good fresh diverse and delicious Staff is friendly and helpful 
511473,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, N a, The breakfasts I had here were some of the best I had in Austria I looked forward to starting my days within the comfort of the dining room cared for by the attentive staff Thank you
511474,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The room got quite hot at night as it was heading towards 26 c during the day As it s a City Centre there is always going to be traffic noise from the street below so leaving the window open could get noisy There was a fan in the room but no air con, The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful every time we spoke to them
511475,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Attitude of waiter at breakfast One waiter quite rude The other one very helpful , Restaurant food was very good and staff were efficient and friendly 
511476,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Nice location just outside the tourist spot with tram stop and metro station within 5 minutes walk Very friendly staff I would recommend to stay here while you are in Vienna 
511477,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, When I arrived in the room and wanted to take some mineral water from the minibar I noticed that it contained an open half empty bottle which must have been left by previous guests I reported this to the reception Despite reporting it at check out I was presented with a bill for THREE bottles instead of one plus a charge for an adapter that I had never ordered This was quickly taken off the bill but had I not checked the bill I would have been over charged by 30 euros This has never happened before at this hotel I have stayed here many times , Very quiet and cosy hotel Wonderful staircase like going back a hundred years in time I always like returning to this hotel 
511478,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room very compact due to choice of furniture bath very small and oddly uncomfortable due to design , Great choice at breakfast healthy and fresh Staff helpful and friendly very welcoming 
511479,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, It would have been better if the room had an AC and an ironing board , The room was always clean very comfortable beds but would have preferred a nice bed for two people rather than two single beds put together as I had already mentioned that we were a couple so that was not as much appreciated but overall it was good and the staff was great 
511480,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, No local air condition in the room at least we didn t have any so in case hot weather might be uncomfortable , Good value for money located only in 10 12 mins on foot from opera house grocery just round the corner 
511481,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The single rooms are too small The bed is very small The cleaning staff housekeeping starts at 06 00 in the corridors with the vacuum cleaner it happened every morning during my stay , Breakfast was perfect The location was optimal
511482,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Really minuscule single room Old furniture might be quite tough to operate Lack of an iron in the room Thin walls I could hear the person talking in the room nearby , Perfect location stylish design of an end of the 19th century hotel Great friendly staff ready to help Decent continental breakfast 
511483,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, very noisy from endless trams passing including at night In the bathroom the shower was not working very well and the bath water took ages to empty bath, The room was good the beds confortable and everything spotlessly clean 
511484,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Minor issue for the three days of my stay they were working to changing the hotel signs there were dangling wires over the entrance that were not very encouraging , Almost everything was perfect 
511485,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, For its price I d expected room service and the rooms to be little more luxurious , Had quite a nice brekkie spread and the restaurant at the hotel was quite good The view from the room was quite gorgeous too
511486,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, My room was situated right where one arrives on the floor via the stairs Anytime people who were talking came up the stairs I could hear them rather clearly Not all that bad but personally I do most definitely prefer absolute peace and silence , The staff was very friendly typical old school Viennese style I felt Breakfast buffet was very good Got a great deal here on booking com Not sure how I would ve felt about the experience if I d paid full price 
511487,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing It was a wonderful stay , The breakfast was excellent with the variety and display a feast for the eyes the tummy Staff were very attentive professional They moved about the room quietly clearing resetting tables with a minimum of fuss Some hotel staff in other hotels seem oblivious to the noise they make when collecting dishes setting tables The ambience of the dining room was lovely Reception staff were also very helpful friendly 
511488,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Nothing , Enjoyed my stay Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was great location was good being just a short walk from the underground and the centre 
511489,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We had a room at the front of the hotel and couldn t sleep for the first two nights as a tram passed every minute until very late We asked if we could move to the back of the hotel Yes we could for another E10 a night to a much smaller room which we had to take them up on if we were to sleep for another 5 nights The hotel takes about 160 guests yet the breakfast room holds about 30 During busy periods the overflow finishes up in the bar evening restaurant We ate there one evening and found the food poor and expensive There are a lot of excellent restaurants nearby , It was less than 15 minutes walk to the main part of the city 
511490,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, If you don t want to pay for the metro you have to walk a bit everywhere The restaurant is closed Sunday evenings, Very pittoresque place good breakfast it s not in the middle of the attractions but it s very close 20 minute walk to everywhere has a pond with a turtle
511491,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Staff at reception not the most welcoming at arrival Questions or wishes during stay could have been handled a little more proactively Wirtschaft nice but with limited opening hours Not suitable for a last social moment before sleep , nice room extensive breakfast nice location near karlsplatz and nashmarkt

511508,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Our room was next to the main road which has the tram and it was really loud along with the traffic So if you are a light sleeper make sure you request a room change , Location is really good Easy walk to the tram underground 30 minutes to the palace by train Close to different amenities Breakfast is good Lot of different options Pastries bread cheese hams fruit etc 
511509,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, The music at breakfast very modern Classical music would complement the hotel style better , Wonderful atmosphere in the hotel it feels like going back in time to old Vienna Comfortable bed quiet room Grand staircase and live turtle in a small pond near the reception add to the atmosphere 
511510,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Room bathroom were small but perfectly OK Not so impressed by attitude of staff in the restaurant in the evening although the food was good Room was hot so we opened the window which was fine for us but this was February not sure how it would be in the summer it also opens to busy main road , Welcoming staff on reception comfortable room but small Nice breakfast Have noted a few things that might bother others but we were fine 
511511,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, I had a pleasant one night stay at the hotel which offers the necessary basic amenities good sized clean rooms for a very reasonable price I would be happy to return for another short stay 
511512,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, Vintage feel specially the lift Courteous staff Short walk to a metro which in turn is a few stops away from city center and to the central train station too Electric tram runs outside the hotel which goes to the vienna city center too 
511513,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, inside the hotel the air was a little dry although the temperature was not very high In particular the air in the room was dry , very nice and clean room comfortable bathroom and a large and useful accessories Close to the center Excellent location and location very good breakfast
511514,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer,No Negative, The breakfast is excellent Location is excellent and near a tube station Only a few stops to most places The area was quiet and safe at night Price was fair and will give you a discount on your next visit 
511515,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Curtains that closed over the windows rather than net curtains and proper double duvets rather than two singles for a double bed a common problem in Europe , Breakfasts were great lots of choice maybe too much choice 
511516,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, I haven t noticed any discomforting things , The staff was extremely helpful When at the arrival I was assigned a room that did not fully correspond to what I was let to believe it would be when booking it online the hotel staff changed my room to one closer to my expectations 
511517,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, , Everything was perfect Hotel Erzherzog Rainer is one of the most charming hotels in Vienna I stayed in I liked my stay there very much We could walk to the centre The breakfast was abundant 
511518,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, We had the do not service disturb on the door but notice that when we got back to our room there was something that had been placed on our table which was not there prior A little sketchy but not too big of a deal , Staff was super friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and was in a fantastic location The breakfast was awesome as well Well worth it 
511519,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Breakfasts used to be much better previously Bathroom was dark and the main disadvantage of our room was a poor soundproofing , The Hotel has a nice location friendly stuff and a very nice austrian cuisine restaurant 
511520,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, the room was very very small had strange smell due to bad ventilation Had to keep the window open to fix it in general hotel has been very nice long time ago It really needs a refurbishment , good location nice breakfast
511521,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Tram pass nearby and can be a little noisy Now view from windows but it is an old city and old location , Comfortable facilities Walking distance to town and especially State Theater 
511522,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, Our room had a persistent and heavy smell to it it didn t smell dirty or anything rather smelt like acrylic paint though I don t think any work was done recently Even with the window open it was a bit annoying but nothing too bad to complain about The floor tiles in the bathroom were quite dated and felt cheap That s not nit picking rather something the hotel management might want to consider if they re reading this , This hotel has a really great location and is very well connected the closest metro stop is 5 minutes walking distance We actually walked to Belvedere which is about 20 minutes away So if you re in Vienna for sightseeing I can really recommend it much less noise and you re two metro stops away from Stephanplatz The staff was cordial professional and made us feel welcome at all times Keep in mind that it s an old school hotel even the doors open with old fashioned key forget magnetic cards So if you re into modern hotels it s not a place for you With that said it s been renovated quite successfully and overall was very clean WiFi was free and quite stable and fast compared with what you usually get Breakfast was plentiful and comfortable Finally it s absolute value for money PS I won t list as a con but keep in mind that the hotel doesn t have A C which may be a problem if you re visiting during the hot summer months 
511523,Hotel Erzherzog Rainer, In general we do not like high suspension mattresses as if one moves on the bed the other one will wake up for sure This generally applies to all hotels not specific to this even though I always write it as a con so maybe one day it will change , Really everything was nice and fine
