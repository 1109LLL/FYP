191756,The Curtain, As we travelled by underground was a bit of a walk from station area could be nicer but once your inside your it worth it, Lovely staff bed was so comfortable could of stayed longer 
191757,The Curtain, No notes Although personally I would have prefered a proper door on the bathroom rather than a sliding one , Gorgeous hotel Has an exclusive feel my husband and I were made to feel important as soon as we came in The concierge Andrew could not be more helpful The staff in the rooftop resturant were also friendly and attentive Although we didnt use it the swimming pool was a nice touch The hotel bedroom was well set out it was our anniversary and we were left some lovely sweets and a card which was very thoughtful The comfortable beds huge tv large bathroom and shower come steam room cool retro touches all added to the mood of the place We danced the night away in the live music room For a new hotel The Curtain really surpassed my expectations and deserves every one of its 5 stars 
191758,The Curtain,No Negative, Flexible check in and out complimentary drinks super friendly staff are professional but really down to earth made us feel comfortable in a posh but laid back place Everything about this place is 
191759,The Curtain,No Negative, Beautifully furnished the bathroom was fantastic Room a little small but well thought out Food at the roof top bar was scrummy The bar atmosphere at Red Rooster was great 
191760,The Curtain, The staff didn t really know what they were doing as it was a new hotel I can understand this The rooms are incredibly small and impractical For example the basin is so big but there is no benchspace to put your toiletries and there is no door on the toilet There is a door to the bathroom but it doesn t go fully to the ground which means the toilet lacks privacy The food from the rooftop restaurant was average One of the lifts wasn t working for our entire stay , The hotel is perfectly located in Shoreditch The rooftop terrace is a great place to have a drink 
191761,The Curtain, Images used on website are the development plans for the hotel the reality is far from impressive The pool is no bigger than a bath a kin size suite consists of a double bed in a bow room in which you have to walk through the curtains to get around the bed and a TV inconveniently stashed in the corner which is also becomes an obstacle you have get around in order to reach the side of the bed One in which i failed at numerous times meaning i had one sore head in the morning To make things better there is a smoke alarm placed in every room understandably However it lets you know via a bright green light that fills the tiny box room every 5 seconds leaving you with no hope of a peaceful sleep , nice stylish environment
191762,The Curtain, Attention all hotels in the world Please add some hooks on the walls, Amazing pool on the rooftop restaurant Great breakfast expensive though The best bed we ever had Big room Extremely good organic chocolate in the minibar
191763,The Curtain, Can t think of anything , Super comfortable bed Loved the quirky mini marshal music speaker and drinks trolley in room The decor was very cool and the bathroom was big and lovely with a fantastic steam and waterfall shower The room was also really quiet so no problem sleeping 
191764,The Curtain, Hotel room a bit noisy at night due to bar next door Didn t matter to us as we were our anyway , Really modern and quirky hotel Great attention to detail in rooms Roof top bar restaurant great bonus
191765,The Curtain, Nothing, Everything massive bed huge tv lovely bathroom the roof top resturant and pool were amazing made us feel like we were in another country the staff were so friendly lots of choice with the minibar and only a few min walk to 2 dif tube stations Lovely hotel I ll deffo be back 
191766,The Curtain,No Negative, An all round brilliant hotel It is a cool place with a good vibe The restaurant served the best burger I have ever eaten The staff were amazing we d like to particularly thank the general manager at the Lido he went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience 
191767,The Curtain,No Negative, Amazing new hotel Few teething problems but the staff went out of their way to find solutions quickly Jesus at the concierge desk deserves a special mention for his kindness Lovely rooms cocktails rooftop bar and breakfast recommended
191768,The Curtain, One lift out of order spa not open yet bar felt disconnected from the vibe in the hotel, All the staff went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay
191769,The Curtain, The painful experience started with charging full 3 nights GBP1000 for my business partner room despite it was cancelled more than 2 days before check in date due to emergency trip cancellation death in the family Front desk instead of finding a solution to refund the unjustified room charged she put the blame on booking com and told me its there policy which doesn t make sense because Booking com is an e commerce intermediary platform and they don t collect room charges for themselves That was my response then the front desk lady she promised to discuss this matter with higher management and get back to me which never happened No one even bothered to contact me about the subject very bad I felt like been fooled When I checked in my room I discovered a serious security defect in the balcony door it can t close from inside the fixed key is misplaced outside the balcony door and balcony is shared with other rooms so its an easy access from the outside Of course I informed the front desk and the show started each personnel started to throw the blame on somebody else security contractors house keeping quality check it was a nightmare eventually I proposed a solution for them by removing the fixed key from outside the door which ultimately was done On different subject room service I used to leave my room very early for meetings and came back after 5 PM surprisingly my room wasn t serviced so I had to call the housekeeping to make up my room Funny enough on my last day was the weekend the housekeeping came at 8 AM and woke me up despite the sign of do not disturb was hanging outside my door as usual lots of apologies Also the room itself is nicely designed but poorly engineered the bathroom lights switch misplaced by the entrance of the room so if you need to switch ON the lights in the bathroom you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the room , new clean hotel
191770,The Curtain, There was a small surprise in the charges, It s a nice choice if you stay near Hackney it s not close to old downtown but Underground is less than 19 minutes away Nice rooms 
191771,The Curtain, A lot of customer service issues still getting worked out It s a new place but I had a very frustrating experience I was so happy with my stay until day 2 I was originally supposed to stay only one night but decided to extend When I spoke to the front desk that first evening about it he told me no problem and that they would give me the same rate as the first night from Booking com He also didn t let me know that they were short on rooms I should have probably just extended then but i didn t know if I was able to change my train yet When I returned the following morning I was told by the front desk manager a curt unfriendly woman kind of surprised she s in customer service at such a nice hotel that they had no rooms However then after telling me they were full she said she found one but was raising the rate 100 I was in a desperate situation at that point so I had to accept but the fact that she didn t honor the rate I was promised by another front desk person was incredibly bad customer service and internal communication , The rooms were very well equipped and comfortable The hotel itself had a good design and the rooftop was great
