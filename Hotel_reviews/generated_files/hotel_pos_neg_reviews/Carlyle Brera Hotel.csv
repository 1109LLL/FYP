304433,Carlyle Brera Hotel, Breakfast was very mediocre Although the selection was good the quality of cheese eggs and cold cuts was very poor No room service A 4 star hotel should have some room service even if only a limited menu though I do understand that guests would prefer to go out dinning in Milan , Location was excellent and staff helpful Rooms are too gloomy More lighting would be helpful
304434,Carlyle Brera Hotel,No Negative, The location is the best thing Right outside the metro And you have those bikemi cycle stand if you would rather cycle through the city Please mind single room is literally for single person rather small But over all served the purpose well
