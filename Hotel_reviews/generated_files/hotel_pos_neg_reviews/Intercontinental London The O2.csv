14829,Intercontinental London The O2, Being over charged and them telling me I wasn t telling the truth then rang my bank and they said 2 different payments have been taken out one for the room rate 225 and then an extra 325 Then suddenly they said it s come up on there system saying they charged me twice And all they could off what 25 of what a joke Very disappointed,No Positive
14830,Intercontinental London The O2, Prices did seem a bit high a kitkat from the mini bar at 3 50 seemed rather excessive , The whole experience was fab and would certainly want to stay again The staff inparticular were informative and very friendly 
14831,Intercontinental London The O2, Small issue with some staff having very poor English Check In sent us to the wrong room trip back to reception but very helpful and resolved quickly Food and drink is very expensive in the hotel but there are options for cheaper eating next door at the O2 if hotel not in your price range , Brilliant location right next to 02 View from standard double fantastic Breakfast expensive but prepaid and was really worth it very high quality and plenty to choose from Room was well insulated and quiet even though in flight path for city airport Room and bed super comfortable Very clean Staff were very helpful This was an anniversary special night away and was really worth it We deliberately went on a night no concert on at the 02 Spa pool lovely and included in room price Highly recommend and we will save up to go again next year 
14832,Intercontinental London The O2, The direction indicator to the O2 was not clear it would have been better on the door leading to the venue rather than on the garage notice which made it look as if the entrance was through the garage , The staff were very caring and did everything to please They remembered our preferences for food and were always friendly and polite and made us feel wanted 
14833,Intercontinental London The O2, We ordered tea in the morning and was disappointed with the operation of it We asked for a large pot with at least 4 servings We only got 1 cup and saucer lucky there was a mug in the room but we just managed to squeeze out 2 cups of tea All for 12 , The room was amazing We were given an upgrade so it was a real treat The view from the windows was lovely We decided to stay in the hotel restaurant to eat before going into the O2 for a concert Again that was an excellent choice The food was lovely i would certainly stay there again if i had a concert to go to 
14834,Intercontinental London The O2, Loved all of it , This is the best hotel we ve ever stayed at Staff were friendly and so very helpful The hotel was clean The bedrooms beautiful The bathroom huge Highly recommended 
14835,Intercontinental London The O2, Bit out of the way but only short tube ride to central London, Very very comfy bed Marvellous bathroom Spotlessly clean Perfect location for O2 arena
14836,Intercontinental London The O2, The room for the price paid was small to have a King size bed I use intercontinental Hotel for my leisure and business travels a lot in the US thought I would get a similar sized room , Excellent layout of the room and the bathroom facilities size
14837,Intercontinental London The O2, Maybe the bathroom lighting could have been better but nothing could really detract from how great this hotel is , Our room was beautiful with an amazing nighttime view across the river 13th floor Staff were friendly and helpful and the location was absolutely perfect for the O2
14838,Intercontinental London The O2, 1 member of staff up in the 18th floor bar very rude made me and my lovely wife feel like we were not good enough to be there so spoilt our 25th wedding anniversary treat after a great day and night before hand , Fantastic for 02 the views of knight outstanding 
14839,Intercontinental London The O2, I always usually need a twin room and even though I books a twin I am never down for a twin when I arrive maybe I am doing something wrong I was upgraded to a suite this time which was fabulous The whole set up is quality and I stay here every time I go to a concert at the 02, Breakfast excellent I have stayed in other 5 6 star hotels in London and paid more but this was the best I have seen excellent selection and beautifuly presented
14840,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We found the hotel to be modern and well maintained We were upgrade to a suite and the room was of a really good size The view from the room was wonderful as we had the O2 on one side and canary wharf on the other The views from the 18 bar are amazing at night so well worth a visit
14841,Intercontinental London The O2, The room service menu was not great there was not much for people who eat halal I suggest that there should be more on the halal and vegetarian options also more standard foods e g More options for burgers etc, Loved the room it was very clean The breakfast was great and better than most hotels in London 10 10 for the breakfast 
14842,Intercontinental London The O2, The broadband connection wasn t too good, The room was fantastic very modern and very neat and clean it had everything you would need for an hotel 
14843,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff excellent facilities and flawless service The room was incredibly well equipped and maintained to nothing less than an immaculate standard I will certainly be staying here again 
14844,Intercontinental London The O2, The restaurant staff were lovely but the service was incredibly slow and some of the food was cold even though the restaurant wasn t at all busy They were very apologetic , Excellent location for the O2 arena Gorgeous hotel 
14845,Intercontinental London The O2, The walking path between N Greenwich tube station and the hotel was not the safest and I would not feel comfortable walking alone there in the dark as no one would be around to hear or help if something bad were to happen It is also not straightforward to get to the ExCeL or landmarks , It was very quiet and the breakfast was very nice It was also close to the O2 for non hotel food options 
14846,Intercontinental London The O2, The concierge was very friendly and professional and gave a very warm welcome to our hotel , Staff were extremely good I was there with my 9 year daughter on my own travelling from Ireland to the celine dion concert the staff were very good to her Aisling
14847,Intercontinental London The O2, The only things I can comment on are the coffee maker in the room didn t seem to work even though I got power to it not certain why Swimming pool was too busy on the Sunday morning when I went down to try it but I guess its because it is popular 1000am , Vidas the concierge had his first day back at work after returning home He was very helpful in attending to hiding a cake with the cafe patisserie staff Olga and her team for it to be presented to my son on the terrace later on Additionally the requests I asked for when I made the booking with booking com were attended to by the hotel ie a room with a river view and other thoughtfulness made my son s 30th birthday a memorable one Nuria checked us into the room very attentively My wife thought the tea served on the g f terrace was exceptional quality The champagne in the sky bar we had later on was very good 
14848,Intercontinental London The O2, Bar was ordinary for a hotel of this calibre Waited ages to be served to be charged crazy price for glass on wine 20 pound each After waiting 20 mins in line to be served Hotel tried to fix but too little too late , Huge room
14849,Intercontinental London The O2, Slow service in the bar on floor 18 but the staff did try there hardest to accomodate our requests, beautiful bathroom really comfy bed views over the Thames drinks in both bars with magnificent views great breakfast
14850,Intercontinental London The O2, Service at the bar late evening not the best No initial acknowledgement and slow service Could be improved , The bed and sofa bed in the suite were excellent very comfortable Bathrooms stunning Reception staff concierge and doormen were superb 
14851,Intercontinental London The O2, Spa treatments were booked up so we wasn t able to receive any treatments Also the mini fridge in our room was locked so we was unable to put drinks we brought from outside inside the fridge , The bed was really comfortable facilities was great Location was perfect Enjoyed our weekend 
14852,Intercontinental London The O2, Spa treatments and food in the restaurant were a little pricey But to be expected since it s in a nice area of London and a very nice hotel Did want to book the treatments but had a busy weekend planned may have booked it if I stayed for another night , Loved the sky bar and the buffet breakfast Incredible views from room and around the hotel Had an early check in and late check out staff were very accommodating Spa facilitates were also great too 
14853,Intercontinental London The O2, It was a shame the bar upstairs wasn t open in the afternoon, This hotel is amazing friendly staff comfortable and beautiful rooms amazing view prefect location 
14854,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, This hotel is amazing one of if not THE best hotel I have ever stayed in The rooms are immaculate the facilities are top notch the breakfast is delicious and the staff cannot do enough for you I would love to stay in this hotel whenever I visit London 
14855,Intercontinental London The O2, Thought the mini bar prices were very expensive , Only stayed for one night so can only rate the room as didn t use any of the facilities Thought it was lovely and the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in Also the pillows were so comfortable that I had a look at the make of them and am going to order some for ourselves 
14856,Intercontinental London The O2, Being old fashioned I like written information on the hotel in the room Would have liked to know in advance how to work the lights and times the pool opened , The best thing was the friendliness of the staff and willingness to help The pool in the spa was clean and pleasant 
14857,Intercontinental London The O2, Staff let this hotel down was given no information at all upon check in for facilities bars restaurants etc We was told we could order pizza at rooftop bar but then staff up ther said no we couldnt We waited 1 hour just for some chicken skewers When only hand full of ppl in ther , Beautiful clean hotel lovely pool
14858,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing we loved everything , Friendly helpful staff lovely clean and comfortable hotel our bedroom was also clean and comfortable with a good view of the River Thames and the O2 Arena breakfast was very good with a large selection to choose from only a very short walk to the O2 Arena being next door to it and with it s own walk way as well you re there in only a few minutes we really enjoyed staying here and will definitely stay here again in the future when going to an event at the arena 
14859,Intercontinental London The O2, found the parking prices a little misleading and a misleading quote on wine tray charge think it almost shows that its misleading so you don t realise your being charged which is a shame like making sure you read the small print Very boldly says free valet parking then further down car parking payable at about 24 per day but for a not seasoned traveller I just read free parking maybe have the price and free valet parking in the same section The wine in the room that is outside of the fridge you could wonder if it was a small free bottle of wine the business card with it shows something free but when reading properly its free tray charge should you want a different bottle of wine, Beds were so comfortable
14860,Intercontinental London The O2, Room cleanliness needs a little attention but nothing to be too concerned about I don t like smudges on glass and mirrors Also MORE IMPORTANTLY bar staff need to be trained on how to serve clients in order of arrival , Room view and comfy beds
14861,Intercontinental London The O2, GBP 59 per person for Sunday brunch Rooms overall a bit pricey even for London Unattractive long walk from North Greenwich tube station Nearby shops and restaurants cater to the O2 crowd not in keeping with the quality of the hotel These remarks concern the general ambience of the neighbourhood not of course the responsibility of the hotel itself , Room and bathroom clean and with luxury fittings and furnishings Floor to ceiling windows Good blackout curtains Large comfortable bed Quiet Extremely friendly and helpful staff 
14862,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Everything was just perfect my doughter and I were seeing Take That at the O2 so it made sense to use this accommodation as previously we stayed at accommodation a little further away definately stay here again Just to add we even had a room upgrade with lovely views of the river 
14863,Intercontinental London The O2, Honestly i think everything was good Sorry can t help you in that , I like everything the food the locaci n but the kindness and consideration of the personal with my one year old daughter was very nice Thank you so much 
14864,Intercontinental London The O2, Price hike , A truly excellent hotel and a wonderful place to stay with great facilities BUT the hotel had quite clearly hiked up the prices for the event which I was attending across the river at the Excel not happy with that at all 
14865,Intercontinental London The O2, Price of drink in the bars bit pricey, Loved everything about this hotel complete luxury at great price staff very helpful excellent customer service skills facilities amazing Pool and spa deserve 5star plus Conference centre again had all you needed to continue a working schedule if required
14866,Intercontinental London The O2, The only minor fault would be the service in the eighteen sky bar Took a little while to get our drinks too , Staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived The view from our room was incredible We were attending a concert and this was the ideal hotel for location When leaving the next day we were unsure how to get back to the station we cannot fault how helpful Graham was with advising us to make the river bus He showed us on the map where to get off and was just generally a very nice helpful man Thankyou for our amazing stay x
14867,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast area could have been more luxurious It was a bit over busy and stressful Not a very calm atmosphere, The scrambled eggs were to die for at breakfast The convenience for 02 was totally incredible
14868,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, This was a very modern and high tech hotel Very comfortable bed and easy access to Greenwich and London as well The staff restaurants and bars were excellent 
14869,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing, The eggs benedict was amazing Shane in reception hes Irish and he was exceptionally nice he was so professional patient and a joy to meet a big thank you to him for making us feel so welcome and making our stay so nice Brid 2 Elaines Therese Julie and Kate
14870,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff here were most attentive and friendly The room was very clean as was the bathroom Toiletries bathing robes and slippers were provided also tea and coffee making facilities Breakfast was substantial with a selection of cereals fresh fruits hot foods cold meats and cheeses as well as a selection of breads and pastries There was also a selection of fruit juices as well as tea and coffee 
14871,Intercontinental London The O2, The towels were a little rough they need softening or newer towels , The bed was so unbelievably comfortable and there was so much choice for breakfast The hotel also did a lovely job on a surprise for my partner s birthday 
14872,Intercontinental London The O2, I was hosting a very small confidential meeting in my room and I ordered a tray of tea coffee to be delivered to the room I received a tray of coffee sachets and tea bags No extra cup , Beds were so comfortable and the pillows excellent Air conditioning and heating was easy to operate and responsive Views from the room were fantastic Staff were lovely and courteous from the maintenance men to restaurant bar staff concierge receptionist and doormen 
14873,Intercontinental London The O2, First room had no view but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 13th floor with a fabulous view, Bed was amazingly comfy and staff were great
14874,Intercontinental London The O2, Lack of information Sat Nav did not have address tried to call for directions phone rang and rang gave up Found that signage to hotel very poor Poor signage into hotel from car park Staff several times gaave us the wrong information such as quickest direction to tube Que at check in and departure with empty desks , Room and breakfast
14875,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was bit pricey as it s a one off price, It was lovely Great view over the river Easy to get to tube Will try more facilities next time
14876,Intercontinental London The O2, Check in was a little slow however I think it was just down to timing it was a little disappointing that the lobby bar with the external seating area closed at 11pm it was a beautiful evening and having just attended a concert at the O2 it would have been nice to enjoy a drink outside , Check in staff very friendly lovely room we were upgraded to a suite as our room was not ready great location for the O2
14877,Intercontinental London The O2, Service in the coffee lounge near reception We ordered scones with cream and jam we waited for almost 45 minutes and when they arrived they were inedible They had clearly been warmed through in a microwave and were of a bready texture When we mentioned this to the member of staff he just said Sorry they are made upstairs I really resented paying 18 for a terrible product which does not represent the hotel very well , great location of concert at o2
14878,Intercontinental London The O2, Room card did not work so had to go back to reception Mini bar was locked although had paid on credit card for extras Complimentary bottles of water were not there, Bed comfortable
14879,Intercontinental London The O2, Waited nearly 2 hours to get the room we booked should have been able to check in when we arrived as we arrived 3 30pm Broken ironing board had to be reported twice before it was replaced My daughter put a comment on Twitter about the service the manager rang us at 10 30pm the next day as we were climbing into bed after a busy day Offered an apology and fruit Which turned out to be 1 Apple 1 banana and some grapes which we refused Then a member of the hotel staff gave us a nice little wake up call at 3 10 am said hello Mr Hillier and put the phone down So was done deliberately , Very comfy bed and pillows Very clean If it hadn t been for poor customer service we would have enjoyed the stay 
14880,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, It was very luxurious The staff were really friendly and the door man made you feel very special Would definitely recommend it It was great location too and easy to get into London by underground 
14881,Intercontinental London The O2, Service charges in bar and prices for breakfast were a little steep considering how many restaurants do breakfast in the O2, Lovely Hotel booked to attend a concert at the O2 which would have been Ideal had the concert not been rescheduled Got a non refundable rate so couldn t cancel Hotel is lovely rooms are nice and clean with a huge bed Travel in and out of the city was easy and would definitely recommend if your attending the O2
14882,Intercontinental London The O2, Booked for a concert at the o2 but the concert got cancelled and there was no way of cancelling without full payment for the room They offered to move the room to the rescheduled concert date but I can t attend on that date and wasn t offered anything else So ended up staying here If you aren t visiting the o2 it s somewhat isolated from London if you are then it s perfect ,No Positive
14883,Intercontinental London The O2, Didn t find the food child teenage friendly and a little bit over priced, Excellent location if you are attending the O2 venue for a concert or event
14884,Intercontinental London The O2, Paying for parking after you pay a good price for the room as a guest you think it would be free as it s there car park , All was so perfect staff friendly they went out there way to help 
14885,Intercontinental London The O2, It would have been useful to have been given at check in or provided in our room more information about the hotel overall such as the Spa Restaurant s and Bar s it was a shame as we later learnt after wondering around aimlessly that the hotel had brilliant facilities but non of this information was supplied to us at all during our stay we had to discover this for ourselves Poor for a hotel of this size and hierarchy , Could not fault our room in fact we didn t want to get out of bed in the morning the bed was so comfy and the bathroom was divine Wonderful shower and separate bath with built in Bose sound system which was a delight 
14886,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Very friendly staff every member of staff I came across went out of their way to greet you no matter what they were doing Room was amazing Views from the sky bar at night are brilliant Sky bar was very busy no seats available at around 12am so we stood at the bar but as soon as a seat was available we weren t forgotten by the staff I could not fault this hotel in anyway
14887,Intercontinental London The O2, Just two capsules of coffee two others were decaff and having used those at 3 30pm i d have expected them to be replaced so we had some for the evening morning But no Would also have expected a hotel like this to change the towels in the evening too especially with temperatures in the 30s No fresh towels no turn down service , Receptionist a lovely Portuguese girl was extremely charming and helpful Everything was smart fresh and clean 
14888,Intercontinental London The O2, The breakfast price But it was still nice , The room was lovely facilities were good easy to the tube to travel around London the views were good and the staff were really helpful and nice 
14889,Intercontinental London The O2, Car park floor was filthy rough concrete and dust although being in a wheelchair noticed it more but more like a building site there are ten disabled spaces and everyone was taken by sports cars and Chelsea tractors not one of them had blue badges displayed I had to park at other end of hotel with bags by time I got to check in was rotten Not a good start and paying 24 to park is why I mentioned it , Location quality helpfulness and sky bar
14890,Intercontinental London The O2, Could ve done with some instructions re electronics in room but worked it out eventually , Staff were so friendly and attentive great customer service 
14891,Intercontinental London The O2, overall excelent service but the only thing was when we were having our breakfast the staff kept trying to clearthe plates when we had nt finished eating it happened a few times, The beds was so comfy great nights sleep the bathroom luxurious brilliant views the staff was so helpful nothing was too much trouble
14892,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, It was the ideal location for going to the Celine Dion show Easy access to O2 arena and close to city airport Great staff friendly and excellent service Room wonderfully comfortable with excellent views
14893,Intercontinental London The O2, Enjoyed every minute no complaints , The staff are very friendly and very helpful from checking in to checking out We really enjoyed our stay here with the arena so close you realise how lucky you are to be staying here 
14894,Intercontinental London The O2, No opening windows or balconies needs adding to their room description , Most things were more than excellent especially the staff who were brilliant 
14895,Intercontinental London The O2, No negatives, We were delighted with the Hotel It was exceptionally clean friendly all the staff were very friendly and helpful Mario gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an upgraded room He explained everything clearly We stayed there to go to a concert at the 02 and it couldn t have been easier It made life so much easier to walk through the walkway straight into the 02 and afterwards while everyone else were rushing to catch trains etc we ambled back to our room and the view from the front over to canary wharf was wonderful and we had a side view of the dome It was a delight We had a wonderful breakfast they had everything there you could want and nothing was too much trouble 
14896,Intercontinental London The O2, Could of had a bit more variety of food, Our room was amazing especially with the river view the spa was great and the staff were very welcoming couldn t of picked anywhere better to spend my weekend 
14897,Intercontinental London The O2, That I couldn t stay more days , The staff was extra polite the acomodations were very comfortable and exceeded our expectations Very clean hotel with a bar at the upper floor 
14898,Intercontinental London The O2, The car park charges, Perfect location for our needs as we were visiting to attend the 02 arena for a concert We were given an upgrade upon arrival and the two floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing outlook onto the river The breakfast was good enough staff very friendly the car parking charge was far too expensive for my liking but we had no choice 
14899,Intercontinental London The O2, Everything was so good , Loveley staff everyone was willing to help the doorman was a true gentleman and Simone from the reception was a wonderful guy I ll return definitely it was so clean especially for London area Wonderful view overal just a 10 10
14900,Intercontinental London The O2, Price but totally worth it, Absolutely stunning hotel would love to stay there everytime we come to London but very expensive Sky bar beautiful outlook but drinks super expensive 
14901,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing not to like, Staff location facilities Brilliant breakfast My Grandson s first London visit and concert We will remember our stay and concert forever 
14902,Intercontinental London The O2, Very expensive mini bar , Friendly staff made us feel right at home Everything was clean smart Lovely rooms very comfortable classy Great access to the O2 with no queuing Top notch 
14903,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing really, Great interior throughout room was very nice restaurant buffet breakfast was excellent cocktail bar was excellent all service was excellent 
14904,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We booked a room as we were attending a concert at the O2 The hotel is right next door to the O2 and has it s own entrance into the O2 building The staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful The room was great and the view from the window was very cool Well worth the money as avoided packed public transport before and after the show Can t wait to stay there again 
14905,Intercontinental London The O2, Constructive comment NOT a complaint Would have liked more than one breakfast tea bag as no tea pot provided More milk and a some biscuits would have been good Staying to see a concert at the 02 Arena later meal snack availability would be nice in the Bar after performance , Room was lovely and quiet great to be able to set the room temperature Bed very comfortable 
14906,Intercontinental London The O2, Air con too hot where broken in the bar but too cold in the downstairs bar where it was working, Best location for the O2 Lovely bar on the top floor with great views unfortunately the air con had broken so was a little hot for our visit Comfy beds 
14907,Intercontinental London The O2, I unfortunately left my heated brush behind but when I rang up in the afternoon they said that the room had been cleaned but nothing had been found , The bed was really comfy and I really liked the duvet 
14908,Intercontinental London The O2, Bed linen was visibly old tatty in places Bar service as opposed to table service in the Sky Bar on Sunday night then closing at 12 00 far too early for a 5 star London hotel , Excellent choices for breakfast
14909,Intercontinental London The O2, Telephoned housekeeping and asked for ice as we had champagne I was asked if small or large bucket and was told it would be sent up to our room asap One hour later it hadn t arrived so i rang again and was told it would be sent up After possibly another hour or so and we rang again The lady we spoke to who said she was from housekeeping was extremely rude denied the request had been made and that was that We never got the ice nor any other contact from housekeeping Not the treatment you would expect from this standard and priced hotel Shame that this let them down , Breakfast river view from bedroom bar and restaurant location to 02 Arena bedroom and bathroom 
14910,Intercontinental London The O2, There are certain things I would expect from a 5 star hotel For example I did not find in the room a hair dryer and neither a toilet brush Probably I could have asked for them but I expected them to be already available in the room The distance between the sink faucet and the bottom of the sink was also really small And the tea and coffee facilities could be better for example I only had decaf coffee in the room and no afternoon tea again I am sure I could have asked for them and I would have received them but this is something I expect to be available without asking in a 5 star hotel However I was really pleased by the kettle and by the brand of tea s as well as by the coffee making facility , A 5 star hotel that offers almost everything a traveller might expect The bed was comfortable the room was nice The reception staff was always ready to help Ideal for attending a concert at the O2 as it has a direct connection to the Arena and that is awesome 
14911,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The room was very comfortable spacious and well equipped The staff at check in and out were really friendly and through We stayed to see a concert at the 02 and although we had to pay extra for the hotel parking it was still really convenient It was a special treat but would do the same again if the opportunity arises 
14912,Intercontinental London The O2, Prices in the Clipper Bar ridiculous, Fabulous cuisine and service for dinner in the Peninsula restaurant Extremely comprehensive delicious breakfast buffet Private entrance to the O2 arena a big plus
14913,Intercontinental London The O2, The room had a strange smell in it when we first arrived but this soon seemed to disappear One of the bar men in the Sky Bar was a little strange , We loved the welcome that we received at the door and on reception We loved the room and the bathroom The Spa was fantastic and the Bar on the 18th floor is amazing The walkway to the O2 is a real bonus too The views from this hotel are outstanding Floor to ceiling windows in the toilets so cool Breakfast was absolutely amazing so much choice 
14914,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The hotel was ideal for the concert at the o2 as we only had a short walk to the venue Hotel reception was was a pleasant experience and Mario who checked us in was very welcoming Room had a great view gym and pool were excellent the best overnight stay we ever had and we will be returning in July 
14915,Intercontinental London The O2, The staf from the moment we got to the door reception and catering staff , The closenes to the 02 after recent avents didnt want to travel home after a concert
14916,Intercontinental London The O2, Cocktails very expensive nearly 5 service charge to bring them to you table in the sky lounge which is unecessary, Amazing place to stay very friendly staff amazing views from sky lounge
14917,Intercontinental London The O2, Availability of spa treatments no availability at all over the weekend very disappointing Service in the Clipper Bar left a lot to be desired it was slow lots of staff who seemed to be dashing around whilst achieving very little a number of disgruntled guest at the bar, The bed was very comfy Breakfast was amazing
14918,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Was not expecting such a large room for the price we paid The room was amazing and views were excellent The location was superb and prevented extra long ques to get in to the o2 We will be booking again very soon 
14919,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Best hotel I have stayed at when visiting the O2 for location and accessibility The entrance to the O2 is via a short walkway next to the reception no queuing to get in 
14920,Intercontinental London The O2, If I had to complain about anything it was that there was not enough tea bags milk or bottled water although I had a room on my own my daughter s were sharing but there was only 1 still 1 fizzy bottle I think for the price I paid there should have been a bottle each I did mention about the tea bags milk when I was checking out but forgot to say about the water We were also charged for water at the table when we had dinner something else I forgot to mention but we didn t know that we had been charged until I got the bill , The hotel was the best that I have ever stayed in The reason I booked it was because it was near enough attached to the o2 Myself my two daughter s 32 30 yrs old went to see Take That although this was our sixth time of seeing them it was still exciting to see them the show once again was fantastic after it was just a short walk to our hotel Fab u Lou s 
14921,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The room was spotless and beds and pillows megga comfy like being on a cloud the bathroom was amazing with beautiful products to use We had a swim in the lovely spotless pool The staff were lovely and so very helpful nothing was too much trouble All in all we loved our one night stay and want to go back 
14922,Intercontinental London The O2, The only thing that we could make a Critisism of and it is minor is the swimming pool could be a few degrees warmer No one was swimming in it at all , We loved everything from the minute we got out of our taxi on arrival to the minute we got back in a taxi on departure The hotel is amazing Perfect for the O2 The staff were superb and made us feel that we welcome at every available chance So much so we are booking to stay again at the end of the month 
14923,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The hotel is brilliant for getting to the o2 as it is literally a 2 minute walk away It is also very well signposted I am so pleased with this hotel I cannot fault it 
14924,Intercontinental London The O2, Was informed at reception that we had been upgraded to a river view in which we had already booked and paid for one already, The hotel is ideally located for a night at the O2 I wouldn t normally pay that much for a hotel but the location and comfort was second to none 
14925,Intercontinental London The O2, Lack of attention from staff in downstairs restaurant when we arrived who didn t notice our food had not been served them served it cold half an hour later at least No greeting or explanation or menu given at breakfast, Breakfast was amazing fresh and tasty Service and food were good for the evening meal and effort was made to right the earlier problems
14926,Intercontinental London The O2, The room service menu is very expensive and a mini fridge would be a great addition to the room , The staff views location and food where all fantastic Bar Eighteen is well worth a visit one of the best bars I ve been to The breakfast was amazing Will definitely be staying here again 
14927,Intercontinental London The O2, Lack of clarity about room type we paid extra for a river view but initial allocation had poor view room was changed to a much better one but staff mentioned upgrades several time but as far as I know that is what we paid for Booking com booking was vague about this too The so called discretionary service fee of 12 5 was not always appropriate but we did not want to make a fuss , Perfect location quiet helpful and friendly staff
14928,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing to fault , Fabulous hotel Highly recommended Staff were extremely helpful upon check in A fantastic view when entering the room on to the O2 arena Peaceful night sleep Pillows were very comfortable Breakfast was exceptional No faults Will definitely be returning 
14929,Intercontinental London The O2, Would have been good to have a meal in he hotel after the concert at the O2 but it closed orders at 9 30 so we had room service which was very prompt The queue at the sky bar was long even though the staff were flat out and made sure what they served was what you expected , We love the bedding we want some Soft light quilt The room was lovely and so clean and up to scratch We could just walk into the O2 No hassle It was great 
14930,Intercontinental London The O2, The heating was a little issue 24c we had the heating on but it took a little too long for us to feel the heat, The bed was a 10 10 Ultimate comfort spacious room lovely view Very professional staff

14941,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Great hotel if going to the O2 like us for a concert Concert to room in under Five minutes Very helpful staff good rooms and a great sky bar to visit in the evening 
14942,Intercontinental London The O2, Slow service in Clipper Bar and service charge added to an order for 2 lattes which ended up costing 11 00 Not worth the money , Lovely comfy bed Great location Close to tube and the walkway to the O2 was great Staff all very friendly Room very clean and quiet 
14943,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , The staff were fabulous Very courteous and helpful Always very cheery and making one feel at ease The rooms were very comfortable and the bars restaurants were all top quality The walkway to the O2 was a brilliant addition if going there for a concert I could not find fault with anything at this hotel 
14944,Intercontinental London The O2, I had to wait a long time to check in the person who checked me in looked like she really did not want to be there very unfriendly and did not engage with me at all or make me feel welcome The bar service in the evening was also very slow and we did not get all of the drinks we ordered , The location and the facilities 
14945,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing, The room was amazing but it was the staff on the door and at reception that made all the difference very friendly happy and the hotel itself is magnificent
14946,Intercontinental London The O2, Not getting loyalty points on my membership as booked through booking com Breakfast was expensive at 25 each so gave it a miss , The bedroom was spacious and comfortable Particularly impressed with the bathroom that had a good sized bath and separate shower cubicle My daughter wanted to take home the pillows and duvet as she said it was so comfortable Room had a good view out over the Thames It was good to have the dedicated route into the O2 which definitely saved time 
14947,Intercontinental London The O2, Drinks prices are pretty harsh but we were in a luxury hotel in London, Fantastic hotel for concerts at The O2 only a short walk in Car parking is easy and we got a discounted rate of 24 per night which though expensive is better that 50

14956,Intercontinental London The O2, Just very expensive considering the location, You cannot get a better location if you are visiting the 02 especially loved the private entrance straight into the arena only available for vhotel guests The hotel is simply beuatiful stunning my gosh it s extraordinarily expensive its more than some West end hotels with not the same attractions However we loved that kids ate free if you are staying in the hotel and their rooftop bar was breathtaking Bedrooms were soo comfortable and with modern technology with their tvs and air conditioning it was a definately luxury If you want to treat yourself then stay here but value for money it is not It s for sure expensive but beauricular The staff could not be more welcoming and gave my son a little welcome gift as we arrived When I win lottery I will be back again 
14957,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Room was lovely over looking river Bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in I visited with my daughter and she loved the bath and the shower was amazing Staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was to much trouble My daughter and I were attending a concert it was lovely that the hotel had a corridor to the o2 arena so we arrived at the concert relaxed and refreshed when the concert had ended we didn t have to worry about rushing to get out Check out was easy Would definitely visit again and recommended to others
14958,Intercontinental London The O2, That we didn t get told that parking was 25 on check out if said at front desk as we stayed at hotel we ended up paying 45, Loved Everything about hotel facility s comfort views and staff but we weren t told about parking

14961,Intercontinental London The O2, 12 5 discretionary service isn t discretionary it is automatically added to every transaction , Attentive staff fabulous breakfasts superb location Rooms spacious very clean Bars uncrowded lively views of London in the Eighteen Sky Bar 
14962,Intercontinental London The O2, None of the restaurants were available for us on the day as there was a corporate event going on that took over the restaurants There was a bar serving snacks but we had planned a nice 3 course meal we had looked at the menu for the restaurant online and decided to have a late lunch early dinner before the evening show We were advised that we could have room service but a nice three course meal is not so nice of your laps in the bedroom , Great hotel in a great location We went to the O2 in the evening and this hotel is right next door Modern feel and very clean
14963,Intercontinental London The O2, That I didn t stay for longer , The room was amazing the staff are very helpful and the views from the Sky Bar are phenomenal especially at night We stayed following a concert at the O2 and the distance to walk is negligible It is clearly sign posted and there is even a special exit to from the hotel O2 for guests of the hotel which made it that little bit easier It has really set the bar high I m not sure there is a better hotel in the country 
14964,Intercontinental London The O2, The drinks were a little bit expensive , Staff were amazing and the facilities were so good Food was very tasty Overall an amazing stay and would definitely go back

14967,Intercontinental London The O2, Leaving and come back to reality, Wonderful A really beautiful and lovely hotel The employees are very kind The room was marvelous and quiet This hotel was just amazing The breakfast is a perfect combination for all tastes with great product definitely hope to come back quickly
14968,Intercontinental London The O2, We attended a concert at the O2 and after we wanted to go to the Sky bar We were unable to go to it earlier as it was closed for a private function However due to the amount of people coming from the O2 both residents and non residents we were turned away as it was at capacity Whilst we understand this from a safety point of view we feel that hotel residents should get priority from those people who had just decided to walk across from the O2 It was one of the hotel features that we were looking forward to experiencing , Very good staff room was a good size with a very comfortable bed Clipper Bar is a lovely place to sit and relax and again the staff were very good We had dinner in the Brassiere restaurant and the food was good quality and again service was good We didn t know this until we checked in but the spa facilities are complementary so we would recommend using them 
14969,Intercontinental London The O2, Bit over the top pricing in certain aspects , One of the best hotels we ve stayed in Staff are so attentive Five star treatment all the way Would definitely go back and certainly recommend

14980,Intercontinental London The O2, The view could ve been better we were on the 3rd floor and all we could see out of our window was air conditioning and some stairs thats it no view whatsoever But that wasn t an issue as such the room was perfect, Everything the hotel room and everything in it was 10000 perfection
14981,Intercontinental London The O2, What s not to like , Comfortable bed modern shower amazing views great food we stayed for one night and had dinner and breakfast I think I could live here 
14982,Intercontinental London The O2, The staff did not seem professional We had to ask for too many things that should be in place Maybe a bit unorganised Had expected more from a 4 to 5 star hotel , Excellent hotel with a lot of comfort The staff was nice and helpful Very good food 
14983,Intercontinental London The O2, Our check in was a little late and although sorted promptly when we went to check in at 3 05 after arriving at 2pm and having a drink at the bar we were told our room was not yet ready once we spoke up about needing our room as we had plans to get out promptly we were then given rooms it would have just been More pleasant and efficient to sort that out before telling us that our rooms were not ready especially as they were aware we had arrived in good time and had been in the bar for an hour ,No Positive
14984,Intercontinental London The O2, Free parking would of been nice but not a problem, The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and comfy and a extra treat as they upgraded us for birthday

14988,Intercontinental London The O2, Bar prices are very high and the mini bar prices were ridiculous It would have been nice to have biscuits in the room to have with early morning tea coffee , The size and layout of the room was good The proximity to the O2 was the main reason we booked this hotel as we didn t want to travel after seeing a concert at the O2 Staff were very friendly and very efficient We ate in the Market Brasserie food was good but quite expensive if you don t have the set menu The service was excellent 
14989,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The view over the Thames and out to Canary Wharf at night was spectacular We also had the room service and both our meals were lovely and the service was excellent The friendly staff made this hotel 
14990,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful Rooms were exceptional very clean and well stocked great view of the O2 River We were there to see Frankie Valli at the O2 and it was great to enjoy the short walk to the O2 from the hotel for the concert Would not hesitate to book this hotel again 
14991,Intercontinental London The O2, when we went for breakfast which was not cheap all the cooked food was cold so we could not eat it we were told by waiter to get some more but it also was cold we spoke to the restaurant manager and he just said you should have just got some but it was cold The point being that it should not have been cold in the first place and freshly cooked its a 5 star hotel and we expected better it ended our experience with you on a low we spoke to the customer liaison staff and they said they would look into it and get back to me but no reply from them on saying that the overall experience was amazing thank you , The facilities was excellent staff were courteous and very helpful and very attentive the views from sky bar were amazing and a very pleasant place to unwind after a perfect concert in the O2 overall a very pleasant experience

14994,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing except it would have been nice to have at least a continental breakfast included in the price we paid for the room for both nights , The room was so comfortable that we were happy to stay in on first night we arrived 
14995,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The only let down was checking in we arrived after 3pm and the queue to check in was out the door we had dinner reservations at 5pm and we still did not have a room at 4 20 we just get being offered free drinks
14996,Intercontinental London The O2, The sat nav in my new car Qashqui would not accept the postcode off the web site There is a lack of signage to the hotel on the roundabout as you approach Millennium Way The cooked breakfast although there was a good selection of stuff was luke warm The room although equipped with a coffee maker only had two teabags and a couple of sachets of sugar about half teaspoon of white and brown We went up to the bar on the 18th floor and had one drink each because the drinks were sooooo sooooo very very expensive The music in the bar was awful very repetitive boom boom trance music not at all relaxing or pleasant , The beds were very nice and comfortable The staff were great The bathroom was great with a good powerful shower The room was nice and with plenty of space to move around The suitcases were brought up to the room for us and the car was valet parked You can easily walk to the O2 but at the moment it is a noisy walk because of the building work 
14997,Intercontinental London The O2, I don t have any complaints about this hotel , Very comfortable bed Extremely helpful staff Having a morning swim and sauna was a great bonus Plenty of choices at the breakfast buffet 
14998,Intercontinental London The O2, When we came out of the concert and went to the bar think it was 3rd floor we had to wait 20 min to be served but the waiter was very apologetic it was fine but the wait was not acceptable really I still loved the stay but just a point to make, Staff were excellent and just complete quality
14999,Intercontinental London The O2, Cocktail lust in the Eighteen Sky Bar was a bit limited but when I enquirer about other options available the bartender offered other alternatives e g a Cosmopolitan , Corner room which had amazing views of the Thames and the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in 
15000,Intercontinental London The O2, I thought 25pp for breakfast was much to expensive and so not value for money Also no english breakfast tea in the room and when it was delivered it was not that nice , The staff were amazing and the room facilities and bathroom were really nice 
15001,Intercontinental London The O2, Only down side was the parking Maybe my fault the hotel has its own car park Upon entry to the 02 I did not see signs for the hotel car park and parked where guided which was a 10 minute walk to the hotel , Excellent hotel only used it for one night and breakfast which there was a fantastic choice of food and well presented
15002,Intercontinental London The O2, The check in We should have checked in at 3pm but our rooms weren t ready until 7 30pm, The beds were amazing Graham on concierge made our stay at this hotel He was extremely helpful during our stay Top bloke 
15003,Intercontinental London The O2, Check in error meant we could not charge the evening food and drinks to the room but this was rectified after revisiting the front desk but was uncomfortable , Good size rooms and loved the walk in shower
15004,Intercontinental London The O2, 2 hours to book in very bad complsined 1 5 hours for a mediocre two course meal Complained Breakfast 1 porridge 1 tea 21 00 1 tea I bowl fruit 21 00 Serious rip off ,No Positive
15005,Intercontinental London The O2, I thought the shower was a bit poor mainly with the water pressure coming from it But that was the only thing we didn t like , Staff were very professional and polite yet still pleasantly down to earth The room was well laid out and spacious Plenty of natural light and room to move about easily Bed was very comfortable Technology was really easy to use and worked well Bars and restaurants were well staffed we were impressed by the ambience and design The mixologist cocktail barman in the 1st floor bar lived up to his namesake The Professor
15006,Intercontinental London The O2, Checkin took a while but they offered complimentary drinks whilst we waited, Staff were amazing rooms imaculate and spa facilities great Rooms very quiet too Perfect It s pricey but worth it if you want to feel like treating yourself Great cocktails on 18 and lovely food on 2 
15007,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The room spacious with great river views The bed extra comfortable like floating on a cloud Great access to The O2 Staff absolutely charming and efficient 
15008,Intercontinental London The O2, Shower a tad small to get away from the water when washing your hair but really I m being very petty here , The staff were amazing Every single person we came across could not do more for us and it made our stay 
15009,Intercontinental London The O2, Service in clipper bar could have been better We did not get nibbles like all others dining at the time Waited a while to be served , Stunning view of the river Thames from our room Quick walk through to the o2
15010,Intercontinental London The O2, The food was a little cold and the hot chocolate and coffee was cold they missed one bowl of cereal , We stayed 1 night as we went to see Bruno mars at the o2 they allowed us to park in there car park and stay all day the next day as we was getting the underground into London and the parking only cost 24 if u pay at the machine it costs 50 also I liked the fact you can order room service 24 7
15011,Intercontinental London The O2, I do not know where to start with this 1 without being told we was nearly charged 50 for parking only for another guest to say to go back to the hotel and they will charge you 24 as you stayed the night No staff told us this 2 Came back to the room late got into our very nice bed turned the TV on at 11 30pm to find out none of the channels worked Went to sleep woke up and they worked TV curfew 3 We paid for a breakfast included in the price Got to the hotel no notice of this they wanted 25 per person for a full English as you can imagine left hungry 4 Air condition in the room barely worked set to 18 degree as was warm in the room slept with no duvet on as air condition could not chill the room only itself 5 Not all light switches worked had to get back out of bed to turn lights off buttons next to the bed did not work Near 200 paid for the room and with lots of disappointments shall not be doing this again can pay for Travel Lodge Holiday inn Premier Inn at half the price and expect more and to receive a breakfast with this , Room was nice and clean accommodated for needs for a night and beds were comfy 
15012,Intercontinental London The O2, The only improvement would be the length of time it took to get a drink in the bars needs to be reduced , We loved the fact that we were so close to the O2 as we were there to see Bruno Mars The hotel was great our room was fabulous and had fantastic views over Canary Wharf staff so friendly and helpful We will be back 
15013,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The location comfort and staff make up for slightly higher than average price Its also worth mentioning that it is well worth getting breakfast included as the quality and selection are first class 
15014,Intercontinental London The O2, There was not enough staff in the bar on the 18th floor after the concert we attended at the O2 I would have thought that they should have anticipated the requirement for extra staff considering there was a concert on at the arena the hotel is affiliated with , The hotel was spotless the staff were very professional and the food was excellent 
15015,Intercontinental London The O2, There were different times for the use of the swimming pool so me and my 12 year old daughter could not go swimming together Seems a bit ridiculous because children wouldn t want to go on their own ,No Positive
15016,Intercontinental London The O2, Not long enough there, Second stay here and never disappoints Staff are excellent Rooms are fantastic Comfortable beds and great selection for brekkie Fabulous location for the O2 
15017,Intercontinental London The O2, The member of staff on the door to the Sky bar She was a bit rude and made me feel awkward , The view we were on floor 17 the bed the bathroom just everything
15018,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, From the minute we arrived the staff were so helpful polite and friendly we received an excellent service The hotel bars are relaxing with Great views over the city I highly recommend this hotel

15020,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing love it, Great to watch the tall ships Great to get away from busy London Plenty of places to eat near by and convenient for the tube or bus even easy to walk to Greenwich easy to get to 02 for a concert Friendly staff
15021,Intercontinental London The O2, The staff were very good the first two days topping up the tea and coffee However on the 3rd night they didn t top up the Earl Grey peppermint and chocolate drinks These are the only drinks I drink As it s my last night I didn t make a fuss My husband drink coffee so it s no problem for him , very near where I want to go 
15022,Intercontinental London The O2, Room 1308 in which we stayed was absolutely perfect and couldn t really fault it however Maybe just a little mention for improvement both me and my partner loved the views you get from that particular room that we felt the room should have been the other way around more precisely the bed because we felt you could lay in bed and have fantastic views but from where the bed actually is you cannot see anything , The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless
15023,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, The politeness and friendliness of staff The location in comparison to our plans The cleanliness of the hotel and our room Lovely and quiet Professional staff 
15024,Intercontinental London The O2, Drinks were a little on the expensive side my only complaint but the view from the 18th floor bar made up for it , Stunning Clean and Classy Bedroom Breakfast buffet was fantastic Beautiful Lobby s greeted by very friendly staff can t wait to come back the o2 was a stone throw away and North Greenwich tube station is 3 minutes down the road 
15025,Intercontinental London The O2, The drinks at the bar were way to expensive we were planning to have a good few drinks at the bar until we got the first bill which was incredibly expensive which was a shame because we planned to hit the late night bar after the event but got discouraged because of the prices, The room was very spacious and modern bed and pillows very comfy the hotel itself was excellent with a great location right next to the o2
15026,Intercontinental London The O2, The value for money with the room service was the only downfall of my stay I felt that the food I ordered was extremely overpriced as I paid 30 for a chicken sandwich with fries but this was described as a chicken club on the menu this was the only negative I must say overall a very nice stay , I loved the small details with my hotel room the speaker in the bathroom made my bath at night one to remember my view was perfect and I was very satisfied with the convience the location gave me 
15027,Intercontinental London The O2, Rooms were very hot did not get twin beds as requested and they told us that we did not mention in booking although it was clear from the beginning and we did our booking 4 months ago but still they let part of the family in a double room that was not accepted And for the last two nights they made us shift to other rooms to get twin bed as well as for cooler room and still the rooms were too hot and then finally they realized that the filters of the air condition was not clean This annoyed us a lot Will not come again , Location room size staff were friendly nice view from the room

15053,Intercontinental London The O2, Communication in bar could have been better re what wine would you like instead of being charged 24 pound for a class of large white wine i didn t even ask for a large one when i asked how much the bottle would have been was told 57 pound they did lower price to 20 pound for the glass, Room amazing spar excellent views stunning
15054,Intercontinental London The O2, Maybe increase gluten free offerings pastries for the breakfast One other small thing was that the tea coffee in the room while it was replenished it didn t follow a regular set up , Loved the spa stylish afternoon tea Friendly staff Great location Would recommend for a touch of luxury The sky bar treat yourself to the view some champagne cocktails 
15055,Intercontinental London The O2, temperature in room was quite warm wasnt clear that you had to pay for parking on booking and at a cost of 300 a night I would expect free parking Staff member didnt charge me when I raised this though , Great location for O2 staff very helpful Great pool
15056,Intercontinental London The O2, I booked this hotel for the location of it as i was going to a concert in o2 arena getting to the o2 was a breeze from hotel perfect in fact but coming back the same way was a totally different story was told the fate would be open for return to hotel until 01 00 but as we rerurned from the concert at 11pm it was locked so had to find another route to hotel so being 2 young ladies we asked the security well 7 security guards later and w0 mins walking back and forward we managed to get to hotel but with very sore feet and a dampener on a great evening and great hotel stay, Staff whete magnificent and the views spectacular 
15057,Intercontinental London The O2, No room at the sky bar we were recommended by staff to go via email prior to arrival however it was so busy we couldn t even sit down so had to just go back to our room That was the only bar open so very disappointing , Large bed Separate bath and shower I loved Good views Breakfast was amazing with views over canary wharf Spa facilities were lovely Being right next to the O2 was great for us as we were seeing a show there Lots of parking easier than getting the train 
15058,Intercontinental London The O2, Quilt was extremely thick and heavy Air conditioning only allowed us to go to minimum of 18 degrees room was consequently hot and stuffy which made it difficult to sleep, Faculties and room were stunning Breakfast delicious Location great for o2
15059,Intercontinental London The O2, Absolutely nothing , What can I say this hotel was beyond amazing we had the most perfect view overlooking the o2 arena Bed was like sleeping in a cloud so comfortable Staff was incredibly polite attentive couldn t want for anything more Feel very lucky to stay I have stayed here Thank you

15064,Intercontinental London The O2, The restaurant s evening meal was a disappointment for me although my wife was happy with her meal To be fair the hotel responded to our complaint and we were happy with that , The staff were uniformly excellent especially the Spanish cook at breakfast who took such a pride in his work and quality of service 
15065,Intercontinental London The O2, There should be some type of guide on how to work the lights and air conditioning It s all programmed so it s a bit difficult to understand at first , Very clean and modern
15066,Intercontinental London The O2, The customer service was slow When we checked in it was a slow process We Waited 10 minutes for luggage to be brought in the room and the bags tag had incorrect details We asked for ice bucket and nobody came , The location was convenient and the views were amazing 
15067,Intercontinental London The O2, The mini bar is computerised and stuffed full so if you move anything to put something of your own in to keep cool your bill is going to grow rapidly although if you notice the staff are happy to sort for you Unfortunately the computer system was down on checking out and still 28 hours later still not received any promised invoice or bill , The location for the O2 is perfect and removes any stress

15072,Intercontinental London The O2, It is not clear when booking that you have to pay 24 per night for parking It is on the list that you have to pay if you scroll down but when booking it indicates there is no need to reserve parking this to me implies it is included , Easy access to the o2 arena Very clean hotel and friendly professional staff We never used the on site facilities or restaurants but everyone that we spoke to seemed impressed with them We used the facilities in the o2 as we were attending a weekend event

15077,Intercontinental London The O2, After returning from the Strictly event at the 02 we went to the bar The bar was very under staffed Over half hour wait to be served Lots of people very unhappy One member of staff said where did you all come from Surely staff know when events end and should expect bars to be busy It really let the hotel down , Room with a view Beautiful

15086,Intercontinental London The O2, Honestly nothing all perfect , The whole hotel was unbelievable every single staff member treated us like we were celebrities will be returning many times to this hotel 
15087,Intercontinental London The O2, On event nights the bar on top floor gets so full you can t get in It was a shame as we had tried to go there before the event in the afternoon but it didn t open until 5pm We were only staying one night and it was first visit to this hotel so would have loved to experience the views from the bar at night The other bar was open so we went there but still had to queue for 40 minutes for drinks at 10 30pm the servers did not serve people in order of arrival which was a little frustrating I was queing alone next to another woman and the big groups of guests or couples were served first despite me pointing out that I had been there before them to the bar staff This put me off and was a shame as we probably were paying the same price to stay there and everyone should expect the same service whether a returning guest or a business guest or simple a guest staying for leisure purposes If you like firm pillows ask at reception as the pillows in room are like marshmallows , Rooms very clean and spacious Lots of extra touches and room ready before we were due to check in which was great The breakfast choice was fantastic High quality food and staff so welcoming It was very busy but still they went out of their way to serve with a smile The speakers in the bathroom are a lovely extra surprise and enabled us to play music via Bluetooth Could even listen to the news in the shower View from bedroom great too Quality of sleep great no noises from other doors closing or anyone walking down corridors or traffic Very impressed

15099,Intercontinental London The O2, Unable to get food after a concert at 02 apart from room service Suggest on concert nights food is served later, Very comfy bed and soft towels Location to 02 superb
15100,Intercontinental London The O2, The full English breakfast was not hot all items just about warm expensive at 25 per head The lighting in the room was not bright enough to read the instructions for the coffee machine , The size of the suite was amazing with great views of the river Thames Convenient for the O2 arena 
15101,Intercontinental London The O2, Appreciate its London prices but 24 for a glass of red and a vodka tonic seems a little high maybe it s the sky bar view you pay for , The quality and professional staff were very impressive had a issue early on a Sunday morning and the door staff and concierge were so helpful trying to find an open pharmacy Location so close to the stadium means a five minute walk back and no sitting in car park for two hours trying to get out Worth the cost alone 
15102,Intercontinental London The O2, As much as the cocktails look and the 2 we tried tasted fantastic the price did seem very high , The rooms are amazing The extra touches like a speaker in the bathroom which plays whatever is on the telly Everything is of a high standard Breakfast was unbelievable the selection from cereals to fruit smoothies and muffins The cooked choices were fantastic tasted so fresh Fabulous hotel and well worth paying extra for what you get

15105,Intercontinental London The O2, it took 45 minutes to get a ice bucket to the room also we had the cleaner just let herself in without knocking we didn t have a do not disturb sign , the hotel was lovely we got upgraded as it was a special occasion just beautiful I would 100 stay here again in fact I recommended my parents to stay there tonight which they are 
15106,Intercontinental London The O2, The swimming pool in the spa was beautiful But it doesn t look like it gets cleaned until the end of the day piles of used towels and robes everywhere No clean towels in the men s changing rooms Floors were filthy We actually didn t stay long because of this , The staff were so friendly whether at check in or at one of the two bars The rooms are finished to a high standard as you would expect with Intercontinental Superb luxurious bathrooms Again high quality finish Loved the Eighteen sky bar and clipper bar expensive drinks which is a shame I d like to have stayed longer 
15107,Intercontinental London The O2, Everything was excellent Only downside was the building work at the 02 meant we got a bit wet as it was raining for which I do not hold the hotel responsible , Bed was super soft Breakfast was superb Very clean hotel and ideal for the 02 arena

15115,Intercontinental London The O2, Paying by debit card meant that I had to pay for everything as I went and couldn t get access to the mini bar that doesn t work for me , Great view from my hotel room 
15116,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was poor and had to pay deposit of 300 pound when i got there only for I had my card but very expensive deposit to make sure the room is left in perfect condition, Room was very nice and view was amazing

15118,Intercontinental London The O2, I stayed here because of a flight delay at London City airport and would not have picked this area of London otherwise It is far from any amenities sadly Plus I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and would give this one 4 5 stars Just does not have the details that make a truly 5 star hotel Staff very good , Room very quiet and bed very comfy Temperature control in room very good 
15119,Intercontinental London The O2, I can t really fault anything maybe few more hangers beds at the swimming pool or a better rate for customer about the car park would help but nothing major, I really loved this hotel the location the view the building is absolutely stunning the staff very helpful and makes a big difference

15123,Intercontinental London The O2, The floor around the pool and in the spa was quite dirty with a lot if hair and could have been cleaned more often , I stayed in room on the 9th floor and the view was absolutely superb Our bed was very comfortable there was a funny smell of smoke when we first arrived in our room however this was not a massive issue as we really appreciated the bathroom speaker view from our window and comfy bed 
15124,Intercontinental London The O2, Room wasn t ready when we arrived despite being told at front desk it was On arriving at room it was still being cleaned , Amazing views from our room Fabulous breakfast everything possible you could choose from

15127,Intercontinental London The O2, I didn t like that when I arrived with my daughter at 5pm I was told they had no room for me and wouldn t have anything for another two hours Obviously I was not happy with this at all as this was unacceptable and we were due at the O2 for a concert at 6 30 I asked to see the manager with whom I didn t get to see and was then given a room upgrade later check out and complimentary drink , The view the room and the very comfortable bed the easy accessibility to the O2 and the staff in general and very friendly bar girl in the clipper bar 
15128,Intercontinental London The O2, food was really pricy 18th floor sky bar slightly boring only good thing was the view looking up to canary wharf 5 charge every time you order to your room , Nice and comfy bed amazing views staff and service was excellent 
15129,Intercontinental London The O2, Booking com mislead me and staff at hotel not cooperative and very rude and made it the fault of booking com hence i will never use booking com again, The hotel was excellent

15140,Intercontinental London The O2, I booked a valentine s decoration the vase of rose wasn t looks good it was just put in a paper bag but not a vase the location of the hotel is a bit far from the centre , the staffs are really friendly and helpful pool and spa is great My girlfriend and i also love the bar on the 1st floor and 18th floor 
15141,Intercontinental London The O2, There was insufficient staff in the second floor bar and the wait was far to long for an order to be filled even though the bar manager phoned on three occasions for assistance none came , The view was breathtaking and the proximity to the o2 couldn t be better
15142,Intercontinental London The O2, There were two brown stains on the carpet in our room which was disappointing considering we paid 255 for one night in a superior room The menu guide on the TV was faulty and when it did finally work it would not let us press select on the options Spotify etc the speakers in the bathroom were also much quieter than when we stayed the first time to such an extent they were mostly pointless things I would not expect of such a luxurious hotel Rather a long queue for breakfast , An array of delicious choices for breakfast Lovely informative and helpful staff lovely bath and shower glorious bed perfect for O2 speakers in bathroom lovely view 
15143,Intercontinental London The O2, Only 2 bar staff on 2nd floor bar so when a lot of guests got back from 02 concert there was an extra long wait to get served at the bar so we have up after 10minutes this was our only complaint Earlier in the day in the mid afternoon it had been fine , Breakfast was fantastic for choice staff all seemed happy and obliging
15144,Intercontinental London The O2, Service at the Clipper Bar was very slow and it wasn t until later that we realised that we had been charged for service We were not sure if this was a voluntary or compulsory charge as this wasn t mentioned , We booked the hotel as we were going to an event at the O2 The room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful 
15145,Intercontinental London The O2, Perhaps making the sky bar larger as it has brilliant views but unfortunately not enough room for everyone to enjoy them , I cannot fault anything we thoroughly enjoyed our stay right from being greeted at the door to checking out Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and what a fantastic location the hotel is in Everyone should treat themselves to a little luxury and stay at this hotel
15146,Intercontinental London The O2, There were not enough staff serving in the two bars during that very busy period when guests had returned from the O2 Arena show 20 minutes to get a drink is excessive and many guests left without ,No Positive
15147,Intercontinental London The O2, My duvet was blood stained and felt although the staff were lovely and I didn t make a fuss on reflection i feel having paid 180 00 i was not offered a refund or any other compensation it would be nice to have something to makeup for the inconvenience , The staff 
15148,Intercontinental London The O2, food and cocktails are very pricey so be ready to fork out but it is a 5 start hotel, The room was extra large with 2 bathrooms and the staff were very helpful
15149,Intercontinental London The O2, Very big and busy so stafff not that friendly Cleared our table including full drinks and stuff from chairs when in breakfast queue Mattress topper made bed very hot , Location right next to o2
15150,Intercontinental London The O2, no bath towels in room only hand towels one of the glasses had chip in rim and cut my lip room a little hot for comfort but that s being a bit picky would have moaned if it had been cold chocolate in mini fridge very expensive especially if you have kids 4 for a small bar of dairy milk REALLY , Link to o2 venue excellent Staff brilliant and so polite Sure they would have sorted out towel query if I had asked but should not have passed inspection Really really clean Parked out front very convenient to finish on a positive THE BED wow As good as mine at home 
15151,Intercontinental London The O2, The view wasn t quite as advertised spa could have massage facilities breakfast wasn t that nice, Lovely room staff were friendly facilities were good plenty of photo ops
15152,Intercontinental London The O2, Several times we had to ask maintenance to come up and fix our toilet which they did and every time we were greeted with a friendly member of staff However persistent running of water which kept us up a lot of the night gave up asking someone to come fix it in the end and the flush would just stop working every now and then , The bed was comfy and the room was lovely and large Location to the o2 was just perfect Ideal for the late nights after a gig and early starts if you would want a breakfast coffee elsewhere 
15153,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Staff were very welcoming and attentive from the outset and for the duration of our stay The room was superb clean and extremely comfortable This was the perfect location in which to stay to ensure our overall O2 experience was memorable

15155,Intercontinental London The O2, Cost although you get what you pay for The inability to have a light meal on arrival we arrived at 1100 and had an early start That said ordering cake with our coffee hit the spot , The comfort of the room proximity to the O2 and facilities

15162,Intercontinental London The O2, The room was nice but personally I didn t think it was worth the money that it cost The handle in the shower fell off and the water was changing from hot to cold We paid for a river view but what we got was mostly car park It also wasn t explained to us very well we would be charged an extra 100 on top of the room incase we used room service or mini bar the lady at reception explained this would be refunded however I am still awaiting this refund On the website it states 25 for parking however we ended up paying 75 ,No Positive
15163,Intercontinental London The O2, Expectation of room from Booking com was it would have several windows for the view but only had one Not really a negative , Attention to detail was spot on specifically things like toiletries which included items such nail files tooth brush and tooth paste rarely seen quality shampoo etc everything to make you feel comfortable Extra large bed and soft duvet covers ensured I had a very comfortable sleep View of the river and O2 was impressive Location to the O2 couldn t have been better literally a 2 minute walk once you get out of the lift Lots of bars and restaurants

15165,Intercontinental London The O2, Disappointed with the breakfast compared to the last time we were there coffee in the rooms are disgusting and every time we ordered a tea or coffee it was just barely warm and when pointed this out to staff they didn t seem interested and replaced with warm tea and coffee, The location is perfect very good staff and lovely rooms

15182,Intercontinental London The O2, We were attending the NTA in O2 hence our choice of this hotel Price was quite high for the general area and was probably hiked because of the awards ceremony It was excessive , All staff at hotel were extremely courteous and helpful Absolutely first class treatment in all areas We really enjoyed the hotel excellent

15185,Intercontinental London The O2, The shower was cold The two single beds I requested were pushed together to make a double bed Never nice when I was sharing a room with my brother The receptionist was rude Got woken up by the cleaners having a shouting conversation in the hall way The only good thing about this hotel was how close it is to the o2 arena ,No Positive
15186,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing loved it , Duvet pillows were super soft and comfy and the shower was fab Amazing breakfast never seen such a choice Ate it by the window looking over the Thames The pre show set menu dinner was absolutely delicious The walkway through to the O2 was really convenient The staff couldn t have been more helpful attentive Hope to stay again soon

15188,Intercontinental London The O2, The afternoon tea we had was over priced and the quality of food didn t match the price The English breakfast was very poor eggs far to oily bacon chewy and poor taste hash browns chewy and poor quality Basically don t eat here and your onto a winner , The bed was pure luxury and room very clean 
15189,Intercontinental London The O2, We were told we couldn t sit at a particular table area but another member of staff said it was fine to have the window area , Selection was fantastic and quality of the food was very good indeed 
15190,Intercontinental London The O2, For the misses to call the desk asking for non featherd duvet pillows to be sent up because of allergies only for the porter to bring up 1 non feathed pillow 2 featherd pillows another featherd duvet so we wacked the heating up slept in no bed clothes , Loved the Sky bar the range of whiskys were superb the French waiter new his stuff fair play 
15191,Intercontinental London The O2, The room was very warm and there was no way to reduce the temperature below 18 degrees I m sure that s great for some people but I found it a bit too warm to sleep comfortably , Beautiful hotel and the staff were cheerful and helpful Location is great for the O2 and breakfast was delivered to the room on time and was lovely 
15192,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing at all , The staff were so polite and couldn t do enough for you opened all the doors for you etc The breakfast choice was amazing and food was outstanding The room was stunning and so clean The facilities were amazing and all round the best hotel I ve ever stayed in Can t wait to go back Made our weekend away perfect 
15193,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Everything was amazing Staff very friendly and extremely helpful Location and appearance of hotel was exceptional Expensive option but you get what you pay for One small niggle which I will be speaking to the hotel about but other than that would be my first choice when visiting the o2 in future 
15194,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Best thing about this hotel is the bed It s an absolute dream staff are amazing friendly and very helpful 2nd time staying absolutely love it 
15195,Intercontinental London The O2, The smell that seemed like it was cannabis which after the cleaner came and sprayed a small amount of spray to try and hide the smell did not leave When asked they explained this was through the air vents but was unbearable in the morning Also when we went into our room there was already someone else s luggage there but after ringing reception we were moved rooms The smell though was unbearable , How close it was to the o2 and that there was an entrance from the hotel to the o2 Bed was really comfy and great shower and bath 
15196,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Fantastic location We were going to the 02 for a show and it was so convenient Loads of restaurants Close to underground station Hotel was perfect Upgraded to a room with a view as it was our anniversary Guest relations provided desserts delivered to our room Beds were so comfortable Highly recommended We will be back 
15197,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Location was ideal as we went to see impractical jokers in O2 arena and the bed was so comfy I wanted to take it home with me And the bathroom having separate shower and bath was a good touch 
15198,Intercontinental London The O2, We put our breakfast in room request on our door but breakfast did not turn up it did not turn up so had to re order which took over an hour to arrive at our room I d suggest more milk pouches in the room to go with Tea or Coffee , The bed and room was comfy the views from the room very good and close to the O2 We arrived without toothbrush and paste which the hotel supplied us with 
15199,Intercontinental London The O2, The in house food was very expensive as was the mini bar However food from outside the venue could be taken in , The door staff were very helpful The room was spacious and clean fantastic 
15200,Intercontinental London The O2, Service charge added to drinks even when you go to the bar yourself to get them is the only criticism , Bed was the comfiest bed I ve ever slept in staff all friendly and attentive and in a brilliant location highly impressed 
15201,Intercontinental London The O2, The fact that they add a 12 5 tip on at the bars for bringing you a drink it tells you on tiny writing at the bottom of the menu this is extra annoying considering you are already paying premium prices for the alcohol , Great location a 2 minute walk to the O2 Great view from our room out over the river Beautiful room and a massive comfy bed couldn t ask for more 
15202,Intercontinental London The O2, Room service was very poor , Facilities were fantastic and staff couldn t do enough for you We re upgraded for free without asking to a room with river view Excellent 
15203,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The bed was really comfortable the view from the room was right over the river Thames which was lovely the bathroom had a shower and bath and the staff were really helpful I forgot my hairdryer and asked the receptionist and got one sent to my room in 5 minutes Couldn t fault this hotel was a very enjoyable stay and will definitely be booking again 
15204,Intercontinental London The O2, Some of the foreign staff couldn t understand me and I had to repeat myself but I have got a Welsh accent so I can understand why , Excellent service would definitely recommend to anyone 
15205,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Excellent location The hotel has a short cut to the o2 so you can walk there in approx 3 mins Also the staff were so helpful and could not do enough for you Dinner was brilliant and breakfast had the best choice of fruit and salad and cooked breakfast I have ever seen 
15206,Intercontinental London The O2, The only problems we noted were that the tea served to us at breakfast was cold and the food in the buffet was only warm They could have been a little hotter When we rang to confirm our booking the receptionist said that they were aware we were coming for my husband s birthday and said that they would make sure amenities would be available for us in the Room though she couldn t say what I don t know what we expected to find but was ever so slightly disappointed that all there was waiting for us was 3 little chocolates You would think for the price of the room and the amount you pay in the bar and for room service etc that the hotel could have pushed the boat out a little bit more , The staff were very friendly Breakfast was absolutely wonderful so much choice We found the hotel to be in a great location for what we were there for The main area of the hotel is luxurious and the check in was very quick and our bag was brought to our room promptly 
15207,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Excellent location if you re planning on visiting the O2 it s literally a walkway away gorgeous views and immaculate room Hotel is located in a very peaceful and quiet area Lovely d cor to make you feel at home and great bathroom with a powerful shower Staff are accommodating at all times and provide exceptional customer service Breakfast was divine couldn t fault my stay at all 
15208,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t get the room any cooler and it was hard to sleep when it was so warm, Amazing location The staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for you Food in the restaurant was lovely
15209,Intercontinental London The O2, The prices could have been a little better as I was doing a proposal and did set me back a bit , How the rooms were very updated with technology the view was amazing and Lina who helped organise my proposal 
15210,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Location excellent watched show at O2 for other halfs birthday treat Staff at intercontinental were helpful friendly and couldn t do enough for you no queuing at check in decor and views of thames city amazing 
15211,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Everything was just spot on Views out the window were superb All the added luxury s were great Great value for money considering location 
15212,Intercontinental London The O2, I was told parking was free until i checked out and had to pay i mean for how much i paid 428 for 2 nights the view wasn t what i wanted and ive stayed in better hotels for that price, The hotel in general was beautiful But i feel i was ripped off with the service charges on top of the ridiculous prices for food and tea
15213,Intercontinental London The O2, Spa area around the pool could be cleaner It was a bank holiday so staff shortages could be to blame , Very comfortable bed Really well designed bedroom with great views Fantastic breakfast 
15214,Intercontinental London The O2, We stayed here for NY all service was incredibly slow things like coffe machine and etc were missing in the room and we spent ages waiting for it During the breakfast the drinks are served very slow too Plus the chemicals in the swimming pool especially hot tub is so strong that gave us both my partner and I an allergy and bloodshot eyes for 2 days In addition Minibar is with sensors so although we took things out to make our own water cooler and didn t use any of the goods and placed them back We got charged So it is always recommended to double check your bill in this hotel Last but not least we paid extra for a river view room but got only a partial view I would not say it is worth the money In general I would not stay at this hotel again as from my experience when one is paying 200 for a night a way better experience could be expected , Breakfast is really nice and with great choice All staff member are very friendly 
15215,Intercontinental London The O2, Had to wait for about 15 20 mins for sausages at breakfast pretty poor for a 5 star but that was the only problem with the stay , Extra comfy beds Service was excellent 
15216,Intercontinental London The O2, The spa felt like a swimming pool with loads of children The aircon didn t work no air in the room The light switch fel out in the middle of the night Wasn t as good as the 1st time I stayed Disappointing really , Lovely hotel setting friendly staff 
15217,Intercontinental London The O2, Perhaps changing the 5 service charge for room service as we ended up paying out numerous times for little bits that we needed Otherwise perfect hotel , Everything Stunning hotel one of the best we ve stayed in Views standard of room food pool location everything was spot on Thank you It was also our anniversary and the lovely gentleman at reception gave us a free room upgrade to the most beautiful room the staff made our trip even more perfect Can t praise them enough Thank you thank you thank you 
15218,Intercontinental London The O2, Wish I booked for longer , There s nothing I can fault I had a wonderful stay and look forward to going back Great service welcoming and helpful staff They exceed the standards expected and has to be one of the best I ve ever stayed in 
15219,Intercontinental London The O2, We were assigned a room that already had people in it Upon arriving to the room we saw belongings of other guests e g suitcases shoes etc We had to go back to Reception and be given another room , The beds were SO comfortable Could have slept forever I didn t want to move 
15220,Intercontinental London The O2, The room I booked said it would have a river view however wouldn t exactly classify it as a river view , The staff were extremely friendly The location was good The hotel as a whole was excellent the facilities were superb 
15221,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing all fantastic , Beds very comfy staff not snooty very welcoming and just generally really nice and helpful food lovely at breakfast unfortunately we couldnt afford dinner as not rich but we tried a cocktail and had a few cheaper drinks and had a fantastic time Will save up for next year 
15222,Intercontinental London The O2, When I checked in I had to wait in a spa for over an hour after being told I would be contacted I had to approach the reception desk out that I have to stay in a different room to the one I paid for of less value , The bed was extra comfy cleanliness was beautiful
15223,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , The staff were very smartly dressed extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of the area and amenities Car park is very convenient and plenty of spaces available 
15224,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Very nice comfy beds Lovely staff Lovely pool and spa area Really enjoyed my stay Nice views watching all the fireworks going off on New Year s Eve 
15225,Intercontinental London The O2, The location of the hotel is close from the metro but still need to walk around 8min to get to the reception The price of the breakfast is high but expected for such a kind of hotel , The room was clean and confortable The staff really kind The spa is great I recommend and I will be back there for my next trip in London 
15226,Intercontinental London The O2, breakfast service a bit slow ordered an omelette which took 20 minutes to arrive after being chased and was nearly raw however everything else was fine and we all make mistakes ,No Positive
15227,Intercontinental London The O2, Sky bar staff unhelpful in wouldn t accommodate a table where it was possible unreserved wouldn t arrange delivery of wine to our room and drinks overpriced, Spa rooms distance to 02 reception staff excellent
15228,Intercontinental London The O2, Instead of delivering our 3 suitcases to our room they were placed on a bus to Heathrow by carelessness After waiting in the room only our last minute trip back downstairs saved our luggage from being lost ,No Positive
15229,Intercontinental London The O2, Receptionist who checked us in was moody and devoid of friendliness or a smile Room was comfortable however it was characterless and generic we could have been anywhere Breakfast was chaotic nobody was there to take you to a table had to wait 15 minutes for coffee , Staff at the sky bar were friendly
15230,Intercontinental London The O2, Small problem with dinner as we didn t have time for dessert due to slow service but this was sorted out and taken off our bill as was the service charge and when we checked out and mentioned this they waived the parking charge as well so very pleased with service, The hotel is really lovely room was excellent bed extremely comfy Breakfast was very good Ideal if going to the 02 as you can walk from the hotel in just a few minutes
15231,Intercontinental London The O2, Took way to long to get a drink at the sky bar Breakfast for 1 25 30 way too expensive No instruction or details in the rooms or prices on the mini bar items , Pool spacious clean rooms and right next to O2
15232,Intercontinental London The O2, Only wish was that the Sky bar stayed open longer or we were allowed access to sit and enjoy the view we were turned away when they stopped serving drinks even though I told them all we wanted to do is sit and enjoy the view without drinking,No Positive
15233,Intercontinental London The O2, Car park charge of 50 which we were not aware of There are no signs to tell you that charge exists Or that you have to pay at reception Staff were very very unhelpful It needs to be made clearer on the websirte and before entering the carpark Would never have gone there Will not return ,No Positive
15234,Intercontinental London The O2, Hard to fault except perhaps price Breakfast is 25 each So I recommend visiting one of the many breakfast options in the O2 just a short walk away Also there was a faulty light in the bedroom that seemed to be flickering a SOS message , A very nice new hotel with the biggest benefit being its close location to the O2 in fact it is connected via a hallway directly to the O2 as well a large car park but not free Unlike so many London hotels it feels very open and spacious We were given a corner room with a brilliant view of both the O2 and the Thames Also in room coffee machine was better than normal Staff very friendly and helpful 
15235,Intercontinental London The O2, The staff could have been slightly less enthusiastic as it made the friendliness and knowledge seem like an act and as if it wasn t real The price of the items in the mini fridge were extremely overpriced too 8 50 for a shot of Jack Daniels 4 50 for a Kit Kat etc , The room was spotless and the bathroom was outstanding The bathroom had basics like shampoo conditioner but also had an emery nail board cotton buds cotton pads and more The view from room 1705 was breathtaking 
15236,Intercontinental London The O2, Needed extra milk but that was sorted through reception needed more bar staff in the sky bar took a while to be served, The bathroom very spacious loved the coffee machine and the sky bar wasvgreat
15237,Intercontinental London The O2, I didn t not like having to pay 24 for parking for one night , Location of the hotel was really good I was heading to a concert at the 02 and what I found great was the hotel had its own link to the arena So we did not need to walk 14 mins to the arena The room was so nice We got an upgrade to a conner view room which was lovely Definitely will stay there again I would stay longer than one night 
15238,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Perfect for going to O2 back exit of hotel takes you straight into the arena Lovely rooms and staff were really helpful Going back in January and glad I booked there again already Especially good when leaving arena as tube taxis are a nightmare We were out and back in our room in minutes 
15239,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The proximity to the 02 was awesome perfect if you want to make a real evening of seeing a band The bar on the top floor is awesome after a gig with great views over Canary Wharf
15240,Intercontinental London The O2, Female who checked us in was not friendly which was disappointing , Location to O2 Meet and greet at the entrance to hotel was exceptional The gentleman made us extremely welcome which was lovely

15248,Intercontinental London The O2, Perfect on both occasions , Stayed here two weekends running for concerts at O2 couldn t be a more perfect location for that Fabulous views of Canary Wharf from some rooms Rooms spacious and well equipped Separate shower cubical and bath Small point but so nice to have 3 hand towels in a bathroom for two so you have one dedicated for washing hands A small attention to detail but speaks volumes Had breakfast delivered to the room for both stays which comes beautifully presented see photo with proper linen napkins and table cloth etc Check out is 12pm so if you have had a late night you can have a nice relaxing morning breakfast in your room before heading off Lots of food options around the O2 plus a pharmacy and Tesco Express

15252,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t believe that the only way to pay for breakfast was either cash or credit card What in this day and age is wrong with a debit card Also breakfast ordered in our room was v expensive for what it was and cleaned us out of cash as we couldn t remember our credit card pin number and a bit disappointing strange quantities large amount of juice tiny amount of coffee large amount of croissants and toast just one tiny pat of butter between 2 We asked for more coffee and butter but surely this is basic stuff , Perfect location v comfy pillows Nice staff excellent parking facilities very reasonable arrival and departure times 
15253,Intercontinental London The O2, Absolutely nothing, Staff were outstanding in all areas especially Simone on reception who ensued my Mum was well looked after Rooms bathroom immaculate and spacious beds exceptionally comfortable would return even if not attending the O2 it was that good Thank you

15255,Intercontinental London The O2, not a dislike but a shuttle service from North Greenwich tube station would be a good idea although the walk is short in wet weather this could be an issue with some guests, The overall experience was excellent
15256,Intercontinental London The O2, TV in room didn t work properly Remote control very frustrating to use and TV just kept freezing 2 lights were not working in room which meant that my wife could not see properly in mirror at night 1 was very distracting and kept flickering Otherwise lovely room, Location to o2 was great Breakfast was excellent though tea and coffee was cold when served 
15257,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Went to see Rod Stewart The location is ideal for the O2 Arena The Staff were all helpful friendly and the Bed Extra Comfy Breakfast was Amazing I would definitely stay again 
15258,Intercontinental London The O2, 276 room only no brekkie pool very high chlorine content which made skin itch , you are paying for the location obviously convenient for the 02 and well worth as a one off treat 
15259,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing not to like about the hotel, Room was spotless The bed was very comfortable duvet was very lightweight but extremely warm Unlike some hotels you couldn t hear any sound from neighbouring rooms
15260,Intercontinental London The O2, Builders working on flat roof right next to side window of our room at 8am we had 2 windows in our room one looked out on air con units which were being worked on the other looked out onto flat roof and builders tools shovels etc, Location to o2

15262,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Best breakfast I have ever encountered the selection and quality was so impressive and I ve stayed in some of the best hotels in the world Staff on reception were exceptional nothing was too much trouble and they even printed off some tickets for me Perfect location for the O2 to see the ATP World tennis finals
15263,Intercontinental London The O2, Parking Prices were high at 50 per 24 Hours especially after you pay a higher premium for the room Parking was validated at half price upon check out to 24 00 but to be honest I would expect Free parking for guests who stay at the hotel not just half price , The Room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in It had great facilities The Staff were ever so helpful The hotel itself was light bright spacious with contemporary d cor and everything you would expect from a London location It was amazing and just a stones throw from The O2 Arena I was suitably impressed 
15264,Intercontinental London The O2, Would like a lower key bar as well as what is there After a madness concert it was a bit high brow but we went anyway , The room had everything the room service was great at 3am and the whole experience wow d my girlfriend
15265,Intercontinental London The O2, Being woken up at 3 in the morning by the people next door having a party in their room I did phone down to reception and they did rectify the situation , Everything it was lovely 
15266,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was particularly poor at 25 a head Lukewarm undercooked bacon barely browned toast what appeared to be not very good quality ingredients , Really clean comfortable with excellent facilities 2 mins from O2
15267,Intercontinental London The O2, Upsetting that some of your guests woke us at 2am banging on our door others swearing shouting obscenities half dressed and when asked to be quiet by my wife was bombarded with abuse not directly the hotels fault but there is a duty of care for your guests and you did know you had a mass company xmas celebration and security should have been on some floors to counter this our room was changed immediately but still experienced guest disturbances , The friendliness of the staff was lovely and so helpful the hotel was always clean tidy comfortable 
15268,Intercontinental London The O2, Only a small thing but it was quite busy in the bar and there were not enough staff to cope with the demand , The rooms were very nice and the staff exceptionally helpful The whole hotel was spotlessly clean and the bar on the upper floor was very nice with a good view of Canary Wharf
15269,Intercontinental London The O2, 12 5 Service Charge for what service Should have a shuttle service to and from the tube station golf buggy , Staff were EXCELLENT and the hotel is beautiful 
15270,Intercontinental London The O2, Not a hotel that you would walk to at night without feeling vulnerable however tube station is only 5 minutes away and we had no problem getting taxis , Good for traveling south of the river As you would expect congestion on roads across the river means taxi travel is very slow during rush hour Staff and facilities great bed very comfortable a great night s sleep Unbeatable for O2 
15271,Intercontinental London The O2, A bit pricey in the bar and general cost of food and drink within the hotel was expensive, Very comfortable bed Probably the best I ve ever slept in Excellent views from the room Ideal location for the O2
15272,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast we only received great coffee when we asked for strong coffee it seems that they only have one strength weak unless you ask for a espresso breakfast was great dinner the previous night was so slow , This hotel staff and management go out of their way to deal with all issues that are raised if expectations are not met 
15273,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The beds are so comfortable and the view at breakfast was great The staff when greeted are so friendly and make you feel so welcome I wont stop anywhere else again in the uk apart from at these complexes
15274,Intercontinental London The O2, For me its always the tea and coffee sugar milk etc never enough I know you can ask for more but it would be nice to have enough so you don t have to minor thing I know, We went to a concert at the 02 and this hotel is excellent for this you don t even get wet when walking to the 02 if its raining that is Rooms very clean and beds very comfortable 
15275,Intercontinental London The O2, Everything was excellent However we missed biscuits in our room , The accommodation was excellent the staff well trained and extremely polite efficient and well super 
15276,Intercontinental London The O2, The main hotel staff were lovely but those in the 18th bar were a bit pretentious when we had a quick pre concert drink and it was quiet the lady who served us was lovely but when we returned after the event and it was busy the staff behaved as if we were an inconvenience when you re paying nearly 10 for a beer it shouldn t be too much to ask to have a glass with it , The location was perfect for the O2 and the bed was amazingly comfortable 
15277,Intercontinental London The O2, Food and drinks are overpriced but it is a beautiful hotel so we could see past it The price to stay was also not bad at all , The bed was so comfy blackout curtains were great too Fabulous nights sleep Loved how there is a tunnel going straight from the O2 Arena to the hotel after the concert straight in the hotel 30 seconds after concert had finished Our bed had also been turned down curtains pulled and slippers out next to the bed The Bose speaker in the bathroom linked to the TV was fabulous too Will definitely be booking this hotel with every show we see at The O2 from now on Great being able to go to the Rooftop Bar in the evening 
15278,Intercontinental London The O2, I was booked in at 3pm for a king sized deluxe room Was told on arrival shortly after 3pm that my room wouldn t be ready for another 30 mins but if I wanted I could have a room with 2 single beds I said i d wait and the lady on reception said she would pass me my key when it was ready 30 minutes later and still sat in reception I asked a male member of staff for help He found my room instantly and was very helpful But I felt if I hadn t spoken to him I would ve still been sat there , Lovely clean room and really liked the ease of getting to the O2 arena for my gig Hotel was very clean and modern

15284,Intercontinental London The O2, A small remark is we have stayed at the hotel twice and each occasion we have had to ask twice for coffee at our table during breakfast , Very relaxing and treated as equals
15285,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We stayed as we were attending a gig at the O2 and it was very well located for that and avoided the aggro of getting home An expensive Hotel but good service comfortable rooms and bed two well located bars and a restaurant we enjoyed but was probably 20 over priced A very enjoyable and relaxed even decadent over night stay and Jess GLynne was excellent
15286,Intercontinental London The O2, Wonderful hotel but at almost 300 per night it could ve been a bit more plush Also be aware that the location is in a newly developed part of London So if you re in town to site see you will need to take the underground a fair distance or pay for a cab , The rooms were very clean and modern The bed comfortable and the staff incredibly helpful and polite 
15287,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing springs to mind, The views were amazing especially at the Sky Bar on the 18th floor at night The Christmas decorations were beautiful Staff couldn t be more helpful friendly We also tried the water taxi bus back into the City it was wonderful
15288,Intercontinental London The O2, Queue at breakfast could have been dealt with a little more quickly, Facilities and closeness to O2 Friendly and efficient staff Very comfy beds perfect at the end of a busy day 
15289,Intercontinental London The O2, Quite a challenge to get to on foot from the underground due to work going on in O2, Pool Was super with jacuzzi and sauna each end Love the crushed ice as well great rest to recover from the awards ceremony and party Good across the water views of canary wharf
15290,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, This hotel is perfect I stay in hotels once or twice a month with either work or for some relaxation time and if you re looking to stay in London by far one of the best hotels for your money Great staff great food beautiful grounds beautiful rooms lovely spa and right next to the o2 
15291,Intercontinental London The O2, Service at breakfast could have been a tad better but still I am nit picking now Our table wasn t properly set and waited a bit to get cutlery condiments coffee which was unfortunately not hot by the time we did get it , We were upgraded to a beautiful river view room on the 13th floor It was lovely with great views 
15292,Intercontinental London The O2, The only downside to this hotel was the breakfast The staff seemed to be rushing around so my feeling was that there were not enough staff on duty The service was too slow and the queues unacceptably too long We gave up and ate downstairs worth the extra money and lovely people, All the staff were wonderful polite and friendly 
15293,Intercontinental London The O2, Struggling to find a single thing , Nothing was too much trouble for the staff It is a beautiful place contemporary yet comfortable Will definitely be returning 
15294,Intercontinental London The O2, For price paid should receive breakfast with no extra charge , Staff were friendly brilliant location for O2 Bed extremely comfy Room and bathroom gorgeous

15302,Intercontinental London The O2, Although the hotel arranged the taxi for me it did not come on time because of traffic The hotel staff got a taxi fro the station but it would be better if the hotel have black cab bay , All staff were so attentive 
15303,Intercontinental London The O2, The only downside was breakfast was 30 each per day which was a little steep so we had ours in the o2 building where there were quite a few choices at a fraction of the price , The bed was super comfy staff were friendly and helpful and the nighttime view from our room was breathtaking Convenient walkway to o2 makes it even more perfect as we were there for 2 days at the tennis finals 
15304,Intercontinental London The O2, On request I asked for a room on a high level and when I got there I was offered a room on the 4th floor and only after another request was I able to get a room on a higher floor, The quality of the room and the view

15307,Intercontinental London The O2, We didn t have breakfast at the hotel as we re not big eaters on a morning so 25 each was too expensive , Fabulous facilities great room superb bathroom the most comfortable bed and the best service I ve had at any hotel ever 
15308,Intercontinental London The O2, The view from our room We were probably at the side of the hotel looking over all pipes No view, The rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds Breakfast was excellent and staff were all very helpful 
15309,Intercontinental London The O2, Parking there is so much space unused I feel that the parking should be included in the price of booking 50 for 24hrs but if staying at hotel 25 00 for 24hrs , Outstanding facilities Spa was fabulous we did not use the restaurant as stayed in the city until late and ate there But they looked very inviting and definitely want to return and use Very close to jubilee line and clipper boats taking you to the city both a 5 min walk from hotel Rooms very comfortable spacious well equipped large comfortable bed with excellent linen good range of free beverages and large flat screen tv Fantastic being able to use the pool and spa facilities after a busy day in the city to unwind as did not close until 24 00hrs 
15310,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We didn t avail of breakfast or any of the hotel facilities as it was a rushed stay attending an event at the 02 However I give this hotel ten out of ten The staff are very professional helpful and friendly The large room had a beautiful view of the estuary and skyscrapers The king sized bed was so comfortable and the pillows were sublime it was like sleeping in a hug We arrived early 1pm and the staff were exceptionally kind and allowed us to check in early Check out is 12pm which is excellent There is a walk way from the hotel to the 02 which closes at 1am I will definitely be returning to this hotel 
15311,Intercontinental London The O2, Liked everything really not much to improve on in my opinion , The beds were so comfy did not want to get up also the pillows were the best i have slept on in a hotel for along time Staff very helpful and polite 
15312,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Very friendly service staff couldnt do more for me and the hotel facilities were great The room was also very well designed with great views over London Will most certainly be staying here again 
15313,Intercontinental London The O2, The changing rooms of the spa had really dirty floors as people were allowed to walk with normal shoes Also the changing rooms and toilets were flooded with water from the showers All that did not seem very hygienic Also the tea spoons in our room had not been cleaned from previous use , We enjoyed great views from most windows and the breakfast had everything We liked the pool very much and were almost alone there All of the staff was extremely friendly We were allowed to rearrange our booking to a different day even though our room was not refundable That was very nice of them 
15314,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Everything was perfect facilities views proximity to the O2 was amazing and breakfast was great quality with loads of choice Will definitely return We live in London but just wanted a nice local weekend away from our usual surroundings Thanks especially to Oscar for all his help at check in 
15315,Intercontinental London The O2, A room only rate of 149 GBP is a bit expensive My daughter has a very serious allergy to nuts for which she has to have nut free meals When we visited the restaurant there was no real understanding of food allergies and apart form checking with the chef there was no real effort made to resolve the issue Because the hotel could not provide food we had to travel to get suitable food , Very friendly staff beautiful hotel 
15316,Intercontinental London The O2, Although connected to the 02 sort of it is a long walk to and from the main 02 entrance not helped by building work going on at the moment , Room was exceptional Very clean with a lovely roomy bathroom Staff very attentive and the views from the bar stunning 
15317,Intercontinental London The O2, A minor dislike was paying for the car parking facility I think hotel guests should get their tickets validated , Excellent rooms with very comfy beds 
15318,Intercontinental London The O2, We couldn t get into the sky bar on the 18th floor as it has a maximum capacity we had been to a concert and you couldn t reserve was very much a first come first serve None of the other bars had a capacity limited , Room hotel was fantastic perfect location for visitors going to the O2 Staff were friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable Pillows were very soft A very nice treat indeed Didn t go to the spa as was literally there for a concert 
15319,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing couldn t fault it , Fantastic hotel great location adjacent to the O2 wonderful view from our very well appointed room superb breakfast and very helpful staff

15321,Intercontinental London The O2, Ridiculously expensive drinks in the Sky Eighteen Bar on the 18th Floor , Sparkly clean very comfortable beds friendly and courteous staff great location for the O2 Bar with pretty night views on 18th floor 
15322,Intercontinental London The O2, Reception staff didn t have the greatest spoken English but perhaps they are there for their proficiency in other languages, Proximity to O2 arena So easy to get to the concert 
15323,Intercontinental London The O2, I failed to get the coffee machine to actually produce a cup of coffee Baffling since it was exactly the same one that I have at home However all was remedied by being given free coffee in the coffee bar by way of compensation , Stayed for one night when I went to a concert at the O2 I think this was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I ve experienced And definitely the best pillows ever Lovely shower too My room had a great view across the river and the covered walkway to the O2 was very welcome 
15324,Intercontinental London The O2, It wasn t made clear via booking com that there was parking on site which there is and ample , The staff were fantastic and the hotel was amazing Rooms were just something else and the views from the restaurants and bars Just brilliant

15326,Intercontinental London The O2, The service at breakfast wasn t that good we had to wait quite a while for our tea and coffee and even longer for the milk When it eventually arrived the tea and coffee was cold We watched a waitress wipe a table with her bare hand and then handle the cutlery which we didn t think was very hygenic Considering the service wasn t that good we were not impressed with the 12 5 service charge , The room was very comfortable with a lovely view Room was very clean and well equipped The hotel was so convenient for the 02
15327,Intercontinental London The O2, Prices in the sky bar 45 for a bottle of Prosecco plus a service charge on top of that , Next door to and linked with the O2 parking reasonable for location and easy access to and from hotel
15328,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Perfect location as I was taking my daughter for a birthday treat to the 02 Access to the Arena was easily accessible from the hotel which was fabulous Hotel was really comfortable the staff were extremely helpful especially Graham the doorman who greeted us on arrival and was there to say goodbye 
15329,Intercontinental London The O2, Hotel charge was 166 00 for twin room for 1night Breakfast was NOT included having to pay an extra 24 00 for parking I find this outrageously expensive especially as we hadn t even spent 24hours there Very disappointed in the cost not good value for money , The room was very nice the location easy access into the 02 was perfect 
15330,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful i enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend this hotel to anyway looking to stay in London the location cant not be beaten i put in a request to the hotel and they were more then happy to help and made my staff very welcome great hotel great staff and couldn t ask for much better 
15331,Intercontinental London The O2, The price is crazy and the breakfast was 25pounds per head , Not very much the hotel is in the middle of nowhere Totally ghastly and expensive but you are stuck if you want to go to O2 My friend was ill and could not come no refund from Booking Como I won t use you again sometimes you have to be more understanding 
15332,Intercontinental London The O2, The main doors to the rooms need the hinges oiling as they creak when opened and closed plus the door closers should be adjusted to prevent slamming Found the noise of this in neighbouring rooms quite annoying , The bath shower room was fantastic and the bed so comfy Staff so polite and helpful great stay 
15333,Intercontinental London The O2, , Fantastic staff friendly genuine and professional Huge comfy bed soft pillows great view delicious food Tassimo coffee machine was a great touch We loved the bar on the top floor the London skyline panoramic views were the best I have seen The 02 is literally next door so this is the best hotel to link with a concert
15334,Intercontinental London The O2, The Skybar was nice but quite pricey , Great location for the O2 Arena The river view rooms have a nice outlook especially at night Extensive breakfast range Hotel is a 10 minute stroll from the North Greenwich underground station so very easy to get to There s also a pub within 10 minutes walking distance of the hotel 
15335,Intercontinental London The O2, I can not fault this hotel We had no problems finding it and there was plenty of on site parking too I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again , The staff from the moment we got there were very helpful and polite The hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in We had no problems at all getting to our concert on time as the hotel is next door to the O2 arena The rooms were superb and we had a lovely view of the O2 and the docklands from our room The bed was so comfortable and the room was very spacious After the concert we sat in the bar on the 18th floor and drank cocktails while looking out at the night view The service was excellent We then had room service and ordered a late dinner and the food was great and was delivered to our room in no time at all And was set up on a table In the morning we had breakfast and there was a large selection of food and even catered for vegetarians so my daughter was happy Our stay was great and the hotel is amazing with friendly welcoming staff 
15336,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing major perhaps the route from the Tube could be a bit more pedestrian friendly and the mini bar was on the pricey side But all in all these were insignificant and would not stop me from staying again and again , From Jennifer s courteous and professional welcome at check in to Tamara s warm and friendly service in the Clipper Bar what a view everything about my stay was perfect The beautifully appointed rooms were extremely comfortable and quiet 
15337,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff were lovely and extremely friendly My daughter and I felt very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our stay I would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend it to all my friends and family 
15338,Intercontinental London The O2, Rather small room for what we paid but view made it worth it , Delicious full English breakfast An array of juices pots of tea smoothies fresh fruit on offer Every pastry you could imagine from french croissant to fried bread 
15339,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Was met at the entrance and escorted to the checking in desk Our bags were taken up to our rooms Excellent service all round Will certainly be staying again 
15340,Intercontinental London The O2, When booked specified it was for my 21st birthday disappointed at lack of knowledge from staff or anything extra, Nice view of the river though partially blocked by L shape of building
15341,Intercontinental London The O2, Wish I could have stayed longer , Me and my boyfriend absolutely loved the Intercontinental hotel I booked the Superior King Room after having read several positive reviews so my expectations were high and I was not disappointed It was our best hotel experience together from the moment of check in to check out never seen such polite friendly and welcoming staff before Amazing customer service from the reception to the bar restaurant and the great spa facilities too It was his birthday so I requested for something special in the room and what a pleasant surprise we got the views the roses and even a free slice of cake which really made us feel special The bed is very comfortable the room impeccably clean everything is new and fresh very modern too we came back very relaxed and wanting to stay more What a hotel Simply the best well done everyone I highly recommend it and will be spreading the word Keep up the good work 
15342,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Large bed View from room and bars restaurants Friendly staff High tech rooms lighting and speaker in bathroom Our mini bar was emptied after requested I said it was my partners birthday and the hotel put a happy birthday cake in our room waiting for us when we arrived nice touch The spa was lovely
15343,Intercontinental London The O2, Brilliant hotel Amazing in every way My only gripe is that the jacuzzi water was quite cold Which put my Mrs off but when we alerted the hotel staff they we re very apologetic and turned the temperature up ,No Positive
15344,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff were excellent from the moment we got to the front door til the time we left The choice at breakfast was unbelievable The rooms was very comfortable The whole thing was brilliant 
15345,Intercontinental London The O2, The bedroom coffee machine was rubbish A hotel of this standard should have a Nespresso machine Some of the breakfast buffet staff seemed quite disinterested and we had to wait quite a while over 30 mins for our coffees but this wouldn t put me off returning again , Go for it A large modern quality upscale yet friendly hotel at a reasonable price for London A visit to the Skybar is a must The breakfast buffet is quite nice too Excellent welcome check in bravo to the young Irish gentleman Standard rooms quite small but impeccable and well designed Ours had a view over the river and the 02 skywalk Five minutes walk from the tube line and surprisingly easy access from Gatwick airport I would recommend this to anyone 
15346,Intercontinental London The O2, If I had to fault Something it would be the pillows were a little thick but thats really just trying to find a fault , The Sky bar IS absolutely beautiful Coffee Machine in my room with the awesome breakfast display 
15347,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The overall cleanliness of the hotel was second to none as were the facilities and attention to detail throughout Beautiful room and incredibly comfortable bed The leisure facilties were spotless Would highly recommend the steam room

15349,Intercontinental London The O2, We used the swimming pool and facilities in the morning Having only two showers available was not enough as there were a number of women wanting to shower at the same time Drainage very poor around the showers there too , Great rooms beds very luxurious Loved the speakers in the bathroom so you could listen to the TV radio Staff very friendly and happy to help you Options for breakfast were brilliant something for everyone 
15350,Intercontinental London The O2, I couldn t fault anything , Being greeted by a happy member of staff before even entering the hotel Helpful and friendly reception staff The cleanliness of the room and the amazing choice at breakfast 
15351,Intercontinental London The O2, Marks and wear and tear on furniture in clipper bar and gents shower needed unblocking I mentioned this to a member of staff who said she would mention this to someone but I presumed they knew because whilst I was in shower a towel was sitting near door on floor presumably to soak water up so as it didn t flow into the next shower, Closeness to the o2 our reason For coming to London
15352,Intercontinental London The O2, My room was 470 00 and night and 2 ladies 8 rooms down paid 220 they stayed 1 night and we stayed for 2 for Some room I thought I d upgrade mine but it was the the same room and view but they did say they would move me in second night but we said it was to much hassle to pack and unpack again, Pool was lovely and bed was so nice and soft cover
15353,Intercontinental London The O2, Liked everything, It was perfect for us to attend a concert at the O2 We didn t even have to step outside as they have a corridor straight into the arena The room was beautiful the beds big and super comfortable We will definitely stay again on our next visit
15354,Intercontinental London The O2, Only a slight detail due to 24 a night parking fee I was lucky I only had to pay 48 but if I d stayed longer obviously it would have been more , The comfort and hospitality at the hotel was outstanding also the spa facilities made you feel so relaxed 
15355,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t find the stairs beyond the 2nd floor no signs so had to find a staff member There were lots of other guests with same problem as the lifts were full Good job it wasn t an emergency situation, Very friendly staff Clean and luxurious 
15356,Intercontinental London The O2, The room got a bit stuffy and there wasn t a window to open we couldn t feel the effects of the air con , Great location we attended a concert at the o2 arena and chose this hotel based on its close proximity and it didn t disappoint Good choice of restaurants and bars nearby plus the underground being a ten minute walk away Hotel was clean and well presented pleasant view from the hotel window 
15357,Intercontinental London The O2, TV didn t work correctly even though they tried to get someone to fix it, Direct access to O2 from the hotel Incredibly comfortable bed Stunning 8th floor bar 
15358,Intercontinental London The O2, Great choice at the breakfast buffet but was not replenished quickly enough This was probably due to the hotel being incredibly busy , The staff were incredibly helpful and polite The room was tastefully furnished with great views of Canary Wharf 
15359,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing everything was perfect , Everything was perfect staff were brilliant and really friendly the hotel room was out of this world we really enjoyed staying here and will defiantly be coming back again 
15360,Intercontinental London The O2, I have been charged extra for using my debit card but I have to wait a week to get refunded Not happy with this, The bed was really comfortable staff amazingly helpful

15363,Intercontinental London The O2, Dreadful Pre Concert 2 course meal Would never have that again service was very poor Huge queues for breakfast the next day went back to our room for nearly an hour but the breakfast was lovely when we eventually got it , Lovely room with view overlooking the Thames Great pillows Staff very helpful Perfect venue for the O2
15364,Intercontinental London The O2, It took me more than an hour to check in just because of my name was mistakenly recorded and the receptionist female blacks hair tie high kept that from me all the time without any apologies You know that after a long flight my almost 3 year old son was very exhausted and sleepy The attitude of the black receptionist was so bad that I doubted whether this was a five star hotel and I swore that I would never book this hotel and told all my friends , The view looking from the window is great 
15365,Intercontinental London The O2, Only 1 cup per person so if you had a tea later a coffee you had to wash the cup in the bathroom not ideal Room was too warm at night could not get temperature under 20 this woke us both on the night as the room was stuffy , Great facilities in the rooms everything was thought of Great cocktails in the Clipper Bar 
15366,Intercontinental London The O2, I know I left my high speed charger in the room I called three times for someone to get back to me The third person did however it was gone Spa Not very theraputic as kids were splashing and screaming in the pool , Very comfy beds Warm welcome and helpful staff Happy and friendly staff concierge cleaners and reception Spa modern clean steam sauna and pool Best location for o2 and surroundings Food excellent 
15367,Intercontinental London The O2, The private hotel access to the O2 it works going to the O2 but not in reverse as the O2 shut the access door to the hotel link far too early and you cant get back leaving a very long walk round, Very courteous and helpful doorman Standard of food and restaurant service very high
15368,Intercontinental London The O2, Price of food and drink , Fruit was poor in room Pillows awful wasn t very equipped for children superb views of the 02 bit expensive to eat and drink lovely hotel tho 
15369,Intercontinental London The O2, Have no complaints at all For the price it s unfortunately not going to be a regular thing but if you ve got the money spare or want to treat yourself I can thing of nowhere better near this location , Stayed for the Brook fight at the o2 and thought we d treat ourselves and got luxury for the whole stay Large new clean stylish room 3 bars situated all throughout the hotel busy but quick service literally a 2 minute walk to the o2 arena through a pathway from the reception and staff always happy to help May even catch a few celebrities boxers there if there s an event on at the o2 
15370,Intercontinental London The O2, Be aware the o2 close some of their exits from the venue once the show has started Turns a 5 min walk back to H tel into 30 mins My mum was disabled and really struggled and the o2 weren t willing to help ,No Positive
15371,Intercontinental London The O2, Location great for the 02 but not if you also want to go into central London as 2 3 tube changes Breakfast very expensive though good food As no opening windows need to be able to alter the air con temp which we couldn t ,No Positive
15372,Intercontinental London The O2, Price of breakfast I enjoyed it and selection was good but 28 inc SC for a buffet is a bit high in my opinion I also think charging for service when you basically serve yourself is a bit cheeky , This place was a dream Particularly liked the Tassimo machine in the room Best nights sleep I think I ve had in a hotel Little touches here and there gave it the luxury feel 
15373,Intercontinental London The O2, we would have liked to go into the 18 floor bar for a drink after watching a show in the o2 but was full also we found breakfast to be expensive for what we had so a bit disappointed , we were made to feel very welcome and the room was very comfortable we slept well we thought the hotel is a great place to stay as we were going to the 02 to watch a show 
15374,Intercontinental London The O2, The breakfast we had inclusive breakfast with the room Our tea coffee order was incorrect and we were presented with a bill for someone else s room The food was not cooked well and of inferior quality , Bed and room view paid for a river view were amazing staff welcoming and attentive Facilities cleanliness and location are faultless 
15375,Intercontinental London The O2, Not enough staff in market brasserie Busy but not full and staff overwhelmed Had to cancel main course as no time to eat before concert Would ve expected extra staff numbers to be on duty at busy times Staff were polite though Waited over hour and had to request drinks etc, Bed and linen very comfy and high quality All room facilities excellent Staff willing and happy 
15376,Intercontinental London The O2, Walkway from North Greenwich tube is partially gravel needs to be properly paved but I am sure it s a work in progress given how new the hotel is , Amazing hotel right next to the O2 Amazing staff amazing bar on 18th floor super comfy beds great views great in room dining 
15377,Intercontinental London The O2, Service was dire the hotel can t cope with a full compliment of guests totally disorganised Staff were polite and apologetic but waiting times were long We were waiting 45 mins to get served in the restaurant and we told them when booking we needed a reasonable turnaround We had to leave in the end without eating or we would have missed the show They should be more honest when taking your table booking we would have been happy to eat elsewhere and would have left with a better impression of the Hotel Many of the guests were complaining some had been waiting 60 mins and still nothing on the table , Convenient for O2
15378,Intercontinental London The O2, Early evening service in the Brasserie was dismal and chaotic Service in the Millenium Bar after 11pm show finish almost non existent , Great views Comfortable room
15379,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Absolutely amazing service Attention to detail terrific Staff went out of their way for us We couldn t get a taxi and the wonderful concierge got the hotel car and drove us to the bus stop nothing was too much trouble I have nothing but praise for this hotel Breakfast was fantastic 
15380,Intercontinental London The O2, Didn t have the breakfast as I thought it expensive but sure it would have been prepared as everything else very well If you don t mind the cost , Location to O2 Everything about the room Staff very friendly and helpful
15381,Intercontinental London The O2, We were unable to get access to the Skyline bar on the 18th floor after the concert due to crowding and the service is the downstairs bars was not great Long waits , The bed was extremely comfortable and the choices for breakfast outstanding The staff were extremely customer focused and our room had outstanding views It was very well placed for the 02 
15382,Intercontinental London The O2, Way too few bar staff in the Eighteen Bar Only two staff making drinks Needed at least double that for an hour or so We had an inordinate wait to get a drink , Top class room and general facilities Pleasant and helpful staff 
15383,Intercontinental London The O2, This is an expensive hotel with high standard furnishings facilities etc What a pity then that the service could be so much better Once you managed to get someone to serve you they were excellent but getting someone to come to you is the problem NOT enough staff in relation to guests At breakfast customers were made to wait while tables were cleared despite the fact that the tables had been vacated some considerable time earlier Finally when checking in they promote the skybar on floor 18 We attempted to do this after the show we had been to waited for a lift as they were very busy only to be told the skybar was full when we REACHED the 18th floor Customers should have been alerted in reception area NOT good customer service , The rooms furnishings all excellent Breakfast selection amazing 
15384,Intercontinental London The O2, Hotel was full due to concert at 02 and it worked ok for us as we didn t mind having a drink after concert rather than queuing for hotel lift Some people just like to complain we heard them We on the other hand loved our stax and would definitely stay again , Amazing spa comfortable room stunning views from room and bar Breakfast had a great range of choices Fantastic choice after a night at O2 felt very smug being able to walk home 
15385,Intercontinental London The O2, very busy expect full as a major star was performing at the O2 which we attended Queue to check in and for breakfast in the morning Not ideal for a 5 star But small gripe , Excellent staff Spa area beautiful Lovely quiet bedrooms and being linked into the 02 perfect 
15386,Intercontinental London The O2, The sky bar was full which wasn t a problem as they said it is first come first served however they could have told the queue of people waiting by the lifts downstairs so they didn t waste their time And then the barman in the clipper bar tried to serve someone who arrived after me despite me telling him I was there first In the end he served us both but the queue jumper got his drinks first and then paid first I say barman he was wearing a suit and looked more like a manager Very rude and not what I expect from such an expensive bar It wouldn t have been so bad if we weren t left waiting so long to be served previous to this as they didn t have enough staff to cope with the post concert rush , Other than the minor pain in the bar everything else was great The Location is great Everything was almost impeccably tidy Great staff and great rooms 
15387,Intercontinental London The O2, As a lot of guests were staying because of the concert at O2 having so few staff serving in the bars afterward was short sighted We waited 30 minutes in the Merdian bar and still had not been able to order THE SAME FOR MANY OTHER GUESTS then we then left and went to the sky bar and were not even allowed in as we were told it was full we then went to the clipper bar and got served after about 15 minutes but had to stand and whilst I do not like to complain that is unreasonable in a 5 star hotel at the prices you charge and my girlfriend is 7 months pregnant I don t even have to wait that long in a Premier Inn A lot of other people also got fed up and left without being served so it isn t just us that were fed up at being ignored , really nice room and friendly staff mostly 
15388,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, We stayed at this hotel as we were going to a show at the O2 perfect as the venue was only a short walk away about 10 min and there was a covered walkway from the hotel to the O2 Staff were exceptional and were always smiling nothing was too much trouble Will stay again without a doubt
15389,Intercontinental London The O2, Sounds silly but not enough milk and tea facilities in the room After a long journey to London a nice cuppa before unpacking and venturing out again would have been lovely but we felt we had to save the milk for a cup of tea in the morning , Everything about our stay was fantastic from being greeted at the door super friendly staff to the slippers and bathrobes in the room Wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying again In fact we are already planning our next London trip 
15390,Intercontinental London The O2, The Brasserie restaurant was appalling The worst service I have ever experienced in a hotel like this I walked out without paying That s how bad it was Very annoyed , Location

15392,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing to dislike , It was perfect for us to be able to attend the Andrea Bocelli concert in the 02 arena as its right next door with easy access to the 02 through a connecting walkway 
15393,Intercontinental London The O2, Expensive car park for the type of hotel car park should be accommodated for rather than paying more Poor room view was told I would have a nice view but got a view of a roof ,No Positive
15394,Intercontinental London The O2, View could of been better but if you want a good view it does say you need to pay more Which was probably worth it but could still see a lot from our room Only other problem is finding the entrance first time It is a bit of a walk but walking through the O2 is great , Plenty of places to eat near by if you don t fancy the menu at the hotel Just walk through the O2 to see them all Tube system is literally a 5 minute walk away and the emirates air rail is 10 minutes away both great for getting around and seeing sites throughout London The beds are very comfortable and the rooms look prestige Bathroom looks amazing too Upon entrance to the hotel you re greeted very politely and even walked over to the check in desk where the staff are fantastic and tell you all about the local area and explain everything clearly The entrance lobby looks fantastic too 
15395,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk from tube to hotel is disrupted by building work and the path is gravel in places not great with a wheeled suitcase It s only 4 or 6 minutes depending on which exit from the tube but its a shame as everything else was fabulous , Fabulous room very nice bar
15396,Intercontinental London The O2, A little bit expensive on just a bite to eat , Extremely comfy beds amazing soft bedding loved the duvet and the pillows All staff was heavenly professional and at your service at any time Views to die for you can see Londons skyline from everywhere the rooftop bar is fab

15404,Intercontinental London The O2, The price of drinks at the bar were ridiculously expensive, The hotel was lovely Food was fantastic Bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I ve ever slept in 
15405,Intercontinental London The O2, During the night in one of the rooms nearby there was a lot of noise well past 2 in the morning Nothing was done about this which did disturb our sleep immensely , The facilities in both the hotel and room were second to none and the views from our room and 18th Floor Bar were amazing As we were seeing a show in the O2 it was the perfect location for us 
15406,Intercontinental London The O2, Coffee machine in the room leaked but it was quickly rectified by a member of staff, The staff we re all very friendly and efficient breakfast was excellent the gentleman that welcomed us at the door was very very helpful

15409,Intercontinental London The O2, I had included breakfast in our stay on Booking com and even upgraded our stay to ensure this However on going down to breakfast we were advised this was not included and I would need to pay 25 per person When I checked my confirmation email there was nothing to confirm I had selected this option I am 100 sure however I had selected this on Booking com as there was the green icon breakfast included and when I pressed book it had another breakfast included icon to confirm again I found this really embarrassing On checking out we were charged 2 full English breakfasts 25 each where I only had the continental I had confirmed this with the waiters at the time and advised I only had a bowl of porridge The staff on checkout were not too helpful and tried to advise breakfast included means you still have to pay They seemed very put out and made many phone calls in clarifying what I had that morning They finally charged me for my continental however this was 20 which is a very expensive bowl of porridge I ve lost my trust in Booking com as it cost me a lot more than I had budgeted and there was nothing to defend me I didn t find the member of staff on checkout helpful in this matter , Food was exceptional and our room was lovely The hotel is quiet at night ensuring a good nights sleep 
15410,Intercontinental London The O2, the free wifi in the room was too slow to be use even for simple email Business center was very disappointing not a good option for work unless you pay extra ,No Positive
15411,Intercontinental London The O2, A lift to and from the station would have been very welcome due to the building work the walk with a youngster and a suitcase to such an accommodation property would have made our stay perfect and truly value for money , Fantastic location staff were so helpful and informative Room was so comfy with everything we could need Breakfast was a real treat 
15412,Intercontinental London The O2, I didn t have Sky Sports in the room not a major issues but after a day of travel me my wife son where tired and wanted to head back to the room there was big premier league game on and I couldn t watch it and none of the bars in the hotel seemed to have a TV But as I said it was only a minor grip and did not impact on the rest of a very enjoyable stay in a top hotel , Excellent location for the O2 staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for you Darragh on check in was particularly helpful would highly recommended this hotel if you are taking in a show or event in the O2 
15413,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Check in was very well conducted and quick with everything explained and any questions answered efficiently Rooms were very well presented and all was as advertised Well worth the expense to stay on site at the O2 
15414,Intercontinental London The O2, Trip hazard going from room to bathroom Reported this on check out some windows at the approach to the hotel were cracked The walk from and to the tube station was not the safest due to what looks like unfinished paths Maybe a shuttle bus would be an improvement The cost of items in the mini bar 3 50 for a KITKAT Calling the hotel when using the automated service to speak to the right person No one answers the phone , Friendly staff Good selection at breakfast A nice surprise in our room due to a celebration 
15415,Intercontinental London The O2, It was odd watching TV and the sound going into the bathroom Would have been nice to turn the speaker off , A beautiful hotel with friendly staff and luxurious bed and plenty to do

15418,Intercontinental London The O2, The prices were very high in the bar for drinks as well as the breakfast which was 50 for 2 or 25 each This priced us out the breakfast which was not ideal as we did not want to pay that figure The mini bar in the room and its contents were expensive so we did not partake in these particularly for a can of coke or 4 finger kitkat so that was a bit frustrating A small 350ml bottle of wine Chardonnay was 25 from the minibar which equates to about 2 medium glasses so 12 50 a glass Overall good price for the room of 132 but some of the extras were expensive , The facilities and room were extremely good clean and no expense spared on any of the fixtures and fittings The sky bar was very impressive on the 18th floor with the views of the river Thames and city skyline

15420,Intercontinental London The O2, Location is great for weekends but a hassle to get to the city or even to city airport because of Blackwell Tunnel A shuttle to North Greenwich tube station would be good A shuttle ferry connecting to the North bank of the river even better , New clean and comfy Spectacular views

15422,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Lovely clean hotel enough staff around to tend to your needs breakfast was fabulous so much choice in again a big clean restaurant and plenty of staff available 
15423,Intercontinental London The O2, Choice of bedding Even though feather down quilts and pillows are very luxurious it s too rustly for me and keeps me awake Biscuits in the room would be nice with the tea coffee facilities , Stayed here a few times now and love everything about this hotel the staff have really stepped upto the mark since first opening where we experienced a few teething problems very friendly and know what their doing A beautiful hotel Walkway to the 02 can t fault it

15428,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , The attention to detail in all respects was very impressive with service and servility to match The location which we were unsure about turned out to be ideal as within metres tube bus or taxi s were available We travelled by car but left it in the car park it was a pleasure to be without it Well done Intercontinental 
15429,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The bed was amazing and the room was well worth the money Loved the surprise cake for my partner that was put in the room prior to us arriving Can t fault this hotel 
15430,Intercontinental London The O2, The cost of the breakfast we did not have breakfast in the hotel , We loved the amazing views from our room as well as the food and the friendliness and efficiency of all of the staff from the doorman to the barman It was my husbands 40th and we had birthday cake left in the room as well as some that was bought to us after dinner which we thought was a lovely touch Overall we were very pleased and the found the rates to be good value 
15431,Intercontinental London The O2, The jacuzzi was broken in the spa the dessert menu for room service could be more extensive, The huge bed was super comfortable the staff were absolutely amazing so friendly and couldn t do enough for us the views were great at night time and we loved the coffee machine in our room

15435,Intercontinental London The O2, Path along the Thames from hotel to Greenwich was closed diverted due to all building development work taking place along the river on that part of the peninsula Breakfast was overpriced lacked value for money unaffordable We were not told about the Link between hotel and o2 by staff on checking in Lack of attention paid by staff in spa parts were dirty towels left lying around no water available by steam sauna batteries in weigh scales needs changing Jacuzzi jets not working Resented having to pay 48 24 per 24 hours for the hotel car park when it was empty and more importantly the barriers were up not working on exit Every opportunity to make money is used and abused , View over Thames from our bed was awesome Lighting in room was well thought out Real coffee machine was a bonus Toiletries provided were extensive 
15436,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk from North Greenwich station still seems like it is under construction not good on a rainy day but I m sure once the path is properly laid it will improve , Staff were lovely and welcoming rooms were so comfortable and had everything you need and more I wish I could have stayed longer and will definitely book again 
15437,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing negative to be honest , Staff were nice gave all the information I needed room was nice a little smaller than I had imagined but it was nice view could of been better but overall it was nice also offered me complimentary late chech out but I ended up not using it because of work hours but it was lovely and relaxing

15444,Intercontinental London The O2, I couldn t find the hotel using my sat nav If i typed the postcode i ended up somewhere else close by but no outside the hotel Took us a while to find the hotel , Came to spend the night here for my partners birthday I had contacted the hotel prior to our stay to see if they could decorate the room upon arrival which they did They sent a beautiful complimentary birthday cake to the room and decorated the bed with rose petals and a helium birthday balloon It was so amazing and really made my partner s day special Also breakfast was served to is in our bedroom in the morning and I cant even find words to explain how amazing breakfast was How it was all laid out on a table with everything we asked Service was amazing They helped with our luggage checking in and checking out Couldn t have asked for a better stay 
15445,Intercontinental London The O2, there was no toothpaste or toothbrush and I had to ask for vallet parking but staff was very helpful , the view was great the staff were very haplfull 
15446,Intercontinental London The O2, After negotiations we finally got a room on the top floor facing Canary Warf This hotel is all about the view which you don t have on the 4th floor We re still not sure why this was so difficult to organize as we had requested it and at our stay it was incredible quiet But we were very pleased that they finally accommodated us , its a 20 mins ride into town with the subway Very convenient Great value for money as the hotel is quiet when there is no major event in the O2 The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable with large windows to enjoy the view 
15447,Intercontinental London The O2, View from the room was of air conditioning units on the flat roof right outside the window Avoid the third floor if this is important otherwise great, Comfy bed good TV nice bathroom
15448,Intercontinental London The O2, The only problem we had was we went to an event at the o2 that finished at 3 in the morning there s a walk way that connects the hotel to the o2 but it shut at 1 had a long walk back to the hotel, Was a lovely hotel very warm welcome on arrival and staff were very helpful would definitely go back
15449,Intercontinental London The O2, Rough start ending up in a building site looking for reception Coming from north greenwich tube st use tha last entrance , Pool gym views high standard breakfast
15450,Intercontinental London The O2, The bed was like sleeping on a board in fact the floor felt softer If you like a little comfort and give in your mattress then don t stay here , I booked this hotel for the location and I wasn t disappointed it was also lovely inside and I had a good river view 
15451,Intercontinental London The O2, 1 Hygiene problem we found mold in our breakfast jam jar After the incident we tried to cancel our breakfast for the next coming days but they refused to and said they will consider it Not until we rreported to IHG in regards to this issue then the hotel agreed to refund the breakfast 2 Broken glass in the hallway outside our room for two days We saw the broken glass and expected someone to clean it up but no one had it cleaned until we reported to the reception to avoid any severe injuries 3 Housekeeping was not trained well The doors were not closed properly after service many times And room supplies was not properly filled everyday we had to remind them to bring certain things that they forgot to put in our room everyday Not to mention the organization of the room regarding the bed sheets things on the table were not properly placed 4 Guest relations They did not solve any problems of which we complained about until we reached IHG During check out I had to argue with the guest relation staff member about the cancelled breakfast that I had confirmed days ago Service and attitude was disappointing , Throughout my entire stay the only service that satisfied me was the doorman He was the only member of staff that didn t make me feel disrespected 
15452,Intercontinental London The O2, N A, Excellent very modern hotel nice room with a very comfy bed It has the convenience of having an easy access to the O2 if you are heading to any kind of show there Spa facilities great and staff also vey friendly and helpful 
15453,Intercontinental London The O2, If I could find a problem which would be hard I would have to say the surrounding area seemed very deralic , I thought the staff were simply amazing always very polite and willing to help 10 10
15454,Intercontinental London The O2, The other guests were so rude The hotel is too expensive for being so cut off from London better stay across the river Restaurants were under staffed Heating was uncontrollable , The spa is nice Good options for dining Nice flavours 
15455,Intercontinental London The O2, Sky bar drinks very very pricey 2 kopperberg 16 View was amazing though , I only have one word for this hotel outstanding the rooms were beautiful and so clean and the service was suberb Beautifully located and the facilities were amazing Our room had Thames view which was lovely Defiantly be back again
15456,Intercontinental London The O2, The breakfast was okay not the best that I have had at a hotel , We arrived at the hotel and was checked in quickly by one of the lovely staff Our room was on the 6th floor and we had an amazing view of river Thames and the O2 We returned from the event at the O2 and ordered room service and the steak and chunky fries was so delicious The bed is one of the most comfortable beds that I ve slept on 
15457,Intercontinental London The O2, breakfast a pretty expensive for the quality of the cooking and nearest other option would have been a tube ride over to canary wharf away likewise room service 25 for a plate of cheese went for the 14 50 slightly floppy pizza instead , big bed massive 17 metre pool decent steam room great check in staff plenty of parking and very near the tube 
15458,Intercontinental London The O2, Electronic card entry failed to work This is always very irritating when you arrive somewhere and all you want to do is get to your room Problem fixed very quickly so staff were great but this is an avoidable problem, Excellent helpful staff and took care of my bike which was very important to me 
15459,Intercontinental London The O2, The smoking area in the sky bar has wide gaps between the paving slabs I m told for drainage purposes My heel fell down the crack and scraped all of the fabric off my brand new shoes that if only worn for the very first time I was so disappointed A hotel of this standard should not have faults like that , Amazing room with comfy bed and black out curtains Had the best sleep Sky bar amazing but very expensive Staff very professional and polite 
15460,Intercontinental London The O2, Overpriced for what it was zero information given at check in no breakfast included milk was off in the tea facilities , Bed was super comfy and the bathroom was very nice 
15461,Intercontinental London The O2, Could be difficult to find without a satnav as there are very little signs around the o2 arena but that is really nit picking for faults, Very clean massive room and great view of the o2 arena and the Docks in the background from the 14th floor Staff were very friendly and the onsite parking was very secure and cheaper than others in the area Even though there was a festival happening next to the hotel we couldn t hear any of it at night which was great 
15462,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Fantastic hotel and service Used the hotel for cycling event next day and the hotel went above and beyond with the facilities laid on for the cyclists 
15463,Intercontinental London The O2, didn t like the hot tub jacuzzi didn t work but didn t spoil a great experience all round , Gorgeous room Top quality Felt brand new So good 
15464,Intercontinental London The O2, The cost for breakfast Whether 3 star or 5 star an egg is and egg bacon is bacon tea and coffee are hot flavoured drinks and none of these items cost much to buy regardless of the quality To charge 25ph per night for breakfast is insane I can make an amazing eggs benedict for 2ph or smoked salmon and scrambled eggs for 4ph No breakfast is worth more than 10 15 max ph sorry but it s just not We re a couple who might get for breakfast or might not But 50 would certainly dictate that decision Please reconsider your OTT breakfast pricing , Outstanding location with lots to see and do nearby The hotel itself was impeccable the staff were top quality where nothing was any trouble and the facilities inside the hotel are fantastic spa pool bars and restaurants Ate at the hotel a few times and the food was amazing Rooms lovely decor perfect the little touches throughout and staff going that extra mile with no hassle at all make all the difference I really can t speak highly enough of this hotel Thank you to all the staff who made our stay perfect

15466,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The service was second to none From the welcome at the door to the team checking you in who also reffered to me by name the following day Its the little things Also the view on the 18th floor bar Incredible 
15467,Intercontinental London The O2, Went up to the roof top bar to find a beautiful room with great views however a female member of staff came across very unprofessional and I was quite shocked wth the way my partner and I were treated All other staff and venue I rate 10 10,No Positive
15468,Intercontinental London The O2, The cost for food in room and restaurants were very expensive parking in hotel car park was very expensive so we parked elsewhere and walked 5 mins and saved 60 , They set up a cot for our 5 month daughter in our room which is were so pleased for Staff were very friendly and always smiling Service was fantastic 
15469,Intercontinental London The O2, The high cost of drinks definitely put us off having more than 1 drink so left the hotel earlier than we would ve liked to, The hotel grabs your attention from the outset with its modern classy look Staff were helpful and the direct tunnel to the O2 arena is fantastic Would definitely recommend and would stay here again 
15470,Intercontinental London The O2, Everything was great But parking a little expensive , The bed was very comfy There was a great choice choice for breakfast All staff were came across were really friendly 
15471,Intercontinental London The O2, Was told we would get a complementary upgrade to the club lounge but it was subsequently and mysteriously withdrawn Initially they reported that it was never offered later they stated that the receptionist made a misstatement It kind of left a bitter taste in an otherwise pleasant stay , Very friendly staff except for the initial experience described above Vaides the concierge was especially helpful 
15472,Intercontinental London The O2, The food and breakfast are very expensive because it s gourmet You can at in the nearby O2 arena outlets , New clean comfortable and great location for o2 and excel Beautiful pool and spa
15473,Intercontinental London The O2, Time taken to remake room Cooling from A C a bit of challenge Cld indulge guests a bit more with d little things considering it s actually rated as 5 star rather than put a charge on em every turn Not like guests can t afford em any ways but it d b Nice , Courteous polite staff Comfy bed Thorough Access to O2 centre
15474,Intercontinental London The O2, The air con in our room wasn t hugely effective The hotel wasn t well sign posted from the tube station , The bar has a lovely atmosphere There was an amazing patisserie selection in the bar perfect to go with a glass of bubbly The lobby was beautiful the hotel was stylish Gym was really well equipped 
15475,Intercontinental London The O2, Having to go home after only one night stay, Staff amazing food was beautifully presented and well priced perfect location for O2 loved 18th floor bar and cocktails amazing

15478,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, excellent service room was spacious clean and very comfortable Staff were so friendly and helpful Excellent location for O2 Breakfast was exceptional 
15479,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast is a little expensive , Lovely room with modern bathroom shower Large comfy bed with lovely soft pillows Had a lovely view of the Thames and the big bonus is being next door to the O2 Staff very helpful and courteous 
15480,Intercontinental London The O2, Drink prices are very high They ran out of Lager on Wednesday afternoon and still had non at lunch time on Thursday Drinks in the restaurant were served by a young waitress from a tray with glasses she d collected from another table The food and beverages department lacks a lot of 5 star polish , The location for the O2 is perfect and the hotel is very bright modern and clean 
15481,Intercontinental London The O2, Very expensive food and drink Very disorganised breakfast Most of the staff and non native English speakers and could not make themselves be understood very well No draught beer The shower head was scaled and the complimentary shower gel had obviously been opened and used Automatic 12 5 on all room charges without any chance to leave them off even when the service was not too good , The great location for the O2 and getting into London A 45 minute walk along the Thames to Greenwich Parking on site 
15482,Intercontinental London The O2, It is quite windy at the location I wanted to sit out smoke and have a drink but the staff wouldnt accomodate this Also we came back from the concert sat in the clipper bar They werent serving food but we did ask if we could order form room service and eat in bar and they wouldnt allow this There needs to be a little more flexibility with customers , Very good hotel We went to see a concert at the o2 arena it made it hassle free In fact you walk out of the o2 arena via a different route and do not have to queue too much to get out Room and service was fantastic the breakfast offered very good choice 
15483,Intercontinental London The O2, Slightly confused on how to get out of the car park as the ticket paid for wouldn t allow us to exit , Extra comfy beds Great location and a bar over the skyline which was open until 3 am 
15484,Intercontinental London The O2, I didn t like that they tried to charge me extra for an upgrade I didn t ask for or was even given the option of and then was told it was my misunderstanding Other than this a great hotel but has put me off staying again ,No Positive
15485,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing, excellent efficiency and friendliness of staff very clean and luxurious modern feel sky bar very chic but pricey then again you get what you pay for Great part of city to stay away from the busy central locations but all within easy access via the delightful river boat 
15486,Intercontinental London The O2, I am not happy about the fact that on checking in I was asked to pay 200 deposit which was taken off my debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar I think this should have been made clear in the booking confirmation to prepare the customers and this shouldn t be compulsory The staff told me it was compulsory that I had to make the deposit What happened to freedom of choice Not everyone would want to use the mini bar I ended up paying 758 for two nights including the extra charge which I didn t plan for I only planned on paying 558 What would have happened if the customer didn t have the extra deposit money , This is a very beautiful hotel I loved it so much that I had to extend my stay The restaurants are beautiful and well set up 
15487,Intercontinental London The O2, Only complaint is that the Spa short changed my partner Bev i booked her a 90 minute ESPA massage and she only received 60 minutes and was too embarrassed to say anything bit disappointing given the cost , Great location great hotel exactly why im an IHG Gold member Great Concierge check in and Luggage Staff
15488,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Excellent breakfast Perfect location for the O2 arena Very good quality bed and bedding Beautiful swimming pool with robes towels and flip flops 
15489,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t go into the sky lounge as it had reached its full capacity at midnight Disappointed as we were only there for the one night , Excellent location friendly helpful staff
15490,Intercontinental London The O2, Price for parking was ridiculous I was there for 24hrs 10 mins and it cost something like 54 should be a service to the local underground station , Clean and comfy room with excellent location for the o2 food was nice too with good service from staff
15491,Intercontinental London The O2, Hard to find fault with this hotel I m disappointed we didn t get to experience the bar on the top floor late at night but it was packed after everyone returning from the O2 looked amazing though On price it s definitely a treat for someone with my budget But on this experience you clearly get what you pay for , From the moment we arrived the experience was first rate Leo I think offered a warm welcome and went that little step further than than usual check in you d expect The room was modern comfortable and spacious We didn t get to use all the facilities but the general assessment was of the highest quality throughout The staff were brilliant breakfast was like nothing I ve had in other hotels and everything in the hotel was immaculate We were visiting the O2 for a Lionel Ritchie concert so location was perfect being literally next door 
15492,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Great service from the staff All of them very friendly Extra mention to Diana in reception Very friendly and helpful Ideal location for visiting the O2 Arena
15493,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t work out the coffee machine and that I had to leave to go to work, Service overall experience Seafood platter in the bar Location to o2 Views
15494,Intercontinental London The O2, My wife had difficulty walking and by the time we managed to get back to the hotel we were not available to get a table in the sky bar Very disappointing Hot water was poor in the room st 09 00 hours , Location is excellent for the O2 Staff very friendly and helpful
15495,Intercontinental London The O2, Very badly trained staff Generally a shambles Leaving aside all else that failed I gave up after 2 hours at 10 00 Hrs as I could not get coffee pods for the machine delivered to the room It was merely the icing on a disastrous cake And at what a price , Proximity to 02
15496,Intercontinental London The O2, Odd smell in the room View of flat roof not appealing Waited for ages to be served in the sky bar Only fruit tea available and One cup coffee per person in the room, Handy location for O2 Concierge was excellent
15497,Intercontinental London The O2, If everything was a little cheaper I guess you get what you pay for though , Super comfy bed Fabulous views Sky Bar amazing Staff exceptional Location perfect for O2
15498,Intercontinental London The O2, Having to Leave, Really comfy bed excellent location for 02 Friendly staff nothing was a problem Fresh supply of fruits fresh fruit juice and choice for breakfast Oh the skyline bar is a must fantastic
15499,Intercontinental London The O2, Sky bar very slow could have been staffed more even though staff that were there were great, A lovely hotel excellent location for the 02 staff friendly food great out whole experience was worth every penny
15500,Intercontinental London The O2, Much too expensive parking was 24 00 overnight After spending that much money on a room parking was just too expensive plus the cost of the minibar where a kit Kat was 3 50 Also leaving 100 00 deposit made it very very expensive cos you don t get the money back for 4 5 days , Location was the best thing
15501,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing it was just perfect oh and that our visit was too short , Staff were so helpful Henry the night manager who assisted with me taking some stunning photographic images of the London Skyline at 5 00am The helpful Spanish limo driver who helped out when our taxi failed to show And the welcoming Brazillian waitress from the Skybar whose first day was going well All the other staff smiled and bade us good morning too 
15502,Intercontinental London The O2, Staff in the Meridian Cafe on site were lovely friendly attentive and professional By contrast staff serving at breakfast time in the Market Brasserie were somewhat sullen and the level of service was nowhere near as good We requested an extra pot of coffee and were met almost with disbelief it then took 15 minutes to arrive and it wasn t busy at the time Staff were also slow to clear away used plates I did manage to get a smile out of one waiter on our second day but that was a rarity at breakfast time , A fabulous hotel reception staff were welcoming and professional Our room was lovely with amazing views excellent air con system and great bathroom with separate bath and shower Food was good and the covered walkway to the O2 is really useful Location couldn t have been better as we were there for an O2 event The hotel is also right next to the Thames Path which provides a nice flat walk down to Greenwich or in the other direction 
15503,Intercontinental London The O2, As a new hotel address it s difficult to find Breakfast too expensive for us so we passed and ate out in Blackheath NB we realise breakfast charge is usual compare told to other hotels , Design quality customer service 
15504,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing to do with hotel but after concert you have to queue with people going onto tube to get back to hotel , Brand new hotel location is perfect for the O2 arena Also for getting into London on the boat taxis Would use again 
15505,Intercontinental London The O2, Had to send food back in restaurant But dealt with well Shower floods bathroom as water does not go away Toilet pressure when you flush was so high that eveytime you flush you get water all over the toilet seat Just teething problems in a new build, Staff were excellent location good I would return Great view from room Stayed in room 412 on the 2nd and 3rd july 2016
15506,Intercontinental London The O2, The bar eigteen was perfect in location and view of the O2 arena and Thames but the staff waiting could not cope with serving lots of people One girl was abrupt and rude when asked to be served To top it off the seats situated near the window areas were reserved which we were not informed of that this could be carried out Breakfast was lovely lots of choice but the massive Que to get seated and served was not nice which all hotels I have stayed in never had this problem , Hotel location was perfect especially with direct access into the O2 arena The mature front doorman was a credit to the hotel Went out of his way to ensure we were dropped to the local tube station in style 
15507,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Fabulous one night stay Convenient for the O2 room with a view was incredible Bed soooo comfortable The staff were helpful and cheerful Breakfast was one of the best we had ever had in a London hotel I honestly cannot fault this hotel
15508,Intercontinental London The O2, When we arrived back that evening there was a 10 minute queue for a lift and we couldn t find the stairs despite wondering around it was incredibly frustrating not to have staff manning the situation Breakfast was a nightmare we queued 35 minutes to be seated then had to keep asking for things as they were so busy the staff couldn t keep on top of it A gentle reminder at reception when checking in notifying us of busy periods would have been very useful , The bed was very comfortable and the curtains were black out which made it easy to sleep in Good that breakfast was until 11am The staff were very friendly and they even gave us a little birthday cake for my husbands birthday to the room very thoughtful 
15509,Intercontinental London The O2, The hotel is new and still has some building work ongoing The Sky bar on the 18th floor was not available when I visited over the two nights I was there which was not explained to me Very expensive bar prices in Clipper bar 7 00 a pint is extreme even for London , The location for going to an event at the 02 arena is perfect Breakfast was better than most hotels I have stayed in Very easy to get into Central London using the Thames Clipper
15510,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Everything wonderful from the moment we arrived staff couldn t do enough and very friendly room excellent home from home furnishings comfy bed relaxed atmosphere food great brilliant access into 02 Arena parking a bonus 
15511,Intercontinental London The O2, We can t fault our stay It was excellent , The Hotel was clean modern and the views were fantastic The staff were extremely helpful professional and could not have done more for us The food was outstanding and there was so much variety We would definitely stay here again 
15512,Intercontinental London The O2, Pillows could have been slightly firmer but that s nit picking , Everything was top quality an amazing hotel we will always remember as I proposed to my girlfriend in your amazing sky bar overlooking the city
15513,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing not to like really only the service charges I thought wasn t really worth it, Fantastic location absolutely amazing for the 02 arena really quality property will definitely go back
15514,Intercontinental London The O2, Long time to wait for coffee at breakfast Having to ask several times Also I asked a member of restaurant staff for gluten free bread and I never got any , Excellent location lovely ambience friendly and efficient staff Overall a very pleasant experience 
15515,Intercontinental London The O2, On arrival I was asked to oay 200 deposit would be taken off a credit debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar I think this should be made more clear at time of booking I didn t have an issue with them taking card details as a precaution but the money was actually taken out of my account and I have to wait a few days for them to send the payment back, Rooms were outstanding and very comfortable and fully equipped Views from the skybar were excellent Staff very friendly and willing to help Location was perfect due to us seeing a show at the 02 Very closely situated to tube station and pier for getting into more central London 
15516,Intercontinental London The O2, There was dirty underwear left in the room from the previous guest all that was said was sorry a complimentary drink would have been nice considering I didn t expect that type of thing to happen in such hotel The mini bar hadn t been stocked from the previous guest and also the mini bar was thick with dust, Location
15517,Intercontinental London The O2, disappointed in the cooked breakfast was not very hot and the black pudding didn t have much flavour , loved the choice loved the view loved the service
15518,Intercontinental London The O2, Some aspects a bit over priced For example a dairy milk chocolate bar was 4 , Very comfortable room and bed Lovely staff Best hotel breakfast I ve ever had 
15519,Intercontinental London The O2, Only the high pricing was disappointing The details didn t suggest that car parking was available at the hotel we thought that we needed to use the O2 car parking This meant a 15 minute walk , Rooms and public areas furbished to a very high standard The most comfortable beds we ve slept in at an hotel Breakfast offered the largest choice of cereals fresh fruits pastries cold meats cheeses and freshly cooked full English probably the best breakfast selection we ve had anywhere Location next to the O2 was a bonus as we were attending a show there 
15520,Intercontinental London The O2, Couldn t fault anything , The room was of a good size with a comfortable bed excellent lighting and lots of room in the bathroom with an excellent shower Breakfast was really well worth the money so much choice and the pastries were yummy Ideal for the O2 Will stay again
15521,Intercontinental London The O2, The room was very warm had trouble sleeping Likewise with other people we spoke to Aircon needs to go lower , The bed was very comfortable very close to O2 
15522,Intercontinental London The O2, Bar prices in the Skybar Far too expensive , We were going to the O2 for a gig and the intercontinental was ideally situated with it being right next door to the arena The covered walkway to the O2 was an added bonus and hotel room to venue in under 10 minutes was well worth the extra cost seeing that there was no queuing for transport had we gone to a hotel further out and the added cost thereafter which would have made a cheaper hotel in the docklands on oar on price to what we paid at the intercontinental But without the hassle The room we had was a superior king room suite Excellent Bed was comfortable room was spacious bathroom was superb After the gig we went to the top floor sky bar fir drinks with a lovely view of the docklands skykine Only one complaint drinks were very expensive 12 year old single malt and a Malibu and Diet Coke didn t bring much change back out of 25 00 OUCH Breakfast in the morning was exceptional everything you could think of English continental plus other items English breakfast was cooked well croissants and pastries all fresh We will be using this hotel for future gigs at the O2 but will book an extra night in irder to take advantage of the pool spa and gym which we missed out on this time Highly recommended 
15523,Intercontinental London The O2, Hair dryer was hopeless kept cutting out the air conditioning didn t seem particularly effective it may have been helped by clearer instructions We were two single women and we were ignored in the top bar in favour or younger latecomers the wine waiter was rude however we enjoyed the position overlooking London, The position the pool the bars provision of robes
15524,Intercontinental London The O2, Thought the hot breakfast items were very undercooked but just my personal choice I just prefer my bacon and sausage well done also the coffee was very average Also if you use the covered walkway to the o2 it takes you straight into the venue therefore missing the bars and restaurants which is not ideal, Lovely new hotel ideal for o2 arena everything 5 star prices of course
15525,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast is expensive at 30 per person so hotel could do with another option coffee pastries cafe , Superb location for O2 concert Totally recommend hotel staff friendly professional and curtious 
15526,Intercontinental London The O2, Although complimentary tea and coffee making facilities in room you only had 2 tea bags unless you like fruit teas and no complimentary water For a hotel of this standard was quite surprised Mini bar very expensive , Location and access to the O2 fantastic Room restaurant and bar views great Good tube connection only 5 10 mins walk Breakfast was excellent Great buffet choice 
15527,Intercontinental London The O2, The door was very hard to open to get into the room, The bathroom was gorgeous loved that they had a speaker in the bathroom that was connected to the television
15528,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Service in the whole hotel was fantastic especially Ucha and Andrea in the Peninsula Restaurant Friendly clean and luxurious hotel Comfortable beds and amazing views of the river and Canary Wharf The sky bar on the 18th floor has stunning views across London Everything you could think of and more for breakfast 
15529,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Everything was perfect for our stay while going to see Lionel Ritchie at the 02 The breakfast was to die for So much choice you would never leave there hungry So close to the 02 with their own walk through to venue 
15530,Intercontinental London The O2, The long queue for the breakfast room was a bit irritating although it moved quite quickly and the fact our table was cleared and reset whilst we were queueing for food was a bit too efficient , Excellent location for the O2 arena Our room was upgraded to a very nice suite which made our stay even more enjoyable 
15531,Intercontinental London The O2, They really struggled when hotel was at full capacity, Excellent facilities Staff very helpful and freindly Made our wedding anniversary very special
15532,Intercontinental London The O2, The location is not ideal unless you are specifically going to the O2 it s a bit out of the way for anything else and the taxi we got back from Leicester Square was outrageously expensive because of this , The staff were very friendly the bed was so comfy and the facilities were great The overall look of the hotel inside is fantastic 
15533,Intercontinental London The O2, There was no price list for the fridge so we didn t have any drinks incase Also as we entered the 02 from the hotel we weren t allowed in the 02 restaurants which is what we wanted to do we should have been told that when booking in so we could have gone in the main enterance A few members of staff didn t speak very good English when we asked a question , Loved the room over looking the river very quiet and very comfortable
15534,Intercontinental London The O2, Nil to note , Couldn t find fault with this hotel Perfectly placed for the O2 Arena and London sight seeing Extremely comfortable room and attractive public places The breakfast is outstanding All accompanied by a fabulous and professional team that really look after you We had a great stay our 2nd and wouldn t hesitate to recommend 
15535,Intercontinental London The O2, The long queue for Breakfast only negative on the weekend , Excellent facilities The Staff where amazing They made our anniversary stay extra special Amazing afternoon Tea as well
15536,Intercontinental London The O2, Location out of the way A bit of a hike from the North Greenwich tube station Could have stayed in Central London for same or cheaper price I wasn t seeing a concert at the O2 arena so didn t need to stay there , Very new modern hotel with great views of the Thames 
15537,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing not to like , The bed was SOOOO comfortable we want to know where we can buy one Apart from that everything was great All round excellent 
15538,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Great location for O2 but also for the centre of London as the Clipper river service stop is by the O2 A great way to get into the centre with views Excellent service in the hotel from all staff we encountered very professional Amazing breakfast 
15539,Intercontinental London The O2, There wasn t too much that was not too like about it I know the hotel has only been opened since December so you expect a couple of hick ups the grounds outside have not been finished so the view from our room wasn t as good as I thought it would be there was a light in the bathroom that constantly flickered and the toilet flush made a noise for quite a while unless you kept pressing the button we came back late from concert went to floor 18 no seats left plus couldn t get a cup of latte or coffee I don t drink alcohol I m a soft drinker I did find drinks a little expensive didn t try restaurant but could imagine prices were high , The actual hotel is beautiful the room was large and very comfortable the staff bent over backwards to make your stay memorable nothing was too hard for them The breakfast was plenty full and very tasty breakfast in your room is even more special and only 5 tray charge which is excellent There was everything in your room that you needed for your stay I can t think of one thing that could be missing or needed It was very clean Loved it Loved the touch of smoking area on 18th floor As far as I can see I can t find anything else that would be needed to make the hotel a huge success 
15540,Intercontinental London The O2, It s an expensive hotel to stay in and of course the drinks bought there and the minibar are also very expensive , The location of the hotel was brilliant for the O2 The room was large with good facilities Great bedding too The bathroom had a bath as well as a shower toiletries provided plus robe and slippers It was our anniversary and they d left us a small cake which was a great touch The staff were very helpful and polite We couldn t really have asked for more 
15541,Intercontinental London The O2, Room smelt a little weird and unpleasant on arrival not enough milk tea or water in room tv didn t work for normal tv channels so couldn t watch tv , Excellent service venue design Friendly welcoming and informative Spacious and modern great views of the City 
15542,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing I didn t like , Fabulous Hotel Fantastic staff We had breakfast this time which was amazing so much choice we ll be getting it next time we go Can t wait to go back again soon
15543,Intercontinental London The O2, Having booked 9 rooms spending over 2000 for a night I thought the 50 parking charge was a complete joke As the person who booked the rooms not even the offer of complimentary parking , Closeness to the O2
15544,Intercontinental London The O2, Didn t realise how far away from train station cost a lot in taxi fares, Lovely setting very nice polite staff rooms nice an comfy direct link to o2 is fab
15545,Intercontinental London The O2, Service at the bar was terribly slow should have been staffed to accommodate for the event happening at the o2 that evening Waited over 20 minutes just to be acknowledged , Incredible location brilliant parking and very nice room 
15546,Intercontinental London The O2, Over crowded with conference , The receptionist was excellent and changed our room without question as we were looking at pipes on the 3rd floor and the river on the 10th 
15547,Intercontinental London The O2, Thought in excess of 200 per night for the room only was too much Room was nice but not fabulous 30 per person for breakfast I think not , Fabulous location if attending the 02 arena All the staff we met were very nice 
15548,Intercontinental London The O2, Although good the breakfast is too expensive Access via the Blackwall Tunnel road is a nightmare , The reception team were welcoming extra helpful Our superior double was very comfortable with a great view of the river

15551,Intercontinental London The O2, Being asked to pay a one hundred pound deposit just in case I break anything made me feel like a little tramp that shouldn t be stopping there, The facilities
15552,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, This is how good the service was I asked a member of the concierge team the quickest route to the Greenwich North tube station He kindly quided me to the limousine and drove me to the station 
15553,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, From the minute of standing in front of the reception you made to feel valued all staff were great Room fabulous breakfast was so good words cannot tell the storey fab hotel will go back
15554,Intercontinental London The O2, The only thing which could be difficult in future bookings with a friend is that twin bed rooms do not have accessible bathrooms I don t always travel with my husband so I wouldn t want to share a bed I have a complaint which means I cannot have bedclothes on my lower legs so prefer and need a bed for myself , Comfy bed accessible shower as disabled Very clean All staff were very kind and helpful 
15555,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable and cozy Room was super clean and I loved the fact that everything was newly built 2015 Staff were very friendly and willing to make guests feel at home Location was great because it was only 5 minutes by walk to the train station The Jubilee line is so efficient in terms of going to other touristic popular destinations Even if it looks quite far from the distance wise it only took about 15 min by train to arrive at the most popular stations like Green Park etc 
15556,Intercontinental London The O2, They offer me an upgrade for extra money but the room was almost the same of original one maybe even worst room size very small with that price I could have a nicer 5 star in London, Staff very helpful perfect location nice comfort and service like spa restaurant 
15557,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing comes to mind that disliked , The variety at breakfast The bed which was very comfortable the approachable friendly staff who were very good with grandchildren who came to visit at the hotel The spaciousness and airiness of the hotel and wonderful views 
15558,Intercontinental London The O2, We got an very good deal on the price but would not be able to afford it normally , Everything the hotel was amazing the staff friendly and the food at breakfast varied The private walkway to the O2 made the whole event so much easier and the security staff were very helpful and friendly 
15559,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , This is a wonderful hotel the staff were lovely especially Diana who checked us in and looked after us It s so convenient for the O2 The breakfast was gorgeous and our room was fabulous and so are the facilities from the pool gym and sauna to the bareighteen with fabulous views over the Thames Don t hesitate to book here especially if you like luxury

15565,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Fastastic location with easy access from Greenwich station Unimaginable view on every floor especially the 18th floor bar It s a place to be Well trained and happy staff 
15566,Intercontinental London The O2, Parking fees slow cocktail bar, We book the hotel over the internet a Few days later we visited the 02 and the hotel so i could get my bearings We ask the receptionist about parking I was under the impression that parking was free I was most upset to find that infact we would have to pay a fee of 50 plus but because we were guests we would get a reduced price of 24 wow 330 for a room and then paying for parking Car park was empty thank you very much After a wonderful stay in your hotel room food was great Service was very slow on the 18th floor cocktail lounge infact after waiting a good ten minutes with out service and no acknowledgement we left we were both looking forward to a cocktail but decided to retire to the Bar on the 2nd floor great service from your staff Also perhaps if you took away the bar stool away from the cocktail bar area we might have been able to get to the bar to be served Regards Mr Mrs C Dobson a return trip I would love at sometime but would have to really think about it 
15567,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk from tube station to reception while short was a little difficult to negotiate , Perfect location for visiting the O2 Great views comfortable and quiet rooms staff friendly and very helpful 
15568,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable The staff friendly and helpful and the location to the O2 couldn t have been better Will most definitely visit again 
15569,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, As we were going to the O2 it is right next door and has it s own covered access All the staff reception bars dining room were very helpful and friendly Very comfortable made our concert so much more enjoyable 
15570,Intercontinental London The O2, Some of the prices for drinks 7 for a bottle of peroni in the two bars i thought was a bit costly , Everything very helpful staff lovely rooms all finished to an excellent standard Great free use of swimming pool and spa 
15571,Intercontinental London The O2, Not the easiest to get to if you arrive into Victoria from Gatwick at rush hour as we did We did take a taxi as the feedback from fellow guests was that it s quite a walk from the underground to the hotel with luggage A courtesy service for arriving guests perhaps , Lovely bed Great staff went the extra mile Lovely bar with fantastic views Very comfortable overall Room service excellent Room facilities as expected for this caliber of hotel 
15572,Intercontinental London The O2, No free WIFI No value for money spent I basically paid for the location how close it was to the 02 I think the room was quite standard Staff needs more training on the services the hotel provides and the information to provide to guest some staff do not know that there is an ATM located in the hotel on the ground floor one staff almost made me drive all the way to the train station to get cash I am so happy that I checked with some one else , Located mins to the 02 arena excellent Staff were friendly and some staff were helpful Room was clean The view was lovely from the hotel window 
15573,Intercontinental London The O2, Having paid quite a bit for the room the pricey minibar and guest charger etc I just found offensive to be honest Either provide the things free or leave them for people to request if needed , Staff were really helpful and kind 
15574,Intercontinental London The O2, The tea cups in the room hadn t been washed properly didn t expect that at a 5 hotel The shower head in the bathroom sprayed unevenly , Skybar was lovely The staff were very attentive welcoming and friendly Great views across the river 
15575,Intercontinental London The O2, The parking cost me 24 pounds for 24 hours which was a bit annoying They have a huge car park so i didn t expect any charge , Staff at check in were the most friendly helpful staff i think i have ever encountered Couldn t do enough for me The room was beautifully clean and modern 
15576,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk through shuts up about 12am I was in a late event that finished about 3 and had to walk back to hotel but not moning only took 5 mins Which I thought could of used walkway But overal you must stay there , Great stay for my birthday with a friend Amazing view of the river and the o2 Couldn t ask for much more 
15577,Intercontinental London The O2, For the price I have paid i was very surprised that the hotel was charging 5 for wifi In most hotels it is completely free so I don t think it s acceptable for a room that is so expensive , Very comfortable bed very close to the O2 Arena 5 minutes walk 
15578,Intercontinental London The O2, I couldn t fault this hotel in anyway, The hotel was excellent in every way Right from arrival the staff were friendly and accommodating The breakfast staff were amazing and even offered my kids pancakes which were lovely They had a variety of restaurants to choose from the facilities were top notch The hotel is right next door to the 02 less than a 4 minute walk I really enjoyed my stay and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again
15579,Intercontinental London The O2, We booked the hotel with the intention of using the spa facilities Unfortunately on the day we wanted to use the spa the jacuzzi was out of service Other than that everything was great , Staff were all friendly and attentive Facilities were excellent Food was great Drinks were lovely Couldn t fault a single thing 
15580,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The rooms are spacious with the beds being extra comfortable and the location of the hotel is great with the o2 just being right next door The indoor pool is brilliant The hotel itself is amazing The staff here are very helpful and I will definitely look into staying here again 
15581,Intercontinental London The O2, The check in was all a bit rushed We were not informed where breakfast was served and as it is a big hotel it meant a bit of wandering around to find the room We were not given a copy of our hotel bill at the end of the stay and I forgot to ask for it Not enough TV channels for a 5 star Safety box was quite hot inside as it was located directly above the mini bar so the heat was radiating up into it The light switches next to the bed only on one side governs the whole lights so if the person on the other side wants to get up in the night they have to do so in the dark The view out the window was miserable straight on to an unfinished tower block The design of the breakfast room means some tables have a good view of the river while many others don t as the separators are very high so you can t see around your little area , 5 minute walk to the O2 Arena and the tube stop great The room was a nice size for a 2 night stay The bathroom was a nice design but the shower door is already leaking a bit and it s a new hotel Tea and coffee facilities was welcome and expected for a 5 star 
15582,Intercontinental London The O2, Got seated in the bar waited 30 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink then I asked the waitress 3 more times if she could serve us as after a hour and half We left without still being served ,No Positive
15583,Intercontinental London The O2, Found out once there that the car park wasn t 24 for 24hrs it was actually 50 , We stayed in the hotel because of it being in an ideal location for seeing a concert at the o2 Area due to being located directly next door Definitely recommend with the facilities available 
15584,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , We were attending a concert at the O2 so the location could not have been any better Everyone we meet was very polite and profectional and facilities could t have been improved views and breakfast were wonderfull 
15585,Intercontinental London The O2, Was not told on booking to my knowledge that there was a 100 a NIGHT charge UP FRONT for potential extras However it appears you can get away without paying this on the basis you cannot access the minibar and if you have anything you need to pay for in the hotel you have to pay for it up front as opposed to charging it to your room The TV wasn t tuned in properly so had to get a technician to show me how to get it to work The thermostat controls minus and plus touch buttons don t illuminate so I couldn t see how to control the thermostat in the dark at night having forgotten about the plus and minus signs again having to get a technician up to my room for me to realise why I couldn t adjust it Beside lamp didn t work as bulb had blown and I didn t see switch for it hanging down the side of the bedside cabinet My rating as added up by Booking com of 8 8 is more like a 7 in reality , Good bed and generally comfortable room Good breakfast but no fried bread or tinned tomatoes although chef did cook me fried bread on request and I was told I could ask for something if i wanted it 
15586,Intercontinental London The O2, Shower in the bathroom wasn t clean properly and stain on bed duvet sheet but other than that high cleanliness standard , Bed was amazing The staff were very welcoming and friendly And room was lush
15587,Intercontinental London The O2, I awoke with a very sore neck due to the pillows But that s just preference The pool was beyond cold which meant we had to confine the little one to the jacuzzi which was dissapointing seeing as we booked the hotel solely due to it having the pool, We were given a complimentary upgrade and a late check out which was wonderful as meant we could attend the show we had booked and still return and enjoy the hotel after The room was spotless as was the hotel in general
15588,Intercontinental London The O2, We initially booked a standard double room and then a week before we were due to stay went online and found a superior King at the hotel for 35 cheaper A lucky find but a bit cheeky of the hotel to try and charge more for a less superior room Also service at breakfast was a bit poor as we had to wait 25 minutes for our tea and they didn t give us any milk , Very luxurious and perfect for an event at the o2 love the walkway between hotel and o2 very convenient Breakfast was absolutely sublime So many choices and cooked to perfection Delicious 
15589,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing could have been better , The staff were friendly the bed was so comfy the walk way to the O2 was so helpful and the whole hotel was execellent
15590,Intercontinental London The O2, Expensive breakfast options limited quantity of drinks in room tea coffee only 2 tea bags per day , Hugely comfy beds great view perfect for the 02 with direct access good transport choices closeby
15591,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing really Air con could Of been a bit stronger but that s only me picking something, The bed was really comfortable Shower was amazing and the staff were so polite and friendly
15592,Intercontinental London The O2, Not enough tea coffee etc in room , We were very happy with the room the bed was very comfortable staff were helpful Next to the o2 was perfect as we went to see David haye fight 
15593,Intercontinental London The O2, For 161 p night the room facilities were a laugh one tiny bottle of body wash between two one milk ration each and no buscuit No menu for room service its on the TV so have to operate the remote first Finally when it did arrive it was luke warm unappetising and very expensive four small beers platter of meat awful one soup one cold chips two rock hard bread rolls came to 67 There was no mention of charges for parking on the booking form that was an extra 25 p night In all a very expensive hotel that had all the ambience of an airport lounge And finally don t bother with the postcode for the Sat Nav we tried it in three of them and it wasn t recognised ended up using my phone which died on me 20 at the hotel for use of a charger So unless you really need to stay there don t you will find a lot better in the city for the same price and get the Docklands Light over , Beds were comfy Breakfast was good with lots of choice 
15594,Intercontinental London The O2, The pricing was a little high for just one night , The rooms were lovely and the beds were so comfy Great location as we was going to a concert at the o2 and the walk way to the hotel took 3 4 minutes

15601,Intercontinental London The O2, They automatically add 12 5 service charge on bills I would prefer to choose if I tip and know the individual will recieve Drinks very expensive etc 4 30g dairy milk in mini bar 11 50 small glass wine in bar lounge so bear in mind on extras not value for money but as posh treat great to save for , Staff and service perfect best had room clean and bed very comfortable everything you need and high end which reflected in price Breakfast fantastic quality Will stay again if go to 02 
15602,Intercontinental London The O2, We arrived by a Thames clippers boat and although the hotel is not far we had to walk a long way around the fence to get to the reception by the same road as cars A gate for foot passengers arriving by river would be good , It s a fantastic very modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff Our room was spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was excellent and the spa swimming pool superb 
15603,Intercontinental London The O2, Needed air con to work a bit better There was no book with info of the hotel in the room explaining amenities etc in hotel Lighting a little bit dull could have done with brighter lights maybe , Excellent Breakfast Clean bathroom and good amenities in bathroom Nice comfy bed with lovely covers and pillows Friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel
15604,Intercontinental London The O2, Had to wait to get access to the 18th floor bar which seemed weird as I was actually paying to stay in the hotel I should have been able to get in no problem , Breakfast was amazing and so was the shower

15614,Intercontinental London The O2, The only thing that upset us was we were decline to go into the bar on level 18 and no member of staff told us we could have booked to go in later , The rooms and view were fantastic The staff were very helpful Getting to our concert from hotel was relaxing and not at all stressful 
15615,Intercontinental London The O2, Slightly off the beaten track around behind the O2 5 min walk when on foot as entrance is facing the river and very car friendly Would not stop me from staying again as this is a small inconvenience and the hotel and staff are lovely , Wonderful reception staff lovely Sky Bar and high spec all around

15642,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing at the moment , Staff were fab Rooms lovely It was our anniversary and the hotel kindly upgraded is Already booked again for the 25 June Can t wait 
15643,Intercontinental London The O2, no slippers in spa or room had to go bare foot as had no flip flops with me when I asked spa girl and reception for some they said there was none available, the bed was extremely comfortable and the spa facilities were perfect we had breakfast brought to our room bang on the time requested such a large breakfast well worth it
15644,Intercontinental London The O2, I feel a nespresso machine would have been a nicer touch than the tassimo Also more than two coffee pods would have been nice and maybe some little biscuits Seems like a petty thing but we had this at a far less superior hotel and it was a really nice touch , Pillows were lush Great views Perfect for the O2 especially with the tunnel through open 5pm midnight Lovely decor and detailing Staff friendly and helpful Jennifer on reception made us feel very welcome Although the drinks in the sky bar are a tad on the pricey side the view at night is so good you get some little snacks you are served drinks at your seat and the staff are attentive without being overbearing Oh and the lime soap in the bathroom was lush 
15645,Intercontinental London The O2, Think the Sky Bar needs more staff Lots of nuts dirty glasses left on tables Short staff issue Managemen need to attend, Great rooms bed linen towels dressing gowns 
15646,Intercontinental London The O2, A lot of kids in the spa pool but it was a weekend , The incredible close up view of the O2 from our room like a huge man made ski slope The breakfast was also excellent catered for all tastes and very well done 
15647,Intercontinental London The O2, Shortage of staff in the bar 25 minute wait for service as there were only 2 bar staff serving when concert at O2 finished Slow coffee service at breakfast same problem insufficient staff , Proximity to the O2 friendly staff bedroom
15648,Intercontinental London The O2, There did not seem to be enough staff on duty I had to queue for 15mins to check in and had to try calling room service 3 times before I got an answer which I don t think is acceptable in a 5 hotel However the hotel was not busy by any means hardly saw any other guests in fact , The room was amazing and at a great price too I had a twin aspect view overlooking the river on one side and the top of the O2 from another The hotel has some amazing facilities too especially the Sky Bar
15649,Intercontinental London The O2, Bar service in the skyline bar was very slow No draft beers Had to ask several times for Tea Coffee at breakfast think they might of been shortstaffed or something Everything else was wonderful , We stayed one night as we were going to a concert at the O2 We really couldn t have stated anywhere closer or better Shannon on Reception made us feel very welcome We loved the bed it was so comfortable it was like sleeping in marshmallows Loved the Spa Swimming Pool thank you also to Aishling for making us feel so welcome Breakfast was wonderful so much choice worth every penny Beautiful hotel great service and immaculately clean 
15650,Intercontinental London The O2, No shower gel in the room although there was soap My husband asked for extra coffee pods but they never materialised , The breakfast was lovely had everything I could think of I only wish I had a bigger stomach to fit it all in 
15651,Intercontinental London The O2, Being overcharged by 100 with no explanation this wasn t even detailed on the final invoice Even worse I have contacted the hotel by phone email and Facebook and have still received no reply To top it off the milk in the minibar in our hotel room was dated 24 4 16 over a week old I hate to nit pick but i was highly disappointed by the service I ve recieved since leaving the hotel , Excellent location amazing views and lovely facilities 
15652,Intercontinental London The O2, Waiting 20 minutes for a drink following the concert Checking Out I wanted to stay another night it was that good , We stayed at the Intercontinental for just the one night as we went to watch ELO at the 02 We did not experience any difficulties on check in and our room was ready for the 3pm check in time The staff at the Hotel were impeccable throughout and could not have done anymore to make our stay more enjoyable Our room was spacious and immaculately clean with great views over the River Thames Coffee making facilities were first class the shower had the biggest shower head I have ever seen and we both enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep We ate in the Hotel bar before the concert and can recommend the fish and chips Again the bar staff were attentive and catered for all of our needs Following the concert we visited the amazing bar on the 18th floor A beautiful place to relax and again floor to ceiling views overlooking the Thames They even have an outside smoking area for smokers so it saves going downstairs 18 floors to have one My only slight complaint would be that there were insufficient bar staff on duty to cater for the numbers returning to the Hotel after the concert and we had to wait about 20 minutes to get served A few extra bar staff would solve this especially when there is a popular event on at the 02 The drinks are pricey so if you are looking to pinch a penny to save a pound then this Hotel is not for you Personally I would rather pay a little bit extra as for me the experience outweighed the cost considerably The next morning we went for breakfast about 8 30am and did not experience any of the queues that some previous reviewers have mentioned A wonderful selection of pastries and everything you could wish for from an English Breakfast Before checking out we ventured for a swim in the indoor swimming pool You really must check this out during your stay as again it was a wonderful experience and the staff were a credit to the Hotel 
15653,Intercontinental London The O2, We were not able to get in to the sky bar when we got back to the hotel in the evening Had we been told on check in that it would be best to book we would have done this when we checked in but the staff at the other bar were very helpful and let us know that we could move up there with our drinks later on in night so it was not really a big issue , AMAZING breakfast and the staff couldn t do enough to help throughout our stay 
15654,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff were exceptional as were the facilities We had the most amazing meal with one meal being cooked to order to accommodate allergies Would recommend visiting the 18th floor to have a cocktail or two the views were incredible Can t recommend enough 
15655,Intercontinental London The O2, everything was perfect I can t even think of one bad point, I booked for my partners birthday and I can t express enough how helpful and sweet all the staff were at the reception and door helping me with the gifts and balloons I had brought along We had a nice spacious room with a bath and shower and lovely view and we absolutely loved the jacuzzi and swimming pool we went to the sky bar on the top floor and was lucky enough to get the seats near the window with a view of the city lights Thank you so so much for such an amazing stay My partner said it was one of the best stays he s ever had and was a special experience for the both of us Cannot wait to come back we re having a look already when we can book again extra big thank you to a member of staff called Shannon for making it extra special 
15656,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We went to a concert at the O2 and last minute for ease decided to stay at the hotel We were running late for the start of the concert the staff could not have been more helpful in rushing is over and showing us the way to the O2 The hotel car park was a real bonus too The room was quiet clean and comfortable bed was very comfy Great shower Coffe machine in room was a bonus I will definitely stay again next time I visit the O2 Really recommend it It transformed our evening and enjoyment of it It really is just a 2 minute walk to the O2 
15657,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Been at this hotel before and never been disappointed special touch with the receptionist Diana who sent a note under our door to wish my wife and me a good night at the concert we had booked what a lovely little touch well done 
15658,Intercontinental London The O2, Wanted to have a drink in the Eighteen Sky Bar but unable to enter as too busy Resorted to mini bar , Friendly helpful staff Excellent location for O2 Very comfortable bed 
15659,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was a mess too many people too few staff which meant the food orders were late we decided to have the cold buffet instead of the full English this was recognised by the manager and a refund for the drinks the previous night was given along with and appreciation of our comments, We were met by the valet parking attendant and the concierge who took our bags the check in took 5 minutes the luggage along with ourselves were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving excellent front of house service The room was excellent great views across the river Thames On the 18th floor there is a sky bar with an excellent selection of cocktails and craft beers at night panoramic window which over looks Canary Wharf mimics the Manhattan skyline well worth a visit just for this
15660,Intercontinental London The O2, Checking in was rather slow It was the weekend of the London Marathon so they were not really prepared for the number of people that were trying to check in not only for the marathon but for the concert at the O2 as well , Lovely spacious room which had a comfortable bed We also liked how close the hotel was to the O2 
15661,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was a bit pricey at 25 pp for a full english even though we had paid 345 00 for our room we just didn t bother with breakfast , First impressions were excellent the staff were very welcoming Our room was very comfortable There was even a tunnel to get to the O2 arena without having to walk around 
15662,Intercontinental London The O2, The fact that breakfast was so expensive and indeed not included in the price Also that car parking again was very expensive especially as there was no alternative Guests I believe should have a special rate I hate to think what the cost might have been should we have stayed for a number of days , Easy to find very well situated for our own personal requirements the visiting of the O2 centre Staff were very friendly and attentive 
15663,Intercontinental London The O2, Big problems with the kitchen in the Brasserie long wait only to find the chef read the ticket wrong and produced a different dish Front of house staff friendly and efficient ,No Positive
15664,Intercontinental London The O2, Drinks were quite pricey , We had a first class stay and would recommend 100 Staff were very helpful throughout our stay including Graham who drove us to the Station on our departure with my mobility issues Such professional customer service and so kind The food and whole ambiance of hotel really fabulous The breakfasts were stunning with the best we ve seen in a hotel We initially booked as hotel so close to 02 and with connection corridor which for my mobility issues made the whole experience two wonderful days for a special treat 
15665,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Excellent customer service A 5 hotel with a relaxed atmosphere which is not at all pretentious as some 5 hotels can be Friendly helpful efficient staff made our stay memorable 
15666,Intercontinental London The O2, Clearer signing from the O2 to the covered walkway I couldn t find it and ended up walking along the road , Room staff and food were all excellent I will come here again 
15667,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , Fabulous room everything you needed complimentary toiletries bathroom spotlessly clean with all mod cons big fluffy towels Coffee maker kettle tea coffee milk and a safe in the room big comfy bed pillows Very quiet area good nights sleep Staff were very helpful happy and friendly location perfect for the O2 Sky bar superb views Breakfast was fantastic One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in we would definitely recommend 
15668,Intercontinental London The O2, Swimming pool was out of action which for a family was most disappointing to my teenager we had booked the hotel as it had a pool Aircon was temperamental but they came to fix it very quickly, Excellent service and comfy rooms Brilliant views of London
15669,Intercontinental London The O2, We went to a concert at the 02 and came straight back after it had finished but couldn t get any food anywhere other than room service Didn t want to go back to the room so made do with complimentary nuts Not quite what we were hoping for It would be good if food could be served later even its only sandwiches , Room with a great view of the O2 Fabulous bathroom lovely robes and towels and best shower ever even better than all the ones we ve tried in the USA Really comfy bed and good coffee machine Staff were extra friendly and helpful The facilities in general are first class It wasn t a cheap stay but well worth the price 
15670,Intercontinental London The O2, Disappointed with concierge taxi booked and pre paid to hotel did not turn up we had to get DLR instead as couldn t get to us in time to catch flight, Location and friendly staff
15671,Intercontinental London The O2, We had a three and half hour wait for our room Treated very well whilst waiting however meant we had no time to prepare for the concert in the evening which we had to go to straight away , Fabulous hotel staff were polite and very helpful given long delays at check in Room was great clean comfortable and terrific views 
15672,Intercontinental London The O2, We arrived at 5pm yet our room was not available until 7pm only 30 minutes before our concert at the 02 next door Despite us pushing several times , Great location and friendly staff 
15673,Intercontinental London The O2, Car park was very expensive Our room took 2 hours to be ready when we arrived BUT the duty manager did all in his power to compensate for this We were very impressed , The room was excellent and very comfortable The staff were very attentive and pleasant There was ample parking on site We were there for a concert at the o2 so the 5 minute walk was brilliant 
15674,Intercontinental London The O2, For the price I would ve liked the car parking to be complimentary , Amazing suite with fantastic views really friendly and accommodating staff particularly the spa manager and the doorman valet Great location and a really superb hotel throughout Absolutely no complaints a fantastic weekend I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody and will most certainly be returning access and proximity to the O2 arena is unrivalled Great bathrooms and really big and comfortable beds The fillet steak in the restaurant was some of the best I ve eaten The pool and spa area are fantastic 
15675,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing at all everything was 10 10 , we stopped for the ELO concert at the 02 arena I thought the short cut thru the hotel to the 02 was great and saved a good walk hotel was absolutely incredible and we would not esitate to use again if we stay in London again also the staff and concierge was extremely helpful really nice people 
15676,Intercontinental London The O2, Long queue to book in at 3 15pm room not ready at 3 45pm but they found us one when pressed , Excellent service lovely room and very good tea and coffe making Bed was huge as was the shower Breakfast was first class
15677,Intercontinental London The O2, Room not ready by 3 00 or 3 30pm still waiting for room 5 00 given a key to room that didn t work then had to move everything up two floors to correct room , location to the O2 Very comfortable bed
15678,Intercontinental London The O2, The only thing that we could possibly comment on would be that the tea at breakfast was rather weak , All of the facilities were excellent staff could not do enough for you all were happy with great smiles A big thanks to Graham the doorman who was knowledgeable helpful and very chatty 
15679,Intercontinental London The O2, Cold plates at breakfast so cooked breakfast was cold by the time I sat down Having to queue to sign in a coach had just arrived I think , Very quiet and comfortable and convenient for the O2
15680,Intercontinental London The O2, Prices are on the expensive side so would only stay here for a special occasion Also you have to pay for parking The service in Market Brasserie was a bit slow but i have put that down to new hotel new staff etc, Almost everything it was pure luxury indulgent We tried all restaurants and the food was amazing in all of them The cocktails in 18 sky bar were delicious Looking forward to going back 
15681,Intercontinental London The O2, Plumbing definitely not what you d expect in a 5 hotel Nowhere to hang wet towels and the television didn t work which is bad for such a new hotel , Food good and service good All staff very attentive The room was comfortable and a good size 
15682,Intercontinental London The O2, Some biscuits on the tea tray would have been nice Apart from that I couldn t fault anything , Fabulous pool Great for Marathon my son was running Excellent pleasant staff especially helpful was Andrei on Reception Great shortcut to O2 A fabulous stay and I would use again 
15683,Intercontinental London The O2, Over an hour to check in Staff excellent but overwhelmed by everyone arriving at the same time Nearly 2 hours to get a table in the bar and get some food Bar lovely but way way too small Not allowed into the much hyped 18th floor bar as two large groups in for birthday celebrations Unacceptable for residents to be treated like that , Bright new modern 
15684,Intercontinental London The O2, Had to change bedrooms twice as the first two rooms smelt like smoke cigarette , Great customer service Really enjoyed our stay would certainly recommend 
15685,Intercontinental London The O2, The advertised walkway straight to the 02 isn t even open yet and they didn t advise of tight restrictions on when children can use the pool very frustrating , Lovely luxurious room with huge windows great view 
15686,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Stayed here as we were attending a concert at the O2 the room was nice with a great view of the river and the breakfast was very good Cant speak highly enough of the quality of the food and the service from the staff in the Peninsular Restaurant first class 
15687,Intercontinental London The O2, I loved all of it , It was in a perfect position for the O2 direct access via a small tunnel The room was lovely spacious bathroom with separate shower and bath and the pool was wonderful Finally the breakfast was one of the best I ve ever had so much choice and attentive service even when busy
15688,Intercontinental London The O2, Could have been a little bit more reasonably priced In house parking very expensive , Bed was like sleeping on a cloud Spacious and well equipped room Great breakfast 
15689,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing , The room was to a very high standard from the small touches like coffee maker in the room to the amazingly comfy bed and 5 star breakfast The staff were very polite dressed immaculately and would do anything to help 
15690,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing, Staff were excellent and always ready to help Food tasted like it had been cooked and not warmed up like so many hotels plus you do not wait long in the restaurants because there are staff everywhere Beds are comfortable even for sore bones and are very large Rooms and bathrooms are excellent Location for the o2 cannot be bettered it s outside the back door However if going elsewhere tube not far away perhaps 5 minutes walk so very good for central London Very quiet no main roads going past so no traffic noise at night 
15691,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was the only disappointing part we arrived 45 minutes before the end so naturally had a slight queue to get in but once we were in we were seated quickly The staff were a little disappointing very friendly but no one seemed to be assigned to our table We waited at least ten minutes before we got coffee then had to queue for the breakfast buffet after another 5 10 minutes of the queue not moving I gave up and decided to order from the menu It was around 15 20 minutes after arriving that we finally got a menu After quite a long wait and at the close of breakfast we were served our eggs benedict which were really delicious but all in all it wasn t a particularly enjoyable breakfast experience To top it all off we had the misfortune of being seated next to a family who decided it was acceptable to wear their pyjamas to breakfast and let their children run around next to us Really quite disappointing from a five star hotel , The hotel overlooks the river Thames and the financial district so amazing views less than five minutes walk from the 02 The decor is stunning and the greeting and reception staff were phenomenal particularly the smartly dressed concierge who took our luggage and made sure we got checked in two hours before check in time The superior hotel room was amazing spacious beautifully decorated and immaculately clean We even had a Tassimo coffee machine The added extras such as cotton buds shower cap and hair band etc were a nice touch Plus the variety of things in the mini bar too The tv was even amazing it had YouTube movies and other channels plus all the hotel information including a little history of the chain room service menu breakfast and even your bill The room also had the comfiest bed I think I ve ever slept in Our view was the o2 building I couldn t have asked for a better room Lots of facilities but we didn t get a chance to use them We also didn t make use of the sky bar but from what we saw it looked amazing The other really good thing was the hotel have their own access to through to the o2 which means you cut out the walking round time and are under shelter aside from a 10 second walk across Beware though it closes at 1am and if you miss it like us you have to walk the long way round 
15692,Intercontinental London The O2, The hotel is overpriced Customer service was poor as we were charged for taking food from the mini bar when we did not The room key card system broke in the hotel and it took 2 hours of us chasing up various members of staff before we had a key and electricity to the room We did receive a letter of apology from the hotel but we still feel let down by the service , The room was clean the beds were comfortable and the room offers everything that you need The view from the room was fantastic and the access to the 02 arena was very handy 
15693,Intercontinental London The O2, Fire alarm went off briefly in night but staff seemed unaware Complementary milk in our room was out of date Unable to pre book hotel parking Staff at o2 claimed that covered walkway to hotel wasn t yet open although we d gone thru it from hotel certainly the hotel was very poorly signposted from the arena took ages to get back A hotel of this standard should have a dress code for breakfast there were some very scruffy people in there , Great location for o2 room was fab really luxurious and well equipped Staff really helpful and polite 
15694,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, A brilliant experience from the hotel and the quality of furnishings to the friendly and extremely helpful staff breakfast had so much choice will recommend 5 
15695,Intercontinental London The O2, The costs of drinks in the Clipper Bar are extortionate 2 Peroni s and a Cuba Libra very little change from 30 But it is 5 star , We were given an upgraded room due to problems with our original room and subsequent late check it The room was stunning The staff are so friendly and welcoming especially Graham the doorman whom we laughed with A genuine gentleman The walkway to the Arena is a great bonus too 
15696,Intercontinental London The O2, I was given a great room upon early check in and told to return later when it was ready promised views over the O2 I was very happy However when we did return we were given a completely different room which had no nice view Not at all happy with this I was told at reception that unfortunately they had to give me a different room So who got my room and why I did mention this upon check out and received an apology it was the same chap that booked me in the day before and he did seem a bit guilty Ie ever he was very pleasant and polite and gave me complimentary parking It didn t make it right but was a little sweetener I will await any management response with interest , It is very new so in great shape but also it does seem well cared for It is a very nice hotel with everything you could wish for really but at a price Great choice at breakfast I highly recommend the lamb sausages delicious I will definitely go back as it is so very convenient for O2 and it is nice 
15697,Intercontinental London The O2, The fire alarm going off at 12 45am ish Not due to the hotel but a guest attending a wedding Staff very apologetic , Extremely welcoming staff and wonderfully comfortable beds and pillows Great location for the O2 which is 2mins walk almost under covet
15698,Intercontinental London The O2, Additional service charges on everything soon racks up the bill go to the bar and get your own drink or they charge you 3 50 to bring it to where you are sitting , Very helpful staff and plenty of them
15699,Intercontinental London The O2, Over friendly staff over priced breakfast long walk from venue clipper service when event wasn t on not allowed to use the tunnel looking out on a great view of Canary Wharf but looking down on the floors kitchens below seeing dirty crockery loo rolls on all the windowsills , Near the venue
15700,Intercontinental London The O2, Fire alarm early hours Not the hotel fault and was cleared up quickly , Great view amazing spa perfect breakfast Perfect bed Bose music in bathroom 
15701,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast was a shambles Long queue outside the breakfast room Poor management that with guests from a wedding also staying they did not make alternative arrangements They have another dining room which was not in use All very unsatisfactory ,No Positive
15702,Intercontinental London The O2, Service was terrible for a hotel like this Breakfast was a nightmare no food with people queuing for over 20 minutes for the buffet, Rooms really lovely
15703,Intercontinental London The O2, The limited access for the Sky bar unfortunately after the gig the bar was full so we were unable to experience it , The location was the best part views of the O2 and the Thames Amazing breakfast 
15704,Intercontinental London The O2, Walk way between the O2 and hotel was closed A bit of an inconvenience because that s why we booked the hotel Didn t bring jackets and was cold outside while walking, Excellent 
15705,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk from the O2 the previous night when we didn t know about the short cut took us about 45 minutes as we had to wait in the tube queue before we could get round the corner to the hotel , Beds very comfortable quiet rooms FABULOUS views from enormous windows Everything perfect especially when Graham the concierge told us about the door to the O2 Arena our concert finished and within 10 minutes we were in the stunning bar on the top floor of the hotel avoiding all the queues getting out of the O2 Brilliant great concert but the hotel was the icing on the cake 
15706,Intercontinental London The O2, The service here is a joke on arrival we where told our room wasn t ready this was at 3 30pm and we would have to wait 30 mins 1hr 30mins we manage to get a key and then off to the room we go to find out the key isn t working off I go back to recp to wait another 30mins then we manage to get into our room off we go to the ELO gig at the end of the gig we head back to go to the sky bar to find out we can t get in as they had two big tables book in there and they where full so we go to the clipper bar and have to wait 30 mins to wait to get served and have to stand as no tables left so we head down to the down stairs bar and we manage to get a table which we take a seat and wait to be served which never happens 30 mins sat there waiting we give up and head to our room We spent over 400 for one night with no food at this sort of money you expect more, Closeness to the o2 arena The rooms
15707,Intercontinental London The O2, Getting our tea and coffee delivered at breakfast as we were finishing our meal Paying to park the car overnight at 24 Should be complimentary for guests, Very comfortable rooms Great breakfast selection
15708,Intercontinental London The O2, Some magazines in the spa would have been good There wasn t any milk in the room for tea The drinks were pretty pricey , The room was fantastic with views of the Thames Staff were very attentive The access to the O2 was very handy 
15709,Intercontinental London The O2, Information in the room for facilities ie room service etc maybe forgot to put one in , Lovely clean rooms excellent bathroom facilities breakfast selection laid out for ease of choice Staff very helpful
15710,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk way to the O2 wasn t open I have mobility issues and I wonder if the walk had been open whether it would have been a shorter distance As it was the walk around was just over 5 mins and luckily not raining , All the staff were so friendly and helpfull The position of this hotel is exceptional and hotel felt luxurious 
15711,Intercontinental London The O2, Was unable to visit bar on 18th floor after O2 concert as it was full at about 11pm Would have appreciated being able to have a look around even if we were unable to stop and have a drink ,No Positive
15712,Intercontinental London The O2, Room which was booked through Booking com had view of an air conditioning unit which took up the whole window Had to upgrade and pay for another room At a reduced rate , Ideal for visiting 02 Arena
15713,Intercontinental London The O2, The foyer passage to O2 being closed Did not mind the walk around as was not raining, Luxurious feel to the room and very comfortable Lovely big windows and light in the room plus view of O2
15714,Intercontinental London The O2, Sky bar on 18 is extortionate views over Canary wharf are spectacular but at 14 a cocktail its a bit steep even by London standards, Superbly appointed hotel great rooms with all the things a modern traveller would need even usb charging points by the bed finally Really comfortable stay and a superb breakfast too
15715,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, From the moment we arrive to the minute we left the service me and my girlfriend received was amazing We visited the 02 for the Ellie Goulding concert a few weeks ago Literally a stones throw away from the arena which was nice as we were pretty tired from all the drinking and dancing at the concert Beds comfy Couldn t fault the hotel will visit again 
15716,Intercontinental London The O2, Cheaper snacks and soft drinks , The room was stunning The beds were like sleeping on clouds The Tassimo machine was a lovely touch The bathroom spacious spotlessly clean and super modern The staff were incredibly attentive helpful and efficient My son and I have vited it the best Hotel we ve ever stayed in 
15717,Intercontinental London The O2, The duvet on the bed was way too thick my husband and I spent all night kicking it off because we were just too warm even with the thermostat turned right down Breakfast in the morning was a huge disappointment All the hot food was cool and tasted very much like it had all been sat there for an hour or longer Even the beans were cold The fried eggs weren t cooked properly and the fried potatoes tastes awful The croissants and muffins were either stale or not defrosted enough and the smoothies and yoghurts both tasted stale Your staff also coUld not advise if the orange juice had sugar or not unhelpful with my husband being diabetic Such a shame as the rest of the stay was incredible , The view from 1407 and eighteen sky bar is amazing staff were very courteous and friendly and the pool all to ourselves was a bonus 
15718,Intercontinental London The O2, They charged me double for the room for some reason ended up taking over 600 pound from my account After a long phone call they refunded the money but took 5 working days Strange because they tried to do the same to my friend who luckily didn t have enough money for them to take Be careful ,No Positive

15722,Intercontinental London The O2, The mattress on the bed was severely drooping leaning and hard on one side , Our stay at the hotel was excellent The breakfast was great and the staff were very helpful The spa was lovely apart from the steam room not being in use Special thanks to Andrei for his help 
15723,Intercontinental London The O2, Water not hot enough for a bath Revolving front door triggers automatically as you approach in a way that turns an open door into a closed position disabling the option of walking smoothly in Tech is great but it has to make things easier not harder Similarly for the light switches Breakfast too expensive to contemplate , Good sound proofing Despite the niggles overall its position and views are excellent 
15724,Intercontinental London The O2, Very upset with the lady on duty at the reception a British girl called Anne I believe was extremely unprofessional and not helpful All other staff were excellent including supervisors and manager , The Food Room and the two bars and restaurant 
15725,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Everything about my one night stay at this hotel was perfect especially the staff who couldn t have been more helpful or welcoming The purpose of my stay was for a concert at the O2 and with the hotel having its own private entrance to the Arena the location couldn t be bettered I d happily stay here again 
15726,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, My Daughter and I travelled by train to attend a concert at the O2 arena The location of the hotel close to the station and the covered walkway from into the stadium were ideally situated to facilitate this The view from our room was stunning the beds were really comfortable and the staff were friendly and polite I would definitely stay here again
15727,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast buffet a little ordinary for the price I would expect elements I e Eggs to be to order rather than sitting in Bain maries , Proximity to the O2
15728,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk around the o2 to get to the hotel as the connection between the o2 and hotel was closed partly due to building work , The beds were georgeous and have never slept so well The lady on reception was so nice and even organized an upgrade and cake when she found out it was my daughters birthday Staff were very attentive

15732,Intercontinental London The O2, You have to validate your parking at reception to get the discounted price of 24 otherwise you get charged 50 There was no sign by the car park machine advising of this nor did the staff advise of this at check in Was sorted though but needs to be made clearer , Very good location and reasonable price with good parking

15739,Intercontinental London The O2, Queue at reception room temperature too high even set at its lowest lack of fresh air was stifling choice of menu items disappointing and cost unjustifiably high Mini bar prices must have been a joke Didn t have breakfast but how can it be worth thirty pounds per person Maybe lobster was on the menu , beds were fantastic cleanliness excellent rooms almost faultless 
15740,Intercontinental London The O2, The only down fall I could say is the pool was freezing It took all my courage to get in and get swimming , We only stayed for one night but during the time we were there the staff were aver so friendly and helpful The room was clean and comfy and the location next to the 02 and train station made our stay just that more stress free

15744,Intercontinental London The O2, We bought a small glass of wine in the sky bar which cost 10 which was far too expensive and the service was not particularly good Although the views were good , It was perfectly situated to see muse at the o2 It was a comfortable friendly and efficient hotel with a beautiful view over the river Thames 
15745,Intercontinental London The O2, The parking was expensive should be at least 10 pound or free with hotel price waiting for drinks at the bar for awhile but staff very friendly and apologetic , The hotel itself
15746,Intercontinental London The O2, Service in the clipper bar was slow took over 25 minutes to order a drink I understand it was an expectionally busy evening however staffing should reflect the amount of residents,No Positive

15751,Intercontinental London The O2, The causeway was not opened until 7pm and as we had vip hospitality from 5pm if it had been a wet eves the walk around to the O2 would not have been pleasant and the main reason we booked the hotel was the causeway , Good room 
15752,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing bad to say about this great hotel, The staff made our stay as good as it was All were very welcoming and politie but Diana at the front desk was particularly fantastic ringing our room to check everything was to our liking and leaving a personal note in our room wishing us a great evening at the concert we were going to The breakfast we had in the morning was also superb and we look forward to our next visit 
15753,Intercontinental London The O2, The hotel was not well managed and our room was changed before we had checked out So returning from breakfast we were unable to relax and couldn t use the facilities as intended A complaint bought a poor response Breakfast was also chaotic with little control and long queues Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel , Location
15754,Intercontinental London The O2, The far we had to walk all the way round to the 02 maybe if there s and easier way , Loved the hotel close to the 02 staff were so friendly and helpful 
15755,Intercontinental London The O2, Not much, The staff were amazing the food was lovely Less than 5 minutes walk from the o2 Slightly expensive for the price of the room given its only good for the o2
15756,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Upon arrival my girlfriend was not happy with the view from our room on the 3rd floor so reception kindly upgraded us to a suite on the 14th floor with an exceptional view of London and surrounding areas In the morning I d forgotten my swim shorts in LA and wanted to use the spa and swimming pool and concierge kindly offered to visit the Westfield shopping mall and pick me up a pair in my size Outstanding service and very kind polite and friendly 
15757,Intercontinental London The O2, My mini bar remained locked so I had no access to the complimentary milk for my morning coffee , Lovely clean efficient facilities In addition our afternoon tea was perfect 
15758,Intercontinental London The O2, Service in the terrace bar was a little slow , Short distance from 02 and location was quiet Room was of an excellent standard with a great view of Thames Beds really comfortable and the terrace bar has an amazing view 
15759,Intercontinental London The O2, In the evening the 1st floor bar staff could have been a little more efficient as it took some time to be served 2 drinks and when served the drinks were incorrect on both occasions , Everything from the moment we got there was first class and the staff were very polite and helpful The breakfast was lovely and there was plenty Of choice The spa pool and sauna were great 
15760,Intercontinental London The O2, It will be better when the O2 tunnel is opened properly An electric golf car shuttle round to the river boat station would be good for the less mobile guests , Liz on reception went the extra mile Hotel opened the Market Brasserie an hour early on O2 show night to facilitate preshow eating Very knowledgeable efficient and helpful doorman Marvellous breakfast buffet one of the best I have seen 
15761,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, We came for Adele s concert at the O2 so the hotel s location was very convinient Everything is new and very well designed We had an amazing view to the Thames The breakfast was superb It s only one station with the riverboat to Greenwich 
15762,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Excellent facilities fantastic view of River Thames from our hotel room free upgrade on early check in very friendly staff extremely comfortable beds room 1st class service throughout our stay chose this 5 star hotel as its so close to O2 Arena with covered walkway direct to the Adele concert we went to that night Breakfast next morning well worth it too Would highly recommend staying here
15763,Intercontinental London The O2, Front of house very poor staff slow so slow check in Arrived 2 50 queued for checkin after 10 16 minutes was told room not ready Went for T etc Returned to desk at about 4 50 but had to repeat registration entry Went to room 5 10ish Previous request for pillow choice not carried out At 5 30 whilst dining in Peninsula was tipped off to reserve via dining management so as to secure a spot for 2 for aftershow nightcap but was refused access cos not on list Felt humiliated just simply not good enough for this chain , The interior design fittings
15764,Intercontinental London The O2, The bar on the first floor was the most expensive and disorganised facility of it s type I have ever been in It cries out for a professional manager who can react to peaks of activity At these prices you do not expect to wait for 30 minutes and then get something completely different to what you ordered It was chaotic and really let the hotel down The score would be much higher but for this , The hotel was excellent with well trained staff good food and well appointed rooms The stay was too short to test the facilities 
15765,Intercontinental London The O2, Very slow service in 18 bar although it was very busy and staff were trying their best , Location is handy for O2 Bed was fantastic room very well equipped Breakfast lovely 
15766,Intercontinental London The O2, Snacks with drinks could have been better instead of rice crackers only , We really enjoyed our stay and the room service was prompt and more than what I was expecting Thank You for making my anniversary even more memorable 
15767,Intercontinental London The O2, Unfortunately I had an uncomfortable sleep The bed is new and soo hard which was made worse by very soft pillows I tried to phone reception to ask for a different one but no one was available about 12midnight We asked at reception at the time of booking in to book a table For the sky bar after our concert but she said we needed to do this from our room By the time we did this less than an hr later we were told they were fully booked When we arrived at the bar around 10 45 the 2 parties before us hadn t booked but were given a table and then when it came to is we had to go to the bar On complaining very politely the staff did everything they could to ensure we had the next table Whilst this didn t spoil our stay and I can t thank the lovely ma tre d enough for sorting it out I feel it could have been better organized Ie a better booking system in place My only other slight disappointment is that at reception at booking in the lady made out that we couldn t use our debit card to open a tab for mini bar etc as a result we agreed to pay as we went along It meant we had no access to the mini bar which she didn t explain and it also meant that as the milk was in the fridge we didn t have it for coffee in the morning We did ring concierge who said they d arrange to send it up but 30 mins later it still hadn t arrived so we went for breakfast There was also no information in the room about checking out where and when breakfast was and other things like that I presume that perhaps it was just missing from our room as it seems crazy that there wouldn t be one This information also wasn t given to us at checking in My only real criticism would be breakfast The hot Buffett was rather dissapointing Whilst my companion enjoyed it I found it was mediocre at best However its important to note that there was a reasonable continental selection and I certainly didn t go hungry , Excellent customer service Very nice hotel and amenities Sky bar is a lovely treat Lovely room with a great view Good price for what we got 
15768,Intercontinental London The O2, Drinks prices very expensive Ok for a treat but at nearly 20 per drink not likely to have too many Service in brasserie very slow but food excellent once it arrives and not too expensive for what it was , Bed very very comfy Staff extremely friendly Location for O2 perfect No rushing after concert for tube just a short walk 5 mins and a cocktail overlooking London at night

15772,Intercontinental London The O2, After the Adele concert at O2 we went for a drink in the hotel bar but had to wait a while to be served Could have done with some extra bar staff , Sheets and pillows were soft and comfy

15776,Intercontinental London The O2, Breakfast service tea coffee was slow and some minor issues with the room like no milk for the tea coffee facilities so we needed to call down for some A couple of light switches not working and the sink not draining in the bathroom , Wonderfully comfortable bed Very convenient parking and very convenient for the O2

15784,Intercontinental London The O2, The reason we booked the intercontinental is the spa facilities and the fact it has a tunnel linked to the O2 arena both of these facilities were not available during my stay they were closed due to maintenance by the time I was informed of both closures it was far too late to change hotels or cancel my booking and it was a real let down considering the price paid for the hotel I d recommend to leave booking for a few months whilst the hotel maintenance is being finalised, Very comfy bed excellent staff amazing breakfast

15794,Intercontinental London The O2, If we re being REALLY picky After dinner out one night we thought we d order dessert back at the hotel via room service however there wasn t anything on there that we liked Maybe expand this menu a little more From what I remember I think there were only 4 5 items on the that menu , Everything was perfect From the room the view and not forgetting the helpfulness of the staff We were given complimentary cable car tickets as the spa was closed for maintenance chauffeur driven unexpectedly to our dinner booking across the river and when we arrived by car to the hotel the ticket machine wasn t working for the car park we notified reception when we checked in was advised they would sort out the fee when we check out thinking they would charge our credit card or something When we checked out we were given a complimentary pre paid ticket free of charge so we could get through the car park barrier again unexpectedly We were there for 2 nights Breakfast was also amazing lovely views of the Thames eat as much or as little as you want The skybar is lovely too Again amazing views Was very relaxing with complimentary nibbles We really did feel like VIP s during our stay

15811,Intercontinental London The O2, Some switches didn t always work properly The door knob of the shower cabin is quite sharp to the hands The door closes firmly so you need some force to open it Light in the bathroom could be a little brighter , Breakfast was outstanding fresh fruits fresh orange juice good espresso food never runs out not even at 10 30 when breakfast time ends All staff was very polite especially the mister helping us with our suitcases Mohamed and the lady at the reception Jennifer And all the staff in the restaurant Room was tidy with a great view Fohn and iron included It was silent too good isolation

15815,Intercontinental London The O2, The tunnel from hotel to o2 was closed without notice when we had booked this hotel for that very reason due to a painful knee injury Walking around to the o2 only took 15 minutes however I was upset that the staff did not seem too bothered by my concern and about the extra pain I suffered which could have been avoided , Huge king bed in a standard double room Gorgeous hotel Close to o2 Incredible breakfast 
15816,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing It was over performing in every respect , Perfect for any O2 event New and well run You need look no further for the right place to camp before and after a performance 
15817,Intercontinental London The O2, Not an efficient service in the skybar had to wait for over 20mins for the bill and when it came it was wrong Had to pay the service charge as included on the bill yet poor service Faulty coffee machine in the room , Views large comfortable bed location to O2 Great breakfast 
15818,Intercontinental London The O2, There was no milk in the room for tea and I had to send for some However it arrived pretty quickly There could have been more normal tea bags too many herbals , For us the most important aspect of this hotel was its location How come it has taken so long for someone to think about building a hotel next to the O2 In addition the hotel was excellent the service fantastic and breakfast amazing We have stayed at hotels that purport to be 5 but this one really was 5 
15819,Intercontinental London The O2, No information booklet in the room to advise of the facilities available Small point but there were no biscuits cookies to accompany the good selection of tea coffee in the room Provided an ice bucket but had to phone room service to get ice as there is no ice making machine on the communal floor area , The room had great views and the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them Great location right next to the O2 arena and walking distance from the tube station The Spa area and gym are really well equipped and very clean probably one of the best we have used anywhere

15823,Intercontinental London The O2, Not a crtiscm nor really an issue but might be an idea to have secure access gate for guests on route to pier , Staff were brilliant couldn t have been more attentive but not in your face Very customer focussed super impressed Great breakfast choices 
15824,Intercontinental London The O2, The lack of staff rudeness of a member of female staff German lady unable to get served a drink , Beautiful room Excellent location hotel manager James was brilliant sorting out an issue 
15825,Intercontinental London The O2, Key didn t work on arrival so we had to go back down 17 floors to reception Receptionist accent very difficult to understand No night time turn down despite light on requesting room attendant Breakfast service dreadful Asked for table by window offered 2 other tables first by buffet Finally got our window table several available all the time Staff did not understand English we had to point out our orders on the menu and they still got them wrong My husbands juice took 30 minutes to arrive Staff looked very nervous 1st day for most Good variety for breakfast but scrambled eggs cold and tasteless, Great views room spacious comfy bed lovely bathroom
15826,Intercontinental London The O2, The service was a little slow in the Clipper Bar when there wasn t that many people in there at 11pm at night but the staff again were friendly I only stayed one night so not long enough to use all the facilities My only other slight dislike is the price of breakfast and hence why I went else where But I know that these are the standard prices , The location was exactly what I wanted the room was comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful with on site parking I would use these facilities again 
15827,Intercontinental London The O2, Long queues to check in and staff avoiding eye contact Refused entry to the Skybar after the Adele concert because I hadn t booked a table When I checked in no one told me I needed to book Check your bill I was charged 50 extra for breakfasts 12 5 discretionary service charge automatically added to bills There were only two of us and I would have preferred to decide on a tip Receptionist handed over key cards but didn t say where lifts restaurants spa etc were located , New hotel close to the 02 some staff extremely helpful and friendly Hotel was very clean Concierge staff were fantastic 
15828,Intercontinental London The O2, The milk for tea and coffee was in the locked mini bar and it took 3 calls and a couple of hours to get some milk , Hotel was spotless staff all of them were a pleasure to interact with Nothing was too much trouble Loved the bar on the 18th floor and at night the view was spectacular So close to the O2 
15829,Intercontinental London The O2, No milk unless you either pay a large deposit for the mini bar or call reception when you wanted to make tea Not ideal first thing in the morning Covered walkway to the O2 not available ATM which was disappointing given the cost of the room and no advance warning that this was the case , Lighting in the bedroom was great beds extremely comfy feeling of luxury amazing view across the thames
15830,Intercontinental London The O2, Nothing to dislike that i could fine, The facilties were excellient the Breakfast buffet outstanding the staff were so helpful nothing was to much trouble well done to everyone
15831,Intercontinental London The O2, No mention of Spa not being totally functional sauna etc not working the point of choosing the hotel was two friends and a spa day as well as the overnight near o2, Lovely staff so helpful especially Diana
15832,Intercontinental London The O2, The white wine we ordered in the Skyline bar was red , The view from our spacious and comfortable room was amazing It added to what was an excellent weekend
15833,Intercontinental London The O2, wrote to the hotel via booking com about an early check in did not get a response Don t know whether it is the fault of Booking com or the Hotel, Asked for an early check in got an early check in no fuss
15834,Intercontinental London The O2, Had to wait for 30mins for bottle opener tone delivered to room then member of staff came opened bottle of wine for me then went away with bottle opener Had to call down to reception ask if they could leave one in room my daughters too was the same Room just didn t seem to be organised with basic items had to wait 25 30 mins for eggs Benedict to be made at breakfast service is very poor , Near o2 venue
15835,Intercontinental London The O2, The breakfast was not included in our stay and was not offered after booking We chose an a la carte breakfast of just 2 poached eggs bacon one slice and toast one slice We were then informed it would be cheaper to go for the 25 full English breakfast even though there was nothing else we wanted Seemed a huge amount to pay as this was all we ate probably our most expensive breakfast in terms of what we ate The waiter then got our breakfast from the buffet 15 minutes after ordering it The poached eggs tasted of vinegar and there was too much soft fat on the bacon Some of the waiting staff spoke little English Upon leaving we paid for all our sundries and were then expected to pay parking When I booked a few months ago parking was included in the cost of the hotel and was told that the terms had later changed This had to be waived , Location was excellent for the O2 and the bar on the 18th floor was amazing in terms of its views The room was comfortable and clean 
15836,Intercontinental London The O2, The walk way from the hotel to the O2 wasn t open The O2 still doing work there side we feel we should have been informed about this before we arrived had to walk round to get to the main entrance now this isn t far but if I didn t take some sensible shoes and coat it was very cold this could have been a problem, Right next door to the O2 Hotel is really nice lovely views had lunch in hotel that was very good but was a bit expensive 
15837,Intercontinental London The O2, We booked because your web site said the hotel has a direct covered walk way into the O2 Arena for Adele concert we were attending However it wasn t open I complained to Christina in customer relations at the hotel and she arranged a complimentary cab but we had to walk back outside late at night Our only complaint ,No Positive
15838,Intercontinental London The O2, Indoor connection to O2 arena is not yet finished But only a 5 minute walk around outside , Staff could not have been kinder Conveniently located near the Tube for easy access just a few train stops into the city to sightsee and such As well as easy access to the O2 Arena The Adele concert was the main reason for my visit Additionally plenty of places to dine coffee convenience store at within the O2 
15839,Intercontinental London The O2, Drinks a bit pricey in the Clippers Bar, From the moment you walk through the revolving doors you know your somewhere special Staff were so friendly and helpful From the hotel to the O2 without going outside is perfect Cable car over Thames River Taxi tube station and bus station are all on the doorstep 
15840,Intercontinental London The O2, It was advertised as having a covered walkway directly into the 02 arena Unfortunately on arrival I discovered it was still under construction This was the main reason I chose this hotel as a solo traveller There was a good selection of coffee but no ordinary breakfast tea Only green tea fruit tea I like a good ordinary cuppa Had to buy teabags at local tesco Having said all this I cannot fault the hotel it was excellent Good location very clean I think the covered walkway will be an added bonus when completed I will definitely stay here again , Lovely new hotel very friendly welcome Cleanliness was superb Bed was so comfortable with very high quality bed linen Had a wonderful sleep Close to 02 underground station 
15841,Intercontinental London The O2, The walkway between hotel and O2arena was not open the following day It would have been much more convenient than the walk around the block , The hotel is new and very comfortable The spa area is fabulous The staff are welcoming friendly and efficient The rooms are spacious and well furnished The views from the hotel across the river and London are breath taking There is a walkway between the hotel and the O2 arena on event nights 
15842,Intercontinental London The O2, My wife felt the room was too hot although this didn t bother me I couldn t seem to get the aircon to make the room any cooler , The location is superb and the service is sublime 
15843,Intercontinental London The O2, View certain part it is like a building site I don t care Wifi even know it s free but it s slow can t actually use it Pay parking for hotel guests not quite what I expected , River view was ok otherwise building site looking like Ceiling to floor window which I like Clean Breakfast is good Staff are polite helpful 10 10 Location next to o2 if u come for show ie good stuff Free wifi Nice and modern 
15844,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing to not like, The pillows were so comfortable your head just sinks into them The standard of the hotel was fantastic I would recommend it to anyone not just visiting the O2 but visiting London in general 
15845,Intercontinental London The O2, Small details were disappointing ie no milk two days running and newspaper forgotten unable to get car out of barrier , All the big things were great standard and cleanliness of the hotel staff pool and spa area position Bedding amazing 
15846,Intercontinental London The O2, Walkway not yet open to O2 but not their fault Had to request additional tea coffee, Great location and when the staff heard it was my birthday they had a cake delivered to my room which was a nice touch
15847,Intercontinental London The O2, The shower in our room was not great the water ran all over the bathroom from the wet area and the main shower head sprayed in all sorts of directions and was not very powerful , Without exception all the staff we met were fantastic polite professional friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent with a good range of good quality well prepared food The room was amazingly quiet could hear no other guests or any traffic outside the window 
15848,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Very Comfortable Hotel ideal location for 02 and London city Excellent Breakfast Very Friendly and efficient staff Could not rate this hotel highly enough and will be staying with them again
15849,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, Location was fantastic rooms were clean with a great view over the Thames Breakfast was also excellent with a great selection and good service Brand new complimentary Pool Spa facilities were an added bonus 
15850,Intercontinental London The O2, We ordered room service the fries were warm rather than hot and came without vinegar That is my only little negative comment, All staff from front of house to the chambermaids were pleasant and extremely helpful
15851,Intercontinental London The O2, The promised direct access to O2 had NOT been completed yet was not me tinned anywhere and even advertised as a selling point As stay was for 3 days of C2C at the O2 this was a disappointment especially as could not get access to hotel for overnight and hour at the end due to massive queue for public transport Luckily weather was good for the extra long way round , Location views decor and service attention all top notch Gteat new addition to the O2 offer and for London travellers with exvellent public transport next door Will definitely book next year again and look forward to direct access to O2 by then as promised 
15852,Intercontinental London The O2, I would have liked to see an offering of gluten free bread and or vegan options for breakfast Eg soya yoghurt or veggie sausages , If you are looking for luxury this is the hotel for you The staff were incredibly attentive the location was literally next door to the O2 arena The food was beautiful I couldn t find fault 
15853,Intercontinental London The O2, It s the small things so here I go walkway to O2 closed no milk in room and no it s wasn t in the mini bar Lack of signage finding reception isn t easy No bottle opener in room so put the cold beers back that really is all I can fault but a nuisance, Staff awesome decor stunning location brilliant
15854,Intercontinental London The O2, The water temperature in the bathroom was erratic which was annoying The food was good but expensive the staff in the 18th floor bar were not particularly helpfull possibly a minor management problem the staff else where were excellent friendly but very efficient Overall we enjoyed our stay and would come again ,No Positive
15855,Intercontinental London The O2, Bed was a little too firm but that s just personal preference , Very well looked after by all staff Made to feel welcome and staff were attentive and gave as much time as we needed 
15856,Intercontinental London The O2, Instructions in the room on how to use the coffee machine we had to call down to reception in the end for help on turning it on Also only one choice of coffee Americano would have preferred more choice as do not like strong ciffee , The reception staff in particular were 1st class they couldn t do enough to show how important we were as guests at their hotel 
15857,Intercontinental London The O2, Air con did not work Hot and extremely uncomfortable in room Some teething problems as hotel not been opened for too long No direct walk through to O2 as advertised , Bed comfy Bathroom nice and clean Good location for the O2 Excellent breakfast but not the cheapest 
15858,Intercontinental London The O2, O2 walk way wasn t available as under construction we were attending an event at the 02 but were not made aware of this prior to booking Couldn t get a parking space had to park at the O2 parking then walk to the hotel then had a space available had to walk back to the car to re park after discussing with the manager, Friendly reception staff Lovely hotel Very clean Good location
15859,Intercontinental London The O2, Room too cold air conditioning unit doesn t go high enough to remedy this No instructions for the coffe machine or price list for mini bar items , Big comfy bed generous breakfast well worth the money 
15860,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The 18 th floor sky bar is a must especially on night time view is stunning Breakfast was beautiful plenty selection and fresh Hotel and rooms themselves fantastic
15861,Intercontinental London The O2, bottle of water on the top near kettle got charged mini bar prices which should have been made clear 200 deposit on arrival should be made clear when booking shocking to recieve money back 5 business days after departure , we loved how close it was to the o2 arena and the underground room was spotless and staff were so friendly easy check out which was fab and really flexible with the check in and out times spa was amazing too 
15862,Intercontinental London The O2, a few issues over the lights in the room had to call for an electrician no bottle opener for the bar very very slow service at the bar especially after the UFC fight waited 35 minutes for three beers even after several reminders steam room and jacuzzi not operating , most pleasant staff very comfortable rooms 
15863,Intercontinental London The O2, Unfortunately my partner and his friends stayed here and I paid for the hotel as a treat for his birthday I went with the more expensive option which included breakfast in the room rate They were told breakfast hadn t been paid for so I paid a grand total of 75 00 for absolutely nothing ,No Positive
15864,Intercontinental London The O2, Cooked breakfast food options need to be much warmer a real shame however there were some great choices of food on offer and loved the smoothies , Fantastic location for the O2 no transport stress to worry about after an event Great bars on both the 1st and 18th floors and incredibly comfy beds 
15865,Intercontinental London The O2, As we were not going to be in the hotel for more than 7 hours we decided against leaving a credit card against the room The mini bar was locked because of this In the morning we made a cup of coffee with the superb little machine in the room only to find our milk was locked in the mini bar Not a major problem but just an observation , This was a very easy hotel to stay at The car parking was plentiful and easy to locate Checking in was easy Staff made you very welcome and were always there to help 
15866,Intercontinental London The O2, At the time of our visit the linking tunnel to the O2 itself was closed so we had to track around the outside in cold and wet to concert getting back to the hotel you then stop caught up in all the crowds and it took ages to return The pool was also not open So the review is based on a hotel that promised so much but was let down by the non opening of facilities advertised as open that would have made the stay perfect, Right next to the O2 the place is new and stylish Great views from the plush bar
15867,Intercontinental London The O2, Because the hotel is brand new there were a few tiny little things such as 1 door key and 1 TV not working However the staff were absolutely brilliant at sorting these things out They were all wonderful and made our stay very comfortable and enjoyable Big thanks to all the team , We had 2 rooms as we were taking my mother in law to the O2 for her 84th birthday treat The staff were wonderful making a real fuss of her They brought her out a selection of free cakes after our lunch and because the connecting walkway to the arena was not ready yet and she has mobility issues they laid on a complimentary taxi to and from the show On our return to the room she wasn t able to climb onto the beautiful big bed so they brought up a smaller bed for her and made it up within 10 minutes Priceless 
15868,Intercontinental London The O2, That the walk through to the O2 was closed not finished Reason I booked hotel Very wet and windy 5 minute walk round to O2 transport could have been provided On a dry day it would have been no problem , Breakfast was good lots of choices and lovely staff to assist you especially lovely phoebe
15869,Intercontinental London The O2, Shame that the private access into the O2 wasn t open yet when it is that s the cherry on top , Lovely room with very large comfy bed top notch bathroom and a great view Couldn t fault it Loved the late check out 
15870,Intercontinental London The O2, More information if the facilities in the room There was no information folder and while you could look up on the TV the info was limited eg no info on the spa, Location brilliant gor the O2 all the staff were courteous and helpful 
15871,Intercontinental London The O2, I would prefer for the twin room to have two beds rather than a kingsize bed with two separate mattresses , Bed really comfy Lovely breakfast The Sky Bar has wonderful views 
15872,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, I stayed here with my partner over Valentine s weekend Lovely new and modern hotel Nothing was a problem very helpful staff and great facilities 
15873,Intercontinental London The O2, The pricing on the food , The bed was very comfy and I love the speakers in the shower from the tele Was all connected And the views were spectacular
15874,Intercontinental London The O2, Only the price For a non flex stay it s 196 per nite and I do think that is on the expensive side although I absolutely feel they gave my Mum the 5 treatment and am not complaining , The front of house concierge team were absolutely fantastic from initial greeting to last goodbye This overnight trip was a present for my Mum and her friend both of whom are close to 70 They were treated like royalty no question was too much and I feel the whole team including the bar staff in the sky bar went out of their way to make them feel special Mum sent me a text to say they felt like VIP s and they couldn t sleep because they were so excited The beds were fab the room and view were just perfect and the whole experience was beyond anything we could have imagined I have tweeted three times to the hotel and their CEO to express our gratitude My sister and I staying in March I cant wait 
15875,Intercontinental London The O2, Finding someone else s personal invitation in our room No English Tea had to ask only fruit tea in the room No mini bar price list and why on earth are Pringle style black tubes in the fridge containing a phone charger and another one containing condoms No hotel info pack had to look on the TV Bath water was luke warm not hot Bath plug was difficult to open Toilet plumbing was poor Shower pressure was poor Breakfast layout was disorganised Walkway between the O2 and hotel was closed Blood spots on the bed linen, The bar on the 18th floor attitude of the staff 
15876,Intercontinental London The O2, The walkway to the arena but it will be completed soon so no real complaint , The views over the river were fantastic Staff were very helpful and were always ready to help It s one of the best hotels I have stayed in the next time we come to London it s the hotel we would book 
15877,Intercontinental London The O2, The breakfast room service could have been lots better there were items of food I had ordered which were missing and the food was lukewarm at best particularly the toast very costly for what you actually get , The bed was comfy the space of the room was more than adequate and the bathroom was very nice and luxurious 
15878,Intercontinental London The O2, Would of been nice if the walkway to the o2 was open saves us getting rained on but it s only a 5 10 minute walk around the outside of the hotel to get there so not a massive problem at all , Everything This hotel was just amazing the staff were very attentive polite and welcoming The beds were very comfortable loved the shower All the facilities were brilliant The hotel was spotless Thank you for a lovely stay Will be back for sure 
15879,Intercontinental London The O2, We attempted to go up to the hotels bar late into the evening We were stopped by the bar manager and told the bar was full In an act of defiance I explained that at these prices I expected to have access to the hotels bar my friend and I entered anyway to find A bar so unbusy I wondered what the bar managers benchmark was for full We were served immediately and found seats Not great service for a 230 a night hotel , Ambience fantastic and location for our purposes brilliant Breakfast was also fantastic 
15880,Intercontinental London The O2, We were made to feel unwelcome and out of place I felt embarrassed and angry as I was with my mum I don t appreciate that behaviour My mum is disabled and we had to park in the event parking area as the hotel parking was reserved for the BMW event Staff couldn t tell us how to get from the car park to the hotel and we ended up walking for a long time with bags where I struggled let alone my mum I mentioned that we were going to be late to the nitro circus event as it is a fair walk around and was there a quicker way but was just told that no my disabled mum and I would have to walk all the way back around no empathy or care given There was no milk to have tea in the room and so phoned reception they said they would be up shortly with milk but never turned up , Room was lovely and clean 
15881,Intercontinental London The O2, My stay was a suite of bad experiences waiting 40 mn to have the room service menu in my room movie ordered on pay Tv not working fire alarm in the middle of the night and no fire and a breakfast ordered in my room that never came though ai asked reception that never called me back And as a cherry on the cake when I asked very politely to speak to a manager upon check out she did not come though she was at 10 meters What a poor attitude , Very large rooms and cunfortable beds
15882,Intercontinental London The O2, There was nothing to dislike , It was a friendly nice warm welcome the room was lovely and clean staff were friendly and helpful at all time enjoyed everything about my stay there will be coming again 
15883,Intercontinental London The O2, There was no room service menu in outer room and we had to ask for it twice and the price of mini bar items was not available in the room Breakfast was buffet style with the option of having eggs cooked to your liking I was told repeatedly that my eggs would be 1 minute and after 10 minutes I gave up Just a couple of teething problems for a newly opened hotel Drinks in the hotel are extremely expensive , Lovely room clean and modern Stunning views from the sky bar and great location for visiting the O2 
15884,Intercontinental London The O2, view walkway to 02 and lower the prices a little , Brilliant bed room but poor view especially as i had booked so far in advance beautiful hotel but walkway into hotel STILL not finished 
15885,Intercontinental London The O2, Will be a great hotel when it is finished Still some great things in the pipeline , Got exactly what I expected for the price Food and drink were expensive but you expect this from this type of hotel 
15886,Intercontinental London The O2, You really do not want to know , Didn t try the croissants Bed was very comfortable Shame the room was only serviced once during a three night stay 
15887,Intercontinental London The O2, It would have been nice to have the option of a brighter light in the bedroom and the mugs were a little small for the amount of coffee dispensed from the coffee machine but nothing major , The bedroom was spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable We were amazed how quiet the hotel was we didn t hear a sound The staff were very polite and helpful 
15888,Intercontinental London The O2, Staff in the sky bar while very friendly were too officious People looking to enjoy a drink and a chat do not need micro managing being told what table to sit at in a half empty bar constantly being asked if we need anything The chairs set at the tables for two are too far apart for comfortable conversation Coffe machine in room needs instructions It took two staff members over 20 minutes to work out how to use it , Great location Comfortable room with a lovely spacious bathroom Excellent breakfast 
15889,Intercontinental London The O2, My room view wasn t great but I was only on the 4th floor I would imagine the higher the nicer view We used this hotel as it said it was located right next to the O2 arena Yes it was but it was a long walk to the entrance and reception from the O2 Some signs would have been helpful too More info in room would also have been helpful like room service info and what time food is served etc Where the dining room was located etc , I loved the stunning views from the bar on the 18th floor The breakfast was spot on and lots of choice 
15890,Intercontinental London The O2, When I booked it said it had its own walkway into the 02 arena but when we got there they hadn t opened it yet which they should have put on there website , The hotel was beautiful could not fault it 
15891,Intercontinental London The O2, The fact that we paid for this hotel believing that all the facilities were open only to find that the spa etc wasn t in use and that this was only in the small print something that big should have been put somewhere noticeable , The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for you The bed was very comfortable and room size was excellent 
15892,Intercontinental London The O2, Service in the Meridan Lounge was a little slow, Facilities and a room excellent and extremely comfortable bed and an excellent breakfast everyone catered for the Eighteen Sky Bar is brilliant 
15893,Intercontinental London The O2, few teething problems with a new hotel but the manager was brilliant and didn t want us to leave with any bad feelings he didn t make us feel bad when we mentioned the problems we had and solved everything so we were more than happy and will return asap , beautiful room with luxurious beds hotel is gorgeous with a great view over the Thames Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast was wonderful Great location for the o2 arena Fantastic manager
15894,Intercontinental London The O2, Carnt fault the hotel but was little disappointed that the spa an gym wasn t open yet as we booked it thinking it was open but apart from that loved everything about it Will defo stay again staff was very helpfully to ,No Positive
15895,Intercontinental London The O2,No Negative, I liked how welcoming and helpful all the staff were And how close we were to access public transport when needed and eating out places were a stone through away Hotel was very clean Would definitely recommend this hotel and would come back here Also so convenient when visiting the o2 arena
15896,Intercontinental London The O2, The staff were very off was made to feel uncomfortable more than once and the bar staff took half an hour to serve me and my friend had that drink and went straight to bed they were that rude would not recommend this hotel based on the staff , The location was brilliant
15897,Intercontinental London The O2, The bar service in the skybar was extremely slow It took us 45 mins to get a drink All the staff seemed to be serving the tables and no one serving at the bar , Graham the bellboy was brilliant Very helpful and he also took us around to show us where everything was
15898,Intercontinental London The O2, We had a member of staff come into our room whilst we were in the middle of getting dressed he opened the door without knocking and got an eyeful of my partner in her underwear We told member of staff in the lobby about the incident and she was very shocked to hear this had happened And a gesture of good will she reserved us a table in the sky lounge for after the event at the o2 and it was the best table in there Looking over the centre of Canary Wharf The complimented us with a couple of free drinks to soften what happened and in all fairness they really went out of there way to make us feel better about the incident Which we both agreed did help and worked All of this aside if I were to go to another event in the o2 I will more than likely stay again , Lovely hotel brilliant location for our trip to the o2 arena Staff were very helpful when we had an issue with our room being entered by a member of staff when we were half dressed getting ready to go out Made to feel extra comfortable after the incident The staff managed brilliantly considering it was there first time if there being a big event at the o2 and having an awful lot of guests for the first time 
15899,Intercontinental London The O2, Bar was chaotic probably early opening problems Nothing major just took a long time to get drinks and had to repeat the order a lot of times However The bar is really expensive , Great location excellent staff especially at check in
15900,Intercontinental London The O2, disappointed with the service in the sky bar at night although it was busy as the clipper bar is not open yet I do however think that hotel residents should be a priority otherwise all the hard work from the checkin staff is wasted if both bar and waiter service is operated in sky bar staff need to ensure customers are served promptly or asked to take a seat and a waiter take the orders We waited too long for service both at the bar and for waiter service hopefully this will be improved when hotel fully open, The staff were excellent on check in and out Gabrielle was very friendly and helpful
15901,Intercontinental London The O2, The only thing I would have liked is if breakfast was included The hotel is very lovely but for the price we paid i wouldve liked a brekkie thrown in , Every single staff memeber we met were extremely friendly and attentive they made our stay very comfortable The hotel had only been opened 3 weeks and was spotless Rooms were very nice 
15902,Intercontinental London The O2, Given they haven t finished it off yet it looks a little untidy outside but once complete I am sure this will be superb No hotel guide to tell you what is where and when it s open but again maybe they were waiting for these to be printed Directions signage from the tube station would be helpful Drinks are expensive so bring extra cash or a bigger credit limit on your card , The staff were really friendly and couldn t do more to help Hotel made us feel super special and the room with the river views was AWESOME 
15903,Intercontinental London The O2, The hotel is very new and there are some teething issues our table was given away at breakfast despite having left only to get food The bar in the evening although busy had a 30 min turnaround from drinks order to arrival , The room was very comfortable and the in room services we excellent 
15904,Intercontinental London The O2, Unfortunately The spa and sky bar was not yet ready to be opened so a bit disappointed we couldn t use them, The room and hotel was amazing was Lovely
15905,Intercontinental London The O2, nothing loved the stay and would definitely again when i visit the o2, ever so friendly rooms immaculate Used a couple of things from the min bar and one was stale but was taken off the bill with no arguments or issues Excellent customer service
15906,Intercontinental London The O2, Eighteen bar is stunning and being told by staff to make sure we visit we did bar opened at 5pm we decided to have a drink before our dinner reservation at 6pm and to check out the fabulous views Unfortunately we were still waiting 20 minutes later despite tellling the waitress twice after we had ordered a cocktail and a beer and so we had to leave without having them a great disappointment as the bar wasn t very full either whereas the service we received in Clipper bar earlier was excellent We received no apology which was a little disappointing , Beautiful Hotel excellent staff Eva and when all the facilities are available it will be amazing 
15907,Intercontinental London The O2, Although we did not have the Breakfast the prices for the Breakfast was fairly high 30 for a breakfast or lower depending on what you ended up having I thought that was a little too high although I must admit the breakfast and restaurants did look amazing , The hotel staff were excellent and the hotel was truly 5 stars The rooms are very comfortable and roomy and very clean The hotel has all mod cons built in the TV s are excellent with showing most common channels including BT Sports 1 2 The Sky Bar on the 18th floor is just amazing the views over the Thames and of Canary Wharf was simply stunning The Hotel is right next to the O2 and you can see the dome roof right next to the hotel it is amazing 
15908,Intercontinental London The O2, NOTHING, The hotel was fantastic every thing was spot on from the reception we had from first walking in from Sima the porter Then getting our room was fast with lots of info about the hotel The room was lovely with a bed that was so comfy I didn t want to leave The food was fantastic the pan fried salmon very enjoyable The views are the best the bar on the 18th floor not to be missed fantastic views of canary wharf wow Thank you to Pheobe for making breakfast enjoyable with lovely service and very pleasant thank you to Graham the doorman for the tour of the hotels great ballroom what a fantastic place he was very interesting to talk to and looked after us When leaving Liz was very helpful in arranging a taxi TCB Liz All in all the hotel is beautiful and the staff are the best we have met Thank you each and every one we had a great time with you
