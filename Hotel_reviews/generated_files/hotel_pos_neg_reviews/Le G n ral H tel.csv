196534,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Clean and tidy rooms Staff was super friendly and provided a precise guide of places to visit and restaurants to eat at They were very efficient in dealing with our requirements Will definitely stay there again 
196535,Le G n ral H tel, Really expensive for what it offers The room was really small Also when i booked it says that the room has shower or bathtub and when i ask for bathtub tjey said that this is a mistake ans they only have showers for the cozy room So that was a wrong information when i booked And the size of the room was muxh smaller of what booking says, Staff were super nice and polite They give u for free umbrella if u need Location was very good
196536,Le G n ral H tel, A new plethgora of photos of young people may make older visitors wonder if this is the place for them , I visit Paris regularly and have stayed at Le General over 10 times over the last few years It remains consistently one of the best hotels in Paris An excellent balance between style convenience price facilities and cleanliness One can immediately tell that even ther smallest things are continuously thought about with care Now that I ve said all this I probably won t be able to get a booking in future 
196537,Le G n ral H tel, the room was quite tiny and if the room rate doesn t include breakfast I wouldn t recommend paying 18 euros for what they offer, very friendly staff great location nespresso machine in the room
196538,Le G n ral H tel, The maids were a bit lazy with the cleaning but it didn t bother me that much, The staff was beyond accommodating Especially Mary and Mansour Hotel next to a new upcoming area
196539,Le G n ral H tel, My stay was not long enough , The staff were better than excellent If I could I would rate them 6 out of 5 that is how welcoming friendly and supportive they were They were the BEST A great hotel that I would recommend to anyone and everyone 
196540,Le G n ral H tel, Liked everything , Beautiful shik hotel with amazing stuff Helped us a lot We didn t like the room we got so they immediately moved us to another Close to everything 
196541,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The hotel is cute well located clean Perfect for a city holiday But What makes it a must stay place is the staff Morgam at the reception was extremely friendly very helpful Noemie served with a big smile changed our perception of French people been not so warm friendly Will definately recommend a stay to all visiting Paris 
196542,Le G n ral H tel, One remark wifi in our room wasn t functioning very well 4th floor , We had a great two nights stay in a room large and comfortable enough for three high demanding women The bathroom was spacious with luxurious toiletries and fluffy towels and bathrobes We didn t have breakfast in the hotel but there are a lot of breakfast spots in the neighborhood Very close to Canal St Martin and Le Marais so there is always something to do around and the R publique metro station with a lot of subway lines coming through this hub is only a few minutes away The staff was very welcoming friendly and always willing to help and the glass of champagne on the house as a welcome offer is a nice extra 
196543,Le G n ral H tel, Triple room Had requested 3 singles beds for 3 adults and were given 2 full size single beds and a child s bed If worked out ok as we ended up coming with a child and one less adult but it wasn t as requested and confirmed , Location and facilities great Nespresso machine in room Sweets in reception which all the kids love 
196544,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Highly accommodating and friendly Happy hour was great Entire staff seemed impeccably trained and customer focus Room was spotless and appropriately equipped for internet chargers adapters etc Great location and overall great value Would definitely staff here again and strongly recommend to others 
196545,Le G n ral H tel, There was one toilet in the shower room but none in the spacious master bath The bath and shower in the master bath which had two sinks was great but for some reason the shower in the 1 2 bath never got beyond lukewarm , The location was just outside le Marais with all major attractions within a short taxi or 15 minute walk Hotel was on a quiet side street The lobby was stylish and comfortable The staff was helpful friendly and courteous They gave us a glass of champagne upon arrival a phone to use while in Paris and the people at the desk were helpful with travel tips for the family all of which made for an authentic experience The family room was a home run with plenty of room for four clean and quiet Typically we would have needed two rooms but this was a great value Ask for 71 
196546,Le G n ral H tel, The room was smaller than what we anticipated This wasn t a problem but when you have 3 suitcases it can sometimes feel a little small Also if you are taking a hop on hop off bus it isn t on the main route and you need to change to get to all the major attractions One day it took us 2 hours to get home from the Eiffel Tower The train station is close by and a better option to getting to the city centre or main attractions The room didn t have an iron , The hotel was really welcoming and funky in the lobby We were on our honeymoon and we re given a glass of champagne on Arrival which was lovely Morgan was really helpful with giving us information about the city and local restaurants We also liked that we had a small but cute balcony The room was clean and tidy 
196547,Le G n ral H tel, I don t have any negative comments it was all good , The bed was extremely comfy the room was very spacious and the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful They also serve a very nice coffee 
196548,Le G n ral H tel, Wifi They have a system where you use the hotel smartphone which is pretty cool But our own devices didn t work at all , The room was light and pleasant Nice interior design It was quiet and clean and for Paris of a decent size The hotel is in a nice vibrant part of town 
196549,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Charming little hotel with lovely staff Well situated and beautiful views over the Parisian rooftops from the spacious suite on the upper floore Would absolutely recommend Le G n ral H tel and hope to stay here again 
196550,Le G n ral H tel, Airconditioning was a bit annoying Caught a lil cold the last night , The whole staff was exceptionally friendly Absolutely recommendable for everyone who s looking for a at home feeling during their holiday 
196551,Le G n ral H tel, The hotel is in a side street between two busy boulevards so there s some street noise but shutting the windows effectively cut this out The rooms are a bit on the small side but again it s what you would expect in this location , Brilliant location very close to Oberkampf and Republique Metro stations and the bustling Place de Republique Lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby and a couple of nice boulangeries too Also it s in easy walking distance of the Musee Picasso in the interesting Marais area The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful The beds were really comfortable a nice change from the hard beds that so many hotels offer nowadays The free soft drinks in the bar and the fitness centre in the basement were nice bonuses too 
196552,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Very accommodating staff Walked to hotel from Paris Est train station Walked to Notre Dame and other sites and quite near Picasso Museum Very comfortable room 
196553,Le G n ral H tel, Didn t like the promise of Occitane toiletries and finding something different on arrival didn t like having a photo taken of my passport at reception to save the planet More pods for coffee machine or at least the offer of more on request , very comfortable bed quality linen very clean Bathroom swanky room adequate size little balcony too Liked the Nespresso machine though would have been good to have more pods Decor throughout was modern and cool Staff excellent very friendly
196554,Le G n ral H tel, The TV only catered for French people so we couldn t watch anything The shower was poor It had no pressure, The hotel staff were amazing So friendly and welcoming The bed was so comfortable and the location for metro was 10 out of 10
196555,Le G n ral H tel, The room wasn t cleaned on our second of 3 days We returned at around 4 pm and the bed hadn t been made or provisions refreshed We left shortly after with the sign on the door to clean it was not , Clean and comfortable near to local facilities 
196556,Le G n ral H tel, The WI Fi isn t that good , The staff and location were great The hotel is cute and it s very easy to get everywhere from here The bed us super comfy Our room was cosy fine if you aren t spending a lot of time in your hotel room 
196557,Le G n ral H tel, The wi fi did not work the whole time we were there We were charged a ridiculous amount of money for a limited breakfast each day at the end of our stay when the website clearly states that breakfast is FREE Very annoyed by this as if we had known we would have eaten out everyday for breakfast , The room was lovely a little small and clean The hotel staff were friendly and the overall atmosphere was very peaceful 
196558,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The staffs make us feel so welcome They go above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible They even make restaurant reservation for us The location is also Perfect not too touristy so many trendy shop dont forget to visit Merci 
196559,Le G n ral H tel, however the wifi didn t work well , The staff was so nice and it is very convenient to get to the subway station And there are a variety of good restaurants nice to try them 
196560,Le G n ral H tel, The room was just tiny we could hardly move in it But still it s Paris nothing new with the space Also there was really poor wi fi coverage in the room though good enough at reception We had no fridge inside no wonder there was no place for it , The staff was really helpful and friendly at all times we needed assistance The room was very clean and all white toilettes were clean and enough for everything facilities Overall impression was quite ok 
196561,Le G n ral H tel, Utilitarian badly organised breakfast with limited choice WiFi shockingly poor for a modern hotel very limited connectivity , Great location to travel around Paris Lots of reasonably priced and varied restaurants nearby Hotel provided free Samsung smartphone with free 4G really handy for navigation and browsing on the go 
196562,Le G n ral H tel, One of the cups we had for coffee or tea was cracked and leaked and we left a note informing them before we went out but it wasn t replaced This may have been because they didn t speak English though I m sure if we told reception we would have got another one , The hotel is a fantastic find brilliant location just walking distance from Republique Metro station which has connections to most of the rest of Paris with loads of restaurants and cafes also nearby Inside the hotel was very trendy with a warm and friendly atmosphere and the room was excellent with a huge comfortable bed coffee and tea facilities bottles of water and a nice trendy sofa The best thing was the provision of a smartphone which can be taken out with you to save you using your data and possibly incurring charges This is pre loaded with apps to help you out such as a Paris maps tours app where you can search for a specific place in Paris e g Notre Dame and it will tell you the best way to get there through all modes of transport including specific Metro lines and buses It also includes TripAdvisor Facebook and Twitter among others just remember to log out again afterwards This impressed us greatly as did the offer of free champagne upon check in The reception staff were very friendly and helpful which isn t always the case in capital cities offering to come up to the room should we need them Overall staying in Le General Hotel was a great experience and if we were to go to Paris again we would definitely consider staying here again 
196563,Le G n ral H tel, Nothing, The staff at Le General were absolutely exceptional Very friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble Our 4 year old son was given a very cool bath duck to take home and we were given a glass of complimentary champagne during our visit Can t wait to go back 
196564,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The bed was extremely cosy and the room was very clean and i liked the little details like water and the Nespresso machine They also gave us a complimentary drink upon arrival very nice 
196565,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The Le General Hotel had friendly staff a great location and spacious room by Paris standards The hotel also now offers free use of a cell phone for every room with GPS maps internet and free international calls which was great as my North Amercain one would have been expensive to use on the continent 
196566,Le G n ral H tel, There was nothing I didn t like, Room decor was very modern coffee machine in the room as well breakfast was really nice too we loved our stay and the receptionist was very helpfully and spoke excellent English I would highly recommend this hotel
196567,Le G n ral H tel, The wifi was very slow on the 6th floor for me , Great design atmosphere The staff is very friendly and helpful They helped me figure out my trip and found out that we re near metro stations shopping and restaurants Amaya is the best it was a joy to check in and felt welcomed everyday The staff asks how you are doing and gives you recommendations to make your trip memorable 
196568,Le G n ral H tel, The wifi connection was terrible we couldn t watch netflix or youtube as the connection was constantly interrupted this was really frustrating as there was a poor selection of TV channels They really need to improve this Room service wasn t available at all times and it was disappointing that after ten we couldn t order to the room However deliveroo delivered , The service is great we were given a welcome drink and the receptionist explained everything about the hotel and told us about the local area recommending restaurants The rooms were very stylish we ended up with 3 double rooms instead of a triple and a double they all have great design features and good lighting We had both a bath and a balcony in our room the balcony looked out onto a typically Parisienne scene which was delightful The hotel staff are really accommodating available whenever needed but leaving us in peace the rest of the time The hotel is really well decorated throughout and has a great selection of design and art books in the lobby we could ve happily spent an evening there studying them and drinking They have a beautiful collection of Louis Vuitton City Guides that I had never seen before The facilities are impressive mineral water and pods for the nespresso machine were readily available and the fitness room and sauna are fantastic The sauna is kept at a good temperature at all times and was quiet everywhere including the sauna and gym was spotless The area that the hotel is situated in has lots of lovely little bars and restaurants on back streets it seems quite bohemian in places There are health food shops and an amazing gluten free bakers within ten minutes walk from the hotel It s not far from the Pompidou centre and on the walk there you can find lovely shops specialising in anything from high fashion to cacti It s a great area to wander around shopping stopping to sit and watch the people go by every now and then at a cafe bar I will definitely go back to Le General we had a fantastic couple of nights there and wished we could stay longer 
196569,Le G n ral H tel, La Republique metro station closed due to demo , Front of house staff were excellent Best welcome ever experienced in a hotel especially in a city hotel 
196570,Le G n ral H tel, Large bathroom was lovely but water pressure in the shower a bit of a disappointment In saying that it did not detract from the positive experience , Big room for Paris standards clean everthing a traveller would need complimentary things like toothbrush and toothpaste comb etc Nespresso machine and lovely tea bags Comfy bed and modern decor We had asked for a quiet room and this is what we got The surprise of a Samsung mobile phone for internet connection and international calls we were invited to take it with us on our city expeditions very useful Cozy tables and chairs downstairs Complimentary drink on arrival at the bar and bottled water in the room Overall an excellent place close to Republique within 2 3 minutes walk to the station Boulangerie Utopie close by an absolute must We will definitely return to Paris and will try to stay at Le General for our next trip 
196571,Le G n ral H tel, 2 huge drawbacks Room 66 is next to the lift and faces the busy road so it was so noisy You need earplugs to sleep The noise level is unbearable evn with the double glazed windows The wifi on the 6th floor is incredibly slow A fridge would have been nice , The hotel is great stylish modern clean and well located near Republique and the metro The bathroom is really luxurious and the bed is comfortable The room is well appointed Cute small balcony Good heating and a c Really nice staff Junior Suite is nice but not as large as the pictures indicate 
196572,Le G n ral H tel, Wifi in the room was not stable , Every room provides a smart phone with 4G and free phone call I really like the Nespresso coffee machine in the room The style of the room is young and modern 
196573,Le G n ral H tel, Room was very small No wardrobe to put clothes in No amenity kit No mini bar No slippers Rooms smell nasty No chair to change shoes you have to sit on the bed No bathtub only shower and odd enough they supplied a floating duck don t know what was its purpose Water wasn t flowing properly so the shower wasn t enjoyable , They provided a mobile phone that made my life easier with unlimited data and all for free The location is very good 
196574,Le G n ral H tel, Even though this is Paris the room was pretty small Fortunately the good sized bathroom and natural light made up for this HOWEVER the water pressure was really poor this is a 4 star hotel so being on the 6th floor shouldn t make this an issue On checking out my husband asked for a 2nd bill for his work and the service and response was unpleasant I was sitting to one side and saw the eye rolling and dirt looks that went on behind my husband s back This is unacceptable He was informed it would take 30 minutes to complete this procedure If there is an issue with doing this for paying clients than I suggest that the hotel management re access its software or billing processes Not a very pleasant way to end our stay , The lady at check in was very friendly The hotel was warm clean and the general atmosphere decor was very welcoming Nice bonus is the Spa even though we didn t use it 
196575,Le G n ral H tel, Even though it has undergone a relatively recent renovation the bathroom is already looking a little worn We were in a privilege room room 10 and the tiles in the shower were bulging and warped in places Room 10 also suffers from noise transfer from what I can only imagine is the ground floor I don t know if it was the receptionist or bar staff but all night we could hear someone in noisy shoes walking up and down This went on all night through to the morning Maybe they need to invest in soft rubber heel shoes Complained in the night and the morning but very unsympathetic staff Eventually on the third night we were moved to a quieter room at the front of the hotel a much smaller room and no refund was offered for the price paid for a larger room Again soundproofing is poor as can hear traffic but preferable to clomping heels through the night If you stay here don t stay in room 10 , All looks really nice in the pictures and the rooms look as depicted It is stated that there is soundproofing but don t be fooled If you are a light sleeper this is not for you There was a different receptionist each morning and none were particularly helpful or sympathetic 
196576,Le G n ral H tel, Book directly with the hotel and you ll get free breakfast for the one euro more Booking com don t provide this offer and will not match it unfortunately So do your own research before booking , Friendly welcoming atmosphere Small but comfortable room Great location Would definitely stay there again 
196577,Le G n ral H tel, Nothing, Thoroughly excellent hotel and very helpful lady on reception helped to make this a great weekend break from London Bed is extremely comfy and room was excellently appointed and bathroom perfect This is a great find in a fun and interesting area of Paris
196578,Le G n ral H tel, Room was very small too small for 2 sharing Beds could not be seperated adequatte distance to be comfortable sleeping with work collegue Duvet was not nice Breakfast was ok not great , Location was good
196579,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Staff were beautiful and friendly accommodating and made us feel at home especially at the end of a long trip where we re getting fatigued at not being fluent in French Italian or Spanish
196580,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and super helpful My room was clean and comfortable The hotel was in a great location quick walk to restaurants cafe s and the subway I would stay there again 
196581,Le G n ral H tel, Breakfast food was not as good as I had hoped Definitely not worth EUR18 person The front desk recommended some restaurants for us but they were pretty bad restaurants , Great and friendly staff Room was nice 
196582,Le G n ral H tel, Small room but cozy and comfortable , Fantastic front of house staff Really made me feel welcome Loved the mobile phone with city mapper function came in very handy The best boutique hotel as frequented by French travellers you really get an authentic experience 
196583,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Staff were very helpful Room was amazing Fun neighborhood to be in for shopping and greet restaurants Would definitely recommend this place to anyone 
196584,Le G n ral H tel, The breakfast was a bit pricey at 18 per person so we didn t avail of it But there s a few cafes around the corner selling a petit dejunais for 6 50, Loved the extras The chocolates nespresso machine slippers and bath robe Also the locctaine products in the bathroom 
196585,Le G n ral H tel, I just wish they had toothpaste provided in the bathroom , The room was described as cosy and i was expecting a tiny room for a single traveler but it was better than I expected The room was spacious and heavenly I loved the modern interior decor and interesting photos all throughout the halls and rooms The bed was very comfortable I would pass out the moment my head hit the pillow They even provided a local phone to help suggest restaurants places to shop and a map app in case you get lost It saved me several times I would highly recommend this hotel to any visitor I would most definitely stay here again the next time I m in Paris A bientot
196586,Le G n ral H tel, A lot of high tables and chairs at breakfast so not very ideal for when you have a toddler They didn t have any meals other than breakfast only sodas and coffee tea hot chocolate But with it so centrally located it s just a quick hop to the restaurant we can recommend the pizza place across the street Lovely people and good food make for a great evening within close range of our baby monitor They organise MasterChef cooking classes Maybe you should put whatever they re making that day or that class on the menu , This is quite a trendy hotel which has been recently renovated so we were told by the neighbours Amelia at reception always jumped up at our service and the rest of the staff were polite and amiable Our room was in order including the baby cot we asked for and clean and everything worked The place is right next to Place de la Republique so within walking distance of some restaurants and very easy access to the Metro Tip 1 If you like us are traveling with lots of big suitcases book an Uber to take you to the hotel They are quick friendly and cheaper than the local taxis Tip 2 There is a little red shack on the Place which organizes games and puts out loads of toys on Wednesday afternoons for adults and kids to play and amuse themselves I think at a small fee There is also a skate ramp there which makes for some very spectacular and disastrous viewing of skaters company 
196587,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, very good location next to Republique Metro station canal St Martin and the Oberkampf and Marais district free use of a mobile phone with 3G and unlimited calls during stay
196588,Le G n ral H tel, I didn t have a view but didn t need one since we were exploring Paris most of the day , I unexpectedly had to get a hotel in Paris with my 6 yr old This was great all staff spoke English and we were provided a cell with maps to help us around town AC and ice cubes were at our service Very clean and modern 
196589,Le G n ral H tel, The shower it took long before we had warm water Because of a waterlimiter the shower is very poor Suggestion don t change the towels every day but give the customer a better showerexperience , Very good location Very original design and the room had a very high finish Good airco Very friendly staff Breakfast was good Perfect ambiance 
196590,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, If Carlsberg did hotels this would be pretty close to the blueprint It is a fantastic hotel and a steal at the price The location is in a nice suburb of Paris not too far from Notre Dame The girl on reception was extremely helpful friendly and her English was perfect Each room was equipped with a temporary mobile phone to be used during your stay with unlimited 4g This was a god send and saved a fortune in data roaming charges I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
196591,Le G n ral H tel, Rooms weren t as soundproof as we would have liked but it didn t impact sleeping at all , Rooms were beautiful bed was massive location was 10 10
196592,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Very clean and the bed was comfortable The room was huge and the extra bed was just as comfortable as normal bed Definitely going back to this place 
196593,Le G n ral H tel, An option for a small refrigerator in the suite would have been a plus but the staff were helpful with ice , Room was spacious light filled and in a great location 
196594,Le G n ral H tel, I was a bit concerned about security at night the front doors were not locked and there was just one person there to mind the front and also the bar Its a scary world now sadly so its something that I thought a bit about My first room was tiny but I am glad that I moved to a slightly bigger one They certainly maximized the space I was not certain that the WIFI was the best It seemed very slow , The staff was SO nice and very helpful with everything I loved that we had Nespresso in the room the giant TV white high gloss finishes and the honor bar was great too The design of the lobby was also very cool I could tell that they tried very hard to make the hotel hip and added great details and design elements Sort of an Ace hotel feel 
196595,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, The hotel is a quirky boutique hotel with very friendly staff The location is excellent and is close to the metro and many bars and pubs The rooms were a bit small but good enough for 2 people The man who opened the door for us in the early hours of the morning was very friendly and helpful if we needed anything Cant comment on the food because we didnt eat at the hotel 
196596,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Our Junior Suite was spacious modern and beautifully decorated Breakfast had a great selection and the honesty bar a great touch Adore the Oberkampf area We will be staying at this hotel again 
196597,Le G n ral H tel,No Negative, Excellent value for money Good location close to metro with many restaurants around Very attentive customer services at the reception desk Modern room facilities comfortable beds large TV stable and fast WiFi Would definitely recommend 
196598,Le G n ral H tel, The room I stayed at didn t have a wardrobe or chest of drawers I traveled light so it wasn t a big problem for me , Good location as the metro is very close by there are plenty of restaurants and caf s around the hotel itself is located in a quiet street just off the main road Has lifts so you don t have to drag heavy luggage up the stairs The staff was very friendly welcoming and helpful The room was perfect for a two night stay a bit small but it wasn t a problem for me but very clean and also had a little coffee machine and kettle for tea 24 hour reception desk was a saver as I had to check out very early in the morning Overall a very enjoyable stay 
196599,Le G n ral H tel, The room was small but for 2 of us it was fine we were out and about too much to care , Great location very clean with very friendly and helpful staff We would definitely stay here again
