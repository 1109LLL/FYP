3778,Monhotel Lounge SPA,No Negative, Nice hotel Room was beautiful and bed very comfortable Did not expect big rooms in Paris so size was really ok with 2 windows Bathroom modern and new with a GREAT shower Staff was wonderfull since reservation They sent me an email prior to my arrival asking if they could help me in anyway and also asking if I had any special needs such as extra beds I had a last minute health problem in the family and had to arrive one day earlier and stay for 1 night less Audrey was wonderful and managed to receive me before and dealt herself with Booking to change my reservation I sent a note to her when I was entering my flight from Cannes to Paris and when I left the airplane she had already sorted everything out They even charged me a lower rate as on the day I arrived the room costed a little less In this same day Saturday June 25 I went out with friends and arrived really hungry at the hotel at 1 30AM and the guy from reception can t believe I forgot his name Maybe Hadesmi managed to open the restaurant and get to my room a nice aspargus risoto bread yougurt and a warm smile even thought riom service finishes at midnight Really had a very nice experience at Monhotel and recomend it 
3779,Monhotel Lounge SPA, Not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is OK but they also noted down the CVV number from the back of the credit card This means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases Since this is unacceptable I asked the receptionist to delete the CVV but she refused This policy should be changed Otherwise good hotel ,No Positive
3780,Monhotel Lounge SPA, N A, Fantastic weekend with my partner We Would definitely stay here again Location was excellent and couldn t have asked for a better area to stay in Was so close to the metro and all the shops bars and restaurants Room was lovely and cosey and very modern with a classy edge to the facility 
3781,Monhotel Lounge SPA, The sauna is a wonderfull addition it s a shame I had to slalom in the cleaning staff halway almost filled with cleaning products Also the proximity to the cleaning staff s room added all the noise to what was supposed to be a quiet moment maybe it would be a good idea to relocate their general quarter , Good location really good breakfast maybe the best I ever had in Paris in a confortable and stylish setting Everything you need is provided on site you can literally arrive with your hands in your pockets Helpfull and attentive staff 
3782,Monhotel Lounge SPA, They have maintenance and I couldn t enjoy the balcony view , I asked to be downgraded because I was paying for a balcony room while I couldn t enjoy the balcony Instead they upgraded me with the biggest room in the hotel for the same rate 
3783,Monhotel Lounge SPA, Reception not impressive building was under construction Room passage was way to small Room has also no space, The room has everything inside as a full package
3784,Monhotel Lounge SPA, lift wasn t working to 6th floor as under maintenance room service dinners aren t the greatest , excellent breakfast comfortable bed stayed in a room with a balcony room 601 highly recommend this room and hotel short walk to metro and arc de triumph 
3785,Monhotel Lounge SPA,No Negative, Mon Hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near Champs Elysees in a little street coming from l Avenue des Grand Armees near the Bus Direct stop airport shuttle The metro station Argentine line 1 is just 2 min away and it can lead you everywhere in town Very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in Paris The mini market Le Marche d Etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need The street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building The service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful The room is so confy specially the bed Air conditioning works great as well as the wifi To end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before I was really WOWed Highly recommended 
3786,Monhotel Lounge SPA, I didn t liked that SPA and massage rooms were under maintenance Breakfast was a bit overpriced 20euro per person just for a breakfast just outside there are few restourants that had main course and dessert for same price , Room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound They gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the Europe and North America it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in Paris Staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on It is litterally 5minutes from Arc de Triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a Paris from there its absolutely beutiful Metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere Really nice location highly recommended 
3787,Monhotel Lounge SPA, Nothing to declare , The hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour The staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in Paris 
3788,Monhotel Lounge SPA, No gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom Also I was not allowed to then change hotel after I discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short I was then emailed far to late saying I could change but by that time I was already at work Also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too Absolute joke how you can get away with that ,No Positive
