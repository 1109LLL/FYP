449425,Hotel Advance, tried to call several times before arriving and just got an answering machine saying that the offices were only open till like 6pm got us quite upset to not be able to get through to the front desk when we arrived someone was there but i suppose that they just don t answer the phone Lobby a bit small no patio or anything , not really that many stars but clean and close to all the sites

449435,Hotel Advance, Little things for them to improve on There should be a choice of different thickness of pillow in each room not all the same In our room we had 4 very thick pillows These were too thick for me but there was no choice 2 thick 2 thin seems likely to please more people , Lots was great too much to list
