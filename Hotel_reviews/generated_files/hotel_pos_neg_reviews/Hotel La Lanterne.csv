40089,Hotel La Lanterne, I didn t dislike anything it was all great I would recommend there being more international channels on the TV, The location was great we were able to walk everywhere The room was great perfect for a short stay Food wise we had no problem finding great deals with the surrounding restaurants
40090,Hotel La Lanterne, The odor in our restroom coming from the shower Very pungent like rotten eggs And we had a small little patio that was right off our room into the courtyard It was specific to our room but others would sit there at night smoking and the cigarette smoke smell would come right into our room , Loved the location A quick stroll down to the Seine and Cathedral Notre Dame Great little restaurants and shops all around the area our personal favorite Le Dante The pool was small but perfect Basically an oversized jacuzzi in the basement with the prettiest architectural brick work It also had a steam room and shower down stairs We had the pool area to ourselves The front desk was always very helpful and spoke English too When we needed transportation they d call taxi service and Taxi service arrived very quickly 2 3 minutes tops 
40091,Hotel La Lanterne, The bathroom was a little bit smaller than the pictures made it seem we were in room 23 but this wasn t an issue , The location was superb it is a 2 minute walk to the Pantheon the Notre Dame and the Seine The staff were really friendly and the room was always clean the cleaner even tidied my shoes into a neat line when we came back after our day out The free bottles of water everyday were a nice touch and definitely needed I liked that the hotel was set back from the road and so it was quiet Would definitely return 
40092,Hotel La Lanterne, No TV remote Didn t cause us any bother but maybe would have reached for it if it were there , Room design was superb walk in shower excellent Aircon very good 
40093,Hotel La Lanterne, There was nothing we did not like , There was plenty of choice for breakfast The pool was lovely and the location excellent Staff were available and helpful any time of day or night 
40094,Hotel La Lanterne, 1 crampy room 2 deceptive advertising swimming pool which is no more than an oversized spa although on the photos looks big due to as we discovered having mirror on the wall moreover just during our stay the pool was closed due to annual maintenance about which we were informed only after making the booking as well as a complimentary breakfast that appeared to be non existentent hotel blamed Booking com for allegedly not updating their website on time 3 entrance below the street level problem when carrying heavy luggage down upstairs from to the street, Location and comfy bed
40095,Hotel La Lanterne, Although the room was nice the double bed was more like a three quarter , Nice hotel two minutes from the Metro and ten minutes walk to the Seine Smallish room but perfectly adequate Friendly helpful staff Nice breakfast with real orange juice as opposed to the awful squash most hotels serve The pool looks great but we didn t have time to use it 
40096,Hotel La Lanterne, Small rooms and hotel service is not that good Location is far from paris landmarks and city center Too expensive for what you get , Safe clean and comfortable hotel 
40097,Hotel La Lanterne, The bed for two friends was too small We really needed a queen or larger or at least two twins It would also have been nice to have a balcony though they only have three at the property so it was not feasible , The staff was great The courtyard serene The grotto experience suburb Very fresh modern and comfortable rooms and experience Would come back for sure 
40098,Hotel La Lanterne, Pool water temperature too cold No porter to help with luggage Difficult access to hotel reception from main road with luggage that needs to be taken down steps to accees hotel,No Positive
40099,Hotel La Lanterne, The hotel lacked atmosphere The bar was a self service shelf in the lobby and didn t lend itself to sitting for a quiet relaxing drink The hotel knew that it was our honeymoon but didn t acknowledge this is any way This was disappointing when we had paid more for this hotel than for some of the others available when we booked , The bed was very comfortable The room was small but clean and had everything we needed The location was fantastic very close to Notre Dame shops and cafes The pool area was small but looked fabulous unfortunately we didn t have time to make use of it during our stay 
40100,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, Great location just off Boulevard Saint Germain and close to Metro Market just around the corner and amazing restaurants in the area The swimming pool is fantastic after a long day of walking and exploring nearby attractions like Notre Dame and the Louvre Staff was really helpful and accommodated early check in and the breakfast was top class Would highly recommend this hotel
40101,Hotel La Lanterne, Small but lovely pool with steam room clean and uncrowded , Very central just a short walk from Notre Dame and close to Maubert Mutualite metro stop Pool and steam room small but great Hotel right next to a bit of an ugly police station and down some ugly steps Hotel was certainly not as fancy and upmarket as the photos looked Disappointing if you are expecting a fancy boutique hotel Also starting to get a wee bit old but for 2 people for a few nights in central Paris the price wold be good Just don t expect an upmarket boutique hotel 
40102,Hotel La Lanterne, Absolutely nothing, Location location location service from staff was excellent extremely helpful provided ideas of what to do and nothing was an issue Spa was great especially after a days walking in Paris The little extra of a mobile phone pre loaded with the attractions things to do calls etc was just a great idea 
40103,Hotel La Lanterne, nothing it was perfect for my very exigent taste, I loved it It s a beautiful small elegant Boutique hotel for a contemporary design lovers super clean and comfortable wonderful spa perfect to relax after a tiring day 
40104,Hotel La Lanterne, I missed a place inside the Box to put personal bath items, The room is a good size The bed is super comfy and it really is a double bed and not two beds placed together The fence of light and noise are efficient But it is best to stroll around Paris all day and return to the hotel swimming pool with strong massage jets and a sauna 
40105,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, Excellent location comfortable and clean rooms The pool and the steam bath was a great way to relax after hours of walking around Paris Very helpful and friendly staff The receptionist recommended and booked a superb restaurant for us 
40106,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, perfectly central in a great neighbourhood for cafes bistros and interesting restaurants and within walking distance of most things A great spa pool for taking the weight off aching legs in the evenings 
40107,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, Great staff and additional free services provided e g Free mobile phone with unlimited data and calls for duration of stay also umbrellas when raining
40108,Hotel La Lanterne, Would have liked a bathtub but space at a premium on the top floor Not a big problem , Very quiet location yet near shops metro and restaurants Excellent reception happy to help with ice buckets etc Loved our two terraces 
40109,Hotel La Lanterne, Breakfast was below my expectations with very poor selection of food , Nice modern hotel with a comfortable and quiet room with friendly staff and great WiFi 
40110,Hotel La Lanterne, Very minor issue with replenishment of breakfast buffet items Classic room had no drawers at all to put small items in , Very helpful and friendly reception staff Rooms and whole hotel finished to a high standard Room safe big enough to take large laptops Location about 400 metres from the Seine and Notre Dame Cathedral right by the Latin Quarter with great selection of restaurants
40111,Hotel La Lanterne, The rooms are incredibly small US cousins will not be able to get their large suitcases in the room we had We struggled to find space for one small case between two of us Clothes hanging space was extremely limited It would have been better not to have had a separate toilet with no washbasin and to use that cubicle to put a wardrobe in instead There was plenty of room in the bathroom for the toilet We had to walk sideways along the end of the bed to reach the bathroom Looking at the room plans we didn t see much bigger rooms and we certainly didn t have the cheapest , The location is great The staff are lovely and friendly Just around the corner is a boulangerie patiserrie bistro wine shop cheese shop greengrocer fish monger butcher deli all in a row On top of that is a little market above a metro station A taxi rank across the road always has taxis available and the ride across Paris is considerably cheaper than London 8 euros to the Gare du Nord in London 35 Victoria station to St Pancras 
40112,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, The spa pool and hammam were a great addition after a long day in the city The bed was very comfortable staff extremely helpful and friendly The location was excellent to explore Paris Close to metro station and Notre dame 
40113,Hotel La Lanterne, Too bad that the unit to boil eggs is very slow check the temperature At 10am it was still cold On our last day no hot water to shower No compensation only well meaned excuses A bikini got lost , Rooms are very spacious for Paris standard Hammam and pool are a nice addition Room bathroom pool and hammam are very clean Breakfast is OK 
40114,Hotel La Lanterne, The bed was a little too soft , The jacuzzi pool and hamman were fabulous after a long day seeing the sights Great location close to the metro and notre dame but not at all noisy 
40115,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, courtesy cellular phone offered in every room with free internet and free phone calls throughout france canada and USA Facebook skype citymapper are a few of the apps on it If more needed 15 the hour very well situated very near to subway and RER B Very near to market open 3 4 times a week bathroom spotless clean and new stayed 4 nights bed sheets were changed at least 2 times lots of lightings in the room clever switches enable easy turning off amenities are plenty and replaced whenever used 
40116,Hotel La Lanterne, storage rooms are typically small in Paris but there was difficulty storing 2 suitcases in the room Could have done away with desk and sorted out more storage , Great location and such helpful staff Area has lovely food shops and restaurants Comfortable rooms and superb pool in the basement 
40117,Hotel La Lanterne, Really minor issue overall amazing experience The room I was in was street level and the bathroom window faced out The Window was massive and when the curtains were closed you could still see out unless someone holds it closed which is what we did , Staff were amazing Really helpful and friendly Great location to get around and the pool offered a nice respite after walking around the city for most of the day
40118,Hotel La Lanterne, Thiugh beautifully designed the double rooms were a bit too cramped and lacking space for opening two large suitcases etc Needed more shelves more drawers and more hooks in the bathroom etc to really feel unpacked and settled in Space issue required an upgrade to the two room suite which was marvelous A bit above our budget but the value was there , The staff all seemed to know us and were exceptionally friendly and helpful The rooms were beautifully designed although typically small and lacking sufficient storage space for a stay more than a couple of days The rooms seemed recently remodeled with the greatest taste shown in design details and gave an overall sense of harmony and comfort Location just off St Germaine convenient to Metro a farmers market a Sunday flea market at the end of the block restaurants everywhere and dozens of bakeries to pick up your fresh croissants in the morning A police station in the same block which gave a nice sense of security We will definitely return 
40119,Hotel La Lanterne, Some fellow hotel guests who were rude Clearly nothing the hotel could do about that , We love the staff They were friendly and helpful We were quite excitable and boisterous but it didn t phase them at all 
40120,Hotel La Lanterne, No refill of bottled water sometimes no refill of coffee All the other hotels we ve stayed in Paris supplied us a lot of bottled waters coffee everyday We were at the first floor Probably higher floor is better If you have lots of luggages it is very hard to bring up to the street , The staff were very helpful I like the cleanliness of the hotel 
40121,Hotel La Lanterne, The price of breakfast was a bit much I thought but I guess prices in Paris in general can be quite high , Lovely new hotel stunning decor great location loved the pool and wellness area 
40122,Hotel La Lanterne, The room could have been bigger , The breakfast was delicious especially the grapefruit juice crepes and yogurt All the staff were very kind and respectful despite my poor French It was very quiet and peaceful Good location only about a block from metro stop The pool and hammam were much appreciated after walking all day My daughter and I enjoyed 5 nights at this amazing hotel 
40123,Hotel La Lanterne, The spa sensory shower didn t work and you were made to give room keys in when you left the hotel but when you came back even just to grab something you would often wait 10 minutes for a member of staff to come back to reception The room was very small expected in Paris but possibly not for that price 5 for a small bottle of Evian in the room very steep too , Location and the small pool in the basement Nicely styled
40124,Hotel La Lanterne, We were alone in the breakfast room for about 10 minutes before we were offered coffee The rooms are quite small which was not a problem for our short stay but could potentially be an issue , Perfect location for our trip Cozy design Very well thought through brilliant use of the small space 
40125,Hotel La Lanterne, We had to wait a considerable time before a staff member appeared at breakfast although we could help our selves to food we had no access to hot drinks and had to wait to be served , Lovely bedroom although the air con didn t seem to work all that well Very clean with a great shower 
40126,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, Very well appointed rooms are very comfortable though small as to be expected in this neighborhood Has an elevator though there are a few stairs into the building from the street 
40127,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, Great location plenty of restaurants around and only about five minutes walk from Notre Dame The pool and steam room were a nice bonus for a city based hotel and the room was furnished to a high standard 
40128,Hotel La Lanterne, On both evenings when returning there was vomit on the two sets of steps leading to the hotel the cleaner did not bother to clean the room at all on the second day the staff were generally unresponsive to our complaints over priced hotel , It is very close to the Sorbonne in the Latin Quarter which is an area that we like 
40129,Hotel La Lanterne, Nothing it was fantastic , The location is excellent Although the pool is small you can get a great swim with the everlasting pool feature The rooms are chic and the location is perfect for exploring the Latin Quarter and Le Marais
40130,Hotel La Lanterne, There was nothing at all to dislike about this gem of a hotel , Staff were excellent and the hotel was in pristine condition due to the fact it has only been open a short while I would most definitely stay here again if I visit Paris 
40131,Hotel La Lanterne, Buffet breakfast was expensive for the quality provided Room was a little small Bathroom bin in room was not emptied from previous occupant No wine in mini bar , Comfortable well located lovely to have use of nice pool and spa area included
40132,Hotel La Lanterne, The lack of storage and clothes hooks was a real problem and yet so easy to fix it would take no time and cost so little yet without these it was a real issue Please sort this out , Location staff welcome and indoor pool

40138,Hotel La Lanterne, The room was so tiny and chlaustrophic and the staff overcharged us for our room on our exit and wouldn t budge on the price , We loved the decor and location
40139,Hotel La Lanterne, The rooms are tiny One can hardly walk around the bed Bathroom is so small that you can t even put your wash bag down I had to keep it in the bedroom Not convenient Bed is quite small double queen size Just enough for 2 people to squeeze in Swimming pool is small not for swimming More of a large Jacuzzi , Location is fantastic Hotel nicely decorated modern very nice Pool area is also very enjoyable Staff is very nice 
40140,Hotel La Lanterne, First room we got was very dark and cramped but we were offered another one overlooking the garden that was much better Room service a bit random , Amazing hotel perfect location Beautiful swimming pool and hammam area 
40141,Hotel La Lanterne, Breakfast area not so good looked like a swimming bars caf and shame there wasn t a nice bar area , Staff particularly the receptionist was very helpful and friendly and booked a fab restaurant for us The pool area and hamman was clean and attractive Room was compact but well designed and comfortable

40143,Hotel La Lanterne, That we didn t have another week , This hotel property is a GEM Immediately upon arriving you feel like you are home Esther was our first point of contact She could not have been more delightful Then add in Sebastian Maria and i am sorry I forgot the gentleman s name who was at the desk when we checked out all fabulous The housekeeping was simply some of the best we have ever had Add in the honor wine bar the tranquil pool and Turkish steam and you have a top notch Gem sitting in the perfect location of the Latin Quarter 
40144,Hotel La Lanterne,No Negative, La Lanterne is a beautiful and ideally placed Boutique Hotel if you want to discover Paris Our room was nicely decorated and quiet The place smells of good taste All the staff were friendly and multilingual I can only recommend this place 
40145,Hotel La Lanterne, No value for money to be had here shoe box of a room and lots and lots of issues as the hotel is brand new Don t order room service it is simply not good If it was a three star at half the price then I would rate it 5 all around bar room service For a four star hotel there is much better value to be gotten elsewhere PS The pool is tiny in the basement and next to the breakfast room not a pool that one wants to spend time in , Brand new hotel Staff are trying hard
