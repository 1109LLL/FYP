115063,Le Meurice,No Negative, The room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure Friendly personnel extra nice The whole service The personnel was perfect and the room very comfortable 
115064,Le Meurice, The famous Michelin restaurant with creative menu However the dessert I don t really like it Strawberry with warm oily soup very strange and scary , The best view in Paris Thanks for offering the top floor with a nice view of Paris The best employee is Dino He is very nice and professional and extremely polite from checkin till checkout I had wonderful night in the hotel 
115065,Le Meurice, Don t get breakfast 56 euros no buffet and bad coffee Tea was also disappointing 50 euros barely any selection of tea using tea bags not loose tea , Room and service were impeccable Concierge helped with every possible effort Fabulous location Pastries were amazing you can just get them not the afternoon tea but then again there are amazing pastries at 10 different places within walking distance that cost a couple of euro instead of 13 
115066,Le Meurice, A couple of opportunities for improvement if I may it would have been nice if the shower had a handshower along with the standard showerhead Also for whatever reason I was unable to use my french styler in the bathroom I could plug it in but it did not heat properly Fortunately I could use it in the room and as there were plenty of mirrors it was no great trouble Last thing my partner requested a high gloss gla age polish for his shoes which proved disappointing , We stayed at the Meurice for 2 nights over a week end as a birthday celebration for my partner and got the most wonderful treatment from the moment we stepped in the lobby We were greeted with great kindness by the front desk and they surprised us with a free room upgrade so lovely The room was wonderfully appointed with a welcoming bag of chocolates by Alain Ducasse and every possible amenity you could wish for It was decorated in XVIII th century style think lovely furniture glamorous chandelier thick draped curtains and even two majestic columns and offered ample space to hang your clothes multiple drawers a very comfortable sitting area and the most luxurious bed which came with a lavender spray to help you get a good night rest Our choice of newspapers was waiting for us every morning at the door of our room On Saturday afternoon as we were back in our room for a bit of rest the staff surprised us with a birthday chocolate cake which was so very thoughtful and utterly delicious During our stay we visited the Bar 228 twice for cocktails in the evening The bar is both impressive with its high painted ceiling and cosy with wood panelling and dimmed lights Cocktails are inventive and the staff is ever so attentive a compliment that must be paid to everyone in this hotel really from the footmen to the chambermaids and of course every single person who waited on us at breakfast or tea everyone was genuinely attentive to our needs and general well being The whole staff was extremely kind and we could feel their utmost priority was to ensure we felt at home at all times and had the most wonderful stay ever On both mornings we had breakfast in the sumptuous Alain Ducasse restaurant which is reminiscent of the Ch teau de Versailles very grand and full of light 
115067,Le Meurice, The junior suite which i booked was a little small and different from what i saw at booking, The staff was proffesional and welcoming they make the stay at the hotel worth the money
115068,Le Meurice, Staff were just not helpful at all we couldn t have the vegetable soup in the Dali restaurant but we could on room service Really at 1 000 a night had to wait in the corridor as room wasn t ready until 5pm and then we were asked to leave as there was another client checking in at 1pm Fire alarm went off during dinner it was an accident Food menu in restaurant was the same for lunch and dinner and was really average 1 700 for one night and dinner with very poor service and average food we will not be returning or recommending , The location was perfect 
115069,Le Meurice, eggs benedict with spinach below standard bland and tasteless brioche chewy bland eggs dry spinach a couple of raw leaves latte machiato not great, service very professional friendly and fast
115070,Le Meurice, Rooms for this price could be larger and more comfortable We booked a junior suit but had no view We were expecting to have the garden view for this price , Location is good staff is very helpful and seems to like their job 
115071,Le Meurice, We booked two Executive rooms We were given on Executive room the other one was not It was much smaller and had little attention compared to the other room , Concierge was very helpful
115072,Le Meurice, We thought our room was alitle small with just the inner roof tops of the hotel as our view Good thing we had heavy drapes to cover our view Would have expected at least a court yard as a view for that price , Loved the staff and the beautiful facilities they offered in the hotel except our room Would reccomend to others and will return again 
115073,Le Meurice, The fact that breakfast was not included in the room rate At these prices it certainly should have been, The hotel itself is beautiful and all the furnishings are amazing 
115074,Le Meurice, If something internet was slow and for higher speed it s a cost not expected in a hotel of this price range , The best hotel in Paris everything is very good breakfast is the best ever rooms clean and very comfortable quiet Very discrete hotel and the staff is very good and service is direct The restaurant was closed but we will try it next time and I am sure it s VERY good
