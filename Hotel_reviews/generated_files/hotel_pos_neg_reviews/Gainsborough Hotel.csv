232697,Gainsborough Hotel, The room felt airless the window did not open and in the middle of the night I woke up wondering if there was enough oxygen with the room being so small However there was , excellent bed linen
232698,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom had a little sewage smell Getting into the bath tub was not easy nor safe The pillows were a little too firm for us , Location of the hotel was excellent Staff were friendly 
232699,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was hot with no working air conditioning though a fan was provided The window opened on to a small recess in the middle of the block 1 metre squared filled with large pipework i e a functioning window Poor continental breakfast selection Selection of tea in the hotel limited to English tea or Green tea , Brilliant location Friendly helpful staff Great full English breakfast 
232700,Gainsborough Hotel, The beds were a bit small I am only 6ft and hung over the end But then it added to the feeling of being back in 1oth century London No mini fridges in the room so don t expect to be able to keep anything cold that you bring back with you , Loved the decor Felt like you were in an old London house Continental breakfast was excellent Good variety of food and never left hungry in the morning 
232701,Gainsborough Hotel, Everything looked a little tired Bathroom fitments were decidedly old The whole room needed referbishing although I liked the style , Location is really good and the underground is close Good breakfast Very pleasant staff Liked the old fashioned decor and ambiance 
232702,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small and old Definitely needs lots of improvement , Location but there are many other hotels in that location with better value for money 
232703,Gainsborough Hotel, Tiny single room to be expected but this room was so hot There was a portable air conditioning unit in the room that was so noisy you could hear it when you came out of the lift 5 rooms away Impossible to sleep with the noise of that and the heat when it was turned off The shower also had a lot of black mold in around the tiles and all of the sealer Tiles were cracked and black in between them The bathroom and furniture in the single room leave a lot to be desired and are in desperate need of replacing No way a four star More like two One member of check in staff was also very rude to me They were unable to take card payments when I arrived as there was something wrong with their system She kept telling me to go to a cash point to get cash out to pay for my two nights stay and wanted another 50 cash as a deposit I told her I would do so in a while but wanted to go to my room first as I had a long journey getting to the hotel and wanted to drop my luggage off When I came down about half an hour later she shouted at me across the reception in front of other guests and asked me if I had fixed the problem with my card Not only was this incredibly rude and tactless of her it was also very inappropriate as my card was perfectly fine it was their system that was down She made me feel like some kind of low life When I came back with all of the cash for her she started speaking in a foreign language with the porter I couldnt say of she was talking about me as I didnt know the language The other receptionist then kindly asked them to refrain from doing this as they had a guest present and it was very rude of them to do so Instead of making me feel like a low life they could of easily just taken payment by my card when their system was up again Needless to say I wont be staying there again despite the great location , location was good
232704,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small The window in the bedroom did not open The air conditioning was unbearably loud and not incredibly effective so it was oppressively hot preventing any sleep on my first night Fortunately the weather was cooler on my second night so I didn t require the air conditioning , The location was excellent and very close to South Kensington underground Quiet street Very helpful staff Clean room and comfortable bed 
232705,Gainsborough Hotel, When we booked through booking com I booked an air conditioned room which I did not get The stopper in the sink was not working So the water did not drain properly even though I complained nothing was done at all i asked for an iron and ironing board to be kept jn my room while going out but was told that the hotel was full so cannot keep in room and that they would put it in after a couple of hours but not done had to ask for it again the next day n then it was delivered Will not return to this hotel would rather pay a bit more and at least get what you booked for , Location
232706,Gainsborough Hotel, Maintenance of the rooms Everything seemed to be either worn out or tired The chairs in the breakfast room were too low to be comfortable especially in the window seats The hot water was dangerously hot I had to change rooms after the first night because the bed was so uncomfortable and the noise of the air con was unbearable Noise from the street woke me up at 4 40am The en suite facilities were minute , The consideration from the staff
232707,Gainsborough Hotel, Very small room for the first night they were catering for a regular customer so the gave me very small room were the shower is bad never known when to get hot or cold water On the second night i was given a big esh room and the shower was ok 4star and no drinking water provided On the last night someone was smoking in his room and the staff couldn t find out who and could not stop it i had to put a towel under the door to stop the smell My wife has asthma and suffered from that I feel the hotel is good value for money I feel it is not up to 4 star, Friendly staff Wi Fi is Good
232708,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a disgrace Have never been anywhere as bad Breakfast a joke No bread left Staff clean the tables by whiping the crumbs on the chairs and floor No wonder they have mice The staff keep picking up the folk used to pick up chesse and ham and lay them down ON THE CHEESE AND HAM Everyones hands touch everyones ham and cheese Beyond stupid I am beyond words frankily, Location
232709,Gainsborough Hotel, Everything except location , The staff were not very welcoming The room was falling apart with an open gaping hole at the window The right bulb constantly wobbled Breakfast was 10 each on line but we were told we could only have continental which was 7 if we had ordered that morning Would not stay here again Old fashioned backward and staff disinterested Felt as if we were an annoyance 
232710,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is quaint but the rooms need an uplift , The location is excellent close to museums and parks to good restaurants and to the underground 
232711,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff not helpful Air conditioner did not work and had been replaced by a mobile one so noisy we turned it off Truely awful shower with no pressure and long overdue with the bath for complete refurbishment No drinking water sign in the bathroom what Bathroom bulbs broken with wire exposure and others that did not work Very small for 3 adults Dirty carpet Walls needed cleaning Minute lift for 4 people No interest in checkout at concerns about the room Will never go back to this place, Location to a degree but nothing else Worst hotel I can recall staying at in London
232712,Gainsborough Hotel, Welcome person weird Very long time to check in No invoices available Room very average especially the bathroom Not a good value for money, The location is great South Kensington and the room was quite But the rest 
232713,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was out dated chipped paint dirty stained carpet and tapestries and two very small uncomfortable beds We even booked a room to have one bed as we traveled as a couple and were given a tiny hole of a room It would be the equivalent of staying at a Motel 6 in America from the 1980s in the middle of all the museum zone of Washington DC Would not recommend as the price for two nights was close to 365 in US currency Spend the extra 200 or more and stay at one of the nicer hotels in the area , The location of the hotel was excellent you are near so many museums Hyde Park and Kensington Palace was just a short walk away 
232714,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel appears nice however the rooms are terrible Very small very old and tired The hands free shower could not reach the wall mount as the hose was too short so you had to hold the shower head with one hand The air conditioner did not work so the room was very hot and stuffy Breakfast usually ran out of food and the chairs were lower than the table because the cushions were flattened due to age and use , To be honest nothing Well perhaps the location Desk staff did try and help however They did not seem to be supported by management 
232715,Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms are shabby I was told the room we were given was one of the best Wifi non existent shabby furniture small double bed Bathroom was big enough but limescale all over taps chipped sink and bath Shower was the worst I ve experienced in 20 years visiting London No milk shower gel soap etc on 2nd day Water from shower was either scalding or freezing Other large cities manage a standard why not London On checkout no one asked how our stay was , Excellent location but the hotel is disappointing Beautiful buildings all around but inside needs a bit of the profits put into it 
232716,Gainsborough Hotel, My partner and I booked for a romantic eve on entering the room was made up and looked presentable When we unfolded the bed sheets we found dried blood on the sheets We were horrified a bed was made up with sheets like this The manager only offered 25 refund or a free breakfast for one Very poor experience ,No Positive
232717,Gainsborough Hotel, Twin room very small Only one power board with two outlets already used for TV and light so hassle for two people to charge everything Internet was slow and intermittent Hairdryer next to useless but they had a real one at front desk Poor communication between morning and evening staff meant things that were promised didn t happen , Good location near museums tube Staff were friendly and tried to be helpful Breakfast buffet offered range of choices Olde English decor
232718,Gainsborough Hotel, The first room had an incredibly noisy air conditioner unit with a large tube venting through a hole in the window Because of the tube the window couldn t be opened for fresh air Also the mattress felt like there were bars across it When I said that the room wasn t suitable I was told I couldn t move After some heated discussion with the person at the front desk whose English was not adequate I was moved into another room the second day While that room had a decent mattress and air conditioning and the window opened the sink in the bathroom had no water I reported the sink twice and was ignored I had to collect water from the shower in a plastic bottle to brush my teeth I was there on business if I d had time to research other options I would have changed hotels I won t stay there again ,No Positive
232719,Gainsborough Hotel, large portable and noisy air con unit in the room lift extremely small old and clunky, Staff were friendly and the location was good for our needs however although this was once a very nice hotel it is now getting a little tired
232720,Gainsborough Hotel, Cleanliness was poor bathroom floor was cracked old fashion air con vent in window and standing machine which took up a considerable amount of floor space Room images were generous and did not reflect the reality, Location and staff friendliness
232721,Gainsborough Hotel, In need of refurbishment inside room 302 shower water pressure is not good more electric sockets needed clean windows too change light bulbs for bright ones, Friendly lovely staff good location
232722,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were too under pressure to be helpful Breakfast very poor staff were carrying food from hotel across the street Basement room no windows opened Hairdryer not in sight of a mirror aircon dripped down the wallpaper, Nothing
232723,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were not the most accommodating I had one staff bang on my door literally two mins of a long a stressful journey over there looking for a pen that the receptionist of 2 days had missed laid , Own bathroom Door open late at night walk in and out freely
232724,Gainsborough Hotel, Tired decor Wallpaper missing toilet leaking tiny room large a c unit and a huge gap at the bottom of the room door all gave a poor impression I was expecting a 4 star hotel and a 4 poster bed in our deluxe double room instead we had 2 singlebeds pushed together which took up most of the room space The receptionstaff were good and very helpful The breakfast staff were indifferent bordering on rude Breakfast was OK but not the best All in all although it served its purpose the hotel was not what I was expecting and certainly does not deserve to call itself a 4 star hotel , Excellent location 
232725,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so tiny that you could not fully open your suitcase except for on the bed Getting in and out of the bathroom was a shuffle and dance and the sink so minuscule that you could hardly do anything with it The size of the room or rather lack thereof was only topped by the heat in there Despite a mere 23 C outside it was stuffy and hot all day and all night although I had opened the window as much as possible Horrible ,No Positive
232726,Gainsborough Hotel, Bed close to bathroom it is impossible to open door without scraping your feet Left bathroom door open all night as I need the loo often and didn t fancy wrestling the door every time I got up, I liked the room as a whole even though very small very comfortable bed
232727,Gainsborough Hotel, Could not drink the tap water The shower was extremely small The mattress was lumpy , The location was great easy to get to museums and the underground The staff were friendly and helpful The room was clean and efficient We really appreciated the AC 
232728,Gainsborough Hotel, Dated uncomfortable bed no hair dryer check in chaotic bar restaurant across the road at sister hotel Understaffed at breakfast for others wanting cooked you d waitress clearly needed support , Clean good location limited but fresh continental breakfast
232729,Gainsborough Hotel, The lift was tiny and it took several trips to take our luggage to our room However the person at the desk cheerfully did this for us, Lift and a c were helpful as were the personnel
232730,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very hot and we couldn t open the window , The breakfast room is nicely furnished and decorated and pleasant to eat in The bedroom was very quiet lovely for central London 
232731,Gainsborough Hotel, Although this is advertised as a 4 star hotel we had a 2 star level room at best Rug and walls were filthy Bed terribly uncomfortable old and unfortunately saw how stained mattress cover was Noisy doors slamming heard throughout night Thank goodness we were only here one night would not have been able to stay another night Water in bathroom states it is not for drinking but that s what they expect you to make your coffee with in the morning , The location is good very close to South Kensignton tube station lots of great cafes in area groom shopping Museum of Natural History and Victoria Albert Museum are right around the corner This is a great location but I d stay somewhere else in neighborhood if I returned to London 
232732,Gainsborough Hotel, N A, Very convenient to the Royal Albert Hall for concerts and Cafe culture just around the corner Also underground station only 2 minutes from the hotel 
232733,Gainsborough Hotel, Single room is very cramped with a noisy air con unit The extractor fan in the shower room didn t appear to be working and it smelt a bit damp , Reception area is very impressive and staffed round the clock Good quality soaps and gels in the room Natural History and V A just round the corner and a short stroll to Harrods and Hyde Park 
232734,Gainsborough Hotel, I had asked for a room with a shower with a hose The first room they showed me did not have this facility and the room was very narrow and faced on to the main road with passing traffic noise It could have done with a lot of changes When I complained they put in me a basement room with a double bed suitable wardrobe and other facilities The shower over the bath was on a hose but the basin plug was non existent They tried to make a replacement but that did not work The bathroom could have done with being refurbished There was no traffic noise as the small window faced the back of the Lycee Francais which was behind the hotel and all one heard was when the pupils were playing football before and after school The lady at reception said as I was in a double room I would have to pay extra I refused The only extra I paid was for Continental and 1 Full English breakfasts which I had had and were excellent with very helpful staff , The Continental or Full English Breakfasts were excellent The staff were v g and helpful 
232735,Gainsborough Hotel, There was nothing I particularly didn t like If i were to be really really picky the room might have been a bit small if I was travelling with my partner but then I am a larger lady so it might not bother others Other than that although the room had two hairdryers I was glad I had brought my own as they weren t really suitable for drying long hair Again not a problem for the majority of the population and not unusual in hotels , The welcome was incredibly friendly The reception staff truly are superb My room was perfect for one person travelling on their own clean and very close to the Natural History Museum and the tube The room had all the necessary facilities including a safe that held a small laptop Highly recommend 
232736,Gainsborough Hotel, My single room was very small but adequate for a one night stay at least it had a good en suite Floor standing air conditioning unit was VERY noisy and could not open window as tube from unit went out through window so window was fixed shut However it was very effective in cooling the room quickly on a very hot London day but you would not want it on all night Did not sleep very well due to poor quality of pillows One was thin and hard the other very lumpy I did bring this to the attention of the receptionist when I checked out and she said she would change the lumpy one Very unusual to see a sign in bathroom saying not to drink tap water and had to pay 2 for a bottle of water If tap water not drinkable I think hotel should provide a bottle of water in room Wallpaper rather faded and could do with updating , Very near South Kensington Tube and hotel just round the corner from Natural History Museum Pleasant reception staff and porter In spite of my niggles it suited me for a one night stay but 109 a bit steep however it is central London and a lot cheaper than places like Travelodge and Premier inns I would think the double rooms would be good A nice feel about the hotel 
232737,Gainsborough Hotel, We were shown 4 rooms They were all tired and shabby and well overpriced The bed was uncomfortable The tiles in the shower were cracked The handle had fallen off the draw and the shower almost scalded us each time we used it The room was not comfortable This was fefinstely not 4 star The bar didn t even have any wine when we wanted a drink in the evening , The lobby was nicely decorated
232738,Gainsborough Hotel, Our room certainly did not resemble any of the ones pictured It was dark gloomy and was at basement level I booked a family room for myself husband and daughter based upon the photographs on the website I would not choose a dark windowless room for my daughter to sleep in and was relieved we were in and out of there prior to the warmer days as I believe it would have been very unpleasant in the airless rooms The shower nozzle was constantly falling off and hitting us on the head The water temperature constantly changed from hot to cold , The hotel was convenient for our stay in London It was easy to find 
232739,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly reception Gave me iced tea Lovely foyer Comfortable room with teaetc and good shower Didn t have time to try the food though
232740,Gainsborough Hotel, The smart elegant feel of the hotel and warm welcome was let down by the deluxe single room with en suite facilities that I was given It was smaller than expected and rather cramped not ideal for a 3 night stay The decor needed an upgrade and the mattress replacing Unfortunately it was not the 4 star experience I was expecting for my excitedly awaited London break , A lovely traditional hotel with loads of character in a prime city location An elegant entrance and friendly welcoming staff During a heatwave I was glad of the air conditioning system in the room Fine for a short city break and close to public transport Liked that the price included a continental breakfast 
232741,Gainsborough Hotel, Dark room Dark curtains even the lamps were not spreading much light The showers watersupply seemed as old as the hotel No drinking water for the room , Exellent breakfast
232742,Gainsborough Hotel, although continental breakfast was included in price 5 extra per person was required for a cooked breakfast , convenient for the museums science natural history and Vic and Al museum the Royal Albert hall is also a short walk away as is Hyde park 
232743,Gainsborough Hotel, The room we were allocated was in the basement and definitely not the room in the picture when we booked It had only one window which was up fairly high and the school behind played football every night until about 7 30 pm and quite often the ball would hit the window At the very least there should be a security grill or something over the window so that the balls from the school do not hit the window The bathroom left more than a little to be desired as the water from the shower would leak through the gap in the glass partition and end up on the floor where we had to use hand towels to mop it up Also the T V reception was quite poor and we only could get a couple of channels We also asked for room service one night and were told that we would have to go across the road to your sister hotel and get our own room service If we had realized we were going to be in a 2 star accommodation hotel we would have booked elsewhere , The only good things about our stay was the Continental breakfast each morning was really good with a nice variety of cereals and fruit and the flaky croissants were just beautiful The proximity to the restaurants coffee shops and entertainment was the best and was the saving grace of our stay Lara on reception was a god send and helped us every day and Elena the waitress at breakfast was also most helpful and always had a smile on her face 
232744,Gainsborough Hotel, The air con struggled, Location location location A relaxing environment with beautifully appointed furniture and furnishings The breakfast room was excellent with attentive staff 
232745,Gainsborough Hotel, I reported there were ants in our bed when we woke up in the morning there was also mold between the tiles in the bathroom and the toilet roll holder was not the correct insert for the unit on the wall so as soon as you touch the toilet roll it pings off I was also disappointed that we had to pay an additional 5 for an English breakfast and they went to a property across the road for it Not at all professional I feel that we should have some kind of refund to be honest , The staff were friendly
232746,Gainsborough Hotel, Sorry question mixed up loved the location room excellent except needed a rail on the wall down steps to bathroom as disabled Otherwise everything except breakfast spot on, Didnt think cooked breakast was worth the money the bacon was the cheapest cut streaky and potatoe cake yucky saus was good taste when you got through the skin no fresh fruit all tinned pears peaches pineapple some days no cakes rolls or quasionts staff very good 
232747,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom wasn t up to standard Flaking paint on the ceiling dirty marks on the shower screen loose threads on the countertop The door into our room would not shut properly you had to give it a good few strong pulls to get it to lock otherwise anyone could just walk in No drinkable tap water in the room had to pay for water No full English included in the price of hotel which was a shame for the amount we paid , The location was great good sized bed that was very comfortable 
232748,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel room was very small and dingy The bathroom was old the shower barely worked as the water pressure was so bad The bed was old and very uncomfortable It was over priced for what you got The website is misleading in that is says they have a restaurant whereas they really just send you across the road to another hotel , It is in a convenient location to South Kensington tube station however that is the only positive comment I can make 
232749,Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were tired and dated Very dark decor tea coffee facilities We re poor Bathrooms needed rupdating lnot sparkling clean Shower doors not secure Beds uncomfortable needed duvets and feather pillows Toiletries nice Wallpaper coming off walls, The location was very good Staff helpful Offered compllimentary soft drink
232750,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel was a little tired and in need of bringing up to date however I suspect the price would be higher if that had happened There were very few plugs available in the room for charging but an extension was available for the kettle and so we used that which made us move the phones away from our bed not such a bad idea , A good English breakfast Staff friendly and helpful The location was perfect for the main museums and 10 minutes walk away from the underground 
232751,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel and the room were not worth the money paid Room small decoration very bad Lining on curtains totally rotted and shredded Hotel generally in poor decoration and not clean No bar or facilities as advertised No free WiFi Definitely not 4 star as advertised I would like to claim money back How can this be achieved , The bed was fairly comfortable Continental breakfast OK
232752,Gainsborough Hotel, No bar fridge or no way to keep milk cold for my two daughters it appeared that the room had had a space for mini bar fridge but nothing , Style location staff security
232753,Gainsborough Hotel, We stopped at this hotel for just one night thankfully When we wanted to give feedback about our experience the available representative was Lara We started discussing the following points with Lara and she fully agreed with us stating I know but I have to work here When we were asked to settle the bill and complain afterwards I declined and wanted to discuss the issues now Well Lara s attitude really turned aggressive rolling eyes and all her conversation was now conducted through shouting When we asked to see the manager Lena we were told she was unavailable as on holiday Lara was able to converse with her during the time we provided the feedback but we were not allowed to talk to her Discussion points in brief The hotel was a 4 star hotel But obviously needs money and a lot of work doing to bring it to even a reasonable level certainly to our room When we checked in we were left waiting whilst Lara talked to people that arrived after us When we were trying to complain about the accommodation we were left 40 minutes whilst the maintenance man verified the state of the room and appliances that did not work The room was grubby bits broken walls and furniture had chunks out of it discoloured and in the bathroom mould due to water damage tv didn t work the kettle worked intermittently shower head didn t fix to bracket so you had to hold whilst showering freezing cold water for the sink During breakfast I asked for tomato ketchup there was none When my wife asked for semi skimmed milk for her cornflakes she was brought hot milk when asked for more cold milk for her cornflakes she was informed there was none left Hearing this Lara brought the waitress out to confirm the story she told the waitress there was milk wasn t there she was twice told they had run out before she ordered her go , The location
232754,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom needs to be bigger with countet space and faucets that work better larger shower Also air conditioning would have been good Floors were awfully squeaky Elevator really small Good thing we were not heavy people , Great breakfast staff were attentive and personable We liked the outside lobby and eating area 
232755,Gainsborough Hotel, The room didn t really have accessible wall sockets to plug in things There was an extension lead on the floor which we had to use We had to boil the kettle on the floor due to this Noisy fan in bathroom room 111 Note It isn t the hotel s fault but the taxi company they booked was expensive 12 for less than a 3 min drive Apparently that is London , Good location for The Royal Albert Hall South Kensington Tube station a very short walk Reception of Hotel to Paddington just 25 mins The staff were polite helpful Clean
232756,Gainsborough Hotel, We had to wait well over an hour for our request for a twin room and I d just finished a gruelling day of chemo We were given a free breakfast as a good will gesture The duty manager on the following day could not understand why we weren t given the twin room straightaway as there were a few available The head manager did not reply to any emails regarding this very unfortunate situation ,No Positive
232757,Gainsborough Hotel, n a, Breakfast was good room is tidy but needs a refresh to decor room was hot but they left a cooler which worked very good great place to stay if you are going to go to Royal Albert Hall for an event which we did as its a 10 minute stroll 
232758,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was in basement no view or daylight the bathroom was small tiny corner sink which you could not stand in front of room was data and also a tie wrap on the towel rail Additional charge for English breakfast which cost total of 12 each and was not worth it as the bacon was under cooked should have come with toast however having asked for it she waitress failed to bring it also at to ask twice for tea oh yes no tomato or brown , Location
232759,Gainsborough Hotel, Unfortunately the room was very dated and small Single delux and nothing in the room constituted anything delux Wifi signal was terrible and shower was as powerful as a small tap , Convenient location near tube and shops
232760,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was too small The beds were very uncomfortable The electrical sockets were not easily accessible ie behind the beds under the dressing table , The staff were pleasant and courteous The accommodation was very clean 
232761,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in serious need of a makeover Our first impression was of a cold dull and dreary room there wasn t even a duvet on the bed just old blankets and a cover The bathroom was small and smelt mouldy and the shower was inadequate , The breakfast room had lovely white cloths and was well run with a perfectly acceptable breakfast 
232762,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel failed to enter Booking com s reservation into the system As a result they double booked on us and we were unable to stay in the hotel for the first of the two nights we had booked Worse still we had arrived at the hotel at 9 30 in the morning on the day of our arrival expecting to be able to leave our bags and spend the rest of the day sight seeing Instead we had to spend the whole morning waiting to know whether the hotel would honour the booking or simply leave me and my family on the street Eventually after several hours fobbing us off with excuse after excuse the hotel transferred us to another hotel across the street but only after a very stressful experience We were not alone the hotel had also double booked on a party of six elderly American tourists who were also forced to wait several hours to see if they would have a room for the night The one bright spot was Booking com who really stood by us when we telephoned to tell them what was going on Without Booking com s intervention and strong support for us I really don t know whether the hotel would have found another room for us ,No Positive
232763,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very tired I could not get in the room to start with as the lock did not work The shower is very poor with little pressure and the shower door was falling off ,No Positive
232764,Gainsborough Hotel, The bedroom was very dark and tied but adequate and clean , The Staff were excellent We had brilliant service especially the receptionist Tara she was very helpful The English breakfast which cost 12 each was one of the best I have had and I Stayed at the Grand last year in Brighton The Lounge and Dining room were very cosy the bedroom was a little tied but very clean An excellent position for the Albert Hall museums and the South Kensington Tube 
232765,Gainsborough Hotel, Not really a 4 star hotel starting to show its age A little expensive for what you get Walls are very thin so sound travels between rooms Breakfast bacon was burnt to the point of being inedible cold toast served before the Bacon and Eggs with no butter Single sausage in a 12 breakfast is a little rich There are far better options for food a short walk away , Hotel is close to South Kensington tube and other public transport 
232766,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was rather hot for our personal comfort but able to open windows Other tables offered toast for two mornings we weren t not really a problem as got some when we asked but wondered what it was about us that it wasn t offered , Very friendly and efficient welcome Lara was the only receptionist we dealt with and she is lovely Good value for the price in London Purpose of visit was The Albert Hall so location was good
232767,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff at breakfast could have replenished the buffet a little faster Low fat yoghurt and fresh fruit would improve the breakfast, Great location as we were singing in the Royal Albert Hall Plenty of restaurants near by Staff very friendly and helpful 
232768,Gainsborough Hotel, the elevator was very small, Staff very friendly especially the front desk atendente Laisa she was always ready to help The location is great e very good breakfast 
232769,Gainsborough Hotel, Breakfast was very poor everywhere was dirty and everywhere smells bad At 3 o clock we woke up mouse Wi fi once is good once does not exist, Staff nice 
232770,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in the basement No veiw It all looked clean and nice but it was beginning to look at worn out when you have a close look We had troble sleeping with blanket and sheeds as we are not used to that And it was also small , The Hotel was close to Underground and Bus Quiet area Classic english furniture stile The madras was ok Not hard not soft 
232771,Gainsborough Hotel, the bed was really old and noisy so couldn t sleep even i was so tired and the shower was disaster and water had no pressure at all, Friendly staff and would say clean for the old building
232772,Gainsborough Hotel, The desk was a bit cramped making work in the evening difficult I know they re called laptops but I prefer to use mine on a hard surface with a bit of space for paperwork around , A rare oasis of quiet in central London It s not often that you can sleep right through without the intrusion of traffic noise and sirens in this part of the world 
232773,Gainsborough Hotel, Breakfast was included but only continental it means cold meal To get full breakfast hot meal e g ham and eggs baked beans should be paid extra 5 pounds per person day The bed was too small for two persons although we are not too tall Next time would be better option two separate beds , Location of the hotel is very good between two underground stations with direct access to three lines very good and quick availability of many tourist attractions of London Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful 
232774,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Staff were lovely and really welcoming Shower was excellent with plenty of toiletries available Location was perfect for our visit to the Royal Albert Hall Continental breakfast was ample

232826,Gainsborough Hotel, The bed in my room was old and uncomfortable and the d cor very tired with torn net curtains I had an uncomfortably warm room with no means to alter the temperature The restaurant for evening dining was across the road and the menu on display uninspiring so I ate elsewhere Small things I know but it made an impact on my stay , The staff were professional and helpful and I chose it for the close proximity to the V A The small dining area for breakfast was pretty and welcoming 
232827,Gainsborough Hotel, First room was cold The windows were old style but also actually old so some cold breeze was coming through So we had our room changed It wasn t cold anymore but the shower and the sink were terrible Shower head was pretty much broken and it was difficult to have a proper shower very very weak water flow And the faucet of the sink was too short to even use it properly When washing my face I had to get some water in the sink and then wash instead of using water directly from the faucet Other amenities were good enough though , Location was great train station is very close to the hotel and there are some restaurants and kiosks nearby Good service We wanted our room changed and we got a new room the next day

232841,Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms and the hotel are very old and in need in renovations You could hear everything that happened upstairs every step is audible and outside which was not great at night TV was great and big but it covered more than a half of the mirror the room is just too small for such TV so the only usable mirror was in the bathroom but as with most bathroom mirrors it was small There is no space around the sink so all your toiletries are on the other side of the bathroom The ventilation in the bathroom didn t work so it got pretty hot inside and there wasn t enough air Hairdryer also didn t work There are not enough plugs even to charge two phones you have to unplug something from the wall or use USB from the TV which doesn t work if it is off 2 out of 4 lamps didn t work one in the bathroom and one bedside lamp We ve mentioned it to the receptionist right as we ve first got into the room but even on the 5th day of our stay it wasn t fixed so hope next visitors could enjoy more light because the room is quite dark , You can t beat the location if you get the room on sale value for money is very good You can walk to many of the museums and it is 5 minute walk to the underground station with couple of lines There is a big TV in the room Staff was always very friendly Breakfast was ok As we have different plugs it was nice that staff was ready and had couple of adapters on hand Despite it being cold outside the room was heated very well

232845,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was very small and it was impossible to read as the light was so poor It needed a wall light above the bed En suite proportionally small The basin would not hold water as plug probably needed adjustment Travelling solo I was saddened but not overly surprised at the room size, Breakfast was very good and I was able to have a light meal in the room the evening before Staff were very helpful and pleasant The room was quiet and comfortable if rather small and the hotels proximity to The Natural History museum and the underground was ideal for my visit 
232846,Gainsborough Hotel, Breakfast was very hit miss the dining room staff were very disorganised and didn t seem to know what they were doing we were ther for 4 breakfasts and on each there was a problem mostly with running out of items and the clearing of tables the Hotel was fairly busy The swing door to the kitchen was always open with diners viewing cleaning equipment etc I m glad I didn t order a cooked breakfast as this is ferried from the sister Hotel across the road not good On at least 2 occasions we had to wait for breakfast rolls and told they would be at least 10 mins these also came from the sister Hotel It s a shame as this dept lets the Hotel down and needs to be looked at for improvement , Definetly the location and good value for money Room was OK although a little small The provision of electric plugs was a little suspect with an array of wires under the desk via an extension lead Front of house and domestic staff very good Hotel somewhat dated but clean and tidy

232892,Gainsborough Hotel, Emne Hotel Rating Good morning I visited London for a few days partly private and partly business stay We ended up booking one night through Booking com after looking for 4 stars hotel in the South Kensington area This hotel was the Gainsborough Hotel 7 11 Queensberry Place a hotel rated as a 4 stars hotel by AA I am travelling a lot sometimes over 150 traveling days per year I have never I staying in a 4 star rated hotel with such old and low standard The staff was welcoming and helpful in every way but the standard of the hotel was definitely NOT anything near what one should expect when booking a 4 stars hotel the standard of this hotel is what one could expect if booking a 2 stars hotel The hotel was old and everything had a low and very worn out standard not even a 220v European type socket for shaving machine in the newest and recently renovated bath room No heating air condition except for a small electric oven placed in a corner of the room one could switch on off manually oneself No heating in bathroom too cold to wanting to take a shower The guest areas of the hotel in general were as said old fashioned and very worn out from furniture toilets wallpaper etc etc to standard of dining room kitchen etc We were told we got a renovated room which was correct but the room standard was still extremely low If I was given an older room with an even older and worn out standard would I have not have been stayng there We fail to understand how AA as late as this year could rate this and similar type and standard hotel to more than 2 stars To give this hotel a 4 star rating is the same as misleading guests would almost say cheating guests who believe they have booked a 4 stars almost top class hotel When hotels like Hilton get 5 stars is this hotel no more than a 2 star hotel not even close to 3 stars , Beliggenheten og vennlig ansatte Det er alt positivt som kan sies 
232893,Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were very small in one of the rooms there was mildew on the shower ceiling the window pane was cracked and the wood around the windows was mouldy Also there was nowhere to plug in the kettle other than on the floor by the bed In the other room the radiator did not work and the room felt damp , Location

232900,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff was uncooperative and inexperienced Their knowledge about London was poor I also ask on reception for adapter however receptionist said that I can leave self phone to her for charging Next day I found out that they didn t charge it but they broke it In their opinion it wasn t their fault so they never payed repair but more importantly they never said sorry Next four days I tried to speak with manager but she never showed up I even try to make appointment in couple of occasions It was broken because someone from staff tried to plug the phone too violently My phone was standard android phone and I gave them my own android charger Probably they mixed up some of other incompatible charger with mine ,No Positive

232971,Gainsborough Hotel, The bedroom was a twin rather than a double which I had requested and was very small although a big bathroom The headboard was broken and as a result the mattress didn t sit correctly on the base The lighting was poor barely enough to read by Disappointing breakfast with rather stale rolls and little choice , The location was very good for our plans Staff were pleasant and helpful The hotel was clean and tidy 
232972,Gainsborough Hotel, Room decor very dated Room on the small side in the basement Fixtures fittings in serious need of refurbishment , Great location for Royal Albert Hall museums Harrods Nice staff Good continental breakfast 
232973,Gainsborough Hotel, The double bed was small and my pillow not comfortable, It was nice and quiet I asked for a room not on the main road and I got one to the back perfect
232974,Gainsborough Hotel, The one room we had was right off the elevator so there was noise from that Not really loud but if you were awake you could hear it , The hotel is in a great location and the staff is very helpful and kind It is well run and there is always someone available at the front desk
232975,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Quiet location but close to Kensington tube station All the staff were very friendly and helpful The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was good Would certainly stay again 
232976,Gainsborough Hotel, When we went upstairs there was an indefinable smell Our room was shabby and many things didn t work The water in the bathroom was a slow trickle We tried to open the blinds once up they would not come back down the cord was hung up on the top The lights in the bathroom didn t work and in the room itself they were little more than a feint glow The bed itself was very worn in and oddly comfortable which was the one plus The air conditioning was attached to the window in a strange tube structure that I ve never seen before and it fell out in the middle of the night , The lobby was cute and the staff was friendly 
232977,Gainsborough Hotel, I didn t like that booking in had to be later than expected I didn t like not having a bedside table and the plug sockets were a bit difficult to sort out and one broken or blocked I think , The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have had Comfortable mattress and I loved the blankets and sheets rather than a duvet You can modify with the temperature etc Enjoyed the breakfast very much I liked it very much that the window opened 
232978,Gainsborough Hotel, Our room was tiny and very hot with poor a c which had a dreadful smell We opened the window instead but still stuffy and hot Bathroom tiny and dilapidated the hotel badly needs redecorating Staff and location mean we would stay again , Staff were charming and extremely polite 
232979,Gainsborough Hotel, Bed linen was filthy Room was small like a broom cupboard Shower cubicle was tight and blocked and gung coming up from it , Down at reception was very comfortable
232980,Gainsborough Hotel, Portable air con unit in the room that made a loud noise terrible shower that was freezing or red hot I walked out of the breakfast , Location was good That s about it
232981,Gainsborough Hotel, The d cor was very tired Bathroom far too small and particularly neglected Bulbs did not work in bedside lamp or lamp above bathroom mirror , The location is good Very handy for Central London
232982,Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were somewhat disappointing in comparison to the facilities mentioned above In the double singles the mattresses were very uncomfortable Larger and more pillows are needed With two people in the room there should be a second towel in the bathroom Lastly instead of using a rigged very noisy air conditioning machine a standing quiet fan would do a better job to cool the room Not being able to draw the drapes allowed too much light in to sleep , The decor of the lobby and breakfast room The continental breakfast was very nice Fresh fruit would have been lovely The staff was friendly and very helpful The location was perfect and a lovely area to walk around with a tube stop nearby and nice restaurants and marvelous museums 
232983,Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was a little bit uncomfortable but its tolerable , The location was great very close to metro and restaurants very convenient Great area to stay in Wifi was really good and the staff were amazingly helpful Thank you 
232984,Gainsborough Hotel, On arrival staff were un cooperative Room in basement We asked re window and were told a large window it was actually small and looked onto steps from street Luggage left near hotel doorway and not secured ,No Positive
232985,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was old fashioned with a huge Ac unit stuck in the window My room was through a fire door and on its own at the top of some stairs which made me feel unsafe We asked if they could order a taxi for us as there was a storm we were told we should go out and find a taxi I also object to paying 20 extra in case I use something in the hotel and then have to wait up to 2 weeks to get it back , The hotel was near to all amenities such as the tube station The bed was quite comfortable Staff were friendly
232986,Gainsborough Hotel, the bathroom can do with an update but overall the single room was quite spacious a fire alarm went off by mistake in the really early morning so after that sleeping was difficult , location close to south kensington tube museums friendly staff
232987,Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms and I was shown a few are tired Could be a great Boutique Hotel but would need a lot of money spending on it , Great location very Friendly staff Given the location very good value for money 
232988,Gainsborough Hotel, Room too hot Fire alarm woke us up at 4 30am Apparently faulty alarm that was yet to be fixed Staff did not know enough about London to be able to help us with directions , Location to train station was great
232989,Gainsborough Hotel, One of the worst hotels I have ever been to The hotel is rated as 4 stars hotel but everything from the main entrance to the room is 2 stars From the begining the hotel wellcomes you with very dirty and very worn out carpet In the room the furniture is very old and worn the walls are cracked and peeled The bathroom is very small I almost did not fit inside the shower tube and the water was almost impossible to adjust The washbasin was cracked The lights in the bathroom half were not working and the other half were blinking Over the night we felt like we are in the army We had 4 fire alarms false alarms every one two hours We could not sleep at all At 4 30 after the last alarm when I decided is useless to try to sleep again I went out to smoke One of the hotels employee saw me at the reception and asked me What is wrong you can t sleep When finally the breakfast time came we were again disappointed Another reason to be angry It was a maximum 2 strars breakfast Literally at a so called 4 stars hotel breakfast we had bread one type of cheese one type of tiny croissants jam and filter coffe Even 3 stars hotels offers you eggs pastrami sausages a few types of croissants espresso coffe This is a 2 stars hotel Is your decision if you ever book this hotel but if you do it now you know what to expect from a so called 4 stars hotel ,No Positive
232990,Gainsborough Hotel, 3am fire alarms EVERY NIGHT If you like a good nights sleep do not stay here The staff were rude when I complained No discount for broken sleep not even after 2 nights of fire alarms going off twice a night Not a good place ,No Positive
232991,Gainsborough Hotel, Really small room Curtains wired to rail and would not shut Safe battery dead No bedside lamp only overhead Room so small I could not open door fully b c of floor fan Low water pressure b c of fourth floor location , Location Staff were friendly Lobby and breakfast room were nice Good wifi and flatscreen tv 
232992,Gainsborough Hotel, Small single room Limited tea coffee facilities in room Very warm room despite fan being available Room was clean but pokey for the price , Location was perfect for purpose of visit i e Museums Staff were friendly and welcoming Smellies for shower were nice
232993,Gainsborough Hotel, I did not like the basement which is where they put us not impressed very little natural light and very dismal Booked way in advance and no where near full so extremely disappointed , The location of this hotel was perfect for our planned weekend Royal Albert Hall and Museums on your door step
232994,Gainsborough Hotel, No hooks in the bathroom Only one chair in the bedroom Room was cold when we arrived and only one small blanket on the bed , Staff were very friendly and welcoming Staff arranged an extra blanket and a heater on the second night 
232995,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, The staff working in this hotel is wonderful They listen they are eager to help they are polite and genuinely friendly I want to commend especially Otilia Ivan Lorena Also appreciated the space The rooms are big with high ceilings beautiful 
232996,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was damp with peeling wallpaper The net curtains were dirty and the shower room was poor loose wires and a giant step into and out of the shower and ordinary light switch in the bathroom to operate the extractor fan and sink lights The kettle had to be on the floor plugged into an extension lead The bedside lamps didn t work The double bed was two singles made up as two singles and pushed together , Location and staff 
232997,Gainsborough Hotel, We arrived at 14 00 as we had a lunch in Chelsea booked at 15 00 but the room wasn t ready They did however get a room prepared relatively quickly , Location is great Close to tube museums and Hyde Park 
232998,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was very poor I was trapped in the shower when I closed the shower door as it had no release handle on the inside If my friend had not been in the bedroom I would have been there until the cleaners arrived Very scary the door could not have been checked properly when the room was prepared prior to occupation The matter was dealt with , The staff were outstanding friendly and very helpful The breakfast was good and dining room very pleasant 
232999,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in a terrible condition Dirty carpets and shabby walls The room was around 5 feet wide so completely unsuitable for a small family and not fit for purpose More importantly there was an electric socket in the bathroom which not permitted for health and safety reasons, The location was great Just as expected
233000,Gainsborough Hotel, Tiniest room I have ever seen in my life Had to climb over the bed to get from one side to the other Couldn t close the bathroom door whilst on the toilet because it was too close to the wall and there was no room Could step out of bed and reach the toilet in 1 step really pleasant for a romantic break Not big enough for a broom cupboard let alone humans , Staff were friendly
233001,Gainsborough Hotel, The room resembled a cell Tea Coffee provision were really limited Lighting was poor Bed and pillows had seeno better days , Staff and location are top quality
233002,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel was located well hotel entrance really nice but room was very shabby and dated Marks on carpet bathroom tiles cracked and shower cubicle was just awful Would not stay again ,No Positive
233003,Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing, I booked this after a cancellation with another hotel The staff were so accommodating after I told them that I had been let down they let me check in early brought an iron and ironing board and two buckets of ice Nothing was too much trouble the reception was an absolute sweetheart Stay at this hotel you will not be disappointed it was home from home Central and easy access to tube and shops well done the staff at the Gainsborough
233004,Gainsborough Hotel, The room we were put in was off to the side and as it was looked as if it was a broom cupboard turned into a room it was over looking good the air conditioning unit and the bathroom was in a poor state We also booked a room with a double bed and we had 2 singles put together The wallpaper was coming off the walls and the headboard looked dirty The room was totally dated and just was very dim Wooden toilet seat which I find to be totally unhygienic They asked us upon check in for a 20 deposit on top of our tarriff on the room Just in case we had a drink at the bar or ordered food We explained that we wouldn t as we were there for one night and would be out We were told that there is a block on the money and of we don t use it the money would then be returned to our card in 3 to 5 business days Not acceptable one bit If I didn t use the money then I should be reimbursed immediately I was not happy about this Why should they keep my unspent money at all We went and got the cash , Only the location was good about this hotel
233005,Gainsborough Hotel, Room very small couldn t open the window or blinds They air con didnt work but a fan was provided felt a bit claustrophobic Dont take a ground floor room , Friendly staff Breakfast simple but nice Would have appreciated fresh fruit 
233006,Gainsborough Hotel, Very poor room cracked sink stained carpet rattling old window hotel fully aware of this but still happy to place customers in this quality of room ,No Positive
233007,Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms are little tired but were comfortable and suitable, Really friendly staff Excellent location for Hyde park and the royal Albert hall Great value for money
233008,Gainsborough Hotel, Limited facilities No catering and bar so when we arrived at lunchtime we had to go out to find a sandwich Breakfast could have been more inspiring even though we were aware it was only going to be a continental breakfast Very little atmosphere in hotel , Beds very comfortable
233009,Gainsborough Hotel, Crack in bathroom basin Wallpapering not finished in bedroom and what was wasn t very good Old and shabby decor throughout , All we needed was there
233010,Gainsborough Hotel, As above breakfast too expensive this was continental , Bed was comphy room nice and clean Did not have breakfast as too dere for continental one Great location by metro 
233011,Gainsborough Hotel, The shower in the first room we stayed in had no water pressure and you couldn t set it to a proper temperature In this way you could only choose to shower ice cold or boiling hot After telling the receptionist we were told that maintenance will take care of it while we were out sightseeing After returning the shower problem still hadn t been fixed and we were moved to another room which had a new shower but was located next to the noisy elevator Oh well if it wasn t for the price we payed for this hotel definitely too much for what you get I would say it was all acceptable , Location very close to bus and underground station South Kensington which had the Piccadilly Circle and District Line Also lots of good restaurants pubs and cafes in this area as well as the Natural History Museum Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum in short walking distance Hotel had a rather old English charm but it was adequate and not frumpy 
233012,Gainsborough Hotel, Shower pressure very low The room rate should have included breakfast not charged as an extra No bar or amenities which is disappointing , Very comfortable room 
233013,Gainsborough Hotel, Room slightly small but good enough for me Bathroom sink did not have a plug But a very minor point, The location was the most important factor as I was attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall All staff members were very polite and helpful overall making my two day stay enjoyable 
233014,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in the basement so rather dark and looking up at the street where everyone walked past The cost on Booking com for two nights was 214 pounds without breakfast or 234 pounds with breakfast I opted for the latter i e 20 pounds for two breakfasts but they told me this only entitled me to the continental breakfast which cost only 7 pounds I would thus have been better off only booking the room through Booking com and paying for breakfast on arrival I pointed this out and they replied that i was getting a very reasonable room rate so should not complain , The room was quite large and the toiletries and towels plentiful 
233015,Gainsborough Hotel, Could have had a better shower but it is only a minor complaint, The staff were so helpful Even though we were staying only one night we were allowed leave our baggage at the hotel for two days which was important with the heatwave in London Room was fine clean and comfortable 
233016,Gainsborough Hotel, 1 the room had a flimsy perspex panel in the window instead of glass this allowed a lot of noise in from the street noise only really noticeable in the evening 2 the toilet shower room was quiet narrow meaning it wasn t the easiest place to dry yourself down in , The welcome and service from staff was quick and friendly The room was clean and tidy with ideal facilities for a brief stay it had free wifi It was also the perfect location with sites to look at locally or using the South Kensington Tube station 2 streets away 
233017,Gainsborough Hotel, Bed Comfort not good no duvet two sheets only Bathroom Fittings Low quality Located on ground floor view from window of boiler size of room was small and unimpressive small size breakfast items bread crissiants etc owner looking to save money , Location near tube stations
233018,Gainsborough Hotel, not that i didnt like it it was fantastic value for money but it was shabby and old fashioned shower didnt work properly so had to have a bath which didnt bother me but if i was there on business would have found the extra time it took annoying , location friendly and helpful staff family room was well laid out 
233019,Gainsborough Hotel, The room looked nothing like those I saw when I booked on line I thought I had paid for a decent double room not two single beds pushed together and small space to get into hanging space for clothes The room had some kind of matching that was not fixed properly to the window and took up space,No Positive
233020,Gainsborough Hotel, Very disappointed that we paid for room including breakfast but was only continental It does not say that on booking com You would expect a full English for the price we paid Also the shower was very poor , Beds room comfortable
233021,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a little bit small for a couple but was sufficient for purpose , The price was reasonable The location was very close to national history museum where wanted to go Breakfast was really nice 
233022,Gainsborough Hotel, Dirty poorly maintained poor standard of workmanship lift rarely working we were on the fourth floor and staff downright rude when I reported the lift not working also made to wait when checking out because the receptionist was trying to overcharge another guest Never again ,No Positive
233023,Gainsborough Hotel, Room needed paint , Lovely historic building in excellent location block from museums 4 5 minutes walking to South Kensington Metro Tube close to many restaurants Spacious reception areas Welcoming staff 
233024,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was small with a very large TV which was situated in an awkward position There were electric points but they were difficult to access especially to use the kettle, The bath room was warm clean lovely shower and great fluffy white towels 
233025,Gainsborough Hotel, the continental breakfast at 12 00 per person was excessive A better value breakfast was available at Carluccios near south Kensington station for 9 95,No Positive
233026,Gainsborough Hotel, It would have been good to have a bedside table for both guests One or two areas were still dusty , The hotel was very convenient for our visit and a quiet location off busy roads in the area The continental breakfast was very good with plenty of choice 
233027,Gainsborough Hotel, Room could have done with redecorating all felt very tired Floor tiles in bathroom were cracked and bath had been re painted didn t encourage one to useit , Very convenient for the Albert Hall Room clean and quiet Good breakfast freshly cooked 
233028,Gainsborough Hotel, Booked a triple room for us and our 8year old granddaughter only to find on arrival that all triple rooms were windowless I think that this should be stipulated on booking On checking with reception we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back of the biulding and were without windows We were offered a family room with a supplement of 30 or a superior double room with childs camp bed we chose the latter not wanting to incur more cost we considereded 145 we had already paid for a triple room to be enough We were particularly annoyed that our daughter was staying in a superior double room for 115 so ineffect we paid 30 fo a very small camp bed and what turned out to be a very cramped room The next morning we went to make a cup of tea and the long life milk pins were rancid They were out of date by 2 months Poor show and lack of housekeeping Situation saved by the very pleasant staff working on the morning of Sunday 3rd , Bed comfy Location Balcony Able to leave luggage 
233029,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was tiny but that was fine as I only slept there, Location was fantastic close to public transport Rooms were nice and warm and bed comfortable I will definitely book this hotel again
233030,Gainsborough Hotel, The only thing i would say is that the room could have been a little bigger , The staff at the hotel were exceptional They were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them I would certainly stay here again
233031,Gainsborough Hotel, Room d cor skirting board looked like it hadn t been painted for years marks all over the walls , Near to the Royal Albert Hall it had a bath and not just a shower 
233032,Gainsborough Hotel, The walls were a bit thin but not much you can do about that Pre authorization of my credit card upon arrival with an additional 60 It was removed when checking out so no problem as such but I wish I had known about this routine before I arrived , This hotel was much nicer than expected based on reviews I had read previously My single room wasn t as tiny as other single rooms I ve stayed in during visits to London The bed was very comfortable The TV looked new and had many channels Staff were very nice and welcoming WiFi was fast Good location 
233033,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is in need of refurbishment we had an awful view out of our window over an area which was dirty and neglected The bathroom was very old and in need of replacing The bedroom smelt of smoke although it did seem clean The receptionist wanted ID from both of us not a legal requirement As well as telling us they had to take an advanced authorisation on my debit card for and extra 50 on top of the room charge We refused hotels haven t tried this for years More of a B B than a hotel and definitely not 4 star , The location was good the room was quiet 
233034,Gainsborough Hotel, It was difficult to have a shower as the shower would not fit onto the hook however we managed , did not have breakfast as we prefer a cooked one the bed was extremely comfortable and the bed linen spotless For us the location could not have been better 
233035,Gainsborough Hotel, Just before we check out we saw clean towels were left on the ground near the elevator by one of the accommodation staff where any one could have stept on it skirting is dirty we can t imagine if we were using the towel we took a pic of it and showed the picture to the receptionist hopefully hotel can address this issue soon , Me and my boyfriend have stayed for 5nights reception staff and lobby staff are extremely friendly and helpful they have really keep up a four star standard we were looking for 
233036,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was shabby shower had two options fires of hell or cryogenics I also didn t like the fact that very few of the guests were paying customers most people at the hotel were being provided temporary accommodation by the government paying for their stay This changed the atmosphere of the hotel into a hostel for the displaced and vulnerable , Maria was very attentive and helpful The location of the hotel is good for South Kensington station 
233037,Gainsborough Hotel, Room could be cleaner bed was very squeaky No extra roll of toilet paper Big deposit and still reserved after 4 days of checkout but there was no minibar so why take deposit Please return asap No sound isolation so could hear neighbors talking and laughing at night Bad wifi signal No socket to charge phone near the bed and only one free socket so you couldn t charge 2 phones at once , Good neighborhood You can make your own tea Not far from subway Classical old building Shower gel was very good Big TV Hot cold water mixer instead of 2 taps 
233038,Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel is not a 4 star hotel it is between a 2 3 star Old and worn furniture dusty curtains Cannot close a window properly I expected a small room but a better standard from 90 night, Friendly staff very good location 
233039,Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel very down at heel definitely in need of a total facelift Shower so small it was almost impossible to turn around in it and I m a small person Not very clean , Location
233040,Gainsborough Hotel, The heating was not on when we arrived so it was cold The bed was small the pillows were hard and the curtains were torn on the outside The room was in the basement , Public rooms were pleasant and staff were helpful 
233041,Gainsborough Hotel, Not at all a 4star hotel more like a 2 Terrible Broken hairdryer stained carpets mouldy bathroom cabinet electric wires all over the floor nails screws sticking out from the skirting boards wallpaper coming off the walls Broken shower Cooked Breakfast comes from the hotel across the road So it was cold and disgusting Definitely not worth the money I had booked it as a celebration I was planning on proposing to my boyfriend and it was our friends birthday Totally ruined due to crappy hotel , The location
233042,Gainsborough Hotel, Sink Water in bathroom you have one cold water tap one hot water tap but no mix So either you wash your teeth with cold water or burning water shower ok though Room not so clean A bit noisy at nights from traffic , The room was nicely heated for a cold February month Nice location
233043,Gainsborough Hotel, Noise of room on ground floor sounded like a boiler was in constant use ALL night and room temp fluctuated, Breakfast was excellent value and staff all friendly
233044,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in need of some TLC It is due refurbishment but guess this is reflected in the price We couldn t turn off the room radiator but this was dealt with promptly , An elegant building Location excellent for museums and bus tube connections to the West End for the shows 
233045,Gainsborough Hotel, Very small and old poorly working lift small corridor small room very very small bathroom congested shower area even difficult to stand Uncomfortable bed Poorly located LCD TV , Very good smiling face cooperative staff with a average breakfast of hotel
233046,Gainsborough Hotel, We felt the hotel was lovely but it was tired and could do with a paint and redecoration, The room was very comfortable and the staff couldn t help enough they were wonderful
233047,Gainsborough Hotel, Overall a little worn at the edges but quite functional The inclusive breakfast is an ok continental one which does not vary Cooked breakfast is charged extra , I had a bath in my double room not just a shower A spacious room good wifi signal and TV Close to underground 2 mins walk 
233048,Gainsborough Hotel, Curtains falling off but able to wrap over window area to keep out light There is a small bar area but at no time were we encouraged to use it They might make more money if they mentioned it to the guests , Excellent location for visiting the museums Comfortable clean and warm Continental breakfast more than adequate with cheap upgrade for full English available Given the opportunity we will be using the hotel again 
233049,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was in the basement right underneath the road including all noises that come with such a location with single glazing accommodation The room and interior was in such a bad state esp the bathroom that we cannot understand how this can be seriously offered to any customer , The only good thing is the location 
233050,Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing to complaint, The room was quite spacious and also the bathroom and the location very near to the underground museums park also other important places it saves money and time 
233051,Gainsborough Hotel, Condition of the room No natural light in the room The room which was on the first floor right next to elevator shaft which wasn t too noisy thankfully was a bit of an odd layout The one thing you noticed as soon as you entered the room was that there was barely any natural light in the room as it only had a 18inch square window above a door where you d expect a window to be The door where the window should be was actually the entrance to the bathroom There was plenty of natural light there so the only option was to leave the bedroom door open The room was a triple as we d requested and although my bed was on the squidgy side they were fine and the linen was clean Next to my sons bed there was a large patch of wallpaper missing where somebody had torn it away and the drawers next to my bed where broken with one drawer not shutting and the other had it s front broken off but just leaning against it Tea making was fun as you had to plug it in on the floor after removing the tray from the beneath the TV I realise that this review seems negative it is sad as it wouldn t take much effort to make it a really nice hotel but I find it surprising that it s rated as a 4 star due to all the issues I found I can t comment on the food as we ate breakfast and all other meals out in Kensington We still had a successful trip as we only spent our sleeping hours there Sad to say but I wouldn t stay at the Gainsborough again , Location Okay so I ll be as kind as I can be Firstly location is excellent it is about 30m away from The Natural History Museum Science Museum and V A A short walk to Harrods and some really nice restaurants in Kensington and close to the Tube to make getting around easy The entrance is also very nice and well kept The young lady in reception was polite courteous and helpful 
233052,Gainsborough Hotel, I didn t have any hot water in my shower one morning but the other 4 mornings were fine , Any time I needed assistance a butler was at my door within 5 minutes The staff was helpful and friendly 
233053,Gainsborough Hotel, Heating in the rooms very poor random time turned on Hard mattresses on bed Most staff did not speak English and neither spoke German French Bathroom taps of cold and hot water separate so washing hands either too hot or too cold Shower without pressure All carpeted floors with carpets needing some cleaning or replacement Charged breakfast for kids aged 6 , Excellent location in general friendly staff WiFi with good signal and speed 
233054,Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel lobby is tired looking as was entrance area to my room Very small room indeed advertised as a double but really it is a single Shower unit too small and I am petite a larger person certainly couldn t shower in it Side table lamp not working nor was the safe Room carpet had stains on as did the over cover on the bed Building work noises constantly from the next building starting early ending late Room 114 backs onto a busy school playground If you do want to use this room ask for a big discount as it s certainly not worth anywhere near what they are charging good location or not , Staff were friendly I did not use the Hotel for breakfast 
233055,Gainsborough Hotel, Poor shower and a stale cigarette smell in the bathroom , Good location pleasant decor friendly staff nice breakfast comfy bed late bar in the reception area 
233056,Gainsborough Hotel, The room we stay in the bathroom lock isnt working and there was a 80 additional deposit required which was quite redundant when we ddidn t want to pay for additional services, Croissants were so good Service staff were so friendly at breakfast Museums and shopping as well as underground train is just so accessible 
233057,Gainsborough Hotel, The door can t even be fully closed The staff knocked on our door at 8am Saturday to ask if room service is needed Of course not now Then they never came back the room is not cleaned up at all during our stay 2 days , Good location
233058,Gainsborough Hotel, view from the room was not very nice junk thrown outside of the window The bathroom was not very clean, the bed was nice and so was the location the furniture was decorative We didn t have to check out till 12
233059,Gainsborough Hotel, The toilet seat was broken in the deluxe room and the wall paper was coming off the walls The carpets were stained and the room was very dirty and dusty , It was very close to South Kensington tube station
233060,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so hot but in order to turn down the heat you had to speak to staff It would have been great to have easier independent access , Very close to tube stations and local attractions Good for the price 
233061,Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel s facilities are very old and need be refurbished For example flush in the toilet was very weak we asked staff to fix it but even after the fix flush did not begin to work properly One of the window sections was not able to be closed completely in January and we also request hotel s staff to fix this issue , Perfect location Few steps from tube and three important London s museums Quiet Rooms aren t huge but big enough for such level of London s hotels Helpful staff 
233062,Gainsborough Hotel, The decor in my single room was a tad shabby Not in a Chic way , The staff were welcoming accomodating The location is excellently placed for visiting The Natural History Museum the V A Gallery nice shopping available Locally but because of the location quite Expensive 
233063,Gainsborough Hotel, We were welcomed very well The room we found very small But we were only there one night We had great difficulty plugging the kettle in as the lead was short the plug adaptor was on the floor The room was clean the bed was clean We did miss having a bar of soap in bathroom but otherwise it was ok ,No Positive
233064,Gainsborough Hotel, Dreadful smell in room a cross between paint and something in the air con system it smelt toxic upon entering every time although I did get used to it Renovators directly above my room started each day at approx 8 30 9am Incessant drilling hammering walking about and dropping tools Very small bathroom this was fine but amenities in wrong positions a badly planned bathroom Mould in shower alcove Decor is dark and needs modernising blankets on bed need upgrading to doonas Room very cold although central heating was on very noisy extra blanket provided upon request , There were many mixed reviews of this property so with apprehension I booked 4 nights It was a very cheap price for London at this location You can t beat the location directly across the road from the National History Museum and only a 3 minute walk to the South Kensington tube with an excellent variety of restaurants shops nearby The room was reasonably spacious it overlooked a local school but no noise issues from that Free wi fi Friendly Reception staff I didn t have breakfast in the hotel Price location outweighed the bad points for me 
233065,Gainsborough Hotel, Bed was a little too firm for me shower floor was a bit slippery hot water from shower rather sparse on 3rd floor probably everyone else using it at the same time , Lovely atmosphere all the benefits of traditional hotels of my youth but with all mod cons very helpful staff in a quiet road of well maintained old buildings quite near tube station very nice breakfast 
233066,Gainsborough Hotel, The accommodation was let down by the bathroom which was cold and in need of refurbishment Poor shower and both basin and bath plugs had come loose and were on the shelf Not good enough for a 4 hotel , The location of this hotel was excellent 5min walk from underground and close to museums Located in a very pleasant and quiet street 
233067,Gainsborough Hotel, Out of date Hotel Everything is old badly maintained with poor quality They gave us a safety pin to close the broken window curtains during the night , Location price in sale
233068,Gainsborough Hotel, Public areas were very nice but room we were allocated was very disappointing for a romantic weekend Decor and furnishings seemed very dated and was more like a single room than a double Bed was two singles pushed together and only one bedside cabinet Buffet breakfast area at 9 30 am on a Sunday was poorly stocked and seating inadequate Dining chairs are far too cumbersome with tables used Should consider bistro seating Staff were pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of them Perhaps maybe coordination regard seating of guests and restocking of buffet table should be addressed We had to wait for coffee milk juice and had no pastries , Location 
233069,Gainsborough Hotel, We arrived 10 minutes early for a 2pm check in Our deluxe room was not available so we were given a room for 3 as an apparent upgrade It was awful room was dirty the shower didn t work lighting was terrible and the double bed was two twin beds put together I wanted to complain but the missus said to just leave it The staff were friendly enough but struggled with basic english Whoever gave this 4 stars needs sectioning Do not stay here , The location is ideal for the museums Hyde Park and shopping in nearby High Street Kensington 
233070,Gainsborough Hotel, See above, Not a lot the room was very small AC did not work for more than 5 minutes at a time The shower was a joke no pressure and went cold then boiling hot That said the Spanish servers in the restaurant were just great
233071,Gainsborough Hotel, Although we had been upgraded our room was still very basic Our toilet flusher was broken and bathroom was tired looking needed some tlc, We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival and were upgraded The receptionist also printed a map for nearest restaurants and shops as we hadn t eaten yet and were very late 
233072,Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was hard The bathroom was adequate but tired and needs maintaining or refurb Eg Wobbly loo cracked floor tiles , Staff are lovely Location awesome Room was quite spacious for the price 
233073,Gainsborough Hotel, The lady at reception asked for passport details which were not explained in the booking Bathroom very dated and dirty, Location great staff not got a clue The lady on reception could not understand English and a very poor communicator
233074,Gainsborough Hotel, I did not like the fact that we were asked for ID on arrival then asked again an hour later Why do I need to carry my passport if im a UK citizen in a UK hotel If it was so important why were not given ample notice of this To say it was in thes mall print was a very poor response , For London 99 is good and the location was good 
233075,Gainsborough Hotel, We paid for a superior double room and got given a standard twin Although this was rectified had we not liked the alternative room we would have had to stay in a room we were originally assigned which was not what we paid for , When we complained about the original room we were put in the lady on the desk dealt with it quickly and efficiently however I am not sure what she would have done if there hadn t been a spare double room 
233076,Gainsborough Hotel, Only vice was the room was VERY warm Couldn t turn the heating down and couldn t open the window as it was terribly windy outside , Hotel looked fantastic from the outside inside was a warm reception area and staff were lovely even taking the time to speak with my daughter There was a small lift to the upper floors and room was easy to find Rooms were a little dated in decor but very regal looking and very clean Adequate facilities and the wifi access was explained to me on check in Easy access links to tube and over the road from natural history museum 
233077,Gainsborough Hotel, Should be good to have any more shelves in the bathroom and inside the wardrobe , The location is very good and the staff very nice in particular Maria and Ivan
233078,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was small and decorations and furniture tired Fine if you want a hotel to sleep in and not much more which we did , Great location and helpful staff
233079,Gainsborough Hotel, Shown to a basic twin room first when i had booked a delux double had to complain to get appropriate room English breakfast was cooked across the road as there is no kitchen not good , Nice location impressive bed 
233080,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was in desperate need of maintenance upgrading The water pipes were Knocking the room was dark the facilities were poor and the staff were ambivalent to Customers , The location was excellent
233081,Gainsborough Hotel, My room was basically a dorm room absolutely tiny and very old It was so cold I had to sleep in my clothes and coat Also in the folder it states food served until 10 I got back 9pm and kitchen was already closed I hadn t eaten allay and even the sister hotel which I did not know had most of the facilities had also closed Staff pointed out other eateries but I was very pregnant and exhausted from work , Staff were friendly and tried to be be helpful 
233082,Gainsborough Hotel, I had a large crack running up my wall that seemed to be the reason why the Bathroom door wouldn t close properly Also the air conditioning machine was at a very odd angle , The Hotel is walking distance from the natural History museum V A Harrods and South Ken Station A large room with a good size bathroom and everything worked 
233083,Gainsborough Hotel, Terrible shower loose taps handle missing from hair dryer drawer Generally a bit shabby and in need of improvements , Good location balcony quiet room hotel had character 
233084,Gainsborough Hotel, The decor and rooms could do with a little upgrade, Staff very friendly and accommodating with my elderly father s needs Nothing was too much trouble for them and always done with a huge smile
233085,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is very veery tired the rooms are small the shower in our room was a joke with no pressure and going cold then hot then cold again the AC did not work the bed was tiny for a double All in all not very good at all , The two Spanish waitresses who served us in the Breakfast room were great 
233086,Gainsborough Hotel, Initially directed to room with just a normal double bed having booked a standard twin room This was quickly rectified Room at the rear of the premises was clean though a little shabby Quiet at night and allowed for a good nights sleep , Location is perfect Reception and communal areas are superbly decorated Staff were very helpful and friendly All in all very satisfied 
233087,Gainsborough Hotel, only complaint would be the small shower and lack of water pressure Bit of a squeeze to get in and shower controls keep moving as one turns in the shower to get wet Very noisy mornings , location for local restaurants etc staff very helpful 
233088,Gainsborough Hotel, The breakfast is quite traditional and could be a bit more modern i e some sliced vegetables for the bread and less sweet youghurt A bit draughty room which made it a bit cold at night , Nice and helpful staff comfortable beds och clean room Continental breakfast with several choices 
233089,Gainsborough Hotel, Booked double room got twin 104 Both bath tap sink tap had very loose parts Bath very slippery when wet but no grab handles , Nice restaurant very good breakfast Would use it again 
233090,Gainsborough Hotel, They gave me room 401 it is behind a firedoor and cut off from the rest of the hotel and therefore the hotel heating does not affect this room There is a heater in the room it was not working and the room was freezing cold I complained someone came up to look at it then said that they d have to call maintenance in the morning No offer to exchange the room etc Next morning the shower took 15 20 min to warm up and was a trickle at best This time they offered that I shower in a different room By this time all I wanted to do was to get out of the musty freezing room At the reception there was no apology they charged me 89 gbp for a night in a small cold room even at this bargain price it was not worth it I could have been a frequent traveller with them and could have recommended this hotel to others at work who stay in London 2 3 nights every single week I will never stay there again , Location 
233091,Gainsborough Hotel, Was sligtly put off prior to travelling by some reviews Yes the reception staff was foreign who isn t in London They were very polite and very approachable Ignore bad reviews You will not be disappointed , Excellent hotel with a budget price tag Nice and clean with comfortable beds Perfect location near to tube Shops and food sources within a short walk 
233092,Gainsborough Hotel, Not a bad experience but needs updating especially the bathroom bath leaked quite badly Top of wardrobe was very dusty which we only noticed when recovering suitcase Biscuits would have been good along with the tea and coffee , Staff were friendly helpful Breakfast food was excellent Beds comfortable and in a quiet room which was at our request Lots of information given in the folder Couldn t ask for more Clean towels provided every day 
233093,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Best location ever in London three tube lines and buses to choose from Nice area with caf s and great museums around the corner Very friendly staff room spacious we had a three bed room for family with 2 small kids 
233094,Gainsborough Hotel, The worst thing is that there was no central heating in late October In addition there was a 12 cm long hole in the window frame The room was cold Heater was provided upon request but nothing about the hole was done The furniture is worn out the bathroom is so tiny you need to squeeze into the shower , Good location friendly staff nice breakfast Differentiation of price by breakfast type 
233095,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was very small although that was made clear when I booked Slightly quirky but very comfortable stay Pricey because of the school holidays but ultimately I d go back if it was a little more reasonable , Convenient and very friendly
233096,Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were helpful enough but seemed to lack understanding The room was very small even for a twin and there was limited space in the bathroom to have washing items touthpaste and toothbrush left out There was a bulb out in the wall lights and this was never replaced The hanging area was down a set of stairs but the light switch was at the bottom near the entrance door so we had to leave the night on all night for safety The bedroom was right next to the AC fans and it sounded as if we were sleeping on a boat We came back from one outing to discover that house keeping had left the window wide open which would allow anyone access to our room and items we had purchased On one morning when we exited the room which was next to the laundry cupboard we were met with 6 housekeeping staff spralled on the floor and on top of laundry bags not what paying guests want to see We opted not to have breakfast as in most cases it is easier to purchase and cheaper at a nice cafe however we were giving complimentary coffee on arrival but it was awful coffee All in all we were disappointed with the room and facilities and that there seemed to be no management available for complaint to , It was two minutes from South Kensington Tube station and the Natural History Museum so it that respect great 
233097,Gainsborough Hotel, Not the happiest of staff but all ok , Cleanliness and Location was very good Seemed to be in a French village location with all amenities around the corner and a tube station Ideal for the museums 
233098,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathrooms were not bad , The location was very convenient hotel was good didn t like my room at first but the staff were very nice and changed the room for me 
233099,Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was very small, The service from the staff was exceptional They made the stay the best and also where the hotel was located was great as you could walk to places to eat very easily and it was a good location
233100,Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is in a very poor state I had safety concerns I have used this hotel before but won t again The furnishings are threadbare wallpaper is missing from the walls in places and the carpets are stained ,No Positive
233101,Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing but we should mention that there was a step up from our bedroom to the bathroom if someone has mobility problems , We loved the location less than half a block from the front door of the Museum of Natural History and only about a block more to the V A Museum and the Hop On Hop Off Bus The breakfast room was set with white linen tablecloths and a good breakfast was served very nicely We must mention the exceptionally friendly helpful staff especially in the evening including Zita 
233102,Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was very hard not comfortable Pillows very lumpy Eiderdown smelt and was full of stains on underside and very grubby on topside Water in shower hard to control temperature and bath all lime scale marked Only 2 sachets of coffee in room , The location was good for the Albert Hall Close to the underground Lots of nearby cafe s and restuaurants 
233103,Gainsborough Hotel, I has single room and was very very tiny too tiny to spend much time in there apart from sleep no room for a chair so had to sit on the bed Very traditional, Great location staff were friendly
233104,Gainsborough Hotel, Our triple room had no window this had been closed over to create the bathroom There was borrowed light but as soon as the bathroom door was closed it left the room rather dark Also no mirror in the bedroom only in the bathroom Not ideal in a triple room Finally no gin available in the bar , The location of the hotel was very good as my sisters and I were going to the Royal Albert Hall The tube station is also only a short walk 
233105,Gainsborough Hotel, As above, Excellent location Quiet room no banging doors Comfortable and warm Maybe a bath mat would be good Also tea and coffee on side not tucked away in cupboard That kind of put me off using it But mostly all was great 
233106,Gainsborough Hotel, The room we paid for was not like the one on booking com we were so tired that we slept in the room we were allocated we complained the next morning and changed rooms the bed was so uncomfortable Then in our next room the bed was also so hard the mattress was a lot smaller than the base , The area was excellent location
233107,Gainsborough Hotel, Booked a double room 4 months in advance Only had twin room next to a noisy elevator when arrived on time At various times the cold water stopped working and the electricity went out Filthy bedcovers Only salvation of this place is the location Conclusion avoid if you can , Location 
233108,Gainsborough Hotel, There was no mini bar or hair dryer In the room and our door had about an inch gap on the bottom so light and sound from the hallway came in freely , Location was amazing and the room was good sized with a very comfy bed
233109,Gainsborough Hotel, Hard to communicate with some reception staff English obviously not their 1st language bedroom decor furniture tired dated curtain track damaged window cracked wallpaper old marked furniture old and poorly mended with visible screws bedspread grubby 1 feather 3 foam pillows requested 2nd feather after 1st night but it never arrived bed could feel dents in mattress bizarrely no duvet but old fleece blanket sandwiched between TWO top sheets bathroom ok used bath foam shower gel 1st night requested replacement eventually butler arrived with shampoo around 11 30pm , Great location near Hyde Park S Kensington museums Harrods etc Attractive reception lounge area Didn t bother with hotel restaurant 12 breakfast excellent French patisseries few minutes walk nr S Kensington tube 
233110,Gainsborough Hotel, A old tired hotel with old tired funiture much in need of repair with tired staff who are only just courteous cold rooms no central heating working outside temperature 8 c only a small electric fire for heat , Nothing I could not recommend this hotel to anyone until I complained our room was in the basement down very narrow stairs there was no outside natural light in the room or fresh air very cloterphobic when the curtains were drawn back the view was of a frosted glass window with a store from behind if 
233111,Gainsborough Hotel, Through no fault of my own I had to change my dates to the next day and was told that I could not get a refund for the day I didn t stay there Yes I know it s in the small print but I am a 70 year old who isn t really used to booking anything on line and didn t spot it My excuse was genuine and I think it was pretty mean of them I am a pensioner and 75 means a lot to me Therefore I won t ever book this hotel for any future visits to London Poor show Gainsborough If you change your mind I ll write something nice about you , I cannot answer that because I didn t get to stay there 
233112,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Staff are friendly and accommodating My first room was not what I booked but this was dealt with quickly and my new room was small but beautifully finished and very comfortable
233113,Gainsborough Hotel, Room not as illustrated very misleading Cramped room no space and no assisitance lift to carry luggage up two flights of stairs to tiny room , Location 
233114,Gainsborough Hotel, No tea coffee making facilities in the room big disappointment for price we paid Room was a little shabby furniture broken curtains torn quite badly , Close to tube station friendly staff it was great we could leave our bags before after our stay so we didn t have to lug around London 
233115,Gainsborough Hotel, Room not cleaned properly no milk provided one day no rubbish bags in bins one day broken toilet seat furniture and furnishings need maintainence , Nothing in particular location was good 
233116,Gainsborough Hotel, Unstable wifi connection during my stay, Very near to museums which is a big plus if one likes such places Good transport access with nearby bus stops and tube station
233117,Gainsborough Hotel, Cleanliness poor and room decor tired Bathroom sealing around bath black and poorly maintained Fan in bathroom loud and I m sure would have disturbed other guests Poor wifi coverage in basement rooms , Location was ideal for needs
233118,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was quite small Wardrobe was unreachable due to a bed being beside it and I could not move it Rooms are a little dated and could do with brightening up Very quiet Hotel which is great Feel that breakfast should be included in the price , The friendliness of the staff Very helpful I liked that there was an electric fire in the room for one to use when needed Breakfast was great 
233119,Gainsborough Hotel, Pillows were quite oldish Was warm in the room for me but maybe not to others , Locality to museums the underground and only a nice walk from many places to see Earing places and coffee shops as well as shopping at Harrods Was quaint with a victorian style room Facilities all were great Storage for hanging garments as well 
233120,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall where we attended a concert Not being a regular visitor to London I can not say if the price of the accommodation was reasonable It does not seem all that reasonable to pay 155 for less than 48 hours in the building 
233121,Gainsborough Hotel, Don t expect a 4 star hotel by American standards it would be a 3 star at best which seems to be the standard one less star than American standards Reserved and paid for a deluxe double room and the a c didn t work maintenance never came to address it even though the helpful staff tried to reach the department again Room was tired and dated in appearance although very clean Although deluxe and a supposed best buy our room didn t include a 12 pp breakfast , Brilliant location for museums in the French speaking district which was a treat loads of restaurants nearby as well Staff was very friendly and helpful No free wifi in our room couldn t even locate it 
233122,Gainsborough Hotel, I specifically asked for twin beds but they gave a double bed Very awkward as they said the hotel was full and so they could not do anything , Good location welcoming reception clean bathroom n nice toiletries 
233123,Gainsborough Hotel, After the 3rd room we looked at found a room acceptable though in a poor state of repair Only good thing the window opened Bathroom in bad state repair Hotel tired Staff friendly but ill trained and fed up with complaints Embarassed One room we looked at rejected looked as though it was being de fleaed Shame of it is the hotel could be nice with a refit and is in a good location , At least I slept 
233124,Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative, Great location for Natural History Museum Fairly close to tube station Lots of places in the area to have a meal Not too much street noise Peaceful
233125,Gainsborough Hotel, It is not a 4 stars hotel it could be considered a 2 stars The rooms are very poor old and messy , Convenient location well connected by tube or with a short walking
233126,Gainsborough Hotel, For single travellers this is more like a two star definitely not a four and a bad two star at that On checking in I could barely understand the person at the check in desk For some reason she insisted on rubbing it in I was not going to be charged for an early check in which I had not asked for anyway I was expecting to use the luggage storage facility which by the way is just the area in the general vicinity of the check in desk She also assumed I was going to use room service and wanted me to pre pay a 5 charge Had to say no on more than one occasion I was in a single room on 3rd floor this was actually through door listed as stairs to reception no mention of my room number and basically looks like it was just a spare bit of space they had on a landing Had no wardrobe space as filled with large floor fan and a luggage support no room to put these in room anyway shelf was filled with a safe No drawers at all Had to sit on bed to open bathroom door as no space to walk by Window was broken with a temporary repair that had been there for a while Shower was disgusting with a rusting shower head mould round the bottom and the tiles had heavy lime scale water marks all over suggesting not cleaned properly in a long long time shower doors very stiff and did not like to force them closed suggesting that no one else wanted to use it either I counted two light switches in the bathroom one above the door and one for the wall mounted hair dryer are these even legal Dust on bottom edge of wardrobe at the side some one could not be bothered to reach down the side of the wall to remove it Bed cover was actually a double folded in half and valance ripped albeit on the wall side Limited tea coffee and only two milk and cup provided was very small giving you a very strong coffee with not enough milk to make drinkable The television was plugged into a multi socket extension which was hanging in mid air , Location was very good for the purpose of my trip Also close to tube The bed was comfortable There was a lift even though extremely tiny Bed linen was clean and wall decoration seemed fresh 
233127,Gainsborough Hotel, Poor beds in some rooms air conditioning not working and some of the fixtures a little tired , Friendly helpful staff who tried to help where they could Location is great for museums Knightsbridge and good tude connections to other parts of London 
233128,Gainsborough Hotel, The room had no window and the only window was in the bathroom and without a view The hairdryer was inside a drawer in the bedroom but there was no mirror in the bedroom There was no toilet brush either There was no minibar in the room which usually there is in a 4 star hotel bedroom Three beds and only one bedside table with a lamp on it , We liked the location Easy access to the underground
