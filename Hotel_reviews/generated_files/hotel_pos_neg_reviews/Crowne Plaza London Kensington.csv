24278,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, It was my partners 60th birthday and the hotel staff were amazing Receptionist were lovely They left a card cake and a bottle of wine The room was lovely at the back overlooking the garden The little things do make a big difference and it made his weekend Thank you we come to London a lot and we will be back 
24279,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Noisy air con so had to sleep with it switched off Very small window and opening to let air in so a bit stuffy in such a small room , Liked the large garden space seating area outside for drinks 
24280,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, At past midnight on 25 June front desk staff on duty a gentleman with short hair stubble beard was rude when asked why there was no one at the front desk A guy was checking in and no one was around He knocked at the door around My 16yr old son was waiting for 15 mins as well to get his luggage for deposit while we were off to Scotland the next day Front desk stout lady replied why don t you work here to know what it s like In the hospitality industry this is a no no Sad for my innocent son to face people who don t have a passion for what they do , Location is quite good
24281,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Nothing really, Staff were attentive and friendly Room was large by London standards and the hotel garden was excellent especially for a Happy Hour cocktail

24283,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, I would have liked a better view from our room, The secret garden is a little bit of heaven in a busy city Loved it to sit and have an iced chilled wine on a warm evening Peaceful 
24284,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Although room was a disabled room which we hadn t booked it was extremely comfortable and had all that we needed for a one night stay It would have been nice on checking in to be informed of this However would stay at this hotel again , Exceptionally friendly helpful staff plus a delicious breakfast of smoked haddock poached eggs Also a little extra from buffet too Would recommend this hotel to family friends 
24285,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, AC in room not cold breakfast not great quality, Convenient location no traffic noise in the garden view room hearing birds singing in the treetops in the morning was lovely

24287,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Beds were very comfortable linen good quality and bathroom facilities excellent On the sixth floor and slept very well I needed gluten free bread at breakfast and one of the ladies working in the restaurant went out of her way to help me I only wish I knew her name to give her a mention 
24288,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel is well located round the corner from Gloucester Road tube station It is within walking distance from Kensington High Street Knightsbridge Royal Albert Hall and museums Breakfast choices are plentiful and the food is really good Bar prices are not what one would expect from a London hotel for example less than 4 for a pint of draught Boddingtons Would stay there again 
24289,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Not value for money quite expensive for what it was Restaurant choices of food were very ltd if you don t like Thai food Just like any other hotel in the cheaper bracket so was slightly disappointed , Staff nice Beds comfy 2 double beds brilliant Nice size TV 
24290,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, this was my second time at the hotel the first time i booked the 2 level suite but this time beacuse we were 2 only we booked a room and it was very very very small 1 peron could move around the room at a time even our bags took the capacity thats left in the room , the location was amazing tesco waitrose boots starbucks paul they were all across the street its a very safe area since we were 2 girls alone that was perfect and its on a main street which makes it very easy for uber drivers to get there or even to find a cab 
24291,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Room good size although I had booked an executive room by mistake This gave access to executive lounge and free drinks canap s if wanted Breakfast also included but have to say no better than other hotels we have used in London Certainly great location for museums Royal Albert Hall etc 
24292,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Room size is smaller than I thought based on picture First impression isn t very good because bathroom and closet door is quite old And there is only a small window which is a little depressing I consider it to be a bit more expensive but maybe it s because of the good location , Common area is very nice like breakfast etc 
24293,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The location was great hotel was very close to the tube station which made it easy to get to all of the local attractions The hotel was modern staff were polite helpful and friendly and the bed was comfortable I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel

24298,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, towels looked a bit old considering it s been newly refurbished they probably just need to be bleached or something to restore that crisp whiteness , My biggest fear when looking for a hotel is the state of the bathrooms and carpet so it took me a week of trawling through reviews and researching online to finally decide on a hotel to stay in And boy was it a relief and pleasant surprise when I arrived at this hotel As a professional interior designer myself I appreciate the style of the hotel decor very modern but warm and tasteful I know those wall coverings didn t come cheap It s quite evident that whoever was responsible for the design was meticulous and applied a very high attention to detail Concierge services were generally very accommodating Although when I called one evening asking for ice I was asked to contact room service directly the concierge from the previous two nights must have passed on the request to housekeeping without asking me to do it myself so being asked to contact room service directly was a bit of a put off It wouldn t have taken much effort to pass on the request to room service from the concierge s desk would it Housekeeping team was very thorough with the cleaning I found the room to be very clean and fresh and actually better in reality than the pictures I d seen online I particularly loved the lavender sleep aid that was left at the bedside it worked a treat 
24299,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Comfy bed good buffet and order breakfast fitness room great location very near tube and on direct line to Heathrow and easy walking distance to Kensington Hyde Park and multiple museums It was even a nice evening walk from Westminster back to the hotel through multiple parks Lots of places to eat nearby

24306,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, There was no heating and the AC which can blow warm air wasn t working succesfully , Very close to Gloucester Road station tube Transportation to any place in London is really easy Nice rooms clean and well equipped very good wifi Good value for money

24310,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, It should have a shower compartment rather than having long bath at shower area , The executive lounge was a good additional service provided with additional cost

24316,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Reception staff are not the friendliest and helpful On the last night we had to sleep in birmingham we asked if we could get a refund which was not possible We then arrived just before 12 at the hotel the day after to ask if we could atleast get an extra hour just to freshen up before we left which they would not allow Considering we didnt sleep there the night before and didnt get a refund this was the least i thought they could have done, I thought robert at the concierge was amazing He was very helpful and a delight to interact with
24317,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Not enough coffee at breakfast my husband and I would have preferred our own pot as we like to have a couple of cups at breakfast The breakfast staff were happy to refill but you had to wait until someone was available So nothing major , Nice comfortable bed room was on the 6th floor nice and quiet even though we were overlooking the main road Air con worked which was good as sometimes hotel rooms can be stuffy Good choice at breakfast even arriving at 9 50am I also used the gym which had a good amount of equipment Position of hotel excellent for museums and restaurants etc All staff very polite and accommodating Fantastic bar and bar staff So all together a pleasant experience 
24318,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Very noisy Traffic noises evident in suite 24 7 Bathrooms are crammed guess that s London standard After 1 week limited breakfast variety gets tiring , Walking to many tourist attractions Convenient for bus and tube connections Friendly staff in all departments make stay memorable 
24319,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The head of concierge s manner is unacceptable He refused to keep our luggage whereas it s stated clearly that the hotel provides luggage storage If not because I ve paid for my next stay with the hotel again on on Thur I d have changed the hotel He harshly talked to me and my mother in front of the others and was not happy that the receptionist came to help clear the issue He s arrogant and at the same time racist in the way that he treated us His bad behavior really ruins our holidays ,No Positive
24320,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Lovely clean and quiet room very comfortable bed and nice smiling staff Great location opposite a tube station and a street full of excellent pubs caf s and restaurants 
24321,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The reception on the second day who promised a room change but did not inform the next shift although i had reminded him 3 times The room 108 for the first 2 nights was poor with small bed and poor water pressure in the shower, Managed to change rooms for me on the third day Room 132 was much more comfortable 
24322,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Room not so spacious Corridors very dark Room and other service too slow and not always responsive Had to call a couple of times until requests are being met , Good location next to tube and bus station Front desk staff very friendly Lobby very spacious and welcoming 
24323,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The hotel corridors and rooms smell like you re in a Indian restaurant Can t stand it and changed the hotel after 2 days even though I ve unpacked my staff The room was old The wood was splitting in stairs in suit room Does not worth the price Not so close to Knightsbridge 20 minutes walk ,No Positive
24324,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Just very small point breakfast plates were cold and so were fried eggs , We loved the location and the secret garden Room was lovely and clean woth lovely view of the garden Everything in the public rooms sparkled 
24325,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The rooms need more light tiny Windows not a good idea so need more lights, Excellent location comfortable rooms and space lovely secret garden Room garden side was quite nice
24326,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Unfortunately standard rooms are tiny bed for 2 persons is extremely narrow with a common duvet , The location and the friendliness of staff The secret back garden 
24327,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Serving hot freshly made tea in a pot for each table instead of that from thermos, Served breakfast with a smile and provided fresh ment for my black tea
24328,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Bed was so comfy The room facilities were excellent and very clean Bathroom was excellent Breakfast was very good Excellent choice Staff execellent 
24329,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The staff were not helpful At one point i called the reception to inquire why my fridge was locked she answered its because i didnt pay 50 pounds deposit I replyed no one asked me to pay and honestly i only wanted to use it to store groceries that i have just purchase Her answer is she will have to send a request to clear my fridge which should take untill tomorrow I guess buying a new fridge should take less time , Location clean rooms
24330,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The worst thing is the rooms we got were like cells or sealed rooms There were windows but basically next to a wall We felt very uncomfortable I think this should be mentioned in the room specifications on the website so customers can have a choice if they would like to pay more for a room with open view Besides the front desk staff were not really helpful We travelled in a group of 6 and 2 of us got a room on a different floor Booking was made well in advance and they could have made necessary arrangement for the group to stay on the same floor but not putting the blame on us for checking in late which was out of our control plus we did mention this on our booking It is something small and it s fine if they could not make a change but their attitude was poor and they didn t seem to care and show sincerity , Location is great and just opposite to the Gloucester station 
24331,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The cookie and chocolate bar that goes so well with the coffee and tea provided The table was a good size for working The fried rice at breakfast is very nice Robert concierge and Roberta receptionist were very helpful 
24332,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, I have no suggestions for improvements It was excellent , Room was spotless and roomy stall members were very polite and accommodating breakfast was excellent 
24333,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, No coffee machine in room just a kettle and instant Fresh coffee only available at breakfast time, Room spacious and clean beds comfortable we went to the hotels Asian restaurant for dinner food was fabulous and staff very attentive
24334,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Without prejudice the service located at concierge has some work to do, Breakfast buffet gardens and location also the good service provided at breakfast consistently at each and every morning
24335,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, i didnt think the hotel was worthy of its star rating as the rooms were small and not nice very dark and obviously been designered beyond need without understanding a guest only focussing on the dark felt headboard design the carpets were not so clean glasses were dirty and i had to call for fresh ones the shower room partition was nice in appearance but putting a toilet roll on the side of the bath fixing meant it became wet when the shower was used The mirrors steamed up fully and rendered them useless There was no guest slippers and i was pleased i brought my own face cloths It was evident that the hotel had focussed on appearance but not functionality having a full size ironing board in the long drop wardrobe section wasn t useful at all and the cut backs on guest facilities was in the wrong places tea and sugars literally stuffed in a tin on the side was very poor no valance on the bed showing the bad base was very poor the concierge was unable to give clear directions to the location and we were driving around to find parking which i understood was in the hotel but we found out was in another hotel over the main road a few hundred meters away the breakfast room s light but again very modernised and designered to look something its not really a prime example of Fur Coating something that s not covering its bare essentials first i could go on but really its not worth it as the hotel has fudged its star rating and i was extremely disappointed i will revert back to my previous hotel nearby for future bookings the lancaster is much better and has some quality in its tradition , the choice of vegetarian sausage to make a real breakfast only took 15 mins to cook fresh and deliver to the table
24336,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The staff was pleasant but not very informative as to where the breakfast area was coffee if not having breakfast or recommendations for pubs cafes etc , Great location close to tube station Excellent breakfast Loved the complimentary sparkling water in the lobby Would definetly stay there again 
24337,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Air conditioning did not work upon first arrival Mini frig in room was ancient and could not get cold enough to safely store food That ancient mini frig should be tossed this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel Shower was one of those with inadequate water splash barrier so that it was an adventure to keep the floor dry seems to be intended for those who like to soak in a bath tub But the newer 4 star hotels provide full water splash barriers so that guests can keep the floor dry regardless of shower or soaking choice , Quiet room Responsive staff when air conditioning was not working they made it work On his own initiative chief engineer placed an additional mini frig in the room when the permanent one could not get cold enough to safely store food All staff that met the guests were well trained in customer service 
24338,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, I thought the d cor was a bit modern and bland for my taste , Very spacious bedroom with really comfortable beds and choice of pillows The staff were warm and helpful 
24339,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel is in a perfect location room is big and well maintained very helpfull and polite staff Breakfast was very good cofy is served in the moment you get in We asked for a room towards the garden yes there is a nice one and got it right away

24342,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The shower was weak and the placement of the shower was too low for a tall person , Nice quiet room Very clean and comfortable Nice garden Friendly staff Good value for money 
24343,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, They didn t have any haddock when we ordered it In common with many hotels they need to learn how to cook eggs so that the white is cooked without the yoke being hard , Very handy for the underground We liked the fact that you could order kippers haddock for breakfast 
24344,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, This is not a budget hotel However you get what you pay Good hotels in London are expensive The hotel is situated in one of the most beautiful areas of central London however it s a little far from main attractions But tthe metro station is next to hotel and within 10 minutes you can be anywhere in the center, We had a standard room and it was very comfortable pleasant and quite The staff was very helpful wifi was working good breakfast was excellent The hotel is situated in a very beautiful area next to metro station In general is a very good hotel with high level of service It fullfilled my expectations I will probably stay again in my next visit in London 
24345,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Room Service never arrived I ordered at 11 10pm and waited up although very tired and by 12 30 nothing had come so I phoned to cancel it Very tired the next day as lost an hour and a half sleep waiting for room service , comfy bed
24346,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Hotel gave us a free bottle of wine as anniversary trip however only left 1 glass addressed letter to husband even though I the wife did booking seemed a little old fashioned ,No Positive
24347,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Lack of extended check out requested for only 2 hours more have been disappointing while travelling with a little baby and being IHg platinum member,No Positive
24348,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, This is not for the luxury travelled For the same amount of money you can stay in better places The gym is really run down it smells extremely bad The hotel staff extremely not helpful the dry clean service is extremely bad Staff would not give me a 2 hour late check out , It s an ok location the lounge 
24349,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, No to mention, Overall the hotel was good the staff were friendlyand breakfast was good Hotel s location it is located on area near to tube station and there are many restaurants caf s and post office It is few steps from museums I do recommend this hotel for anyone vist London 
24350,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, It might be the norm in England but there was no ice machine in the building I didn t like drinking warm water Also there was no beer available to purchase from the mini bar I would have made that purchase several times if available , The staff was extremely accommodating The free bottled water and candy provided daily was very much appreciated The room was quiet clean and comfortable Also due to the great location we were able to flag down a taxi within seconds each and every time Also there is a market directly across the street that we found to be reasonably priced 
24351,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, I didn t really like the pillows because I prefer feathered ones and not so bulky but the staff were so nice I didn t want to mention it, I liked the hotel in general the staff foyer bar area The bedroom bathroom perfect 
24352,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Greeting on arrival was excellent We were early and our room wasn t ready so we were upgraded to a King sized room The room was overlooking the garden I always stay in this area of London but my first time to stay in Crowne Plaza The hotel is right beside the tube station The hotel staff are very friendly and room facilities are excellent I won t be returning to London until October but I know where I will be staying 
24353,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Nothing , Liked everything including the food Umami Asian restaurant attached to the hotel Even had a 50 off offer on which was great Staff were so helpful friendly cleanliness was excellent Room lovely warm Gloucester Rd tube station is literally round the corner Lots of cafes restaurants to suit all tastes budgets Cannot fault 
24354,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, I think the price can be lowered also it wouild be good to have at least 1 or 2 more F n B outlets very restricted in terms of variety also i think the service could be improved for example no newspaper was delivered to me nor did i feel special being there i was just another guest , i liked the friendly staff and the daily supply of good fresh apples and water also the computers for guest use and the overall ambience the location is what really did it for me 
24355,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, A small stuffy room which didn t match the description deluxe or the price in our opinion To get to the 2nd bed required a sideways shuffle between the end of the beds and the desk There wasn t room to have the chair at the desk and you couldn t open the mini bar because the door was blocked by the bed The room didn t match the website photographs which show a suitable gap at the end of the bed We paid 40 to have an extra person in the room but there wasn t an extra set of towels extra coffee etc There was one biscuit packet and one chocolate bar between 3 of us which seemed a bit mean especially for a deluxe room Luckily we were able to settle who had what amicably We weren t inclined to use the bar lounge so cannot comment on the quality of these areas The receptionist was efficient but unsympathetic Her advise was to ask for a larger room on booking not something we would have thought necessary beforehand and we won t be booking again , The beds were comfortable The hotel was generally clean and bright Several of the concierges evening managers were friendly and helpful Extra tea bags and milks were supplied on request Our bags were stored while we waited for a room and after check out 
24356,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, We didn t think the breakfast was really great esp for the price , The rooms were really clean and had great beds bedding bathrooms The hotel was in a perfect location next to the Underground Starbucks a grocery store several restaurants even the same underground as the Heathrow airport 
24357,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, All perfect , Fabulous Club Lounge well worth paying the little bit extra for this facility Large room massive bed very comfy We were thrilled to return from a walk to discover a complimentary bottle of wine and a box of chocs for our wedding anniversary These little touches make the hotel special 
24358,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The aircon wasn t very effective and even though it was cold outside we struggled to get the room to cool down enough , We needed a place to stay for the night close to the Albert Hall The room was well appointed with generous toiletries and towels and a super king size bed Great value for money and a good experience 
24359,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Hotel was great and we appreciated the extra little touches like the chocolate bar in our room and lavender scented pillow spray Also only 5 10 min walk from V A Albert Hall Science Museum etc Nice friendly pub only a short walk away called The GloucesterArms and a lovely Itallian restaurant opposite the pub called Da Mario serving good food at sensible prices We will definitely return 
24360,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Very difficult one as liked everything but I asked for a pot of tea at breakfast as the big pot with tea in was luke warm Not a problem pot of tea was brought , The little touches gorgeous apples in reception pillow spray for calm sleep very clean bathroom lots of towels nothing missing and yummy chocolate cake 
24361,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Certainly the room was large enough to accommodate a bit more wardrobe space , Beds extra large lovely garden area Quiet well sized room good restaurant Modern decor Great area 
24362,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Not all the staff were welcoming, The room overlooked the garden at the back and was quiet 2 queen beds were v comfortable and the reception staff gave us an early check in which was Sio appreciated after arriving from Australia Great breakfast and location near a tube station

24364,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The room service was not excellent They don t change the soap And the cafe table was hidden in the closet Not practical location for the cafe , Almost everything Location Free and fast wifi hospitality comfortable

24368,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, A pint of soda water in the bar was over 4 Almost the same price as a pint of beer The bed was a bit too hard for my preference end the duvet was a bit small for the bed , Nice little touches such as champagne and chocolates for our special occasion plus a nice selection of toiletries and complimentary water tea and coffee in the room Breakfast was fresh and there was a good selection 
24369,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, There were two generous pillows person could have done with a thinner one No slip resistant bath mat which for an older less flexible person is essential when exiting the bath shower , The staff were welcoming and efficient the restaurant was excellent both food and staff The room was spacious and well equipped Location was brilliant and I appreciated the parking availability at the sister hotel around the corner 
24370,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, You could have a small ramp at the front entrance which would make it easier to pull up heavy luggages instead of carrying it up that small flight of stairs , It was a comfortable stay and great location The staff at the Amami restaurant were very helpful with good suggestions for the food selection on their menu Very good service for a weary traveler like me 
24371,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Crap view from the window but wouldn t put us off returning , We enjoyed our stay and were happy with everything The toiletries and hairdryer were very useful and the staff were friendly We would definitely stay again 
24372,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Typical of London our room was small Maybe it saved space but there was only bed side lighting on one side of the double bed The grout in the bathroom looked mouldy in places Almost felt like getting stuck into it with the White King and and a tooth brush , The location close to the Gloucester Rd tube station on the Picadilly line for ease of access to Heathrow is very convenient Also lots of casual eateries close by Nice foyer and public areas We got a good early bird pay in advance rate 
24373,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Nothing to say , The hotel location was perfect The room was big perfectly clean very agreable and confortable In general de hotel is just perfect I also liked that the hotel looks new and clean and it was not very big 
24374,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Not the comfiest bed and we do like a nice duvet It got a little warm overnight and the heating air con blower was a little load Shut it off and opened the window The garden view from the first floor was actually of a flat roof but the church the other side was nice , Location just around the corner from Gloucester Road tube and quite a few shops pubs and restaurants was good and on the 74 bus route to Marble Arch Easy walking distance to the Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens Good serve yourself breakfast but wish I d ordered the eggs benedict 
24375,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, In room 332 the heating system was not working and the receptionist suggested bringing in a portable heater Of course I asked them to change the room which they did only after I insisted a lot I checked in at about 4 pm and we moved at 8 30 pm In the meantime we had to endure the cold in the room Not to mention the fact that room 332 is very small and I am not convinced even now that it was a Deluxe room with two twin bes which I had paid for I cannot explain to myself why the lady at the recepiton did not want to move us to another room there were obviouy other rooms available as it turned out in the end No slippers or gowns provided so take care and bring some from home ,No Positive
24376,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, the executive lounge was not worth the additional money paid Service charge on all bar bills when exorbitant prices already being charged for the drinks , Pleasant and helpful staff

24382,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, We stayed in 2 different rooms The a c is not working peopeely in both rooms and it s loud We realised that the rooms are cold and they gave us a heater It was kind but what if everyone was cold and there was no spare heater , additional to my previous comment staff is great althoughe we always left the room around 2 oclock housekeeping cleaned our room and provided new towels everyday also the receptionists are very kind they always found a solution to our needs If you forget something such as tooth brush flip flops they provide that for free 2 bootles of water is free in the room 
24383,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Shower pressure could have been a bit more powerful for my liking , Big room with 2 large double beds and modern bathroom Nice breakfast choice including cooked items and pastries etc Staff really friendly and helpful Good freebies such as water bottles in the room usual tea and coffee etc and apples in reception Looked like it had a nice bar and garden area if the weather had been warmer to sit out Excellent location near Gloucester Road tube station and only a 10 15 minute walk to South Kensington Plenty of restaurants nearby Would stay here again next time we come to London 
24384,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Had a few heating issues with the room and the temperature wasn t right Was too cold so we called someone to come and fix it which still didn t solve the problem unfortunately Also breakfast was fairly limited for a 4 star hotel, Location is brilliant and staff are so so friendly Lovely quiet room 
24385,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Nothing at all , Everything about the Hotel is good We stayed for 5 nights in December and it was an excellent stay Right across the hotel is the station so easy commuting You can also take leisure walks to Harrods which is walk able Some of the museums were again close by Several Restaurants are near to this hotel Lovely staff and excellent place to stay Would definitely stay again
24386,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Executive Lounge only open at certain times of the day, Really comfy bed Staff were really pleasant and helpful Location was good for The Royal Albert Hall 
24387,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The room is already hot enough without the a c we were fine even as a Mediterranean but if you feel colder than a normal person the air coming from the a c was cold in the both rooms and it works so loud Breakfast we paid for the breakfast but regret that we already paid There are other restaurants and cafes just near the hotel you can have a better breakfast at a cheaper price , Great location with a few steps away from underground and 10 mins away from the centre At night at 4 am taxi costs 16 pounds from leicester square to the hotel Staff they made everything to make us comfortable We told them to change our room to the back side of the hotel since the front side facing to the road can be a bit noisy And the reception sent a guy to move all our stuff and back side was so silent And even we forgot to hang please clean my room thing we found our room tidied up Thanks we loved the two double beds they were comfortable And huge tv and mirror is nice Rooms are big enough Overall we loved it and extended our stay and we hope also in the following days everything will be fine Full experience will be provided at the end of our stay in a seperate comment Gym is okay but enough for the one who does not want to give a break even in the holidays 
24388,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Big room comfortable beds nice extra touches in room like free water pillow spray and chocolate bar Breakfast good choice could choose off buffet and food cooked to order Definitely will be using again when in London
24389,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Expensive, Friendly helpful staff ideally placed and with walking distance of Royal Albert Hall Fantastic Breakfast Close to Gloucester Road Tube station
24390,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, We made our reservation at booking com We did not take a prepaid rate so that we could have flexibility and had full cancellation We were booked for an 8 day stay Because the room was so small we changed our plans and decided to check out after a few days The hotel charged us an extra 50 GBP fee to check out This fee was not mentioned in the booking com terms and conditions We were surprised as we have never paid at other hotels to check out earlier We were fine to pay for the days we stayed but felt the extra fee was no outlined anywhere and was unfair We should pay only for the days we stayed , Great location and great staff Good breakfast 
24391,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Nothing to mention, Friendy staff Big and cozy room Nice and rich breakfast Hotel is located on area close and in walking distance to the shopping area 
24392,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, There was no desk in the room and the wardrobe was so small and occupied by the tea coffee set so little room for our cloths and other things , I liked the room that was spacious with two double bed and the location and the breakfast 
24393,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, We arrived at 9am and they were not prepared to let is in until 2pm even though we had requested for an early checkin at the time of booking They said the rooms are vacated but our room service takes time to orepare the room Which could ve been managed easier by them to allow us in at least by noon , The location is fabulous one min walk to the tube station Facilities were good too for a business stay though The staff were reasonably good but not beyond expectations I would say And the rates were fair for a reputable hotel 
24394,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Very poor tea and coffee at breakfast No coat hooks in the room Weak shower, Friendly and helpful staff Big and comfortable beds Good quality cooked breakfast
24395,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Club lounge facilities i e free food drinks were excellent great value if you book a club room Biggest most comfy bed I have stayed in any UK hotel Hotel rear garden is a rare real little gem

24399,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The Crowne Palaza at Kensington was beautiful The cleanliness of the room was awesome just couldn t fault it We didn t have much of a view but we neither did we have much time to have stood and looked anyway 
24400,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Unfortunately our room was next to lift and as I am a light sleeper it was a bit annoying although in general there was little noise from other guests , The location for us was excellent within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go The room was clean spacious and at the back of the hotel so potentially quiet The complimentary items were all of good quality 
24401,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Lack of staff at breakfast meant slow poor service also the breakfast lacked cooked vegetables so there was only eggs to go with bacon nothing else, Location cleanliness
24402,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, Superb location rooms very clean lovely garden at back good breakfast However rooms are cramped we had the family room and it is very expensive for the space

24404,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Unfortunately the WIFI was not working well The bathroom is designed in a way that one can t really put make up on the mirror is too far , Very clean room spacious minimal pleasing design Coffee and tea maker in room and in general attention to details 
24405,Crowne Plaza London Kensington,No Negative, The location is excellent you can walk take the tube bus or cab to so many interesting parts of London with ease The area has good bars and restaurants but even in such a busy area the hotel is calm and quiet 
24406,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The mattress was a little hard for our taste and they should include a top sheet on the bed It was either the duvet or nothing But of course we did not ask for one either which if we had I am sure they would have provided one We loved our room and bathroom though , We loved the concierge lounge to relax in after walking all day Breakfasts were delicious and the bar at night had a great ambiance Everyone was very helpful and polite One reason we picked this hotel was because it was one of the few with an outdoor terrace to enjoy The September weather was beautiful so it was perfect 
24407,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, The Club facilities were extremely poor Food provided in club lounge was very basic and limited in veriety Only one type of beer which was not even cold The coffee machine was closed down after 9 30 PM On departure my credit card was overcharged from the agreed amount in my booking com confirmation , location was adequate 
24408,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, Lack of information at the receptionist which took time to find the name and reservation although I gave her copy of the reservation but he didn t look on and thank god that I found other copy to save breakfast money although I made my reservation 4 months ahead I fund that the room rate on the same date reservation cheaper nd if you buy voucher for break fast at reception on arrival breakfast cost is 15 pound only what a hell of policy , 1 I asked for a meeting with lady which is the gm never met she sent me her assistant is she the prime minister of Italy 2 I booked with breakfast and the receptions when I checked informed no break fast for you I thought that I didn t do it I paid for the breakfast as much as 17 5 pond for next day then I found the confirmed reservation it was clear that I paid 17 75 pound per person x 2 for 5 days I took it to them then they said no its with breakfast they made payment back through American Express 
24409,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, In the family room The double bed is not really double if you know what i mean Two adults would have difficulties in sleeping comfortabley, Great location and clean room very modern and well maintained The staff are amazing and the room view is breathtaking Cool AC and comfy beds Its near waitros and glucster station and many coffe shops and resturants are close by also the kinsengton garden is five minutes walking distance
24410,Crowne Plaza London Kensington, We were mostly concerned with cleanliness and hygiene but we found a bit disappointing this time as we found the same piece of rubbish lying in the bathroom after 2 days , The breakfast is most accommodating with a wide selection of cuisines The Concierge proves to be helpful and functional We were glad to meet the same Italian man this time as he is always cheerful and helpful
