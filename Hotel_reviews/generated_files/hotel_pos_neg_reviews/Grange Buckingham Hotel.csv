169744,Grange Buckingham Hotel, From the street to the room we had to open 6 doors plus an elevator ride We understand they are fire doors but is pretty annoying sometimes , Location is awesome Staff is small but corteous and helpful Bedroom is cozy and we had amazing rest 
169745,Grange Buckingham Hotel, Tiny bathroom with very high sided bath and fixed head shower ideal for a six footer but not for someone much shorter, Less than a five minute walk to the British Museum and an easy walk to Leicester Square and the theatre district Fridge tiny microwave and sink in room 
169746,Grange Buckingham Hotel, Confusion at checkout which was at 5 30 a m Couldn t print out an invoice and did not send me the invoice by e mail as promised However all was corrected later and the staff was generally very good , Tidy great location charming old building The hotel is around the corner from the British Museum and down the block from Russell Square 
169747,Grange Buckingham Hotel, Curtains needed fixing one set was hanging off , Friendly staff Location Having a fridge in the room It s familiar we always stay there Local parks
169748,Grange Buckingham Hotel, The check in process was terrible We arrived at approximately 3 30 check in after 2pm is listed on the confirmation form and were told that we had to wait more than 1 2 hour before our room would be ready Also I would not consider this to be a 4 star hotel Perhaps 3 Finally the website indicates that Grange Buckingham serves breakfast daily for all its hotel residents in the breakfast room on the Ground Floor You can choose from a variety of breakfast items including both continental and cooked breakfast selections I assumed that the breakfast was included in the price of the room as no extra costs are mentioned Terrible to misinform potential guests , The location was perfect and the neighbourhood was fairly quiet and relaxed Excellent proximity to the British Museum and several Tube stations
