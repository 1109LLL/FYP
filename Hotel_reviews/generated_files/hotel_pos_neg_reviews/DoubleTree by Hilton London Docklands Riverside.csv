124658,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing was all good, Everything from the warm welcome we got at reception a little gift on arrival of warm cookies and a bottle or called water great way to say hello hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff are great too the room was amazing lovely view of the river and loved the complimentary boat for the river crossing would 100 stay here again
124659,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Drinks were a bit pricey but probably normal price for London and the bathroom was a bit on the small side for my liking , All of it staff were fantastic got a car parking space which is a bonus as it is first come first served room was clean and we had a lot of room in the room itself Shower in bathroom was fab nice to have a decent shower in a hotel and the food was amazing Would recommend the vouchers by a dinning voucher for 25 and get 5 free 
124660,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom ridiculously small could barely use toilet and have door closed Using garage was challenging as entry cards didn t work so lots of trips to and from reception, Service at dinner was excellent
124661,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and informative went above and beyond our expectations Was able to check in earlier then stated which was brilliant The free unlimited ferry ride back and forth was a brilliant perk 
124662,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wasn t made clear how easy it was to get the C10 bus directly to the property from Canada Water so we had a very expensive taxi that took us to the wrong Hilton through the Rotherhithe tunnel , The deluxe rooms overlooking the Thames have great views You can also open the windows properly so the room stays cool and fresh Ferry great for getting across to the City and the restaurants 
124663,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, unable to get the room i wanted river view with outside balcony, love the hotel stayed before just didnt get the room i was expecting but the staff did try to amend it limited amount of river view rooms with access to outside balcony
124664,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Having to queue at restaurant for breakfast, Friendly and helpful staff Comfort Accessibility Facilities Perfect location for use of public transport including small ferry to Canary Wharf and back to hotel
124665,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Found room cheaper still no refund through booking com one staff member told me there was no parking on site Bathroom could have been cleaner , Location and ferry great 
124666,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Unfortunately during my stay I got food poisoning from the hotels restaurant When mentioned to staff they were not very concerned This spoilt my stay , Good facilities and lovely spot rooms were spot on On arrival we were upgraded to a suite 
124667,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our door did not lock on its own and we only realised when we were leaving our room to catch the boat Had to ring reception and it took them 25 minutes to send someone up to fix it We had to wait in the room as didn t want to leave it unlocked with valuables in it This meant we missed the boat over the river and also took about 45 minutes out of our day when we wanted to get into London centre for our weekend away , Breakfast was cooked well with a lot of choice to cater for everybody Rooms were clean 
124668,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The whole experience The hotel is over priced for what it is it s not luxury it s a standard hotel with standard rooms and I paid 250 a night for the best room and the room was pathetic , The food was nice but expensive 
124669,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, At times the lobby was very crowded Restaurant Breakfast was nice but also very busy Navigating the hallways and lifts was a bit confusing wouldn t want to be a little tipsy Location is a bit out of the way but useful for where we needed to be , Breakfast buffet was amazing Room was decent size clean quiet and well laid out View was lovely Ferry was very helpful Staff was very helpful 
124670,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Couldn t use the dockside bar past 10pm Was told could not make any cocktails as they had been busy that week had no ingredients left Main bar was cramped when we returned to hotel after our meal ended up finishing the night earlier than planned headed to our room a little disappointing to say the least , Lovely room with great featured bathroom abit of a let down old fashioned Breakfast excellent huge choice 
124671,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The cookie received on arrival The staff were really friendly and helpful One particular bar staff was very friendly and chatty didn t get his name as we met in the lift 
124672,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wifi could be a little hit and miss may have just been my phone though as partner appeared to have no issues , Loved the trip away Very comfy bed good sized room and bathroom lovely view and had a small balcony Free unlimited pass on the ferry to get into Canary Wharf Great variety of food in the buffet breakfast Warm cookie on arrival Overall great stay at the hotel 
124673,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had no windows to open making the room exceptionally hot and was expecting a lovely view of the Thames which we didn t have , The staff were welcoming room was lovely and breakfast was very good 
124674,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It was a littl further out than we thought it would but other than that all good , Staff were efficient views of the river lovely comfortable room with small balcony 
124675,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The Restaurant had run out of key ingredient from their limited menu The waitress lied about the sauce on the brisket and the customer service right up to duty manager was deplorable and insulting Having stayed in other DoubleTrees and The Hiltonsurrounding I was horrified The room was not made up and after some hours trying to locate anyone to help I was told I would have to stand there or it would not be done The step into the bathroom has a sign but is still missable owing to the tiling , We were thankful the Blacksmith was to hand The hosts and hospitality should train those at The Hotel They were so good we returned for a family mealife later in the week 
124676,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booking com advertised a room with a view across the Thames I did not get one My view was a brick wall , The helpfulness and courtesy of the staff How quiet it was The ferry ticket and cookies was a nice touch 
124677,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The way the breakfast was it was unorganised it was really busy and only one chef cooking and everyone was complaining as they wasn t everything out for breakfast also the sausages wasn t cooked properly they was pink, The views and that it was based on the river the location was lovely and that you could get a ferry from the hotel
124678,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Toilet seat was broken in our room which was surprisingly annoying Also we were shown to a table for breakfast went up to get a drink then another couple were also shown to our table which was by the window I had moved things around on the table to try and indicate it was taken however we did not want a scene as it appeared the other couple of ladies did so we moved not very proffessional made it quite uncomfortable , Good location for the Olympic Stadium
124679,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Parking was a nightmare you have to phone a number when you got to the car park so they could lift the barrier but no answer so i rang the hotels reception to be told i had to walk up to reception as noone would answer the number that was left Breakfast was a bit of a sham everything lovely once you finally got it but seemed to be chasing staff constantly to get cutlery juice jams ,No Positive
124680,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The lamp in our room didnt work The satellite cable used to go off and the tv was displayed with no source After change of sheets on our second day we returned to tea coffee stained sheets Staff make you wait a long time even if they don t have any customers to deal with Especially the ones that help around the kitchen Found a fried egg with a hair on it right infront of the chef and she failed to detect it Completely put me off breakfast that day The underground car park seemed very risky as no sufficient lighting also had some young teens running in past midnight which concerned me and my wife For 660 3 night stay I d expect a lot more Compared to 740 i paid for flights and accommodation to Sofitel Dubai last summer this was a 1 star experience The UK needs to renovate the shoddy buildings it s a class below the rest of the world Wouldn t recommend this hotel at all Pay a bit more for something in the city Novotel etc Location is not the best it s about 15min walk from nearest underground and 3 min ferry ride and 9min walk to Canary Wharf station The area itself feels unsafe The hotel doesn t even offer water Me and my wife would take our own bottles at breakfast as the two bottles are finished by the time we get to breakfast around 9am We had a Queen guest room which we upgraded to a better view for 20per night as the others were taken Absolute extortion Room was relatively small The bathroom was a joke The tub and tiles had limescale and the sink was very low and really small Had to wash my hands at the side of the tap because I couldn t lather them directly under it If you try to wash your face water spills everywhere They have a bar across our side of the room Apparently they had a prom night for students Loud music went on past midnight which could be easily heard through the glass like I was sleeping outside Very narrow lift and corridors , The ferry ride to Canary Wharf was complimentary for hotel guests but due to lack of other services we might as well have paid for it 
124681,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room tired TV unable to face the bed Tiny bathroom Not near public transport Small corridors, really warm welcome with cookies the boat trip to and from the hotel nice bar overlooking the river good breakfast fast check out
124682,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booking com stated we had a smoking room however when we arrived I had to go out of my way back to reception to get the room changed which they said usually costs 25 pounds, The boat ride from the hotel across the river Thames which was offered free by the hotel 
124683,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room I booked was a king deluxe and I expected a good view but was over looking the car park not the most romantic of places , Great location close to canary wharf and loved the little ferry 
124684,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The internet connection was awful and kept dropping off Paid 8 for a tuna sandwich which was very basic and was worth about 2 We had a powercut at about 10pm which was a bit of a pain , Warm cookie on check in was great 
124685,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Only thing I could pick fault with is I was hoping for a fiver view on the balcony but sadley we didn t get that You could just about see the river but it was more of a view of the court yard Not that the court yard was dirty or an eye sore or anything but would ve made the trip even better with a Canary Wharf view, Great modern hotel staff lovely and the room comfy Went for my girlfriends birthday and let them know this when I booked When we arrived we were greeted with happy birthday balloons on the bed which was a great touch We then went out round London for an hour or so and returned to 2 beautiful cheescakes strawberrys and blueberries and a bottle of wine and 2 glasses sat on the bed side cabinet with a little happy birthday note from the duty manager What an absolutely fantastic touch and they really were beautiful I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here so modern clean and comfortable and the staff and management really helped make our trip and my girlfriends birthday Will be returning 
124686,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Got in late wanted to go to bed and order room service to be told that they had stopped cooking and had run out of everything from the snack menu So ordered take away and the 5 staff on the desk were not even good enough to ring the room to tell me the delivery guy was here They would only give us one room key which was very annoying as my partner went to the bar to get drinks and I got in the bath He asked for a 2nd key and was refused which was most inconvenient Had to pay extra for wifi The bed was very tired and noisy , Good welcome with a yummy cookie Bathroom facilities excellent 
124687,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Price of the breakfast and that it wasn t included in the price for the room Too far from the attractions A long walk for the tube station, Clean rooms Friendly staff 
124688,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room service very poor it was a selection of left overs as described by a member of your staff as a result of this we had a processed meat type sandwich cobbled together and a packet of crisps grand total of which came to a staggering 17 00 where as I appreciate room service is expensive by the very nature I would expect said sandwich meal to be all singing and all dancing to coin a phrase This not being the case I would appreciate some form of recompense I shall leave this for you to determine what is fare , Breakfast
124689,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The restaurant food at night is very poor and basic and extremely over priced we expected more from a Hilton although breakfast was very nice , The location of the hotel was brilliant and the boat was amazing hotel was extremely clean and the staff where very helpful Lovely to sit outside at night and watch the Thames Lots of choice at breakfast
124690,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Better food options for room service after 11pm choice of 9 cold sandwiches All food services closed very early and there is not many options around the vicinity unless you know the area very well , Location for our purpose of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Stadium concert Travel to and from stadium was very easy
124691,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, they charged a service charge every time I went to the bar for a drink I had to ask for it to be removed It was shocking And extra 1 30 every single time I went to the bar just for service More if you were ordering more than 2 drinks ,No Positive
124692,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Comfortable and clean hotel in an interesting location It s not exactly what I would call a boutique hotel though it is large breakfast felt like an all inclusive impersonal no nice touches and there is nothing really special about it The short boat trip across to Canary Warf Pier is pleasant although you do have to factor in more time when going from A to B Sitting outside on the terrace is nice but be warned if you order 2 small bottles of water at the bar to take to your room they will cost you nearly 8 which does include an unbelievable 0 9 service charge Fortunately this was deducted from my bill when I expressed my disgust 
124693,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had a nightmare with the key cards because we was given 3 different cards on 3 separate occasions and none were working We was on the 6th floor so to keep going up and down to reception was very tiring I was calling reception and all they were doing was putting me on hold it was quite frustrating ,No Positive
124694,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When booking I chose a room with great views of the London skyline Our view was of an estate over the road When I questioned the staff at reception they said that if I had wanted a room with a view I should have contacted the hotel separately to my booking com booking Something which I couldn t have possibly known and which I suspect may be total rubbish , The hotel was in a great location and the views of Canary Wharf are fantastic 
124695,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Unhelpful staff late allocation of room which resulted in a missed dinner appointment the room should have had Sky TV it didnt the bath was rusty the tiles were stained Used the fact that i booked through Booking com that the room was not correct , Breakfast
124696,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The shift leader on the morning of the 8 7 17 during breakfast time should improve her communication skills and attitude towards customers I Had asked the receptionist to have one of the tables cleaned for breakfast and was told it would be done in five minutes The shift leader who was told to do this walked away without any communication whatsoever and l was left standing next to a dirty table for more than 15 mins until I had to look for an alternative seating place She never came back to me untill I called her after breakfast , Allocated Room no 171 The bed was comfortable the pillows were too soft and warning the step sign in the bathroom should also be out side the bathroom in case someone falls down 
124697,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was very warm and there wasn t enough tea and coffee left in the room, Close to the river and had a ferry accross to canary wharf which was free to guests 
124698,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact that in 2017 this hotel does not provide free wifi puts it right at the bottom of my list I don t want to pay 12 99 per day for wifi and 20 per day for breakfast when there are other hotels in the area that throw both in for free Also I don t want to stay in a room that has air con that has 3 levels Not very cold quiet Not very cold quite noisy Not very cold really noisy It s not cool , Bed comfy Location good for a quick ferry ride into canary wharf
124699,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very limited food available when returning from the O2 late at night Didn t like the distance from a tube station Felt the Hotel lacked refinements Carpets looked tired Hot drinks served in glasses with no handle so very difficult to hold , We loved being able to sit out by the river in the morning for coffee Liked the ferry being directly available Reception very helpful when we arrived as we were in a rush to get to the O2 Very good breakfast and comfortable bed 
124700,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The air conditioning was set at 23 degrees which we were unable to alter and was a bit warm for us , The location was excellent and views from our room fabulous Very convenient to have complimentary ferry shuttle to and from Canary Wharf which allowed easy access to all areas of the city 
124701,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, room lighting layout service slow at times tv on wall that could not be comfortably viewed from bed Balcony dirty , Breakfast Buffet fresh omeletes coffee machine friendly staff Comfy Bed
124702,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rubbish coffee sachets in room The toilet was adequate in the bathroom but if you were a little large you would find it a problem to sit on and close the door We were ok , Lovely delicious hot cookie welcome Bed very comfortable good air conditioning Excellent breakfast choice 
124703,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Called on room phone at 5am and again at 8am by somone phoning to cancel their work experience Staff were not particularly helpful and the queue at reception was slow moving ,No Positive
124704,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, A little isolated from the main areas of London because of the river and no bridge around but the ferry makes it up somehow , Former warehouse along the river converted into a lovely style hotel The room is more spacious than the average of London The bed was very comfy The hotels give a pass for the ferry crossing the river to Canary Wharf which is the easiest access to most areas on the city 
124705,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Quicker room service had to make a second request for additional pillows when we checked in we were told breakfast was included but when we went down to breakfast it wasn t so that was a bit embarrassing, It was the most comfortable bed we have slept in ever Welcome biscuits Getting there by boat location of the bar having a balcony and a door that opened out onto the balcony
124706,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, We didn t have coffee at the hotel However upon arrival we were visibly soaking wet having walked through torrential rain yet weren t even offered a paper towel to dry off 
124707,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The air con was not working properly in our room we had to leave all windows and balcony door open over night cause it was pretty warm otherwise, The free ferry to Canary wharf the very comfortable bed the view from the balcony excellent breakfast friendly and attentive staff
124708,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No fan so was warmer than I would have liked Breakfast at almost 20 for a full English per person a rather hefty additional cost found the bar staff quite rude and disinterested, Lovely room comfortable bed large to
124709,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, First night we stayed on the ground floor and got 5 hours sleep because of the noise of staff at the smoking shelter and a skip being changed at 7 30 am The staff were very rude and not helpful at all with bags and the chafing of room, Nothing 
124710,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel was very busy At breakfast the restaurant was packed noisy and not well laid out for finding the food Poor bread selection In our double room the duvet was too heavy There was only one bedside table In my opinion our room should have been a single room as there was not enough room for a double bed I wish Premier Inn would open a hotel nearby they are far superior and much better value for money , The ferry boat is an asset 
124711,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The taxi service the hotel uses was very poor We booked him to take us to a show which we arrived 35 mins late for and not only that but we had to get our own navigation out on our phones to get him there after a 1 hour transport from the hotel Felt like the gentleman was deliberately driving wrong to get more money our of the journey wouldn t recommend this at all to anyone wishing to get a taxi into the city from here We called a black Cab on the next trip and got where we needed again centre of London for less than the hotel taxi Even the black taxi cabs on the way back cost cheaper to book This was the only upsetting part of this trip , Views at night and free boat to get across the river
124712,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We arrived at 16 45 check in was 15 00 however our room was not ready We had very little time to check in and set off again therefore we had to make do with a temporary room which we had little choice but to accept as we were running a bit late , Good location and Asha on reception was very welcoming and provided useful information
124713,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was very hot and the Aircon didn t work There wasn t any bottled water in the room either let alone a fridge mini bar , Lovely location overlooking the Thames
124714,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Waiting 45 minutes to be seat at breakfast Then waiting 20 minutes in a que for your full English breakfast and letting what s on your plate already getting cold Clean the rooms before new guests go in Make sure the tv works Have clear signs to show keep quiet after dark Taxi at 1 and 3pm in the car park honking horn is not good, Complementary ferry crossing
124715,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The que to be seated for breakfast took a little while likewise waiting at the bar to be served took a while , Loved that breakfast was unlimited with a great range to choose from The ferry pass was an added convenience and the warm cookies on arrival were a lovely touch 
124716,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Rooms were quirky loved the windows with the shutters rather than curtains Outside seating areas were great Food was lovely Cookies on arrival were amazing The free ferry across to Canary Wharf is fantastic Great stay will hopefully be back again 
124717,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff in the restaurant specifically at breakfast were entirely unhelpful and in more than one occasion rude Breakfast service on the day was poorly managed and despite the lady chef who was a diamond in the rough was frankly awful particularly as paying 200 a night was not close to value for money Extremely disappointing Breakfast experience 0 out 10 , Great location staff on arrival and checkout were extremely pleasant and helpful 
124718,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, TV not watchable from Bed in a very awkward position Bathroom and bedroom very small and we had a king deluxe room not even enough room for two people in bathroom Had a room right next to the lift so heard guests in and out all night No fridge in room to store drinks and London was baking this week , Warm cookies on arrival 
124719,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Ordered room service late one evening and there was no food left although the guy who spoke to me ended up finding a sandwich which had just gone out of date I was starving so took it and he threw in brownies too free of charge , Staff here are amazing and so helpful Room was beautiful and will definitely be coming back
124720,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Birthday tray was organized Wasn t ready and I had to call from the room to ask where it arrived 4hours late The restaurant was booked for outside to enjoy the views couldn t have the table booked as the hotel had booked a private function If i had know I would have gone somewhere else No water available Paid for breakfast for my wife and they were supposed to pass the ticket under the door This never happened so my wife never got breakfast which was paid for Spent 15minutes calling reception until someone answered to complain that we could not sleep as the music from the function was vibrating through the room , Nothing
124721,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Air conditioning wasnt working so room was unbearable and didnt get any sleep throughout the night There was no fans that could be provided either Got discounted rate but still paid 150 for one night stay in a room that we didnt get any sleep in due to the heat , Location was great
124722,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The price of this hotel for one night was very expensive and when talking to other visitors at the hotel we found that we paid twice as much as they did and they had a two night stay we only had one, I liked the hotel in general
124723,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel was absolutely spotless the room was very spacious and up to date I would recommend this hotel to anyone , The hotel was lovely and the staff where very pleasant and friendly 
124724,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very poor quality of accomodation for amount paid for stay Property very dated and requires an update No mini fridge in room which I would have expected for amount paid for stay Also very poor view room overlooked a car park , Comfortable bed
124725,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was a lot smaller then a delux queen room should be I ve Been to budget hotels with a room that size and half the price balcony barely had a river view, Balcony was ok
124726,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The air con did not go below 26 which on a hot day is a nightmare someone said they would look at it but never showed up we saw them giving out fans but they apparently ran our The door which opened to the outside would not lock there was a barrier outside and a small chain inside but anyone could have climbed over and bashed the door open The car park was full so they sent us to one down the road which you could exit on foot right near the hotel but when you had to return to it with your bags you couldn t get back through those doors so you had to walk down the road and then basically all the way back on yourself to the hotel side underground It was narrow and difficult to manoeuvre in a big car and they still charge 16 not 12 like it says on some sites for the privilege Don t stay here if you want to be close to city centre either a long bus ride to the nearest tube stop or ferry ride over to Canary Wharf with a walk to the tube We had a drink in the bar only to find inflated prices and a discretionary 12 5 service charge we went to the bar for our drinks but would have paid the same if we d just sat down and got someone to serve us We found a dirty coffee cup next to our bed though I have to say generally the room was clean and tidy small but fit for purpose I personally wouldn t stay here again mainly because I didn t find it very convenient for getting to or getting around , The outside restaurant bar area is nice to look over the water towards Canary Wharf The communal areas grounds are well looked after and very welcoming Staff are very friendly even if they do forget to come and see you when promised 
124727,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We did the reservation via booking com and we had to wait 30min to check in as the reservation wasn t in the system It was a 30C day and we got a roof room with a poor functioning AC very noisy and didn t cool the room at all Overall the stay wasn t brilliant,No Positive
124728,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Air con in room could be better Also nobody answered when calling for room service numerous times , Location and view were amazing Modern look Cookies on arrival are a lovely touch 
124729,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was not at all as depicted by the images it looked wonderful on the pictures river view wide ground to ceiling French doors balcony open and airy reality was a cell with a port hole that would not stay open unless propped with a pen the night was for my husbands birthday linked to seeing Guns and Roses and so was a treat room service Did not answer on three occasions we rang reception who said they would pass on our message and room service would revert to us this did not happen the price of overnight parking was charged at 16 but on booking com stated 12 this was reviewed and Amended I was upset and embarrassed that the special occasion was ruined by poor description of room as I would not have booked if it had been described as it truly was and other services on offer were not actually provided the trip had been planned for six months and turned out not to be the perfect Experience that I had wished for my husband I felt let down by false advertising, Cleanliness
124730,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was a little dated and located over the front reception where cars and buses were dropping and collecting pasengers , Facilities location Breakfast all very good Staff helpful and courteous 
124731,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room s are small for a deluxe The layout of the room isn t great Mirror in a dark corner with no light Drinks at the bar very expensive 26 for two drinks , Rooms were clean staff friendly 
124732,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Explain how the parking works as we ended up going through the driving opening when picking up the car as couldn t find a pedestrian walk way, The staffs approach In delivering the best service we ve ever had and to make our stay the best we ve ever had in the uk Thank you so much 
124733,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The ferry was excellent staff really nice The terrace was nice to sit out on to relax and have a drink We had afternoon tea on the Friday which was excellent and all the staff were lovely at breakfast especially Sandra who made me my omlette
124734,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Parking we had paid for it and could only park in the farthest car park away which was down the road there was no easy access to and from it , The ferry they provided to get to the other side where you could get to canary warf
124735,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The reception staff are very cold unwelcoming really think they are superior to everyone The view was meant to be a city view If looking at the back of the hotel a car park building site is meant to be city Booking com you really need to change your wording The arrangements to get to the hotel also need to be clear If I had known I could travel by tube then jump on a boat to take me to Canary Wharf to then catch the regular ferry over to the hotel it would have saved me walking in what I class as very dodgy areas , Food was excellent both the breakfast evening meal The restaurant staff were extremely helpful polite friendly Especially Dinos Francis The bed was so comfy George on reception was very helpful polite Shame about the other reception staff If it wasn t for the food bed restaurant staff I would never step foot in the hotel again It is only those points that made me give it a reasonable review 
124736,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The attention to detail we have appreciated at lower star Hilton hotels was missing on this occasion and we felt there was a complacency that the accommodation was enough on its own A suite for 2 with no bathrobes or slippers a mean amount of toiletries and tea facilities which barely lasted the duration of the stay no virgin cocktails hairs in the bath the tv not working properly and showing other guests details these were the irritating things that detracted from our luxury experience There is also a tendency to over reliance on free cookies which were offered as a panacea to all no substitute for a bathrobe On a positive note we were offered extra towels but this was after a 2 hour wait and 3 phonecalls , The hotel is in an amazing location with a private return ferry service from Canary Wharf which makes you feel incredibly special The converted building is high end and certainly luxurious with stunning views Staff are pleasant Breakfast was excellent and plentiful 
124737,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, You can t improve perfection , The bed was super comfy and the pillows But more to the point I must mention Sandra Her personality shines and she is a great asset to The Hilton hotel She cooks the best omelettes in the world She makes them just soft and fluffy enough without any raw parts Hilton is lucky to have her Look after her she is an asset to you Also there was a young man Italian who served us at reception He was so demure and a perfect gentleman I don t know where you get your staff from and how you train them but they are the greatest asset to you It doesn t matter how beautiful your hotel is and how much money you have spent if the staff do not reflect it in their personalities I didn t want to leave 
124738,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room allocated was rear of building on ground floor and dated so I upgraded, I changed rooms from basic standard ground floor dated room to a king de luxe second floor Paid upgrade
124739,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom was quite small in that you had to shut the door to sit on the toilet but who needs a big bathroom , Location staff accessibility quiet and view
124740,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The bed was really comfy the breakfast was really nice but for me the location was fantastic we were heading to the O2 and it was just so easy would definitely stay there again
124741,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast was awful Queuing to get in and wait was unacceptable The food was hard and warm not hot because it was sitting siting fir us The tables weren t clean or wiped or tidied away on time Really disappointed, I liked the old brick building but unfortunately we didn t get that sort of room that was advertised
124742,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No spa or pool Something for the hotel to consider getting , Very welcoming friendly staff who gave us cookies upon check in clean good location with complimentary ferry taxi then only a short walk to the tube shops and restaurants close by the hotel had a lovely breakfast choice something for everyone rooms were perfect as had everything you could need Park over the road if you have little ones Parking which is of good price We had a great view from our room too x 
124743,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hard beds Rubbish wifi, Location was stunning Staff were all really lovely friendly and helpful Breakfast outstanding Cod with risotto dinner was outstanding 
124744,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location is a little off Beautiful but off The nearest stations Canary Wharf and Canada water are not that close to the hotel In the room we stayed the wifi was just not working for the full trip On booking com it said that we had a city view but that was just a view to a parkinglot , The old monumental building is beautiful Location next to the river has a lot of romance to it The breakfast is good The staff is very helpfull and friendly 
124745,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was a lot smaller than expected didn t have a river view as requested and wasn t like the pictures , Staff were lovely and the head chef was fantastic
124746,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Waited nearly 1 hour for the ferry on Saturday night as ferry staff having a break and not working to the published timetable Bit of a pain with young kids , Staff went the extra mile for us Providing treats for our daughter s birthday Fab breakfast 
124747,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing, Check in very good nice bonus of warm cookie Ferry service great Excellent service in the restaurant staff very friendly and professional but make you feel like you are getting a personal service 
124748,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, We were upgraded to a king size suite The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in the breakfast was superb a thoroughly enjoyable stay Thank you
124749,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing it s excellent, This hotel is amazing the staff are the best the rooms are fantastic brilliant location no need for the tube just take the boat everywhere the beds are soooo comfortable and a warm cookie on arrival it really is excellent I would recommend to anyone and everyone going to definitely come back wouldn t go anywhere else now 
124750,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Air coon and the room temperature was difficult to adjust , Breakfast is worth it all Staff and place with the view and the bar is just perfect The staff most of them is great The food is good
124751,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, there was nothing I didn t like except the lighting was abit poor could ve done with a light outside the bathroom and more mirrors in the room , The complimentary cookies were the best I personally love staying in places with views and the view was beautiful and the balcony 
124752,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were in a room with a sloped Roof and our window looked directly into another guest room , The staff are super helpful and the welcome Cookie was really good The bar and outside Areas are also really nice 
124753,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, This has been the worst hotel experience of my life The room was small my bed was under a slanted roof only had blind windows the curtains didn t keep the light out and the airconditioning next to my bed was extremely noisy even in OFF mode Even earplugs could not resolve this All this for 263 euro night And under the Hilton brand Hotel not reachable by tube ,No Positive
124754,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the bathroom was just a tad dated and something was rusty in the shower, The chef was really friendly and accommodating and made my eggs to order All of the staff was really nice 
124755,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Tricky to get to by tube which was stressful after a long train journey Bus was easier but there was no mention of the bus on their website we found out ourselves We arrived in the room and there was only 1 teabag and the shower gel shampoo etc wasn t replaced on day 2 Clean room but it s the extra bits that make a difference , The bed was amazing so comfy 
124756,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, when booking stated executive lounge access when arrived we were told that it wasnt included and not available in this hotel asked for room close to family that were also in hotel this was not accommodated either, clean room good choice for breakfast
124757,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location is a bit far from city center Free wifi is only available for members, I could hear the water flow and feel peace by the river view and the bed is comfortable It s quiet at night
124758,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only thing we missed was a vending machine We arrived back from a concert and had to rush to get the last ferry back to the hotel There was nowhere after 11pm to get a drink and snack to take back to the room A vending machine would be ideal there was one for toothpaste razors etc , The staff were very friendly helpful and efficient Offered an upgrade on a room so we could check in early Cookies on arrival Fantastic spread of everything you could wish for at breakfast Comfy bed and pleasant room Lovely views of London Very good value for money
124759,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to inform reception that the state of our bathroom was not acceptable when we arrived They were very apologetic and had it cleaned for us Offered a discount The amount of time it took to get a drink from the bar more staff needed , Staff very friendly and helpful 
124760,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Drink and food prices, Fab breakfast Great room Comfy bed Clean throughout Great location with river taxi there Recommend Would stay there again
124761,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were up in top rooms very hot and air conditioning didnt work plus double bed was against wall so access was a pain Changed room and much morw friendly room but again air con no good, Easy access to travel Free boat across river to access transport routes
124762,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was extremely hot and stuffy The fan was on when we entered but we switched it off as it seemed to be blowing hot air despite the thermostat setting , The room was clean the staff were friendly The hotel is well situated if you need to get to Canary Wharf and they give out complimentary ferry tickets 
124763,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom floor could do with having a bath mat or some grip as it was very slippy and my partner would have like some complimentary chocolates or biscuits to go with the coffee and the kettle , Really nice hotel nice staff and a cookie on arrival The boat was great but it was very difficult to get back at night The main bridge was closed and this was out of the hotels hands but keep this in mind if you re trying to get back on the night tube The bed was so comfortable It was very clean and easy to check in and out The bed had been made and we had fresh towels when we got back in We agree with the little signs in the bathroom asking for you to reuse the towels tho 
124764,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The Room 342 Apart from the view Really disappointed No sleep first night due to a faulty extraction unit in bathroom Rang reception at 0230h no answer The soap holder on bath not fit properly so fell off Ironing board broke And even ended up watching tv on my my phone as the remote didn t work by the last day Staff very polite full of apologies But for approx 300 it s not good enough for a hotel chain we have always stayed in , The views The bar terrace The ferry crossing was frequent 
124765,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Smoke alarm covered in room so dangerous told reception but little apology sent to a car park from reception without coin to gain access and room was so small breakfast was poor at first looked a great choice but eggs were not cooked as well as bacon and sausage undercooked Been to many Hilton s but this was the worst Shame as loved the location , Right on the thames
124766,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The communication between the employers could be better but that s just a small detail , We liked specially the view from our room to the river the easy access provided from the hotel with the ferry boat to the Canary Wharf and of course the breakfast was amazing 
124767,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, An excellent property living up to the Hilton standards that you would expect We had a Queen room which has a view of The Thames The staff all went above and beyond with their customer service The rooms were spotless as were all other areas within the hotel An excellent breakfast selection with waiter waitress service A nice touch was the free ferry across to the hotel from Canary Wharf included in the cost of your stay 
124768,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We was booked for a Queen room as it was my birthday the staff member upgraded us to Queen deleuxe room which was a pleasant suprise but our friend had a King room and they were both exactly the same other than our friends view was better than ours onto a tennis court Rooms could be modernized, We enjoyed the ferry crossing and the fact it was included with stay 
124769,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The long walk to the car park and then to realise the barrier was closed , Cookie on arrival You changed our room because of a loft room window curtain with no quibble Able to sit in the bar and have a very relaxing drink late in the evening A complimentary bottle of champagne The breakfast was very good value Views for excellent in the room The staff were very helpful especially the lady serving breakfast 
124770,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Only slight issue was the temperature we had a lovely view of the river however there was a slight draft and the heating on in our room wasn t able to go high enough for our liking however the bed was warm and comfy enough that it didn t hinder our evening that much , The breakfast was fresh with so much variety especially for myself and my girlfriend as vegetarians The staff were welcoming and gave water and cookies when waiting to check in and out three whole experience was perfect 
124771,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room had a few oddities There is no mini bar There is an ice bucket ice machines on the ground floor along with two glasses There are no water bottles in the room There is a kettle for tea and coffee though When we wanted drinks we of course consulted the in room menus Ah No drinks apart from tea and coffee on the menu Tap water only How absurd So if you re a fan of ice do stay here and use that very thoughtful ice bucket and maybe even take it down to the bar that the staff assured us was open till 1am but was in fact closed by 12 15 and supply your own ice for what I m sure will be very average mimosas We also booked a balcony room We got a Juliette balcony room with a view of the river But not a balcony Just an open window with a railing in front of it The bathroom was dingy and the shower head cocked to the right The hotel is a maze of corridors When I asked for directions to my room from a porter he explained that there are 6th floors everywhere and then proceeded in telling me a very Homer esque set of directions to the room It was an odyssey to be sure The location is good for exploring the lovely Greenland Docks Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf with free tickets for the ferry but that s all The rest of the hotel is a bore It s average to the extreme and missing so many key features of any good modern hotel that it really feels like stepping back in time Oh wait no There s a very modern vending machine close to the lobby But alas no drinks just condoms and toothpaste presumably for the working clientele who can t make it home because of the late meeting , The location We booked the Hilton because it was conveniently located and we were moving and needed a place to stay for a night 
124772,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom could have been slightly better designed as the door was catching the toilet while opening and closing Was a very nice bathroom other then that , Great view across the river and with a direct river boat to Canary Wharf 
124773,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Horrendous evening meal room with no window staff didn t seem to be bothered about food Completely different standard compared to previous hiltons ,No Positive
124774,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The service at the hotel was terrible It was my partners birthday and had arranged the romance package along with my own champagne on ice The romance package was just rose petals on the bed and nothing else they promised For his birthday there was the smallest chocolate thing which wasn t even worth sending up The shower was never a constant temperature It kept going hot and cold We ordered room service twice for drinks as it was a hot day and we had to call up twice to check where the drinks were and to ask for ice and glasses as they only sent bottles Would not stay here again ,No Positive
124775,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I stayed at the hotel this bank holiday weekend with my boyfriend and what a pleasure it was The warm cookies on arrival are a lovely touch A MASSIVE thank you to Melvin he was at our every beck and call even going the extra mile of getting us hair spray that we had forgot to pack 10 10 on our stay and would be happy to stay again
124776,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hotel is cramped delux room is small bathrooms are dated no mini fridge overall I expected more from a hotel like the double tree , View was great
124777,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, room far to hot and extra money charged to my card and being charged for a meal not had this being said was rectified by the duty manager, location the breakfast staff were excelkent friendly and efficient
124778,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 we paid for a river view room but got a back room so our room should have been cheaper 2 There was constantly lorries unloading under our room so we got woke up alot 3 our bed was so creaky every time we moved we woke eachother up 4 someone came into our room at 7 30am weird , The free ferry over to Canary Wharf
124779,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, COULDNT WORK THE AIR CONDITIONING AND IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT THIS WEEKEND, LOVELY ROOM OVERLOOKING THE THAMES ROOM WAS CLEAN AND WE HAD A FREE UPGRADE TO A QUEEN DELUXE WHICH HAD GREAT SPACE BED WAS COMFY VIEW WAS GREAT AND BATHROOM WAS CLEAN LOVED THE FREE FERRY ACROSS THE RIVER TO CANARY WHARF 
124780,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Firmer pillows would be nice Didn t sleep well When I go to a B B which is far cheaper you get biscuits and a variety but not here The extra effort is not there There is no ambience Reception were really good even though they initially charged 10x the price It was refunded and as an apology they they gave us free WiFi in the room and a complementary drink in the restaurant Why do they charge for WiFi in the room Also the air conditioning didn t do much conditioning i e Cooling Also noisy and no obvious airflow As for the restaurant food looked and tasted OK but is basically expensive pub food Service was awful Put at a table and then ignored Complementary drinks we argued over that one plus they charge a service charge on top Desert was awful Then they said we had to charge to the room and reception said we should have paid in the restaurant , We have stayed here before so thought we d stay again We were given a free upgrade thank you presumably because there were no standard doubles available Still not really worth the 209 for the room Everything is there the room is very clean we asked and received extra pillows and milk The view over the river is great except for the noisy party boats Free ferry tickets is good 
124781,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Like Jerry Seinfeld said I don t think you do You see you know how to take the reservation you just don t know how to hold the reservation And that s really the most important part of the reservation the holding Anybody can just take them I entered the hotel late at night to find that the room I have reverted was taken without any notification Im pretty sure they would have changed my fully if it would not have come at all ,No Positive
124782,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booking stated city view As I arrived at 19 30 I was given a view of the tennis courts and what looked like a housing estate Having called reception I was relocated into a river view as all the city views had gone Staff were very obliging but if you have a particular room type booked it should be honoured , Staff were very pleasant and helpfull 
124783,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wi fi didn t work at all in the room despite being a Hilton Honors member TV was fixed to the wall to the side of the bed impossible to watch without getting a stiff neck, ENORMOUS bed very comfy Good location well served by local buses Complementary ferry service to Canary Wharf Fantastic breakfast Chocolate chip cookie on check in 
124784,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Surprisingly well located never much of a wait for the short ferry to Canary Wharf and just hop on another boat there to Central London a perfect commute on a hot summer s day The hotel itself is great nice rooms stylish good bar restaurant and very friendly helpful staff I had one problem the air con not working in my room but they kindly upgraded me when it couldn t be immediately fixed I ll be back 
124785,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Not most convenient for access to city centre first a boat across Thames and then a 5 10 min walk to underground at Canary Wharf , Easy access and parking for car Nice location next to river Good breakfast and decent size room Good friendly staff
124786,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I loved the staff so friendly and welcoming The bonus was at breakfast where the chef personally introduced herself and we then had the breakfast manager do the same This attention to detail is impressive The boat to the hotel was a bonus and the fantastic views across the Thames to Canary Wharf Rooms were much nicer than I expected 
124787,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to move rooms as we requested water front view but we got building site Got changed to different room told it would be 20 got home and they have taken 40 not at all happy , Water front view
124788,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I could not pick a fault with anything , We had a problem with the signal to the TV Engineer did improve the signal but still not successfully in the end But called down to reception and was moved to another room with a Tv in good working order Nothing seemed to be a problem Would love to stay again Fantastic location too Views amazing 
124789,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We paid for an upgrade We have stayed here before a few years ago and chose to return to celebrate our anniversary it may have been a nice gesture to have been given this complementary or maybe to have waived the car parking charge, Loved our room
124790,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, You couldn t open the bathroom door without it getting stuck against the toilet the lay out of the room was not good Also the view from our balcony was not very nice we wanted to over look the Thames , The location of the hotel 
124791,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel was very far away from the centre which was not really well indicated on the site It takes you 1 hour at least to get into town The service of the hotel was ok not great There is no mini bar in the rooms so even a bottle of water is not available The rooms are a long way from the main bar The furniture in the rooms especially the chairs were worn out At the bar we asked for crisps but that was not available only drinks The quality of the breakfast is very poor It is a massa production Eggs and bacon were cooked long time in advance no fresh orange juice and the croissants were no good at all , The setting is nice as the hotel is in an old renovated pack house It is ashame it has all be renovated with cheap materials though 
124792,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, My only negative comment were that even though the bathrooms were clean they looked tired in need of a refurbishment, Value for money free ferry taxi pass over to Canary Wharf Free warm cookie on arrival Fab breakfast 
124793,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location Good that they provided a ferry service however I get motion sick so the journeys were not great for me We did find other routes to get where we needed to but the ferry was the quickest and easiest way , Staff were wonderful
124794,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The ferry stopped at 12 15am which means it was harder to get back when you re in canary wharf at this time, The rooms were fantastic and the staff were very polite and always wanted to help
124795,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Building project going on next door but not too noisy , The whole experience walking distance to Canada Water tube station From here could access all main attractions in London Fantastic shopping at Westfield Stratford Great location friendly staff great food with beautiful views both at night and during the day Breakfast available till 11 00 
124796,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, N A can t fault our stay , More of a holiday resort than a hotel everywhere spotless and gorgeous looking Cute little spots throughout the hotel including snug room library with fires and open terrace balcony Staff were extremely welcoming as soon as we stepped through the doors They went above and beyond and catered for every need 
124797,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room No view from any window The Bed was rickety uncomfortable The floor boards was creeky The TV was in a bad position Not enough tea coffee making facilities Not what I would of expected for the price I ve stayed in premier inn with better rooms better Beds, The hotel the car parking the staff
124798,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The payment and deposits could be explained a little better at reception when checking out But this is a very little issue , I have been to many Double Tree Hilton hotels and every single time I have left satisfied with my stay The staff at the reception make you feel very welcome and are always very enthusiastic I was at Double Tree in Docklands and I cant remember her name but a lady at reception did everything she could to accommodate to our needs she even upgraded our room And that little touch of giving us cookies as we finished checking in was nice In addition our room was lovely with the added touch of a balcony to enjoy the views of London Overall we had a lovely stay at Double Tree as per usual 
124799,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact we only stayed one night , Brilliant hotel the staff were brilliant Cesar Costa who checked us in was an absolute legend Perfect room with a view of the thames breakfast was lovely The whole hotel has a chilled feel we felt right at home Private ferry to canary wharf pier is a great way to travel Can t fault the place at all 100 will be staying here again All for the same price as a Travelodge Loved it 
124800,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact my friend got charged twice When we checked in we both payed half each for the hotel so we payed the full price on the first day When we checked out we were told that my friends payment did not go through and that she needed to pay again We advised that she received a receipt confirming payment however we were still told she needed to pay the price The member of staff who checked us out was incredibly rude and very patronising It was out of order especially for a Hilton hotel My friend paid and when we left she phoned her bank who advised that she had been charged twice By this point we had left the hotel so I phoned the hotel and spoke again to the rude member of staff who was again very rude and patronising she said on the phone that the bank were lying and that only one payment had gone through and was adamant this was the case She advised that she would send an email to confirm Once we received this email it contradicted everything this staff member said and advised that it was correct my friend had been charged twice My friend had to make a formal complaint regarding this matter and it ruined my opinion and expectation of Hilton hotels , The bed was very comfy and on the first day the receptionist we had was lovely The birthday treat was a fantastic touch 
124801,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was a little small although we did have a small outside space which was great bed was very squeaky to even move there was a huge dirty linen bin over filled right out side our door from when we arrived and still there when we left, Restaurant was good value for money breakfast was great
124802,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I got lost trying to find my room via the lift I needed because it was down past more rooms which I thought was a dead end , The free boat to canary warf The cookies on arrival The view and balcony Staff very friendly and helpful 
124803,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It wasn t clear that it would be such a trek to get to the hotel from the tube station It was a good 5 10 minute walk with stairs to from the boat back to tube station A shuttle bus would be better than the boat in my opinion especially if bringing luggage , The booking greeting staff were professional helpful and pleasant The staff in the restaurant were cheerful hard working and quick to bring the coffee when asked The room was spacious clean modern and beds were super comfy 
124804,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rooms were a little tired and the linking doors were very noisy , The whole experience was good The real asset that this hotel has is the boat to Canary Wharf Without this it would have not been half as good a location 
124805,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff at breakfast just ignored us at greeting desk breakfast lounge was very busy Car park system was confusing which would have been ok if it was explained on check in and check out but it wasn t We were charged a pre authorisation refundable cost without knowledge of this , Lovely views location room very clean lovely hotel building terrace and outside seating area next to Thames Ferry over to Canary Wharf was reliable and great 
124806,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Initial room was very poor condition small with sloping roof and bed in corner Iron flex damaged lightbulb out and curtains on skylight very frayed Just above face if in bed Room changed without a problem but original room should not have been in use Ferry return finishes at 12 midnight which is very difficult to get back for if at a show in central London , Staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was excellent
124807,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We upgraded room because bed in queen room was terrible , The staff were very friendly and polite Bottle of water and cookie was a nice touch and tickets for the water taxi 
124808,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bar staff were especially slow and seemed a bit disorganised even with a very quiet bar Seemed to be a bit disorganised across quite a few areas bar replenishment of food and booking differences not what I would expect from a doubletree Hilton experience , Breakfast chef was extremely kind attentive and friendly She is a great asset to the company There was a bit of a mix up with my booking at check in once I showed my confirmation this was swiftly amended Great to enjoy some relaxing drinks with friends 
124809,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom was a little worn , The staff made me feel my stay was so important to them and there customer Focus was second to none The breakfast was amazing and I must say the gentleman who managed the restaurant on Friday night was so friendly and couldn t do more to help he is an asset to doubletree
124810,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room had not been cleaned upon our arrival There was stains on the carpets and the towels were not clean at all There was thick dust around the bathroom including the bin and window ledge We would not stay here again , nothing
124811,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No mirror at dressing table so was not able to dry and style hair with hairdryer or straighteners easily I was resorted to sitting on the floor by the door where there was a full length mirror and a socket just close enough to manage This I consider a basic consideration which is why I marked down on the facilities Also there was not window in the room but there were French doors that opened onto a little veranda That would have been fine but anybody could access that balcony which was outside our room and the neighbouring room Therefore didn t feel comfortable leaving open the doors at night and became a little to hot and stuffy , The hotel was lovely and very quirky The best bit was the terrace was right on the riverside Lovely seating areas heaters blankets and all lit up at night Lovely to have coffee on the terrace in the morning The omelettes that were cooked for breakfast were to die for and a truly excellent breakfast The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced The staff were really helpful and friendly and the hotels surroundings were lovely Would love to return again The ferry service from the hotel was also brilliant with attentive staff and was very reliable 
124812,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bar staff were very rude Not helpful in the slightest The room service was appalling I asked for two different items on the 24 hour food menu which they didn t have Very limited food menu All they had was sandwiches Which come in a packet No plate provided Over all wouldn t recommend staying here , The cookies on arrival 
124813,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to pay for Wifi in room The bathroom albeit clean and the complementary toiletries slippers were great but the bathroom door would not close unless the toilet seat was up Design error , The view was fantastic from the balcony We were given a complementary pass to use the ferry for our stay to cross the river The room was comfortable and clean The bed was very comfortable which is important The staff were helpful and friendly Received a cookie when we checked in 
124814,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom was in need of a little updating , Very picturesque London hotel on the river in a converted industrial building Stunning views friendly staff very comfortable room and the breakfast was excellent The complementary river ferry was extremely helpful takes you right to Canary Wharf and the Jubilee line 
124815,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No complaints whatsoever, The staff were brilliant and the food first class and I was given a complimentary glass of wine when they heard I was running the marathon which I thought was a lovely gesture
124816,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, On Saturday 22nd April the hot breakfast items kept under the hot lock e g Bacon eggs hash browns etc were not particularly hot , We were there to run in the London Marathon and to support a runner I would like to commend the hotel staff and management on the 23rd April as they gave excellent assistance to our party in extending our late check out when our runner needed treatment after the Marathon This caused our group of 11 to overrun the organised late checkout time as we were delayed in Central London 
124817,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Would of liked a mirror on the desk by the socket so I could see what I was doing when drying my hair, Very friendly staff lovely bed delicious breakfast
124818,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The service was great very helpful and friendly staff the room was comfy with a lot of space overlooking Canary Wharf and the ferry service was a lovely touch too sad to have only spent one night there 
124819,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only issue was that the plug socket next to our mirror didn t work , The staff were very friendly and helpful Bed was comfy and the room was nice and clean Great location as the river ferry is right at the hotel so very easy to get onto northside of the river quickly 
124820,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Everything exceeded my expectations, Amazing service from the staff who went out of their way to ensure my needs were met The view from our room was amazing and overlooking Canary Wharf and the O2 with the river on one side and a distant view of the city from the other side of the balcony We were offered free return boat tickets from the hotel into Canary Wharf and the breakfast was scrumptious Would definitely return Special thanks to Maria the front desk supervisor who provided an amazing service 
124821,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, nothing, Premium room was well proportioned great location to all hotel facilities nice large bed Staff were friendly and helpful free ferry to Canary Wharf a real bonus 
124822,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bar service could have been better, Friendly staff Excellent breakfast Lovely room brilliant view across the Thames to Canary Wharf great location
124823,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Midday food and snacks from the bar menu a little expensive but tasted good , Great size room Comfy bed Asked for allergy free pillows and was helped straight away Fab breakfast with even almond milk for my son Fun to use the river boats 
124824,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Only hotel I ve been in that didn t have bottles of water in the room I upgraded to a room with a city view but I didn t get a city view, Bed was comfy Ferry trip was a nice touch 
124825,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast is expensive 16 for a breakfast I can t justify that I m afraid after spending 200 for the room rate for one night , Our room was lovely along with the balcony but was overlooking a building site 
124826,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only gripe is that the standard Queen rooms were very small however this did not ruin our stay , The staff were very friendly and helpful The restaurant manager Barry was fantastic and really made our stay special The food was fantastic especially breakfast Rooms were clean 
124827,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I didn t like the fact I was charged twice for my stay on my debit card and I don t like that it s still not resolved and that I m being passed around the houses ,No Positive
124828,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very dark room frosted windows so couldn t see out and only one opened 3 4 inches Didn t look like luxurious picture shown when booked TV channels very limited with option to be charged extortionate amount to access films Breakfast offered limited options Although location interesting was not ideal for traveling or accessing a shop isolated nearest undergrounds not walkable distance had to get a boat then walk 15 mins to Canary Wharf or a bus to Canada Water , Interesting to be in an isolated location if you want to really get away hotel has nice views across the Thames from the bar Bed was very comfortable 
124829,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room was very disappointing with rust in the bath and it was dirty all round so me and my partner moved to a second room and that also had rust in the bath Very disappointing trip , The bed was very comfy

124832,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, my first room had a leak in the bathroom ceiling and I was most unimpressed and requested another room That should not have happened and it was obvious that the leak had been happening for a long time and the room had an odour of mould Most unsatisfactory Full credit to all staff I was upgraded to a better room and all was well Could not fault the reception staff I sincerely hope that such substandard rooms are not the norm for people such as myself who have book online from along way away Australia Tasmania to be exact ,No Positive
124833,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our bed wasn t stable It was on wheels so you couldn t lean on the bed because it would just roll , Great location Loved the decor in our rooms and the view from our room Lovely breakfast and great service 
124834,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom a little small Smashed my elbow on the door numerous times , Comfy bed and lovely pillows We had a great nights sleep it was almost too comfy We found ourselves not wanting to get up to continue exploring London 
124835,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had a king room and the bathroom was extremely small there was maybe a 2 3mm gap between the toilet bowl and the edge of the door I was a bit concerned about the location of the room near the lift shaft and overlooking the hotel entrance yet slept well , Staff extremely friendly and helpful Lovely terrace to enjoy the sunshine Slept very well Cushions were very comfortable Loved the little ferry and the public services to the hotel were good It helped that the bus drivers were also friendly they deserve a thanks I hadn t been keen on Double Tree in the past yet this was a very positive experience so will consider in the future 
124836,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Theur was a mix up with our room but the staff were so quick to rectify the mistake and couldn t have been more apologetic and helpful , The view from out king room was beautiful and we had use of the executive sweet which made the trip even more special

124839,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The size of the bathtub could be better but everything else is perfect , The staff is very helpfull the restaurant is awsome and the place of the hotel is really nice 
124840,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the corridors and lifts were narrow and made wheelchair use a little difficult but was more than compensated for with the extremely helpful and pleasant staff I was really impressed the each and everyone who worked here, In liked the room size as I am in a wheelchair and getting the upgrade gave me plenty of room
124841,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom wasn t big enough for a child let alone an adult bed was not comfy and played my back up it was not in the location that it advertised when I booked and it was not worth the money paid for it Wasn t all that clean and walls were dam and yellow in places Not what you expect from a hotel of the hit on chain, The view from the room was nice and location was quiet
124842,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Amazing staff in every area of the hotel Attentive polite and just happy in general which as a guest is a big thing for me when arriving The breakfast was incredible and the view overlooking the Thames was just as impressive The rooms were clean spacious and the balcony we had was a nice touch My girlfriend and I loved it and the surrounding area combined with the ferry service just topped it off for us We will be back

124845,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When we got there at first they couldn t find our reservation and was also told that the hotel ddnt receive any of the emails I sent through booking com making certain requests to make our trip pleasant When we were even calling the hotel before we arrived they kept saying we can t find your reservation so we should call booking com and sort it out with them although I kept giving them the reference This made me really worried wit my partner and thought of booking somewhere else last minute but we thought about the fact that my card would be charged if we ddnt pitch at the hotel Getting there from the train station in canary wharf was a problem the hotel could have at least mentioned they have a ferry that runs every now and again for our convinience but obviously communicating them was hard now we had to take a taxi which cost us a lot We apparently got upgraded to a king room from a double room but to be honest those rooms are small if if were we stayed was the king I wonder how tiny the doublr is For that price the hotel doesn t even have a mini bar just great The pictures of the terrace are what sold me when I made the booking but clearly they were deceptive Looked nothing like what we saw there All in all mediocre standards and service I believe , The breakfast was alright 
124846,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Poor non functioning aircon in our original room Beds and bathrooms a little small for a family , We had some issues with our room which were efficiently dealt with by your duty manager Aaron Frank The breakfast choice and quality were superb as we re the staff 
124847,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact they tried to sneak in a 11 odd service charge at the bottom of my receipt which I wouldn t usually check , It was unbelievable even ended up eating in the hotel late Saturday night at was very surprised at how nice it was

124850,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing, It was my partners birthday and the Duty Manager left a bottle of wine and cake with a personal letter in our room This was a kind gesture and made him feel extra special thank you 
124851,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rooms are getting a little tired but you get over this by excellent service from all members of staff that go out of the way to help, All the members of staff are very friendly and polite restaurant staff are excellent and food is great and good value for money
124852,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was very small with no window felt like a prison The WIFI in my room did not work on iPhone or iPad despite several attempts Tried to order room service and was told there was no food left and to use just eat Not the kind of service you expect from a 4 star hotel Paid over 150 for a 1 night stay on a weekday and this was not enough for breakfast to be included ,No Positive
124853,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, How the rooms are very close and you can hear people slamming their door at the early hours so found it hard to sleep The costa stand very slow , The decor of the hotel the staff were helpful the complimentary boat service

124857,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only thing that I didn t like was the room I booked on booking com wasn t the room I got All I would say advertise the actually room customers are paying for as it was a let down for me as it was my daughters 18 birthday and booked what I thought we was going to get for her and didn t get the room shown on there , Nice and quite area 
124858,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was very squeeky any time you moved it was very loud and noisey and un comfy there was also no mini bar which i thought was strange as the room was very hot would have been nice to have a cold drink and our room looked on to a fire exit which wasnt amazing for viewing would have been nice to look on to the thames , Croissants were extry lovely and loved that there was a starbucks in the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful The ferry accross fo canary wharf was very handy and very easy to travel to A B was an enjoyable stay

124863,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Needs a plug near mirror so she can see herself with the hairdryer etc Step down into bathroom was not good floor could have been lifted We were staying with Hilton as it worked with the ferry and access to the o2 The ferry worked well until Sunday night where we took the river okay to the venue instead of ferry walk underground route on return we were told the river bus would be there for 15 mins after performance we left the concert promptly and we re ahead of 50 plus people and as we re we re on the ramp the boat pulled away we did not realise this was the last river boat and more than this when the river Joan arrived at the HILTON crossing it was to be waiting as the last crossing so we would have missed that as well the only way back was by taxi at a cost of 28 90 this was the only down side to a very good weekend , Bed was very comfortable Room was spacious
124864,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It did take a ferry and a little walk 20 mins to get to restaurants , The duvet was the best duvet ever still trying to find one like it The hotels ferry service was awesome and the bus stops right at the hotels front door

124866,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The shuttle service from Canary Wharf following a concert at the O2 was very poor and did not afford customers the time to get from the O2 My Daughter and I were left stranded at Canary Wharf with no option to transport to the Hotel The Police took pity and returned us safely after 2 hours of trying to get back by public transport Hotel staff had no interest when I attempted to discuss the issues the following morning , The breakfast was lovely Nice hotel 
124867,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, That weekend my partners parents came to visit us in London And annoying got offered a room with a double bed and two single beds together in the same room When we paid for a family room for 4 Highly think it wasn t worth the money and was also very embarrassing for our inlaws to be going through a difficult time just to get what we paid for Shouldn t be advertising what your not giving So annoying , Went through a lot After changing the hotel room 3 times we had to accept anything 
124868,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Going home, The Restaurant manager forgot her name Was absolutely fantastic We complimented her for the wonderful food variety and service So she called out the head chef so we could talk with him A fellow South Africa and absolute gent Lovely hotel Highly recommended

124870,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, From when we checked in at 3pm till we left at 6pm to go out we were waiting for the staff to bring us something When we got to the room we asked for fresh milk the robes that were included with our executive room an ice bucket and for the tv and the patio door to be fixed The only good point about this hotel is your maintenance who came quickly and sorted everything no problem Fresh milk for tea was an alien concept only 1 robe ever materialised about 5pm as did our ice bucket Every time we called we were told not our department you need to call This just isn t good enough from a Hilton brand one employee should have taken responsibility and noted down what we needed and then ensured other departments were informed My partner physically went down to reception twice asking for an ice bucket he would have just bought it back up but they insisted on bringing it two hours too late They never admitted they had ran out of robes one was finally bought for me with the promise another was on its way still waiting We hadn t bought relaxing clothes with us as we re planning on just chilling in our robes We never had time to relax as were constantly waiting for the door to go it all could have been solved within the first 30 mins Shabby poor organisation I d have been better off saving my money and staying in a travel lodge , Comfy bed great views from room 546 Actual hotel very attractive looking 
124871,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to pay to upgrade our room as we were stuck in a shoe box at the back of the building next to a building site Bathroom needed upgrading bed linen falling apart Wifi was only free due to having a Hilton Honors membership , Beautiful view opposite canary wharf IF you were lucky enough to get a river view room Good connection to public transport quiet area of London which was very clean 
124872,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had no tv or power points from 10 00pm until 10 00am This was very inconvenient The manager did take my phone to charge it for me but that ment I had no phone over night no TVs and no kettle , Liked the ferry
124873,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, when booked the site and hotel never mentioned breakfast so ordered room service which was fine but when it came was told you have breakfast in price but still charged 40 pounds extra because we ordered room service not happy so check you have breakfast in price, bed was good room size excellent

124876,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I was really unhappy that my room did not have hot water so we couldn t have a shower the next morning for the price we paid for the room I find this really unacceptable ,No Positive
124877,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, This hotel cost me a lot of money and it was for a special occasion The pictures advertised and the price gave me the impression that my partner and I would be in for a real treat Unfortunately this was not the case When we got to our room we were extremely disappointed as it did not quite look like the advertised pictures Also this hotel sells itself on its spectacular views which we were very much looking forward to When we opened our balcony we were in disbelief We had a shared balcony with two doors either side that seemed accessible by anyone The view was of the back of the building and nothing more I personally felt unsafe and thought that the balcony would be better bricked up as there was no view and to reassure safety I felt as though anyone could have walked on our balcony and got in to our room What was also extremely disappointing was the noise level On both mornings I was awake for 6am It seemed from our room you could hear every little squeak and movement from what I presume the other rooms I could hear showers and toilets flushing There was lots of loud banging that was probably people just getting around there room normally but from our room sounded like someone trying to get in to our room We had a terrible balcony and view the room did not match the pictures I felt unsafe and the noise was unbearable which resulted in a very tired frustrated couple that were trying to enjoy a romantic trip I am disappointed as we were very much looking forward to this trip it was meant to be special and for an occasion We are frequent Hilton stayers and expected much much better for the money and from the advertisement , The staff were very friendly and the food was lovely particularly the breakfast The view across the river and the complementary boat were also nice 
124878,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms are tiny but for 100 in London that s not unusual, This was actually a relief to get because of storm Doris all our trains got cancelled and we were forced to stay over We really surprised at the price and how nice it is It really was such a relief 
124879,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Would have been better if we could have purchased a snack with our drinks i e crisps or nuts etc at the bar after our returned from the 02 in the evening, The bed and pillows were very comfy location of room was good Was a very easy journey to the 02 by ferry in the evening as well

124881,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, They don t sell bar snacks There is a food menu though but not available really late , The location by the river is lovely The boat over to Canary Wharf is really handy and makes it quicker to get to central London 
124882,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, layout of the room could not quit see the TV from the bed Iron could have been placed lower in the wardrobe to enable us to use the full hanging space wardrobe would have been easier to access if facing the bed and not enough milk cartons in the room , The ease of traveling into central London Via canary wharf and the hotel atmosphere was amazing
124883,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The images on booking com of the queen size room didn t reflect the actual size of room I got and it didn t look like the photos on the website The pictures made it look much more impressive than it was The room was clean and modern but the room I got was more like a box room and not queen size I wouldn t like to see the size of the standard room Did upgrade to a king and that was much better , The staff were very helpful and the breakfast we lovely A hotel having its own boat is a brilliant idea and the staff on the boat were very helpful

124892,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the communication with staff that worked there i found was very poor simple questions asked were hard for them to understand or even know two nights cost over 200 pound as checked in was told they rake 50 deposit for each night but was told this goes into bank when leave straight away was not told it takes 5 days noticed on my online banking they had taken payment for hotel and on check out day i had money in my account then i had to contact my bank as i placed a order for online food payment went through then the next day i was notified my order was cancelled as the hilton hotel took 338 00 plus the rate for the two night stay after trying to contact the hotel and to be put through to the right person was a nightmare after many attempts contacting the hotel i asked to speak to the manager i spoke to him and he basically didnt help said he would call back i said if i dont answer could you please leave a message i think its disgusting as its to do with my money noone is interested and still have not heard anything from them i am now fed up of me making all the contact this is just a quick review For experiencing such poor service from hotel staff and to not even get a response back from the manager I will not book to stay here again , first time staying at hilton hotel hotel great great location

124895,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, If I had to find a fault and I am really scraping the barrel here I would say that the view out of our window wasn t the best we were facing out onto the back of some other rooms but as we didn t spend that much time in the room it wasn t really a problem for us , The fresh cookie on arrival was a nice touch as a welcome to the hotel Staff were very friendly throughout the whole stay nothing was too much Transport links to and from the hotel were great we took advantage of the free ferry on a few occasions which took you to within about a 10 minute walk to the Canary Wharf tube stop or there was a bus stop right outside the hotel which took you to the Canada Water tube stop otherwise this particular stop would be a long walk from the hotel Both the ferry and the bus were very regular The hotel was nicely decorated if you have some down time I would suggest popping into the library where you can settle with a book and a glass of wine infront of one of the roaring fires The only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast absolutely no complaints here it was a plentiful and really good quality The toiletries in the bathroom were lovely also Crabtree Evelyn Overall a fab stay 
124896,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When I arrived it was 3 20 check in was at 3 i requesting a room with a view and told I had this but when I got to check in the Man Behind the Counter told me the room was not ready so our room was moved to a different one as we had to get ready and didn t have time to wait, Free ferry across the Thames

124908,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was freezing cold But i was given a discount due to the bad heating The hotel needs to invest in triple glazing even if the room is heated there is a draft during cold weather months, beautiful views of the river At night it s magical watching the lights and tatching the tide go in and out But it s definitely a summer hotel
124909,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The view from the room The overall expense for what you get The bed was too stiff , The staff whom were working within the restaurant at breakfast so helpful and very happy Great transport facilities for crossing the Thames 
124910,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wifi did not work in my room the rooms are not correctly labelled in terms of going through the doors to show which direction you should be going That I had to go to reception to pay for room service before I could order Would be better if you could pay as leaving for it , The location of the property and that there was access to Canary Wharf via ferry which was free Food was nice

124919,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rooms are tiny we were even given a room upgrade so I would dread to think the size of the normal room we booked The TV was unwatchable due to where it was braced onto the wall Fire alarm woke us up every morning and the cleaners would just walk in , Free water boat to other side of the river was great we booked the hotel as we were attending a gig at the o2 so we were definitely well connected Costa coffee was delicious Bed was comfy

124925,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Felt abit awkward when we went for breakfast and a staff member had mentioned to the worker that sat us down that she was saving the table for her guests We heard all she had said and it left us feeling uncomfortable Also our morning shower was too cold , The location and view and free ferry was great and staff were happy to help when we kept getting lost around the hotel
124926,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was a small double not a large one as stated when booking, Location of the hotel was lovely would be nice in the summer months the menu for the 3 course meal deal off wowcher was extremely good for the price paid 
124927,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff could have been more helpful I didn t have a great experience as the staff just were not interested in us We had a few problems with the location of the hotel as the nearest tube station is 20 25 minutes walk away The food drinks were extremely overpriced I wouldn t recommend eating drinking there , The room was massive felt more like an appartment than a hotel room 
124928,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The staff are so friendly there is always someone around to ask if you need anything The beds are so comfy its like sleeping in a bed of feathers and as for the breakfast i couldt fault it they offer a wide range of breakfasts to suit everyone i had the full english with a cup of tea i couldnt say a bad thing about this hotel 
124929,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Service in the Kaliedescope bar was not great Long delay and then they had forgotten our starters and the main meal was not hot enough Very disappointing in relation to the rest of our stay , Very nice hotel with excellent boat service to Canary Wharf 
124930,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Being on the ground floor of the hotel and not being able to turn the heating off My room was very hot and I found it hard to sleep , The river view and taking the ferry at the hotel s dock 
124931,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Was some rubbish noted under chair from previous guest but staff were really apologetic and dealt with house keeping appropriately, My wife s 60th birthday room decorated with confetti cakes etc
124932,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Photos were very deceiving Toilet was so small the door rubbed against the toilet seat Also was impossible to work the tv as no remote Whilst looking for remote found sex coupons which was funny but 100 not meant to be there , Bed was comfortable and everything very clean Staff were also very kind and help was easy to get through the care line Complimentary ferry crossing was also very helpful and the staff were happy to give us directions 
124933,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I am so appalled with what experience I had and will be calling directly Booking com or the hotel to better my understanding of what has happened to me over the night at this hotel , The staff
124934,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location was slightly out of the way but a good local TFL bus service with a very helpful driver who confirmed when the location had been reached , Welcome at reception Nice room with comfortable bed Nice detail for room 
124935,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room could ve been bigger but it was just enough space for 2 for a short time Would ve liked a pool table in the bar area , Room was kept very clean and tidy for us cookies at reception were incredible a very nice touch 
124936,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I didn t enjoy the room itself as it wasn t the same room as depicted in the photos on booking com the room had a lack of plugs meaning we had to switch between charging devices the television had a slow response time and poor choice the room itself didn t contain a fridge which would have been useful as maintaining food was difficult the balcony wasn t great either it was just a door that opened to a walkway so the view was awful , The bathroom was large and the shower was efficient and we also enjoyed the decor of the hotel as it was very picturesque 
124937,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 It is expected to add a provisional 50 per day on account of potential expenses so 4 nights would have 200 added towards it I did not accept it as it is not mandatory and I knew I would not spend anything extra but it is presumed not to be queried I have been to other hotels with the same category and this provisional 50 day was not ever mentioned 2 I could not have a hot shower as the water was barely tepid 3 On the A la Carte menu there is no mention that the price for each course DOES NOT include the VAT plus a service charge so a meal that would have been 21 adding up the prices shown on the menu becomes 27 95 3 50 Also the printed bill expects the customer to also add a tip on top of it 4 The booklet in the room should mention that if there is an early start when checking out the staff can prepare some breakfast to take away This same booklet does not say on Saturdays breakfast will not start till 7 00 instead of the usual 06 30 Consequently I left without my breakfast which I had paid for 5 The WiFi was free but very poor 6 I did put a good for staff because the restaurant staff made up for it Some staff I dealt with at reception were not as efficient Unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives therefore I shall not return to this hotel , There was a wide variety for breakfast It is a good policy to have a complimentary ferry service to Canary Wharf 
124938,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The step from the bathroom kept stubbing toes Kettle didn t turn off when boiled Broken socket by bed Didn t get our free cookies, Bed Massive and so comfy
124939,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I feel the room was very over priced for what it was the bed was shoved in the corner of the room we had no view of the surroundings out of the window the curtains were worn dated not good value for money at all 129 for one nights stay without breakfast I could understand if we were staying near central London but this isnt, easy location to gain access to tube station by free river taxi provided by the hotel

124941,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wifi wasn t very good or strong even though it was meant to be included The room was supposed to have a river view but did not , Everything was very beautiful in the room staff were incredibly helpful and friendly 
124942,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The mattress was hard and the room was cold despite increasing the thermostat to its top temperature The shower head wasn t connected right to the hose so at least a third of the water ran down the tiled wall instead The water wasn t hot enough either possibly an annoying safety feature The guests in the room opposite were noisy and inconsiderate but you can t blame the hotel for that , The pillows were very comfy and the room was nicely decorated The location was nice and a good spot for catching Pok mon 
124943,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Level of connection via booking com the request concerning facilities was not received by the hotel , Good connection with other side of the river beautfiul view fast WiFi

124958,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There is a free boat put on by the hotel we found this excellent as it was more convenient and you can get off at Canary Warf tube and walk 5 mins and jump on the boat the other option is getting off the tube at Canada Water and walking about 20 30 mins this also isn t too bad but we went to see a show at the O2 which finished late and by the time we got to the boat it had finished it would have been better to hae that boat running longer even for a small charge , The location for us was brilliant The room was spacious and very very comfortable 
124959,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, One towel in our room was dirty and had blood on it which obviously put me off using it All good other than this , The location was fab Friendly staff Wonderful room Delicious breakfast and cookies on arrival And also loved the boat you could get to Canary Wharf saved us a lot of time Great location if you re going to the O2 Arena Will definitely be visiting again

124982,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I always use booking com to book hotels and rooms but somehow the Hilton did not have my booking and I had to chase it up several times Very distressful Although in the end I had an amazing experience it would be better if the room had a fridge to store drinks and snacks and it is very silly to be paying wifi at a four star hotel , I had an amazing night at the double tree in the docklands The room was very clean and beautiful with a balcony Staff were very friendly who generously upgraded my room with a kingsize bed A great thing is you get free unlimited rides on the ferry to canary wharf from the hotel A beautiful couples experience would definitely come back

125010,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bed was uncomfortable personal preference though Requested a river view and got dumped in the back which was very noisy with deliveries and what not Randomly got chargerd an extra 100 for no apparant reason Each night there seemed to be a function in the lounge so we never got to experience it , Breakfast was delicious Staff friendly Cocktails were lovely The view from the good part of the hotel was spectacular 
125011,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our room was very disappointing small and with an obstructed view nothing like the photo beware The upgrade we were given was better but smelt strongly of the cleaning cupboard next door Disgusting , Excellent receptionist who tried his hardest to meet our needs 
125012,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location On the other side of the river had to get a ferry to get to canary wharf Ferry was quick simple and free but added a bit of extra time to each journey that i wasnt expecting, Comfy bed excellent breakfast really helpful staff Overall a great stay
125013,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I called a receptionist to the room at 1am because the heating was broke a member of staff came to the room and agreed it was broke who then said he would come back with some electric heaters Waited til 2am tried ringing reception no answer I told the member of staff when checking out she took my details and said she would investigate and see if she could get some compensation But i still haven t heard anything back from the hotel and will never be visiting again ,No Positive
125014,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Heating turned up a little more in rooms especially this time of year Or maybe i m a fussy thing , Staff we re very welcoming and helpful with locations etc Food was well cooked room service staff were lovely and the doubled drinks 
125015,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bedroom location was noisy with people walking past alot and the bed was very rickety every time i turned in my sleep it made a noise and woke me up , It was very moder and clean The food and resturant was really good Very well greeted especially with a warm cookie when checking in which was pleasent and it was handy to have a boat service across to resturants 
125016,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree by Hilton it was perfect from start to finish We will definetly be coming back The room was beautiful and the view was outstanding The staff could not be more helpful and were extremely friendly inparticulary a lady in the resteraunt who s name we unfortunately did not catch she has long brown hair and had such a friendly unique touch The complimentary ferry was also a bonus along with the scrumptious food served at breakfast Could not thank the staff any more for such a perfect stay all the best and we wish you a Merry Christmas 
125017,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The service i recieved from the staff I ordered room service then to be called back 10 minutes later saying i would have to go to reception to Then get home the day after my stay and they have charged me 40 for something i had not had It then took me 35 times to call to be hung up and lied to by Linda at the front desk who said they could make the refund and it would be in my acocunt immediately Then to be hung on by someone else Then eventually getting through to the manager and saying she couldnt do anything right then so i had to wait 1 hour for a phone call for her to say they was refunding me and it would be in my bank account the NEXT DAY That was on saturday and i am still waiting for the payment back This has ruined my stay and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone, the hotel is very nice looking 
125018,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was slightly chilly and couldn t work out how to turn on the heating Relied on shampoo included in the bathroom but not enough for a couple to shower, The breakfast included in our stay was absolutely lovely yummy food The bed was comfy and slept really well Lovely view from balcony
125019,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, If there had been more leisure facilities for relaxation and pampering it would have been so much better , Wonderful location with the riverside looking amazing at night You are welcomed by a warm cookie on arrival which is a lovely touch Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and were quick to assist when we found our rooms were not warming up and the room phones were not working Awesome that a ferry trip across the river was included Fantastic breakfast too 
125020,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, On the website there is a cocktail meny they apparantly doesn t have anyway Disapointing 24h roomservice is actually not 24h we were told , Columbia Restaurant food is awesome 
125021,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Thought the breakfast was overpriced we ate at Canada water, Bed was super comfy wonderful view of the Thames from balcony the room was comfortable and clean and modern A warm cookie on arrival was a nice touch Easy to get around the bus stops right outside the hotel straight to Canada Water for the underground 
125022,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked a deluxe king with a river view and we got a basement double room with no view because they were full The room was freezing and the heating and hot water didn t work inside the bath was patched up with mastic filling 2 holes and when we complained all we got was sorry but we are full we booked 9 weeks ago and would u like a free coffee , Nothing 
125023,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, elevator too small for my son s wheelchair can not in international Hotel slow check in reception understaffed cold shower hard to find light switches in the rooms , nice location near river fine breakfast clean and spacious rooms helpful concierge 
125024,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booked a deluxe double room with river view over a month ago to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday was given a dirty room with small unable to open window over looking buildings no river view staff weren t helpful at all even with all the signs saying if you not happy tell us had to really stand my ground even after being told that they were fully booked they would see if someone wanted to change The Hilton became more like Butlins such a shame as the hotel is lovely ferry across really well organised they need to sort out reservations asked over a month ago for a room with a balcony that didn t happen Not sure I would book again ,No Positive
125025,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Access on the weekends ferry stops at 9pm No hot water available in the mornings Over ambitious descriptions of the room particularly the river view , Views
125026,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, My toilet hadn t been cleaned and there was a UFO in it tried calling reception many times but no one answered Flushed it a lot but took the shine off of the stay , Enjoyed my free cookie and the free ferry to Canary Wharf
125027,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We didn t have hot water on both mornings we were there It was reported to the reception team which they acknowledged and bar voucher given but really hot water is a must for a hotel stay Talking to other residents it seemed a common problem , Great location for Canary Wharf and O2 Lovely hotel with lovely restaurant and bar Ferry is very handy for link to Canary Wharf
125028,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, staff could have been a little more helpful with giving us directions to locate our room we ended up going to reception twice with all our bags , river suite with balcony is very pretty at night
125029,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location and the fact that the air conditioning was constantly on Our room was cold for a while before we were given a portable heater , The cookies
125030,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bar food menu was quite limited would have liked a couple more options, Location was good for the O2 used the hotel water taxi and clipper service which was really quick and easy
125031,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had several issues with staff being rude and or not knowing what their jobs were or what they should be doing , Complimentary Clipper trips across the Thames were good 
125032,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The size of the queen guest room was ridiculously small it was definitely a double room and not a queen Also the cleaner walking in at 11 30am without warning and seeing me naked wasn t ideal , The complementary cookie on arrive was a lovely gesture
125033,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Only thing I can fault is room not very warm even with temperature turned right up , Location decor breakfast complimentary ferry and staff excellent 
125034,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the pillows were feather pillows and I couldn t get comfortable with them at all but I m sure if I asked they would have given me more , We got upgraded to a king room the room was clean and neat with an awesome view of the dock and Thames Loved the ferry boat The building itself is stunning and I couldn t get over the view was such a novelty 
125035,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booked a king deluxe room with a city or river view Room had neither Had to ask to change Second room had a better view but still not in line with the pictures seen when booking TV didn t face the bed it was on an arm but you still couldn t turn it round to face the bed Not a big deal as we weren t planning on watching it much but still not what you expect when you pay for a King Deluxe room Water was only just warm in the morning so not a great shower Website shows photos of a terrace bar but it turns out this is only available for group bookings , Bed was comfortable Breakfast was good
125036,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I booked a smoking room on the net and when arrived said its s none smoking now and asked for room close to each other as booked 2 rooms one for my teenage daughters but had to pay for room up grade cause said none close so had to pay 25 to get rooms next to each other, I liked the room looked a little bigger on pictures tho and staff was friendly the boat trip is nice idea and view was nice
125037,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We came here to stay to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and was so disappointed the check in staff were lovely very welcoming but after that point it wasnt up to expectations The room was so small the bathroom wasn t the cleanest either looked slightly run down The TV lost signal every 5minutes Also had a constant high pitched noise going all night that kept us awake and the room walls were so thin every noice of talking walking past was heard very loudly heard another rooms tv going off till 2 30 am Other than disappointment of the room we went to check out restaurant bar and can not put in a good word at all the staff were so rude to the point we decided to eat elsewhere The attitude of the food and beverage staff that were serving on time of our stay really let it down We also skipped breakfast the next morning too to avoid the restaurant Such a shame as was looking forward to staying in hotel for meal and having few drinks with the beautiful view Overall very disappointed ,No Positive
125038,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When we arrived we were assigned a room Once we got to the room we found that it was still being made up by the facilities staff We mentioned this to reception who then replaced us into another room but with a less adequate view This shouldn t have been an issue in the first place and rooms should not be issued to guests until fully cleaned and tidied The floors were incredibly creepy and we were worried about waking other guests , The breakfast was unbelievable along with the view from the room 
125039,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Strange thing but the step threshold between the bedroom and bathroom was dangerously high and caused both of us to trip several times In the end we had to put a towel on the lower level of the bathroom floor to prevent accidents , Comfortable bed with crisp linen Fantastic breakfast range highly recommended Wonderful location on river with bonus of regular passenger ferry crossing to Canary Wharf and connection to the river bus service This facility gives hotel guests excellent access to a range of transport options including the underground at Canary Wharf 
125040,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I didn t like the fact that my TV didn t work and it took the electrician THREE tries to fix it which resulted in me having to be moved If there is a problem staff members should move you regardless , We loved the free access to the ferry It was so nice to jump on the ferry at any time and see the city 
125041,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bath could have done with a little TLC Needed replacing really , Staff were very friendly Room was lovely Breakfast and dinner was superb Ferry crossing from hotel to Canary Wharf Pier was a blessing

125044,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We stayed in Kingsroom I never stayed in Kings room before but thought it will be bigger bathroom is very small there is no room for two people there was power cut in our room in the morning Although it was resolved very quickly, It was such a nice touch to have a warm chocolate cookie with the room key Big thank you to the stuff as I asked tea coffee facility in the room View from the window was very nice especially in the evening when all canary wharf was illuminating complimentary ticket to the ferry to from canary wharf was very handy bed was fantastic Extra big and extra comfy it was absolutely perfect breakfast 
125045,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Corridor outside room smelt musty, lovely warm welcome at reception Rook with a balcony and river view quiet and very comfortable Excellent breakfast good choice and freshly cooked 
125046,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Long Queues for breakfast excellent staff there Location can be a problem and not easy to get there after a late night ferry stops at 12 Only two larger on draught and I wasn t fond of either Takes the best part of an hour to get home from Central London, Interesting rooms on Themes so great view Good breakfast Quiet Love the ferry Interesting part of London 
125047,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room was really small so we upgraded We had to check out of the more expensive room at 1 30am as there was a noisy radiator and we couldn t sleep There were no more rooms available and no maintenance so we had to get a cab home arriving home at 3am so we were very unhappy Still awaiting a refund for the room and breakfast that we obviously did not have , The view
125048,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff were useless Woman on reception took 20 minutes to check me in and gave me someone else s details as my own Bar was small and quiet Noisy room next to the river and smoke alarm kept going off for no reason at all Bed was noisy also , The room was lovely with brilliant view Big bed Breakfast tastes good but very small for money
125049,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was much smaller than pictured expected The city view was only partial The costs weren t clear and we were charged an extra 50 deposit that they were in aware of in the morning I still don t think I got it back despite reminding them We had to walk through a woodland in the dark just to find it , The bed was amazing the breakfast and dinner was brilliant the staff are very helpful and pleasant The hotel itself is clean and very nice 
125050,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Drinks were very pricey Probably just London prices though, Breakfasts were great Staff friendly and helpful Easy access to Canary Wharf and the river clippers and the fact the Doubletree ferry always waited for the last clipper to transport guests from Canary Wharf dock to the hotel Comfy rooms and beds Very clean hotel The terrace will be fabulous in the summer 
125051,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was small for a Queen Size and the windows where really in need of replacement Heating in room was loud if turned on and 20 for breakfast is excessive wouldn t go again unless seriously discounted, Nice place staff friendly especially the transport support staff

125054,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The shutters on the window rooms were really hot but opening the windows ment rattling , Great bar area to relax with friends and really nice food Nice touch with warm cookie on check in 
125055,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Good location for the City but not so good for Central London , Super confty bed free wi fi available friendly staff ready to help nice view complimentary tickets for the ferry nice breakfast 
125056,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Queue at breakfast, Hotel was beautiful staff very friendly gave us options of what room view we wanted Room was very comfortable Loved getting the ferry to Canary Wharf 
125057,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 Bed was extremely noisy 2 step in Bathroom although notice on wall still an issue in middle of night 3 Barrels were being moved from 7 00am Sat sun Monday disturbing sleep 4 Stayed in august breakfast was included in the price for a higher price breakfast wasn t included although my mistake for not checking reservation details , Location
125058,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I paid for a river view which I did not get due to heating not working in room my view ended up being scaffolding Waiting for another room made our whole evening late We missed our anniversary dinner in town Ended up having room services which we had to wait over an hour for Not the great anniversary gift I had planned for us I still feel really upset and disappointed , Friendly staff 
125059,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom was a little dated although spotlessly clean Free wifi didn t work in our room , The rooms and facilities were spotlessly clean Our hairdryer didn t work and after phoning housekeeping a replacement arrived in less than 5 minutes The beds were really comfortable and so were the pillows and duvet Free complimentary cookies on arrival were very tasty Breakfast was really good with plenty of choice from fish to cooked full English to cereals and fruit Easy access to the main attractions via C10 bus and Underground Hotel is close to an Odeon cinema and PizzaHut which was great to unwind after a busy day shopping 
125060,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Queuing to go in for breakfast when we finally got in the breakfast was v nice Seemed to take quite a while to get anywhere waiting for the ferry then a 15 min walk to any tube station So if you are wanting to get in to central London it can take quite a while , Rooms were spacious with balcony and view over the river staff allowed us to have a later check out as my daughter was ill
125061,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room price we paid was the same as the executive room However our room was not up to scratch The tv didnt come out from a fixed position on the wall deeming it useless This was the only downpoint Other than that and the bad pricing it was okay Balcony room hardly worth the extra money especially without breakfast I would also recommend not checking out dead onn12 as gets very very busy or make sure you can express checkout ,No Positive
125062,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I paid extra for a twin room I was staying with a male colleague in advance Despite that when I arrived the room we were given was a double bed We were re allocated another room but why did I have to waste time doing this and why did I have to pay extra , Location and comfort
125063,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, A wonderful hotel with great views from the bedroom and bar Amazing welcome with a warm cookie and free boat service The boat service was extremely convenient frequent and quick to get to the restaurants and bars with the last boat at midnight perfect Comfy bed excellent shower and great service Wonderful luxury stay

125066,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Restaurant closes to early we was turned away at 9 30pm, Loved everything about the hotel we was in a king suite room 686 and it was awesome lovely veiws also 
125067,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fire alarm system went off 7 times during the night apparently due to a fire a few miles away and the smoke affecting the system The system kept picking up smoke and going off again Quite unsettling and ended up in the lobby at 4am until 5am until we felt confident that all was ok Very little sleep due to this problem which meant I felt exhausted the next day at my Conference , The trip across the water was enjoyable and different The room whilst small was comfortable very clean the shower lovely and hot and the toiletry products were good quality The food and service in the restaurant was very good friendly warm good quality food and variety of menu I was struggling with foot blisters the staff kindly gave me huge plasters which saved the day 
125068,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, We were greeted with a freshly made hotel chocolate cookie which was a lovely touch Great nights sleep with comfy bed and pillows Lovely view out of our room window Very efficient ferry ride to Canary Wharf and friendly staff onboard Delicious breakfast and lots of options Staff were very helpful and friendly

125070,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fire alarm went off several times during the night finally becoming an urgent continuous bell at 4 00am As a permanent wheelchair user I had been given instructions to stay in my room if the alarm sounded and a member of staff would come and get me This did not happen we could not get a reply from any phone number so my wife had to get me up and dressed not easy I need to use a hoist to get in out of bed We went to reception where chaos reigned full of guests in various states of dress A member of staff in a hi viz jacket was explaining the situation to one couple saying he would speak to everyone individually I interrupted him to suggest that he made an announcement so that everyone could go back to bed which he then did It was clearly ridiculous that it took me to suggest this and my wife was very distressed that Hilton had not followed their own instructions and notified us that we were either safe or unsafe in our room The following morning all the guests looked very worse for wear we saw one man leave at 4 in the morning he couldn t take it anymore obviously however Edward Loader Head of Operations spoke to me at length and said that he would waive the cost of our room for the dreadful night a gesture I appreciate , Good location nice room friendly staff
125071,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very disappointed with our room it had a smell from bathroom drains I didn t like that we couldn t see out of window made it feel I was sleeping in a bathroom It had opaque glass on window Felt clostrophobic, It had a lovely lobby and liked the peir to and from hotel

125081,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room wasn t as advertised no balcony staff with bad knowledge of underground stations meaning a longer than expected walk back to the hotel room noise from pipes the quilt looked like it was designed for the Arctic , Hotel bar and resteraunt
125082,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked and paid 3 weeks before our trip to get there and to be told there were no quuen rooms available we then had to pay another 30 to upgrade to a different room ,No Positive
125083,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, our view from our room was a little dissapointing as i would have liked a thames view but we could only just see it from our balcony if we were leaning, The staff were extremely accomodating as i have an allergy to feathers and all the bedding was feather based but when i told the staff they changed all the bedding immediatley for me Breakfast was amazing and lots of lovely choice
125084,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was tiny with double bed up against the wall one side nothing like shown on the website Hardly room to sit on the loo with loo roll sticking in your side Woken early 6 45am by cleaner hitting radiators and pipes outside the room for nearly an hour Worst 4 hotel I have ever stayed in Same applied to my colleague Complained at reception didn t even get offered a discount ,No Positive

125086,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, 2nd visit love the hotel and the room was good Service was not up to our last visit We used to love sitting outside and eating and drinking but there were not many comfy seats they were geared up for outside dining and no one came to take our orders
125087,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had booked for two nights and we were on the top floor the room keys were deactivated so we had to come back twice to the reception to reactivate the key cards plus the lift nearest to our room was out of order, Overall the hotel was comfortable
125088,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, WiFi very poor and no signal in hotel via service provider Booked a superior king room but I have no idea what was superior about it Hotel is overpriced and on the wrong side of the river for O2 but is advertised as close by No night room service and is in the middle of a residential site but no shops Definitely wouldn t stay again,No Positive
125089,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were attending a wedding nearby on this occasion and so my requests of the hotel were a bit more critical than usual particularly early check in so that we could change in preparation for the wedding At check in approx 2pm I was told that early check in was not available The receptionist s response to my suggestion that they should at least have communicated this to me ahead of arrival was that they had no record of any of my requests I have been using Booking com for many years and this is the first time that has been claimed I am inclined to doubt the accuracy of that statement therefore Thus very poor service from a four star hotel , Large hotel originally I believe an old warehouse but an impressive modern conversion Big plus is on site car parking at not unreasonable cost for London 12 from memory I think Generous size bedroom although the en suite was compact to say the least everything was in there though so no complaint overall 
125090,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Didn t like being stuck on the fourth 4 in what was effectively an after thought of a room The window was opaque and as for the bed I have never ever slept in a bed that made so much noise and I m talking about attempting to get comfortable and sleeping , Fabulous views over the Thames clean pleasant atmosphere helpful staff

125094,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Rooms were big The location is beautiful view of Canary Wharf on one side and short walk down the dockside you can see London city scape of the Shard and other buildings There is close transport links to the underground on a coupe minutes by bus and a river ferry to Canary Wharf to the river bus or underground and over ground links 
125095,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, My bedroom was on the ground floor beside a car park and I could hear people talking right outside my window It was only for about 10 minutes so it didn t bother me but I wouldn t have liked it had it gone on for longer ,No Positive
125096,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rude unhelpful night staff Terrible room smelt of urine and was like someone s attic No gym and fitness facilities Go to the one in canary wharf it s so much better Room service don t bother answering calls , Day staff were helpful
125097,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Manager was extremely rude Tried calling reception from my room for 30mins no one answered tried again off mobile no answer went downstairs to complain and was told we are busy can t you see the phone are still ringing Room was not ready at check in time Had to queue twice to check in and get parking sorted waited 20mins to start with when checking in Mentioned at time of booking was a 10 yr anniversary Hotel didn t seem to care Junior suite room with balcony is a rip off You pay for the view only Exec king or exec queen rooms are cheaper but there balconites are double the size and also with the same view Does not make sense Wonderful way to ruin a 10yr anniversary didn t have breakfast because just wanted to leave hotel first thing in the morning , Bed was comfy View was lovely especially at night
125098,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Dirty toilet in room had been used Long wait for dinner to be served in the bar Too many steps and no help from staff watching you carry suit cases up the stairs from the car park or from bar to reception No plugs by bedside for charging phones, Breakfast was good amazing chef Good bar food menu Beautiful location by the thames Complimentary river ferry taxi
125099,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The service in the restaurant was awful I had to collect my own food from the serving area as there were little or no waiters available Hilton you need to staff your facilities better , River bus great to get to Canary Wharf and restaurants and free for hotel guests 
125100,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had pre booked a room only to get there find it had been given to someone else Then told they didn t have a similar room available which we refused to accept Got given a room as we opened the door walked in on someone already staying in that room Fuming at this stage we were given a twin room which was nothing like the room described or paid for Not a good experience Staff very unhelpful ,No Positive
125101,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Not being offered the special offer in the restaurant at night My husband had seen the offer on check in and had to go back to reception to ask for a voucher and then get the different menu , The decor of the room bathroom and the view from the balcony The ferry across to Canary Wharf 
125102,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very disappointing customer service and most importantly our room couldn t of been any more different to the photos online certainly not worth the money we paid ,No Positive
125103,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was noisy and not comfortable We stayed in room 150 If ever offered this room turn it down The constant sound of the boiler with a combination of the lift going up and down in addition to the noisy bed kept me awake all night Thank god check out was 12 00pm as I didn t get to sleep until 5am I did complain at the point of check out and was provided with an email address advising me to contact the member of staff for the purpose of an upgrade next time NO THANKS , Staff were lovely and helpful The boat across the Thames was also a nice touch 
125104,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast was poor compared to other Hilton hotels I ve stayed in Over cooked hash and under cooked scrambled eggs Choice of continental pastries made up for this though Bed was an old fashioned Spring bed but ok for our one night if you don t mind noisy springs Good pub a few hundred yards from hotel , Loved the free ferry and the bar area Would return 
125105,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Expensive food poor for the price no water dispenser and water from bar v expensive standard was no better than premier inn which is much cheaper , Comfy bed modern bathroom cookie on arrival ferry to connect with Thames clipper 
125106,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We was in room 148 We was kept awake most of the night with a buzzing vibrating noise coming from a room next to us I think it was some kind of a boiler room but we was not happy with this There was an open window to this room on our balcony which when we had door open was even worse ,No Positive
125107,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room temperature air con heating is hard to figure out so we were a little bit cold , This place was better than other places we have stayed in and paid more for Just under 200 this suite was luxury We have been here before which is why we decided to come back 
125108,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location is far out from the city if you arrive late in after mid night the ferry is no longer running so you have to walk a distance to the hotel or take a taxi The photos on the website is way better than the actual hotel view and location , Facilities are good and staff are very friendly 
125109,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It s quite expensive in the hotel for food and drinks, The view is wonderful the rooms are very modern and provided with everything you need iron board hairdryer everything you need I also liked that you could go on the boat to Canary Wharf 
125110,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Sometimes we felt too removed from the city We got inaccurate directions twice from two different staff members They were certainly kind and helpful but if they didn t know where they were going they should find someone who does , This hotel is away from the bustle on London clean and comfortable We loved that our room had a view of the Thames city lights The frequent complimentry ferry service to Canary Wharf made traveling to London sights easy and fun Breakfast in the restaurant was wonderful and our son ate free 
125111,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room service messed up my order but not too bad Paying 5 00 room service was a bit harsh when they messed up the drinks but I paid it anyway, Suite was lovely
125112,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The beds were rock hard My neck and back became very sore and stiff I slept poorly and when I slept on the second night I woke with numb hands This is not normal for me , Loved the location on the river and the free ferry tickets Loved the warehouse brick and the look of the hotel 
125113,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location is great but if you don t get back before midnight then you can t use the ferry to cross the river and understanding the us system from Canada Waters from non bus users is a bit tricky so walked Room was very small and while cheaper on the deal compared to travel lodge and premier inn the room is half the size , Over nice clean hotel 
125114,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Comfortable bed nice room good location though last ferry at midnight on a weekend could be a problem for some we had to get from Wembley Breakfast was excellent All staff were friendly and competent The location gave us a chance to explore a different part of London Canary Wharf lots of shops bars and eating places The Docklands Museum is really interesting and well laid out free entry 
125115,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast was good but extremely chaotic people were losing their tables when they went up to get food and there were not enough waiting staff to monitor this , Really comfortable room Loved the warm cookie on arrival lovely touch Beautiful location breakfast with a view 
125116,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I called from the airport to ask for directions to the hotel They told me they didnt really know they transferred me somewhere and nobody picked the phone Considering the roaming cost it was a waste of money I had mentioned in the booking that I was taking my daughter to London as a birthday gift I expected some kind of special attention or at least saying happy birthday to her but none of it happened Getting some food at the bad took ages Bad location if you want to do sightseeing The closest station is quite far , Breakfast was great and the hotel is really nicely arranged Welcome cookie was a great surprise 
125117,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Check in was below standard , Large Rooms and well located for transport by ferry tube and bus Using the Coffee kiosk located near reception with good coffee and pastries fruit salad etc saved a lot on the cost of breakfast 
125118,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bar staff not very organised I m afraid They seemed stressed and understaffed , The location is great if you want to experience the quiet of London and yet you can get into the thick of it by taking the boat into central london Canary Wharf is the river ferry away The breakfast is the best 
125119,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The price was nothing short of extortion 250 per night not including breakfast and that was for the worst room was a complete rip off and I expected more the TV wasn t working for the Manchester Darby the building is worn and like a rabbit warren I feel proper ripped off , The bed
125120,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Lower the price and rating as this hotel does not meet the standard it is priced at , Hotel was looking tired in decor Room was small for a deluxe Lifts were tiny Not worth the money 
125121,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first impression of your room is at the door The doors on our floor all had old screw holes in evidence and different coloured wood where the old room sign had been removed The Hotel needs modernising Whilst the ferry service was very good to the Hotel the extra step was an inconvenience at times Gym equipment needs regular servicing as some was damaged and unusable Complimentary water in the room would have been appreciated for each day of the stay and not just the day of arrival , The night time view from our riverside room was spectacular looking out onto Canary Wharf Good choice for breakfast The outside sitting area was lovely with views across the Thames The regular ferry service was very good to the Hotel 
125122,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, room was very small windows didn t open awkward step from bathroom to room which we kept tripping over TV was in a awkward position not facing the bed but facing the wall had to wait a very long time to be seated for breakfast then there were not any clean plates for the hot food so we had to wait longer for them to get clean ones, great location
125123,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We did not get the room promised a number of the amenities were not in the room Walk in shower fridge etc I was made a special request that was not actioned Plus we ordered room service and asked to pay by card when the staff member arrived he said we could not pay by card I had to walk all the way back to to the front of the hotel to use an ATM woeful , Location
125124,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rooms wasn t that great bedding isn t nice No facilities close by the by water when Costa is closed 50 deposit even though the cost of stay is already paid taken Informed that money goes straight back into account and it does not , The pizza
125125,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, rubbish air con local kids knocking around undesirable rooms And bad location terrible staff, Breakfast receptionist and one of the bar staff were pleasant
125126,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I was very put off by the general state of the room The throw blanket was stained and really dirty Bathroom smelled of mold Too much light in the morning thru the curtains , Nice location on the Riverside complimentary ferry service connecting to Canary Wharf Included breakfast was very nice
125127,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No mini bar AND no bottled water available I think that is retrograde especially as you classify the room as superior Whilst there was an empty ice bucket in the room there weren t obvious instructions how to obtain the ice , Excellent bed with reasonable pillows
125128,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very loud room 236 in the evening and through into the early hours of the morning music from the bar downstairs , Excellent location and decor Very friendly and competent staff at check in Stunning views from the room 
125129,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I had booked a queen full river facing suite but was given a side room even though it was a king suite When I complained I was first told they couldn t change but when I told them that I had specifically booked the queen suite and showed them the booking confirmation they finally relented Not the kind of welcome you expect to receive at a Hilton hotel ,No Positive
125130,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The reception staff are rude and this thing of charging a extra 50 security deposit on arrival is insulting and insinuating the guest is dishonest Booking com should tell us this charge is policy prior to booking , The river view
125131,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I don t like the service charge being added to the drinks bills The drinks are already expensive enough 4 for a green tea It s a tea bag with hot water for goodness sake , This is a really well kept comfortable hotel Staff are pleasant there s some nice subtle touches and it was fairly priced 
125132,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The stairs outside being spiral shape as I only go in lifts However that s being fusy , The breakfast in the morning was lovely And the fery is a brilliant idea made good use of it to get to all the reastraunts and bars on the other side of the river and it s free to use Room was nice and big with the Beauitful river view Staff were all welcoming and lovely 
125133,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I booked a 2 night stay Never like the ground room I was placed in on arrival But this was fairly resolved for my next day stay with a king size suite complemented by the manager , I liked the rooms on the upper level 
125134,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room we had was very small and dark but the give us a better one The pier was nor really confortable if you are travelling with luggage Beati, The views and the ubication are great
125135,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I noticed that for people arriving for a late breakfast about 9 30 there was an extremely long queue fortunately we had had ours , The quiet breakfast area behind the main area 
125136,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When we were given the keys to the room at 5pm we found that the room had not been cleaned so was given another room which was not what we booked no view and a very small window found the room very hot even though there was air conditioning , The hotel was very comfortable and the breakfast very good but restaurant can be busy if going down later 
125137,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room service sandwiches like supermarket or petrol station ones Room service brought a glass of flat Prosecco and said it was just open Rooms advertised with balcony not worth having no view and no seating Incredibly you only get free bottled water on the first night it cost them 10p Asked for milk but non turned up so no water or tea or coffee in the morning Takes ages for anyone to answer the phone reception or room service Ask to speak to manager but he did not phone back Apart from the staff on reception and one or two in the breakfast area the other staff had no idea what they were talking about, The reception staff the breakfast was good
125138,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very badly organised when it came to breakfast The hotel was very busy but having to stand in a queue at the breakfast counter for over 20 minutes was less than satisfactory Also the family room that our friends had booked was not ready on our arrival at 5 30pm and they were told they would have to wait until at least 7pm before the room would be ready , The location and the view from the room 
125139,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast service, Whilst the food was good the queue to be served was horrendous the result of only one poor chef cooking and serving it was a disgrace
125140,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fire alarm system was set off 3 times so a very sleepless night for us , The room was spacious and modern and we had a view of the city and the river which was great We loved the bar with outside seatingLoved the ferry to and from Docklands a nice little novelty 
125141,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff were abrupt at the restaurant when asked for food at 10 30 and said food had stopped being served but the website said until 11pm The restaurant didn t suggest getting food at the bar Had to pay a 50 deposit for the room per night hopefully this will be refunded soon The car park at garage 2 is strange there is no way down to the car park direct from the hotel you have to use the car entrance to access your car and walk across the car park , I liked that you got compilmentary ferry passes to cross the Thames I liked the Costa coffee in house down stairs 
125142,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, had a really small issue with the room took a little while to get hold of someone to get it fixed especially as it only took a couple of minutes to fix , Awesome breakfast really friendly and helpful staff Thought the room and bathroom would be a bit bigger on the small size especially the bathroom 
125143,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location wasn t great and no little gift shops or anything like that would have stayed longer if prices were abit cheaper food prices were rediculous, The views were amazing and restaurant staff were so lovley
125144,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Fire alarm went off twice at night with the only explanation being a fault Staff did not once ask if I had a good stay even on checkout No info given on check in like restaurant here bar there ,No Positive
125145,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No free wifi Breakfast service chaotic and unorganised as had to continuously ask for and fetch items myself , Bed nice and comfy Reception gave Hilton made cookies which tasted great 
125146,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The balcony door needs oiling Very creaky TV needs a bigger wall mount on it so it can swing out to face to bed properly Might apply only to some rooms also arrive later than 3 They seem to struggle having the rooms ready in the time frame they give The adjoining dinning company not so great Employees seemed stressed and come off a bit rude Also very very busy in the morning Other than that place was great , Very good rooms Lovely bathrooms Nice views Great area Nice and peaceful Free boat trips to canary and complementary cookie when u arrive Respectful staff in the hotel part Very clean and we ll maintained Elevator broke and got repaired the same day Staff are very helpful and are about 24 hours a day The area is connected to a walkway along the riverside Looks great at night i recommend this 
125147,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very disappointed we arrived at 6 15pm and our room wasn t ready The check in staff couldn t tell us when it would be ready Had no where to shower or get ready properly for our night out we stayed over the weekend for a special birthday meal Also breakfast was very badly managed Huge queue for the hot meal had to queue for ages didn t go down at all Hotel couldn t cope with being full Wasn t a good experience,No Positive
125148,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Was a really hot weekend and unfortunately the air con didn t seem to be cooling the room much so was very stuffy Also where the large mirror in the room was there was no light so couldn t see much , Very comfy bed and enjoyed the warm chocolate cookie on arrival Ideal to have the ferry across the river too 
125149,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No bath slip pad for our friends room We had one Staff at the tour information need more training for visitors , Location was good Elevators were a little small 
125150,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had breakfest only one morning only one of us and was charged for several days Not right , Everone was very nice and helpfull made our stay very nice 
125151,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Poor room initially but then moved to a nicer room as requested room with a view Some staff unhelpful broken air con However attentive staff when complained and compensated for next stay due to issues , Comfy bed and nice views Nice breakfast plenty of choice Riverboat to Canary Wharf service great nice boat staff Wine and cake sent to room to congratulate us on our anniversary which was a nice touch 
125152,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff at the bar were slow rude The fire alarm went off 3 times during the night meaning we were very tired for our onward travel the following day , Great hotel excellent rooms loved the ferry service 
125153,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were not able to access our room until 16 45 but the reception staff did offer free drinks etc by way of apology , Stunning location beautiful hotel Breakfast was amazing with everything you could think of The staff were friendly rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable We had an amazing river view balcony the view from our room room 441 at night was beautiful The only negative I had was the check in we were supposed to be able to check in at 15 00 but our was not ready until 16 45 this was a bit of a let down but we were given2 lots of drinks vouchers and later that evening a complimentary fruit bowl and drinks I would definitely book this hotel again 
125154,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, At arrival somebody used the toilet in our room and didn t flush Awfull Terrible We ve never experienced this in our livetimes We got offered an other room in which you could not see tv from in your bed Oubviously there was a smaller tv before and now there was a bigger one which was hanging in an angle but the arm was fit for the small tv not for the big one You couldn t turn the tv in full Pffff No tv in the evening , Breakfast was marvelous 3 times hurray Marvelous friendly helpfull beautifull staff Frances and the breakfast team Job more than WELL DONE 
125155,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Views over the Thames were beautiful The complimentary ferry across the Thames was incredibly useful The staff were very nice and the breakfast superb 
125156,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Pillows too soft Also in the rooms some lights were not working so it would be good that your housekeeping checks these ahead Provide a small fridge so we can store stuff for our snacks cold drinks tks
125157,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Arrived in the hotel in the morning to leave some bags I asked them if they have my details as I booked my room a couple of weeks back via booking com but they said my name was not on the system even when I showed them my confirmation email They assured me that they will fix it but when we came back at night to check in they still said I wasn t on the system Then I heard another person complaining because she was in the same situation as me ,No Positive
125158,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was quite a long wait at the breakfast area But that was it Certainly nothing that would stop me coming back The bottled water was expensive too , The beds were so comfy the staff were brilliant food was great and it was very cheap The location is amazing too 
125159,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Paid for a deluxe King room with balcony but the room was small and there were no chairs on the balcony so we couldn t sit out there Also it overlooked a car park and tennis courts should have booked a river view room The housekeeping staff knocked on our door twice way before check out time 12 00 asking what time we were leaving so we felt rushed to get out the room When I booked the room it said breakfast included but when I checked in we were told it was not The tv in the room was on a wall next to the bed and it wasn t on hinges so we had to lay side ways on the bed to watch it bit strange , The hotel was in a perfect location with the complimentary ferry over to Canary Wharf until 12 at night very handy to go for drinks in the city The bed was so comfortable and big We couldn t hear any noise from other guests in the hotel which was great as this is usually a problem in big hotels We had dinner in the Columbia restaurant which was amazing and really good value for money the bar was lovely too and it wasn t too expensive for drinks 
125160,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was so small and very claustrophobic View was in to next room and i could of crawlled in to their room and vice verca as the locks were broke on window Noisy at night Will not be staying again awful , Location
125161,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff on the reception desk are polite but painfully slow We were initially allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the description on booking com We returned to reception to be greeted yet again with a long queue too few staff and another painful wait Finally we were given another room slightly better but it didn t match the criteria that we d booked This whole situation had taken far too long We were due at another appointment for a very specific time and were late The reception desk is the front line they should be reassuring alert and quick the staff here at Doubletree Docklands are non of these We have stayed at other Doubletree Hotels and had a wonderful experience and that s why we chose this one Think very carefully about booking this hotel it s nowhere near the standard of the others , The best bit about this hotel was checking out 
125162,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom felt a little tired the grouting was extremely discoloured and whilst I m sure this is down to age it made the bathroom feel slightly unclean The bedding also smelt slightly damp , The view from the room was lovely The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good 
125163,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The persons at the front desk were all very helpful and nice The location is ideal for making a short trip to Greenwich on the river on the sunny day as well as is convenient for both the underground and DLR The hotel ferry across the river run frequently so the access to Canary Wharf was good Enjoyed the breakfast with the view of a heron and seagulls 
125164,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location is challenging if weather is not great as you need to pay for a cab or get a boat across the river and walk 10 minutes for the tube Breakfast was below average and the building needs some TLC Our room at first was a box looking at other people s window so you must fight for the right one You don t get necessarily what the photos shows , Views from the bedroom IF you get a decent one Comfy bed 
125165,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Long queues to check in Someone elses underwear in drawers No answer on careline Room Temp control not working Big leak outside room Had to visit reception x3 to get TV remote that worked Costa coffee bar not open as advertised, cookies Free ferry Room decor
125166,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Could hear people in corridor when room door was shut , Decent room size Breakfast staff were VERY friendly and professional Decoration style nice Good location for public transport 
125167,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing the deal was really great , The amazing location for a business trip and the way they made it convenient for leisure travellers too I think going there for vacations must be great as well due to the shuttle boat and the excellent connection with Canary Wharf Jubilee line Also a special mention for the restaurant and the sunny terrace from which one can get wifi an AMAZING spot to work while enjoying the weather the waves on the Thames river and the view over Canary Wharf I m used to staying at Hilton and DoubleTree especially but this one was a very good surprise I d stayed once a couple of years ago but it was winter and I couldn t enjoy the whole facilities 
125168,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Better notification of having to get a boat across to the hotel Didn t cause a problem for us but did add time on to our journey times , Breakfast was good We were in a nice quiet part of the hotel comfortable room 
125169,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, That I have paid for breakfast online but wasn t included upon arrival Pre pay 50 upon arrival incase of damages wasn t notified when booking only told when checking in with it taking 2 3 working days to be put into your bank , The view was amazing from every angle of the hotel Our room King deluxe was very clean and well kept Bar had lots of variation Hotel staff were friendly and helpful Unique experience different side has been seen to London 
125170,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the queue for breakfast was huge but nothing we couldn t handle and the bar was a bit pricey, the rooms were lovely with brilliant rooms and the location was excellent for our plans the free ferry service was excellent and we will definitely be returning
125171,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, AC didn t hold out well 34c in London during stay , Buffet overlooking Thames a great way to start the day Location was quiet with easy access to transit 
125172,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I had contacted both the hotel and used the chat option on the Hilton website as I am a photographer and required uninterrupted views of Canary Wharf Both recommended the same room so that s what I booked however the only way to get a view of Canary wharf was to stand on tip toe and hang out of the window Thankfully there is an outside area that I could use for taking pictures but if the weather had been bad this would not have been possible Not the view I was promised by reception or the person on chat The staff seemed to lack training subsequently some were great and others were unsure of pretty much everything In some cases the bar for example the staff were good but way to stretched which did not help them or the customers , The hotel looked good nice room lovely touch with the cookie when you arrive Some of the staff were extremely good
125173,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff were rude from start to finish we were checked into our room late after emails months in advance about early check which was great after a 4am flight My wife fell asleep in the lobby she was so exhausted Multiple people were checked in ahead of us and all they could say was its not ready No apology or niceties were given My wife and I were both ignored in the bar more than once to the point were we just left Horrible experience and we won t be back I wouldn t even give 1 star considering how expensive the room was I have stayed in hostels and had a better experience for 13 pound a night not 110 Oh and they also tried to charge us extra for the room claiming that this was their policy even though the price on booking com was final ,No Positive
125174,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The TV didn t work and I queued 3 separate occasions for over 25 mins Wasted time especially when we had things planned to do and panicked about doing them and arriving on time Not good , The view from the room was incredible
125175,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The electricity cut out TWICE in our room That doesn t even happen in a 1star hotel Not happy Manager tried to bribe us with a free 60 breakfast who the hell pays 60 for breakfast Room layout was ridiculous The door just missed the bed when opened Bathroom smelt like damp They refunded me 50 after complaining twice which I was still not happy to pay but I had had enough by then and just wanted to leave Would not stay again ,No Positive
125176,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Terrible parking which we were charged twice for then had to carry our cases up two flights of stairs to reception Long queues for checking in checking out breakfast Rude hotel staff housekeeping supervisor barged in our room whithout knocking telling us we shouldn t be in the room then after nearly an hour of waiting not knowing what was going on we were told we could stay in the room Paid extra for a bigger room with balcony and river city view but the room still felt cramped and the bathroom was tiny the door hit the loo when you opened it and there was barely a square foot to stand in the whole bathroom As for the balcony with view the river city could only be seen if you stood right at the edge of the balcony and stretched your neck right over and round Poor quality breakfast bacon was more fat than meat and the rest was tasteless When I tried to complain whilst checking out I was shot down and ushered off as quickly as possible Real let down expected a lot more from this hotel , Good location free ferry over to Canary Wharf for hotel guests
125177,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Oh dear We arrived early during the day and from the way we were received and welcomed I thought this was going to be an amazing stay Unfortunately I would be sorely disappointed The service I received from the night staff was the worst I have ever seen and received and for the last 18 months I spent at the very least 5 to 10 days a month in a hotel I thought I seen it all First night having requested before my arrival foam bedding through Hilton Honors my wife s allergic feather down as silver status member I am apparently entitled to this but alas I didn t find any I tried to call and left the phone on speaker for a good 15 minutes before I hung up I tried another number that they made available apparently this number was supposed to make your stay better and no answer again Then I had to trek five floors down through a maze of rooms on the ground floor you have to see how poor the floor layout is to appreciate the strain and when I finally got to reception guy told me they never answer their phones on weekends because the phones are serviced He also told me it would be impossible to get any foam bedding because he could not leave the front desk because pointing at the queues of people behind me I returned my wife removed all the bedding and we were prepared to sleep on a naked bed when bless his soul he managed to give us one paltry foam pillow The next day when I went downstairs and reported the lack of foam bedding Maria was amazing she apologised for the inconveniences and assured that the matter would be resolved without any hassle and she kept her promise I thought ok perhaps dude from the night before had a bad day hey I worked in customer services for many years in many ways as a government official I still do so I know you cant always have your A game on when it comes to customers I forgave him and Doubletree , The day staff the location were great 
125178,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I didn t like how long you had to wait for breakfast It took about 15mins before we were seated But the food was very nice , The beds are very cosy and the shower was brilliant 
125179,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Queuing for 45 minutes to check in with nobody explaining why it was taking so long and it was very unwelcoming When we came down 25 minutes later there was still a queue The tv in the room was in an awkward position When we arrived back on Saturday evening there was nowhere to sit in the bar so we went outside only to be told that the area was closed so we went to bed Breakfast was disorganised though I had spoken to the kitchen about gluten free toast when it arrived it the bread hadn t been toasted and the waiter suggested we put it in the ordinary toaster When we checked out the receptionist didn t even ask if we had had a good stay Definitely won t be coming back , The bed was comfortable and the free ferry service 
125180,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Cleanliness of rooms one room had a filthy bath that we had to call housekeeping up to sort out the other room was left for us with a very smelly used and unflushed toilet The bar prices were high but the bar service was a disgrace Not what we expected from the Hilton group, Location
125181,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast was joke the queues for getting in and the queues for getting your breakfast having to borrow source From other tables no hot water to make a cup of tea no orange juice,No Positive
125182,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Too many people for breakfast dining room and cook station couldn t cope Both mornings has to queue out side restaurant and wait for table On Sunday morning when we were at the cook station waiting twice our table was cleared as if we had left Very unorganised , Lovely terrace on the side of the river very well furnished 
125183,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No biscuits in the room to have with my tea, The hotel was very clean and the surrounding area was clean as well The staff were very professional One person in particular is a asset to the hotel I do not know her name she worked in the bar Saturday afternoon 
125184,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were given a single occupancy room in error but the hotel was sold out so had no choice but to stay there The room was tiny The bed was tiny and it had the quality of furniture you would expect in a hostel not a 4 hotel Took 35 minutes just to check in Restaurant lost our reservation , Nothing the entire experience was a shambles 
125185,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booked a King size bed got two uneven twin mattresses pushed together Staff overwhelmed at front desk waited over an hour for assistance before giving up ,No Positive
125186,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Check in reception inefficiency , Check in shocking I went early prior to my brothers and sister in law check in to make sure everything would run smoothly Staff chaotic Need training to deal quickly and efficiently with one customer at a time and not be distracted by other staffs requests When my brother did check in they unable to find the booking until I gave the member of staffs name I had spoken to earlier in the day 
125187,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bath was filthy room was next to a lift which vibrated the walls everytime it went past Couldn t cater for the guests had to wait almost 35 mins for some of the breakfast to be available , Rooms were nice food was nice location was excellent 
125188,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Extra net needed over balcony door so you could have more privacy as being looked over by people opposite, That the staff were very helpful added bonus we got upgraded
125189,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Some staff were a little abrupt and rude but I understand this has a lot to do with their poor English The breakfast was appalling cold lack of choice tasteless and very very untidy with lack of cutlery and crockery , Balcony looking onto the Thames We initially thought the ferry to and from the hotel would be a bit cumbersome but it was a novelty and very reliable 
125190,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Unexpected charge on my credit card Room had French windows opening to fire escape balcony accessible by other guests Could not keep the door open at night , Staff were friendly and breakfast abundant Free ferry to Canary Wharf
125191,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, A small size room with a normal size bed does not make our room a deluxe executive queen suit I felt I was misled pictures of room discription no not match will not book here again WiFi hit miss no hot water for 1night the next day, Decking area
125192,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast could have been better It should have been 23 and I certainly wouldn t have paid that for a buffet breakfast Grumbled at 16 95 It was cold and I certainly want waiting on for that money not having to collect my own tea and make my own toast or have to queue for it But the hotel made it right so I am pleased with the outcome , The staff were excellent Parking facilities excellent complimentary service to Canary Wharf was also excellent Room was clean and tidy Our overall staff was excellent will be staying again
125193,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I planned the nights stay here as a surprise for my boyfriend It was supposed to be a luxury getaway based on the amount I paid I booked a table ahead of schedule and the only time available which was 10pm Admittedly we were a little late The member of staff then appeared so desperate to clock off that he made us feel like we were an inconvenience The food was average Lack of facilities in the bedroom meant I couldn t even make a coffee in the morning Overall I feel disappointed by the stay and the service we were given ultimately a waste of money on something that was meant to be special ,No Positive
125194,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Restaurant seemed a bit overpriced but we never tried it out so for all we know it could have been outstanding , Lovely hotel with cool interior and a brilliant breakfast Friendly staff Super quiet and peaceful Also the free boat over to canary wharf was a major plus for us as we were going to the o2 everyday and also allowed us to take a riverboat into central London They also have a costa in the hotel which was a fun addition 
125195,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, in a quiet residential area too out the way Very expensive soft drinks in bar service on food very slow Room too warm no air con , Lovely view at the outdoor terrace bar good breakfast 
125196,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Curtain net could do with reaching across whole window for privacy Prices of drink and food with service charge completely crazy 4 40 for water Otherwise very nice hotel , Well maintained hotel shuttle ferry across river convenient Room lovely bed very comfortable 
125197,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing that we can think of The travel advice maybe could be better or if you could provide a map as the direction of the hotel to Canary wharf quay is not evident from the railway station Also which is best Station Thanks , The Bed was fab and it felt like a real little holiday break The breakfast was excellent and it was lovely to sit on the terrace The staff were really attentive despite beinbg busy 
125198,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I was told a river view but it wasn t one really it was a side on river view lookjng through buldings misleading also not happy that if lying in bed the tv is fitted to a left hand wall so you can not see the screen properly receptionist were very busy I gave up queuing as took too long , Lovely staff lovely and clean hotel breakfast excellent Beautiful river view from bar dinning rooms and reception 
125199,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The hotel had a beautiful layout with a classy feel the free boat to and from the other side of the Thames was just a thoughtful idea and just adds to your stay The find gesture of the warm chocolate cookies when you check just makes you feel that the staff are going out of there way to welcome you The rooms were so clean and tidy and the views were amazing would 1000 per cent recommend this hotel to everybody 
125200,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Beds were comfy View was amazing Fresh cookies on arrival Amazing room Best hotel I ve ever stayed in Free tickets for ferry was amazing Location beautiful and restaurants available 
125201,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing, The location is brilliant overlooking the Thames and Canary Wharf Free ferry across the other side of the Thames to reach Tube or DLR stations short walk away 
125202,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I ve stayed for a night Saturday the 23rd of July I booked through booking com and on the websites states room with view I ve called in advance to have a arranged a small cake and an happy anniversary message in my room And I did state that I would come for a late check in on booking And I confirmed the booking the day before arrival On arrival we are sent to a room with no view and no happy anniversary message in my room The night was already ruined The receptionist offered us a cold or hot beverage to convince us to accept the room and stating that there were no room available with view I refused and he called the manager After 20 min wait the manager showed up and suddenly there was a room available however the room was half the size and the air conditioning was not working And there was a only a side view of the promised view on the websites So the room was super hot and we had to keep opening and closing the room to keep the right temperature The manager promised a bottle of prosecco I waited about an hour for the bottle and I had to go downstairs at the bar and pick it up myself dreadful In addition no one was answering the phone at reception so I couldn t really ask for anything So I ve managed to start my already ruined night at about 2 o clock at night I m addition there were only two hand towel in the room so I had to go downstairs and again cause no one was answering the phone and ask for them The receptionist arrived later with towels still wrapped in the delivery bag and with an annoyed face he gave to me I got surprised he didn t threw them in my face So I will definitely not trust anymore Hilton chain as I ve been let down greatly and ruined my anniversary with my wife , The bed was comfortable
125203,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Didn t like the way the way one of the receptionists would make a face and look a customer up and down after checking each one in as they walked away Aircon in room wasn t working the first night and the second night we had a ceiling leak so had to be moved at 1am in the morning , loved the location and facilities food and drinks The way we were looked after after some room issues 
125204,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was stuffy and smelt stale not what you expect when your paying the cost you are Also the room I booked was a deluxe queen room which was not deluxe by any means the bed was a standard double bed the bathroom was tiny there was nothing about the hotel that stood apart from a cheaper priced one the price you pay is for the name of the hotel it s most certainly is not reflected in what you get I will not stay there again also the photos advertised with the hotel are very missleading, The bed was comfortable
125205,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, River view was a very bad stretch of the neck over a balcony need to be honest guys my view was a tennis court , Location location location free pass on the ferry 
125206,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rooms are very congested booking com confirmed the size of the room as 35 square meters however it was not even half the size Bathroom is so small you can t even move The staff were not supporting courteous Location is not great as well ,No Positive
125207,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Check in and check out took a long time Room cost was charged to our credit card even though I said I wanted to pay in cash Room was very hot as couldn t use air conditioning because it was too noisy I advised at the time of booking that it was my 25th wedding anniversary but we weren t given anything complimentary , Excellent choice at breakfast Service in the restaurant at dinner was very friendly Bedroom and bathroom very clean 
125208,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only thing I could think of was the car park entrance could be clearer and having to use the second entrance door , I think if we decided to go to London we would definitely go back to that hotel
125209,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I thought this hotel was great I will definitely recommend it and stay there again The staff were very friendly and helpful The public spaces were well thought out the riverside terrace was great 
125210,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were given biscuits when we arrived which we didn t eat straight away Arrived back in our room on Saturday after being out all day to find that one of our biscuits was missing Might seem petty but it is still stealing Surprised also that bottled water is not supplied in the rooms Had a meal in the bar on the Friday night it was just average, Bed was comfy shower was amazing and breakfast was excellent 
125211,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Low floor room not great soundproofing could hear lots of external noise and in particular was woken by ice machine in corridor throughout night A room with a good view would have been a bonus but a lovely hotel nonetheless , My daughter and her boyfriend were attending the Star Wars convention at the Excel I treated them to a night at the hotel and they raved about it They loved the complimentary ferry to Canary Wharf and cookies on arrival They were also allowed early access to room 
125212,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was one lady at the reception and her attention was not pleasant But apart from that the other staff was good, Few is the staff was helpful for instance the black chief and the new Italian girl at the breakfast The lady offered us a better room because we wasn t happy with the room they gave us This was very good costumer service
125213,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Rather long wait to book in staff being held up by people booking on the door Pre booked could have had a priority queue , Balcony view over river exceptionally quiet no traffic noise despite balcony door open all night Open door meant cool room although middle of that heat wave
125214,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Here go I got my hotel on an offer if I had paid 300 a nite I would been happy I was in room 862 as I was in my room I could hear lots of shouting When looked outside it was a group of teenagers shouting up at another customer on opposite side and lots of sweating from both sides so as you can see 300 a nite to listen to that for over an hour or so not good we had no sleep as lots of noise would I go back no, The staff were very polite and helpful the breakfast was brilliant overall the hotel was OK
125215,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was small there was bird poo and a cigarette butt on the balcony the bathroom was tiny doesn t reflect on the pictures at all no wifi in rooms have to pay 15 a day , The free ferry over to the hotel
125216,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Car park was broken so had to walk away to get to the car Food and drink very expensive even at London prices 13 quid for 2 drinks No close tube, Nice hotel in general just had a few issues Breakfast service very good
125217,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The toilet didn t flush very well , The room was lovely clean and modern Staff were welcoming and helpful Breakfast was really nice too Would definitely stay again 
125218,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bed was broken tiles in bathroom broken asked for a higher floor room was put on ground floor Ferry doesn t run at peak time for dinner which made us miss our reservation , Terrace bar area was lovely for an evening drink
125219,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bed wasn t too comfy Not enough options on room service on the after hours menu, Location is superb with direct access to canary wharf The room was Very clean warm and a nice atmosphere 
125220,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Classic room was tiny bed up against wall which would have been an issue if more than one person was staying, Quick and easy check in Great views over Canary Wharf 
125221,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I did not like the bed much it was confusing like a water bed but not a water bed Snd there was some mess under the bed and stickyness on the papers, I liked the big room and the cookies cookies were the shizzle
125222,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms and bathrooms were a lot smaller compared with the Marriott which is a short distance away and cheaper staff talk to each other whilst serving you which feels a little rude they Rush through the check in I missed the small print where they actually debit your account of a further 100 on top of the room cost then refund it back within 5 days where they know there has been no damage theft I called about this and was told to call back if the money doesn t go in annoying The worst part of this experience was breakfast having arrived at a busy time I had to queue for about 20mins not too much of a problem but what really annoyed me was that we were queuing when we could see lots of empty vacated tables which just needed cleaning however there was a shortage of staff so the tables were not being cleaned until a lot later than the guests had exited probably to ensure that they had actually finished and not gone to get more food perhaps Also annoying was the girl at the front restaurant desk in front of the queue who would see people walk up let them join the back of the line then bark at them saying excuse me you have to give me your room number first before you line up not what was expected for a Hilton hotel , I like the location for Canary wharf it is really close by the rooms and hotel were clean there s a coffee shop inside the designs of the rooms were very nice and sophisticated and the beds were comfy
125223,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked a river view room only to be given a room with no view at all This is false advertising by Double Tree needs to stop We were very dissapointed by this , Very friendly staff clean rooms Excellent breakfast options
125224,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Needed to access tube early on Sunday morning before the ferry was open Had to pay 5 for a taxi to the station very inconvenient as its a fair walk to the stations ,No Positive
125225,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Would have preferred to have had a room looking directly out over the river rather than at the side of the building as being somewhat over the carpark caused a little disturbance sadly, Breakfast was exceptionally good service was excellent and the ferry kind of quirky but we liked it 
125226,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No fillet steak temporary taken off the menu but Victoria did get the chef to cook two excellent thank you , Our restaurant manageress was very helpful as we did have two small issues which she dealt with no hesitation friendly and helpful her name Victoria on duty Friday Saturday 8 9 July
125227,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, charge for early check in even though they advised we could check in if room ready Given wrong room complained and Manager rude Have written letter to hotel , modern good views nice atmosphere
125228,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Could have been emailed to advise ferry was not running instead of having to travel to ferry port and then travel back again Had we have had plans it could have delayed us Member of staff could have been more friendly as seemed short but got us checked in,No Positive
125229,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms although look big are tiny Toilet door was hitting the toilet bed was super noisy for the price you pay you should get free wifi and not have to pay for it luckily was out of the room most of the time spent there , Complimentary cookie on arrival ferry service the balcony relaxing feel of the lobby 
125230,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I m being extra picky here but the coffee at breakfast wasn t the best to be fair I m a coffee addict and take it seriously and had I had breakfast both days I might have got my coffee from Costa in the hotel the second day , I thought the whole experience was great from the Reception Staff who were so friendly and helpful to the location the use of the water taxi and when that was not working on Saturday morning the hotel arranged free taxi rides to the nearest tube I loved my room which was modern and clean and the bed super comfy I only got to eat breakfast the once but the staff were efficient and friendly There was a wide range of food 
125231,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact that the ferry had broken down and there was no one to let us know this and had to make a rushed dash to the tube to make an appointment Costa coffee was very slow and coffee was cold , Loved the river location 
125232,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Ferry wasn t working on the Saturday and we were not informed by staff even though I d asked for an extra ticket at reception that morning Only informed about replacement taxis after asking what was happening Receptionist extremely difficult to understand English is my mother tongue but I had ask him to repeat himself several times Extremely slow bar service I was the only person at the bar however the bartender continued to clear empty tables for another 5 minutes even though he was aware I was waiting , Great breakfast and lovely outside terrace area
125233,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I had a rather frustrating experience I booked the room because it came with a guaranteed view and a bathtub in reality the room looked out onto another building through dirty windows So I complained and the staff tried to be helpful upgrading me to a room with a view of the river I was so pleased until I actually got inside the room It was a family room and had two double beds in it and wasn t cosy or nice at all For a romantic getaway with my boyfriend it just all felt so wrong The bath drain didn t work so we couldn t have a bath And the toilet didn t flush properly It was supposed to be a special night away for us an anniversary and birthday celebration and ended up being rather a let down in terms of the room and facilities etc I had also called ahead twice to stress that it was a special occasion confirm that I would have a view of the river and ask for some wine glasses to be in the room which I was assured I would get and never got When I checked in I asked again and still never got wine glasses Which is just freaking annoying , The staff genuinely tried to help with the issues I had However even in helping they didn t really the room we got shifted into was not nice at all a big open space in the room without chairs or anything even though it did have a view of the river sure It didn t feel warm and cosy and romantic I was really disappointed with the whole experience You expect more from a Hilton It wasn t cheap either 
125234,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff not very helpful we had special requests which were ignored breakfast service and bar service slow They always seemed a little short staffed room was small, The bed was amazing slept so well beautiful location lovely views
125235,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Great location for 02 the ferry was great and we got ferry from hotel to 02 which was so easy and stress free Great terrace bar for cocktails before Breakfast was lovely huge choice Room was modern with balcony and river view
125236,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location isnt very close to any tube stations so not having a car isnt a option , The bed was very comfortable There was a lot of option for breakfast
125237,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No service charge we would instead leave a tip the pizza at the bar tasted like it was cooked from frozen and not freshly prepared for the price of it , The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size We had a good view and the complimentary boat service was nice touch The bars were nice but should not include service charge Overall I would come back such a nice treat The homemade cookies were amazing a classy hotel 
125238,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was very small and not decorated to the standard of a four star hotel Balcony was filthy and we had staff walking from corridors onto our balcony to get to the other side very early in the morning We were not told about room deposit until we checked in which was inconvenient I feel the room was not value for money , Ferry was a nice touch Staff were pleasant 
125239,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room did not have double doors opening out to a large balcony as the photo alongside the room showed when I booked The tv was on a bracket that only pulled out far enough to watch from the door not while sat on the bed also there were no plug sockets near a mirror which made drying my hair quite difficult in the morning, The staff were friendly and bed was comfy and the shower was good
125240,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Well no one had told us when booking that to access the hotel you need to get a ferry This really restricted what we had planned to do as the last ferry back we just before 12 , Lively hotel really picturesque One of the best hotel breakfasts I ve had and staff were great
125241,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing But Location won t be for everyone especially if wanting to visit touristy bits of London If that s what you want stay closer to centre , The view from our room and the bar terrace was amazing at night The boat across to Canary Wharf so that we could eat and shop Location great for the O2 Nice and quiet especially at weekends 
125242,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Great rooms in a spectacular setting of this fine hotel looking across to the wonders of Canary Wharf and all the interesting river transport and tidal variations Great location for short or long stay trips to London particularly recommended is the walk along Thames Path to central London Great Gym at the hotel too good beer at the bar free ferry fantastic breakfast need we go on more 
125243,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No hair dryer in the room , Bed comfy Plenty of tea coffee Staff helpful friendly on check in Free ferrie travel Highly recommend Great hotel 
125244,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our first room was horrible Really really small and was i think in the middle of the hotel had one small window overlooking the ceiling of the hotel But we went back down to reception and luckily got a much nicer room , The location of this hotel is great we used it as a base for an event at the O2 They offer a free boat service across the Thames where you can get the clipper service to the O2 The room was great although our first room was AWFUL but the lady at reception was nice enough to give us an upgrade We had a balcony over looking the Thames and it was just really lovely Also the bar in this place Just go its beautiful just to sit out on the river watching the world go by at whilst having a nice drink and a bite to eat Also breakfast is really worth getting huge buffet with really yummy food 
125245,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The corridors seems a bit tiny and scary at first but it is due to the original architecture of the building old docks , Easy to reach metro 5mn bus which are very frequent Amazing and unique view on the thames from the room Brunch on the riverside Clean rooms Very friendly staff Free hot cookie at arrival Very good deal for money Excellent breakfast included in room s price
125246,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The view paid for a city river view but could only really see the ferry dock the roof of the walkway connecting to the other half of the hotel Not exactly the prettiest of views The wifi didn t work properly which wasn t ideal Our room was right invetween the boiler room and the lift so all we could hear throughout the night was the pressure valve in the boiler and the lift shaft clanging The price that we paid for the room 200 just for 1 night I feel wasn t justified with what we received Of all the things we were promised when booking the two most important things the river view and the city view were amongst others the two biggest things lacking I would stay here again if the prices were lowered , The complimentary giant cookies The size of the room it wasn t overly big but had everything you needed The shower was extremely nice may sound silly but the water was really soft Complimentary ferry service to Canary Wharf for people staying at the hotel just show your key I personally feel the hotel would ve been better for prolonged stays I was only there for 1 night 
125247,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Fabulous stay from arrival to departure first class Staff very helpful and friendly Excellent location free ferry over the Thames to Canary Wharf with excellent shops bars restaurants and metro to all London areas and beyond Room beautiful such a comfy bed Second visit and will be back Breakfast amazing all fresh everything you could want Close to all London has to offer but discreet enough to allow you quiet as well A fab London pub couple of doors down and a posh bar bistro a lovely stroll down the Thames away You will love it xxxx
125248,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, An automatic service charge added to my bill of around 15 just for ordering 2 bottles of cider and a pizza in the bar , The room was quiet and very clean The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable We both had a fantastic nights sleep The breakfast was also very good 
125249,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff were not very helpful We requested room service at 11pm but were told this had stopped After a lot of probing we discovered that the bar was still serving hot food we had to get it ourselves though and wait at the bar whilst it cooked and carry it through the hotel up the lift into our room rubbish service We would have been happy to pay a tray charge and not what I d expect from a Hilton Other hotel room services will do everything to help and make your stay relaxing Bar staff not very attentive one member of staff spilt a whole bottle of coke over the bar which went all over the bar stool and floor but made no attempt to tidy or rectify so it was left dripping and unsightly whilst she stood around chatting , Beds were super comfy breakfast was lovely Check in staff were very friendly great free boat service to the hotel and back to Canary Wharf
125250,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The incredibly creaky floor boards in the room were really loud probably not great for the people below us but otheriwise nothing Quite a time to travel to the near undergrounds if you have a short stay and a lot to do , Breakfast was really huge and all fresh each morning The rooms were very clean and there was plenty of space for all of our stuff After an issue with the air con the staff were really helpful and moved us straight away to a better room that was bigger still Even though we re quite young it was nice to be treated the same as any older guests would have been 
125251,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Everything This was not 1 2 miles from the O2 bathroom was filthy staff was unhelpful Tried to order room service for 30 mins and they kept picking up the phone and putting the phone down ,No Positive
125252,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Firstly when we got in our room and started to unpack we found a pair of ladies underwear not my wife s then my wife found a pubic hair in the bath The next morning at breakfast my wife went to have some cheese which was in a wrapper and noticed it was a month out of date We told a woman that looked like she was managing the breakfast about the cheese in which she did say sorry and walked off with it After that we did not see her again and we was there for at least another half a hour after To top it all off as we checked out we went down to the car park to set off home As we got to the shutters they did not open so we parked back up and went to reception to find out how we get out That s when we got told that we need a car park coin to get out why we was not given this when we checked out I don t know as I paid for the parking whilst checking out so then we finally thought we was ready to go but no we couldn t get out still because the had done the same to two other cars My wife went back upstairs to tell them what was going on She came back down with a caretaker sort of guy who said to my wife I don t know why they always do this Meaning this is an ongoing problem The staff where rubbish at this hotel they defiantly need more training I would not recommend this hotel and I most certainly never stay there again, The bed was good and the room was a good size
125253,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff I was given a double room with no balcony without being told anything I went to reception told them this is not the room I paid for I paid for a queen with balcony and views and was told sorry we are extremely busy tonight we only have that room I said that s unexceptable they told me do you love on London we can redund you money and come and stay with us another night when I was 3 in morning had to organise a babysitter ect also underground car park was full,No Positive
125254,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The help that was given to me when I had come to the wrong hotel having made an error when booking Reception staff were very obliging and made calls on my behalf to the booking company and also the other hotel All was sorted and we will definitely stay at this hotel again and use the booking company 
125255,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No competent and strong assistance with bags All on staff at checkin were very slight women physically Unequipped for bag assistance though willing Then when I was checking out there was no one available at all for bag assistance , Location location location Can t be beat Great shuttle service to Canary Wharf 
125256,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was nothing I didn t like , Very relaxing hotel Great outside bar and food Fabulous courtesy boat Nice size room Hotel parking Easy access to the 02 arena

125258,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bar staff in the evening were awful didn t know what they were doing didn t know whether or not they were serving food and took far too long to make drinks and serve you I had also informed the hotel that it was my partners 21st birthday and it would be nice if they could make the room just that extra bit special but no such extras were made which is a shame cause I would have been happy to pay for a bottle of champagne or something in the room on arrival There was a long queue to check in and out we were also woken up by a cleaner in the morning continuously knocking on the door and then when we answered she simply said it was the wrong room Staff at breakfast were not very helpful either although the food was nice and there was a great selection there was no coffee and no one to ask for help , The room was lovely bed super comfy and loads of space in the junior suit Bathroom was very nice and clean Lovely views along the Thames The ferry was also very convenient as dropped you at the hotel Overall the trip was pleasant but would have been greatly improved by better customer service 
125259,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Amazing location I loved the fact it way quiet and I fell in love with the design and the location of the hotel You get a pass for the water ferry which took us over the river Nice little perk Although the hotel itself was a bit of a labyrinth our room was a decent size and had a very pleasant deco Pretty quiet Only down was that we couldn t access our balcony would ve been nice to sit out w a drink however when mentioned at check out staff very helpfully mentioned to ask on next booking you d like a balcony Breakfast amazing restaurant very nice beautiful sitting outside by the river Loved it Will be defo back w the family

125261,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It would be useful to have better signage at Canary Wharfe station for directions to the ferry , The bed was extremely comfortable and the room a good size It was lovely having the little balcony and being able to step out to look over the river We left the door open for a while to enjoy the pleasant breeze The complimentary ferry was useful although we preferred taking the bus to Canada Water to pick up the tube into the city The breakfast menu offered was varied and delicious As the weather was good we enjoyed sitting outside on the terrace to eat All the staff we encountered were polite helpful and professional 
125262,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Not a big fan of feathered pillows but the bed and room was comfy with good facilities Excellent and friendly room service gave me a freebie too Warm cookie on arrival was a nice touch Lovely breakfast huge variety Was very happy with my stay will definatley come again Also the ferry over the river was just beautiful Wasn t expecting a boat ride Loved it 
125263,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, To say the hotel had been refurbished the quality of the room was poor Soap dish hung off the wall in shower and various botched patched up repairs, great choice for breakfast staff couldn t be more helpful
125264,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Could not see TV from the bed paid for city river view got a view of residential apartments , The bed was extremely comfy and the choice for breakfast outstanding

125266,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When we first arrived I had booked a room witha private balcony and a partial sea view They gave us a tiny room with a tiny window with no view or balcany like I had booked The problem was that I had booked this room especially as an anniversary gift but they gave us a very subpar room Thankfully they changed the room for me after a little complaining and the new room was much better and overall didn t spoil our stay , The location the food the atmosphere and the room was great with a fantastic view
125267,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I had purchased a deluxe King room with balcony and was also told that I would be able to check into my room early 12 1pm Upon arriving they said that the room wasn t ready but we were able to leave our bag with them in a safe place When we eventually got into the hotel room at night time we found that our king bed was in fact two single beds pushed together there was no balcony whatsoever and the bathroom wasn t great The power of the shower was also very weak which left us disappointed the morning after Overall I feel that this hotel was not value for money whatsoever and me and my partner both feel very disappointed by this hotel and its facilities , The mattress on the single beds were comfortable and hotel lobby was nice

125271,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast was expensive and not very good quality sausages were cheap and toast cold and soggy The maids walked in on our room prior to our check out wife still in bed , The free ferry Friendly staff Room was nice and clean but not worth the money Shower powerful Big Bed

125273,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The position of the TV in the room was NOT properly adjusted for guest viewing and could not be changed The bathroom was small and toiletries occupied almost the whole space available on the shelf in front of the mirror leaving almost no space for our personal items It has been a long walk through narrow corridors to the lift The Wi fi connection was usually very poor or completely unavailable in the room especially at night , The king size bed is wide and very comfortable bedside lighting is very convenient The design of the room is nice even for a long term stay All members of the staff are friendly and help you asap

125275,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The car park located in the hotel was completely full so we had to park our car outside down the road When we arrived they told us our room was no longer available and gave us a different room We took the key and went into the room to find they had given us a key for someone else s room with all they re belongings in there I was mortified I would hope that my possessions Are safe in the room but this made me uneasy The rooms were ok basic nothing amazing for the money , The free token for boat ride across the water
125276,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booked a room with a balcony but you could only see the view of the river and Canary Wharf at the end of the balcony the rest faced another building We had to leave the public terrace at 11pm which was a shame as we were enjoying the view and we were being quiet , Fabulous choice in the breakfast buffet with a great selection Bed was super comfy and staff were friendly and helpful Would definitely stay here again Ferry was useful Nice and quiet

125282,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff was very helpful but we had a small confusion upon our arrival The receptionist gave us a room with partial side view on the river whilst we ve booked one with full view on the Thames queen size When we contacted him he said that luckily there was still one room available with full view so we changed for that one Happy end for us eventually but just be sure you get the room you booked , Helpful staff nice view nice breakfast ferry boat service for free to from Canary Wharf
125283,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I didn t like the fact that i was charged twice for my stay I was also charged more money which i wasn t aware of , I liked the hotel and how it was presented And i appreciated the staff for recognizing their mistake and giving me and my partner free breakfast and a pass to the executive lounge 
125284,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It needs a mini bar and the bathroom is too small , The staff were very friendly and helpful I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend The room was very comfortable with a nice view from the balcony 
125285,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room size was small for a king deluxe room Travelodge has bigger rooms The tv was awkwardly mounted on the wall making it hard to view , Very nice decor in the reception and amazing breakfast The staff were helpful and warming and the free ferry service to canary wharf was helpful 
125286,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed It was sooo uncomfortable I did not like the check in The staff member asked for my credit card which i thought was for ID purposes he then debited my card with 100 with no explaination It was for any incidentals during the stay but if I hadnt of asked I would not have ben told On check out I was also billed for someone else s room This caused a delay whilst they sorted things out , Parking facilities was good Free water ferry to canary Wharf Clean Hotel Good room size with lovely views The hotel was in a good location for the Olympic Stadium

125288,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Would of been nice to be aware of getting to hotel via bus link as arrived back after last ferry crossing so had to find this out ourselves bathroom could of done with being a little bigger, Very nice hotel enjoyed travelling across river to hotel which was an experience staff very friendly good choice at breakfast rooms clean bed comfortable
125289,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We felt that the on line booking and all the information regarding the room size and style were misleading and hence when first impression of walking in to the room was one of disappointment Buffet breakfast hot food was cold It was not until we were leaving did we happen to see the second car park I would have been happier parking in secured parking than on the street over night, The Hotel facilities and location were good 
125290,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No response for 40 minutes when calling room service upon placing an order for sandwiches we received packet sandwiches Not what you d expect for a Hilton , Overall a really lovely hotel with friendly staff you even get a cookie on arrival Lovely room 
125291,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, different levels of floor in the room going from the en suite to the bedroom nearly broke my foot a couple of times bad design wasn t off to a good start, breakfast was brilliant
125292,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The wifi wasn t free I don t know if this was because of the kind of room we booked or just policy It wasn t a massive hindrance as 4G was available throughout the hotel but it would have been nice not to use our own data , The bed was amazing It was an executive queen room and needless to say the bed was fit for royalty Great space and light amazing views and just all round satisfaction 
125293,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No swimming pool fitness room could be better, Beautiful location river view from blacony complementary ferrey to canary wharf Nice welcome warm cookie on arrival Nice rooms very clean
125294,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was extremely uncomfortable in room 205 it has a very unforgiving lump on the left hand side of the bed Our friends who were staying in a family room said their bed was very comfortable Also the ability to get extra pillows would have been nice , Bar man knew and remembered our drink choices over the weekend and remembered our room number even though we only went to the bar couple of times This was a lovely special touch Also as the trip was for a special occasion we ordered a bottle of bubbles for the first day which was swiftly delivered on check in with a lovely bowl of complimentary fruit Thank you
125295,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, View from the room was more onto an ugly building across but from the right angle you still have a view of the river It s a short walk from the ferry to Canary Wharf station but long enough so that if it were raining it would be off putting But in good weather it s a pleasant walk But there is a bus supposed to arrive in front of the hotel too that goes to Canada Water station To be honest this is nitpicking , The room was beautiful and well looked after The bar is cosy and quiet the view was over the river and quite stunning at night The free ferry across made it easy to reach the hotel you walk off the boat onto up the quay and then into the hotel lobby which is great The price I got 230 for 2 nights in a SuperKing bed was cheaper than Stratford Double at a Premier Inn on that weekend date A no brainer really 
125296,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Evening meal and lack of available snacks in bar I e crisps nuts etc our table was in line with area where food was cooked for evening meal we were not happy to see chef nibbling at food while preparing it also not wearing hygiene gloves while handling food Evening meal was of poor quality chips soft and over cooked chicken only tasted of salt We sat in bar to relax about 2 hours before our table was booked for we needed some snacks to keep us going but we re told none were available but we could order off menu which was no good when we had booked table We ended up going in 50mins earlier for our meal Not happy We have stayed at hilton docklands on many occasions prior to double tree but are not impressed with double tree I very much doubt if we will return , Nice welcome at reception Very helpful 
125297,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When I asked for a river view room I was expecting to look at the river face on Instead I had to look at the patio area then to the left for a bit of river , The breakfast was amazing So much on offer and it was all delicious 
125298,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing stands out which I didn t like but if I really had to pick something it was how busy the staff were at breakfast We asked for coffee but as they were so busy they forgot , Brilliant location friendly staff and very clean The staff couldn t be more helpful at reception when I needed directions 
125299,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location although free ferry service is available to address this issue but timing on weekends are not practical As per advert every room has river view and I requested room with river view as per advert but my request was declined as river view rooms were available at premium rates , Good welcoming staff and breakfast 
125300,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff need to pick up phone calls and there was no fridge I previously booked a queen room it was better than the King room because the King room didn t have all the complimentary essentials for some reason Bedding was creased and looked rushed Tv wiring was seen instead of hidden , Quality and vibe was fantastic Area is prestigious Cookie from the reception was nice Free tickets to ferry was great didn t use it though 
125301,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No view over river, The cookies and most comfortable bed Our check in attendant Can t remember his name but Italian from Milan Most helpful young man 
125302,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel was so far away from the tube station which meant travelling late at night was almost impossible as there was no way of getting back from the tube station , The room was spacious and clean staff were helpful and the views were amazing 
125303,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff was rude and stuck up Got my booking all wrong at check in No fridge in the room and the car park gate was a hassle, The ferry crossing was free and very convenient and the view from the bar outside was beautiful
125304,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The underground was a 25minute walk from the underground we did not know about the ferry until we arrived The room was not particularly large and no view to look out onto , The room was clean and the staff friendly also there was a good choice at breakfast 
125305,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Tiny claustrophobic rooms Expensive wifi Poor service Noone picks up the phone Had to chase roomservice 4 times went through reception who promised they would call back but nothing happened In the end it took 1 5hour to get some food to the room which meant i could not get to bed until 1am Asked for a newspaper at breakfast was promised to have 1 brought to my table finished breakfast 45 minutes later without any papers Seems like staff very nice and agreeable but then doesn t care much about carrying out the actual service Far from public transport, Beautiful location by the docks Clean Friendly staff
125306,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No negatives really perhaps a mirror behind the dressing table would be good for whilst doing your hair and had to make sure back for last boat at 11 50pm apart from that cant wait for my next visit , Great location being just across the river from central london the boat bus was great stayed there for the o2 just a short boat trip over river minutes walk to tube station and one stop to the 02 always a boat available when needed and just made it more exciting also so close to tube station anyway or clipper boat taking you to all of the sites great fun hotel was great very individual with the internal walls and decoration very clean rooms big for london too and we only had basic twin good facilities in room great large shower warm chocolate cookie in reception was a lovely touch too and yummy cocktail bar lovely and breakfast best ive had so much choice couldnt really fault it

125308,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Are you kidding me You greeted me with a goddamn cookie I d marry this hotel if it wasn t frowned upon , The bed was ridiculously comfy honesty it was like sleeping in the fat fold of the Pillsbury doughboy 
125309,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was nothing I didn t like , The staff were ALL excellent From the lady who checked me in and got me a room immediately and I was early to the Bar Staff and the lady who delivered my evening meal They all were professional kind and engaging It made a huge difference 
125310,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the room that i rent was relatively smaller than i expected, the location next to the famous river and the bar are both lovely The staffs are generous and charming
125311,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It would be nice to know the ferry times as we weren t sure how often it ran and until what time , Amazing hotel wish I could stay longer Complimentary ferry service makes it easy to cross Thames and reach Canary Wharf tube station or take a ferry to the center of London 
125312,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Paid for a room with balcony but was given one without and they would not of done nothing if I didn t go back to reception and tell them I paid for balcony and the view wasn t good as I couldn t even see Canary Wharf Ordered room service and they bought the wrong food up ,No Positive

125316,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Perhaps table service in the bar would be nice make a guests experience a bit more relaxing , The cookie on arrival The shower is much better than ours at home Transport over the river was very convenient All the info on arrival We were able to leave our bags at the hotel whilst at Comic Con Getting nibbles with drinks 
125317,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bed could ve been slightly comfier creaked every time we moved Lack of toiletries toothpaste , Great location opposite Canary Wharf easily accessed by bus or free ferry shuttle Large room with fantastic view of the Thames Breakfast served until late with a fantastic selection we got there ten minutes before end of service and nothing had been cleared away which makes a nice change from other hotels 
125318,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Service charge for even buying 1 drink is strange but i believe that is normal for this part of the world , Very spacious rooms Lovely location and views from hotel Very good idea with the boat into canary wharf 
125319,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Mini bar would have been good It was difficult to get drinks in our room Also very cold room so bathrobes would be good, Loved the welcome cookie and friendly staff

125322,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Tiny tiny elevators They also don t tell you that unless you get dropped off at the front door by a cab you have a healthy climb up two floors with all your bags to get there after getting dropped off on the street from the bus , Awesome pillows Good public transit options to all of London Very quiet Got the best sleep of our two week vacation at this hotel 
125323,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The noise booked a suite above a terrace party I wasn t informed of then had to move rooms a further 2 times , Food was nice however the chef was wiping her nose on her whites which was off putting
125324,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was lovely but the bed was so hard both myself and my husband had no sleep and chronic backache the next day , The hotel was lovely the staff were professional our room was gorgeous and we enjoyed the food in the restaurant and sitting out on the terrace in the sun by the Thames The downside was the very very hard bed 
125325,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was small Check in was a little slow and disjointed Local knowledge was lacking from staff on reception , Nice bar with a good ambience Free ferry Breakfast was nice and staff at breakfast very friendly and efficient
125326,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was nothing which could have made our stay any more enjoyable it was perfect in every way Special thanks to the team who prepared our room and the gentleman on reception who ordered the taxi to take us back to Kings Cross station, My husband and I stayed at the hotel as we were visiting a show at the O2 arena to celebrate our 55th wedding anniversary My daughter unbeknown to us phoned the hotel and asked for our room to be special the results were amazing I have taken pictures with my ipad but am not sure how to upload them here Shortly after our arrival 2 members of staff came to see if we were happy with our room reception staff phoned shortly after to see if the room as okay We had a wonderful stay and I cannot recommend the hotel staff enough for making our stay so special The food and service in the reception were excellent everyone was friendly and helpful I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel and its staff to anyone 
125327,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had many issues with the hotel as soon as we arrived Firstly they had given us the wrong room and then we rang the reception so many times without any answer We rang all the numbers and no one answered any of our calls which made us have to walk all the way down to the lobby Overall it was a very disappointing stay with us questioning whether this was really a hilton as we have never experienced such bad service in any hilton we have stayed at before We would not recommend this hotel to anyone ,No Positive
125328,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hair in the bathtub The doors to the room were in bad shape they d obviously had plaques on them that had been removed and just left as is Just a question of aesthetics but still The view from the balcony was nice enough the city skyline beyond the roof tops but the balcony itself was in disrepair Bar was OK however the under section of the bar is filthy I put my hand under it to steady myself while I sat in the bar stool and came away with a nasty surprise on my hand Linens on the bed a bit rough The Black Pudding at breakfast is a firm fav but it was raw and quite obviously so so that wasn t a plus point , Nice location on the river excellent ferry service over to Canary Wharf Nice large room we received an upgrade on arrival I had requested a river view which they couldn t offer Room was fine Nice big comfy bed Breakfast was VAST and plenty of choice and good bacon The chef made me a fresh omelette Excellent and attentive waiting staff 
125329,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Checkin was extremely poor with no details given about stay breakfast wifi how to find room Toilet didn t flush properly Drawer didn t close Reception didn t answer phone Couldn t get shower to work, Room was nice
125330,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Paid for an upgrade at 50 and was not upgraded room was changed on the second day and when we went into this room we found someone had left a solid present in the toilet Not great Was not happy with how it was handled and is still going on 2 3 weeks later ,No Positive
125331,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Well the rooms are as basic as a Travelodge or Premier Inn despite paying for a deluxe room The tv didn t work the bedside lights didn t work not even bottles of water were provided I wouldn t bother paying the hiked fees for this hotel spend your money on a decent hotel that is actually worth the amount There s alot more noise than I was expecting too The beds are so soft so I wouldn t recommend if you suffer from back problems Overall I m very disappointed , The only things that made this hotel stand out from a regular budget hotel was the free ferry over to Canary Wharf and the pretty lobby when you enter the hotel 
125332,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very busy for breakfasthe but it was the Sunday of the London marathon Unable to get a hot drink at the bar the previous evening when we got back from o2 arena, Very handy for the ferry along the river
125333,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Long queue for breakfast and poor service once seated Eventually seated in bar area for breakfast Spent the whole of this time with a crowd of other guests right next to us all waiting to be allocated a table Had to request tea and coffee for which milk and sugar arrived 15 mins later This situation made worse as tea making facilities in bedroom had not been restocked or clean cups provided after use on Friday Disappointing end to an otherwise pleasant stay , Free ferry shuttle Friendly staff Outdoor patio and decking area
125334,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was a bit squeaky , The hotel was in a very nice location great view at night from the bar but the food and drinks could be little more cheaper Overall a lovely hotel for a couple of nights stay
125335,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Too expensive for what it offered Public spaces and decor a bit tired, Very friendly obliging staff All very helpful Good comfortable bed bathroom well stocked
125336,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Fab location super views great staff excellent breakfast bar terrace faultless Reliable ferry shuttle great access to city Thames Path well worth finding all the hidden treasures 
125337,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I thought as it was my partners birthday i had booked a room with a balcony and river view i could slightly see the river but i more had buildings and a badminton court It was my partners birthday and i had spoken to someone and they said they would put a little something in the room i got their and their wasn t anything when i rang reception the lady on the phone said to me ill pass u to the manager she can deal with you in a very very rude manor then the phone was hung up on me i didn t feel like the 3 ladies at the front of reception was approachable to talk to them about it especially after i had been spoken to the way i had on the phone I have always stayed at your branches and found them lovely but to be honest this kind of ruined our trip a bit as i was very angry , The boat service was amazing and the staff was soooo friendly and helpful also the breakfast was very nice 
125338,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast service was poor but I note two staff were off sick customer services compensated me for this Real down side was the ferry doesn t run past midnight , Staff were great in the hotel nice rooms comfy bed great customer service nice views from the room good access to central London and the Docklands 
125339,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Sometimes the employees don t look really organised e g at breakfast , Amazing cross outside fluffy inside fries Beautiful room Very good breakfast with the best real bread in Great Britain so far 
125340,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast looked delicious and had loads of choice but cooked breakfast was all cold and served on cold plates Easily avoidable mistake which ruined it Tried to charge me over 11 to make two quick phone calls to my husband who was lost having been redirected to a different car park as hotel one full and had my phone with him by mistake That was very disappointing and ridiculously priced They took it off the bill but to try and charge that amount seemed very unfair , Lovely hotel and great to get free ferry Friendly staff and lovely big room with great view Check in was quick and professional I would return Good value for money Really lovely outside terrace and great playground very close 
125341,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to keep re logging on to free wi fi , Liked the setting very much Built over old docks and with views across the river with dedicated ferry from Canary Wharf Easier access via Canada Water and C10 bus 
125342,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, One of the reception staff was abrupt and unhelpful I do not understand why we was offered a newspaper if it wasn t going to be available We didn t find out our paper was unavailable until we asked for it We had to queue for a long time for Breakfast there clearly was not enough staff available to cope with the demand I had to ask for a glass for juice on several occasions It was a similar scenario when i wanted a bowl i was finally told they were all being washed , When we arrived we were made to feel welcome and offered a warm cookie I liked that when we advised a member of Staff the hot water and phone in our room was not working we were offered an alternative room There was a member of staff working outside by herself she was totally run off her feet However she couldn t do enough to help us 
125343,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The single beds in my twin room were not great standard single size but just not very comfortable , Good sized twin room nice and clean with good facilities big TV nice shower etc Hotel facilities were great parking water taxi bar etc Had a burger from the bar menu for dinner which was nice and breakfast was great lots of choice and all good quality 
125344,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our sleep was disturbed due to a continuous hum all through the night had we been there for another night we would had gone to reception, The location staff were very friendly and helpful the boat from hotel to Canary wharf was really useful excellent value for money will definitely book again
125345,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The front desk staff was clueless when we asked about booking tours , The luggage porter named Melvan was great and very helpful i finding a doctor for me due to my illness while there 
125346,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Having to pay for wi fi access which I elected not to do The free hour was actually only thirty five minutes I know because I timed it lol , The restaurant staff who were very friendly and welcoming Nothing was too much trouble 
125347,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Poor sound proofing Extremely noisy on corridor and outside Lack of privacy when curtains not drawn due to carpark being immediately outside , Liked location Wifi fine 
125348,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Small window in room which could only be opened a small way because of security lock Step down into bathroom from room , Warm cookie on check in Free ferry to Canary Wharf Good selection of food at breakfast Friendly polite staff
125349,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I only booked the hotel because it had a river view and even called and asked if it had a river view Turned up and had a view of the loading bay so all I could see out of a tiny 3x3 foot Window was a brick wall and woken up by people outside pulling trolleys around loading trucks Not romantic at all , The view from th terrace was absolutely beautiful The most amazing way to have a drink and some food 
125350,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Poor standard of pillow in the room Disturbed at night to pay for room service, Amazing location Quality bar foyer Complimentary ferry on the river is excellent
125351,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel could do with a small store selection of supplies nearby or on the premises A fridge in the rooms would be very beneficial My only other minor quibble would be how small the bathroom sinks are I enjoy having a really large sink when I go away as I only have a very small sink at home so was disappojnted to see that the sink was the same size as or possibly even smaller than my one at home doh , Having been to this hotel several times over the years I was really glad to say that this visit didn t disappoint either The staff were excellent the location splendid the ferry staff were excellent the rooms were immaculate The rooms were immaculate the quality of the breakfast was superb and the restaurant manager was an excellent compere Mrs McLucas she was warm and friendly but was still clearly running a very tight and efficient ship and definitely serves some credit Excellent 
125352,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Loved everything X, Loved the room with the river view Very clean hotel and very friendly staff Wish I could of afforded to stay a few nights not just one If you ever have any offers or deals on please let me know I would definitely come back Great hotel Also loved the free ferry over to Canary Wharf very convenient Thank you x
125353,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The hotel was quite far from a tube station , The room was very clean and tidy as was the rest of the hotel The food in the restaurant was very good There was an added bonus of the free ferry use to get to the other side of the river 
125354,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was no net curtain to cover the balcony door and you could see the bed in the next room the only way to get privacy was to shut the curtains which blocked all the sun out The TV was fixed flat to the wall therefore you could not lay on the bed to watch TV to relax We ordered a continental breakfast to be brought to our room Firstly it arrived later than within the 10mins of your given time there was no spoons for the cereals there was no pastries or croissants and quite frankly the tray arrived looking like it had been thrown together and not nicely laid out as we would have expected I rang Room Service to ask for the rest of our breakfast items but got no reply so I rang Reception A short time later pastries and spoons were brought to the room but no croissants We were not happy with the way the staff member pushed his way into the room we felt our privacy wasn t respected on this occasion We would not return to this Hotel Lastly there was no light near the only mirror in the room that would be used to dry your hair and put on make up light is needed for these tasks , The Bed was really comfy All the hotel staff spoke and said Hello as they walked passed you The views are lovely too 
125355,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing, Very warm welcome by staff and warm cookies which was a lovely start Hotel is simply stunning breakfast was fab and the views across the Thames were superb Room was lovely well equipped with hairdryer and iron and the view was great There s a bus stop right outside the hotel which you can travel to the tube which was ideal and the ferry passes were very handy
125356,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast was not worth the extra money although nice the bacon was rock hard and by the time you sat down the food was near enough cold The staff wasn t very helpful and did not make us aware before hand or during booking in that an extra 50 a night will be charged and given back within 4 5 working days I am stating this for the people like me who did not know this , Nice hotel in a remote location near the river themes 
125357,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The view we had, Room was lovely although the view wasn t that great but didn t affect our stay the ferry crossing was a lovely way to get to the hotel and all the staff I came across were very friendly and helpful hotel clean
125358,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Maze like corridors making it difficult to navigate Size of bathroom , Location Extra special service from the waiter and chef when we ate on the terrace Quality of room 
125359,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Weird smell in hall way Not enough mirrors in the room, Bed was very comfy staff very polite and helpful Great location very useful free ticket for river bus Room very spacious
125360,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Disappointing that wifi wasn t free , Great location for the O2 short ride on the Thames Clipper Very helpful staff Great rooms really comfortable 
125361,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Check in was a bit slow but nothing to complain about , Location and how easy using the ferry was cookies were nice on arrival Breakfast was excellent 
125362,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast was chaotic and disorganised Waited over 20 mins to get seated and then disappointed by poor service no crockery food quality and cleanliness of dining room , Lovely hotel in ideal location Room comfortable 1 min Ferry to Canary Wharf 
125363,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff need to learn manners Don t boast about things like choc chip cookies when you don t provide them Told the bar would shut at 1 00a m when it shut at 11 45p m , The bed was comfortable
125364,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bar staff slow messed up a few orders including ours No personalities no enthusiasm Pillows hard and no mini bar , Cookies given at check in and parking on site 
125365,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Wasnt happy that i didnt get a walk out balcony like others and that the water was not warm only luke warm, The hotel was very comfortable The view was amazing especially at night the rooms were a nice size
125366,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only thing that bothered me slightly was having the room situated next to the door which allows access to the room near us This meant banging and people talking loudly late at night , The location and rooms were lovely Very clean the staff couldn t do more for you which was great The breakfast was included in our stay which was really nice had full English buffet plus cold meats and croissants etc 
125367,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom very small no minibar , Lovely bed and pillows very friendly staff and stylish decor Loved the outdoor terrace overlooking the Thames also great pub 2 minutes walk away for a change Free ferry across to Canary Wharf 
125368,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, that my husband tripped several times over a tiny step in the bathroom and has a bruised toe and looks like hes going to lose his toenail not good really design fault, nice sized room good view free water travel to the hotel
125369,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I dislike having to pay for wifi especially as you can get it free on the bus , The ferry across the river and down to Greenwich for the start of the marathon was an added bonus 
125370,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, That we had to exchange our rooms 3 times due to it not being up to our expectations for what we paid for Had to also go all the way back to the other room to get our own luggage Felt like we got fobbed of by most of the staff when we needed assistance always got told to ask another member of staff Also the room wasn t clean at all dirty towels and bed sheets Broken plug socket and also not a good TV for a 4 hotel, We liked the suite that we had and also the Canary Wharf view It was nice having a living room as well as a bedroom Free warm cookies on arrival 
125371,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our room was right next to the lift machinery equipment and very noisy and also right above the loading area which was a problem and spoilt our break Value For 99 No We complained at reception and they offered a free breakfast but that wasn t any compensation Then as we checked out we were blocked in on the hotel car park for half an hour by a guest that had gone out for the day Its a free for all with parking that the hotel have no control over Our stay overall was very disappointing and it ruined a special weekend We had looked forward to for a few months Nice staff but we got a raw deal and won t be returning, The convenience of the hotel ferry to get us across the river into the city good access plus parking at the hotel is a benefit The staff are very helpful and polite
125372,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, My request of feather free room not take care of had to sleep without any bedcover Even after I mentioned it on my booking called the hotel nd checked and checked while booking in Disappointed that even after mentioning it 3 times it was not taken care Got free parking for the inconvinience but did not get any sleep very poor communication Not happy at all , The service at the bar in the afternoon Excellent 
125373,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Grab and Go was advertised as being 24 hours but was closed when we arrived, Incredibly comfortable bed and lovely views of the docklands Really liked how there s the little bridge over the old docking station to get to one part of the hotel from another
125374,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Literature stated free wifi It was only free for 1 hour , location great for access to any part of London but no need to go far anyway free river shuttle to Canary Wharf short river trip to Greenwich Breakfast couldn t be better river views excellent Our rooms as good as expected The bestest hot chocolate chip cookies free on arrival Bath AND shower in ensuite Absolutely lovely decor
125375,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Due to the nature of the event in London the price was premium Bathroom was small for an executive room, Stayed in this hotel as it was ideally situated for me to run the London marathon The hotel went out of its way to cater for the marathon runners early breakfast healthy choices ferry to Greenwich ideal for marathon runners Room was spacious and bed was very comfortable
125376,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Some staff weren t briefed about the additional marathon services so was confusing with conflicting information, Fantastic breakfast hotel put on free ferry for marathon runners to get us to the start line Free cookies on check in
125377,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Staff were so good Eddie sorted disabled parking straight away for my Mum Sandra sent fruit to my room as soon as we checked in Our 6th stay at hilton riverside Now Hilton doubletree
125378,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The lift to our room was very small and no mini bar in the room , The room was just the job bed was very comfortable the bar was lovely and the staff very pleasant and efficient The location for the concert we attended at the O2 was really good FREE FERRY Breakfast was superb with very polite staff and plenty of choice thank you 
125379,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The tele doesn t move off the wall can not watch this In Bed properly , The beds were comfy great facilities for runners for the marathon good breakfast and great boat taxi service to the start 
125380,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast staff very rude I had to ask 3 times for a cup of tea at breakfast most hotels offer you a pot when it did come it was slammed down in front of me Also whenever I ve stayed at a Double Tree Hilton we ve been given warm cookies on arrival this wasn t offered but must have been available as I saw other guests with them , Clean comfortable rooms nicely decorated
125381,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our room felt like it was in the staff area poor view car park bins corridors a bit shabby in places lifts tiny Our room was adequate but small bathroom location my only gripes Nice to have a balcony if only to strain ones neck to see the view of Canary Wharf The bar staff were frankly poor this needs addressing especially in the evening after O2 events More heated areas outside too for us non smoking capers Cookies not all that , We loved the novelty of the ferry Decor of public areas was modern comfortable Location for the O2 was fabulous
125382,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The complimentary ferry there was a massive queue of people queuing up to catch the ferry after the gig we were attending at the 02 and we could see the boat was just sitting there the other side of the water unmanned it should have been there waiting when the gig finished Lots of people stay at this hotel because they re attending a gig at the 02 so the hotel really needs to get this weighed up , Lovely room comfortable bed gorgeous breakfast with amazing choice Great location with wonderful views of the river skyline from the hotel bar Would probably ask for a room with a view next time 
125383,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I waited 1hour for room service I phoned to remind and turns out they forgot about me Came up with wrong order Dirty towels No vending machine for Snacks but yet they have a vending machine for batteries and paracetamol , It was a night away from home so that was nice 
125384,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Would of been great if you could of used the ferry without your room keyou rather than having to pay surely if you ve stayed an you weren t aware of the service before you should be able to use a return service , The bed was so comfy massive thumbs up I didn t want to leave Loved the welcome cookie too however just the gesture I m sure there were nuts in the cookie an I didn t want to risk a reaction The location was lovely as it s further out would of been nice for recommendations 
125385,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The price of the breakfast I went to the harvester at the O2 and had an eat as much as you like full english and continental with unlimited drinks for less than half the price of two full English breakfasts at the hotel , I was impressed by the facilities and the cosy personal feel to the place 
125386,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I requested a room overlooking the river we got a room with a white washed very small window I had said it was my husbands 50th birthday surprise weekend when I booked yet I had to go and complain about it not the best start to our weekend we were moved to a a room with a view after I complained but having to do so we only just made out theatre time all became very rushed and harrised , Most comfy bed ever 
125387,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Fantastic staff who were helpful polite and went out of there way to be friendly to the adult with learning disabilities I was accompanying fantastic Buffet 
125388,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Slightly off the beaten path but it is nice returning to a quiet that isn t in the middle of the busy city , Great staff very friendly Staff were always more than happy to help Nice and quiet place too Nice clean place Food in the restaurant was fantastic however I d say breakfast was slightly expensive Dinner though Outstanding 
125389,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location A long walk 1 hour 40 mins if you miss the ferry which stops at midnight As a mature couple we had to ensure we were making our way back to hotel well before 11 30pm So much for the city that never sleeps we had no choice, Staff were wonderful breakfast was outstanding and the chef would make things to order A nice touch with the cookie 
125390,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact it took nearly 30 minutes to check in was crazy To have an e check in desk which I had done and a Hilton Honours desk to recognise different guests was great but then to not let guests use the different desks was madness I tried to check in at 2pm but was told the room was not available you should have let me check in at that point instead of telling all guests to come back later creating a massive queue that you could not cope with As I say MADNESS Additionally it took 3 keycards to get out Car Park 2 and I did not enjoy walking up and down the road , Overall the feeling of the hotel was very good 
125391,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The ferry time table didn t make any sense for weekend not easy to travel around without the ferry at night We had to get a taxi, Very friendly staff
125392,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room 431 was unsuitable as the sloping roof had windows that the curtains would not close to conceal and we moved rooms so that the light did not wake us in the early hours , River location and shuttle ferry Comfortable beds and spacious room Breakfast was good Nice bar
125393,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room felt a bit clinical and box like Tube was a good distance from hotel despite river link Which didn t start till 8 55 on a weekend Room was quite noisy as backed into homes Didn t quite have the same feel as the Marriott we stopped in on Canary Wharf in December which cost a similar amount , Breakfast was lovely and staff pleasant
125394,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, It was my boyfriends birthday and the staff were so lovely he received a cheesecake delivered to the room and a complimentary breakfast it was so lovely Will definitely be going back again and again 
125395,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Everything was great apart from there was only a few channels on the TV only BBC 1 and E4, The receptionist gave us welcoming chocolate cookies They also gave us free passes for the Ferry to get into Canary Wharf for the duration of our stay 
125396,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing wrong with the hotel just Booking com s description of the room was very misleading Riverview should have read No View windows covered in etch vinyl so not transparent Tut Tut Booking com,No Positive
125397,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Walk in shower requested NOT provided Double room booked they tried to give us a twin No Heating in the room had to have a space heater They made me sign a form due to my slight disability i am not in wheelchair nor walking sticks in case of fire they would come and knock on my room VERY VERY humiliating for me,No Positive
125398,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, NOT REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY FOR THE SIZE OF THE ROOM ALSO STILL HAVENT HAD AN INVOICE EVEN AFTER CONTACTING THE HOTEL AGAIN , FREINDLINESS OF STAFF
125399,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The view from the bar looking over Canary Wharf and the free unlimited travel river crossing from the hotel for easy access to the other side of the river and the nearest tube station
125400,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Terrible location We specifically booked this hotel because booking com said this hotel was 0 8 miles from Tobacco docks where we were attending the BAFTA gaming awards that evening We could have stayed at any hotel but chose this one based purely on location value for money What a joke 0 8 miles should take no more than 5 minutes in a taxi And it probably was 5 minutes from our destination ACROSS THE RIVER The reality of it was a 20 minute journey via car Booking com need to make this clear on their website as we were then late We also paid extra from a room upgrade A superior Twin room Well all I can say is God knows what the standard twin room was like because there was nothing superior about the superior twin It was tiny The bathroom was so small I didn t even have room to dry myself off after the shower It reminded me of being on a boat The layout of the hotel is also horrendous Upon check in you are given an elevator number a floor number and a room number All of the elevators are located in different locations across the hotel It was like a maze We had to ask for help in the end as lift 5 was no where to be seen Eventually after walking through the main building across a bridge and around several corners we finally found it And that was just to get the lift up to our floor Oh and suprise suprise despite us having 2 suitcases 2 suit carriers and a carry on bag not one person offered to help take our stuff to the room , Check in was ok Guests are given a hot cookie upon check in which was a nice touch Decor throughout the hotel reception is nice
125401,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, we were a little gutted about the view none from our room 404 We had been upgraded for a room with a bigger bed for myself and my daughter to share but I think we would have preferred a smaller bed as only 1 night with a better view over the river , Booked the room for just 1 night while I took my young daughter to a concert at the O2 Great location for this a the river boat took us straight there and back no getting around London late at night with a child myself and my 8 yr old shared a room and staff upgraded us on arrival for a bigger bed which was huge and very comfortable Huge shout out for Cristian who made a big friend with my daughter and delivered pastries upto our room for her breakfast which made her feel very special Extremely clean room and overall lovely hotel The compliment boat was fabulous and another shout out for those guys who again made my daughter feel very special 
125402,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, having stayed at hilton docklands on a number of timesI noticed the staff have changed some of the new staff were not as friendly as the old staff but overall we enjoyed our stay , breakfast n a bed very comfy
125403,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast could have been included in the costing considering the price , The luxurious feel of the hotel was lovely and I especially liked the free water bus to the Canary Wharf during the stay 
125404,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Not being able to afford to stay more often , The staff were excellent and treated us very well My wife and I were really impressed with their attention to us and to any questions we had We were treated very courteously by reception the breakfast chef and the ferry assistant but the smiles seemed to emanate from all staff We also liked our view of the Thames even if it was sideways on 
125405,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Didn t like to be asked for a 50 holding fee incase we had anything to eat drink or used facilities Which we only used the bar and paid then and there This was not stated when I booked it and was waived in the end but should be made clear when booking Also check in was 3 but room was still not ready at 3 so we had to wait around , Lovely view across the Thames beds were comfortable and overall very clean 
125406,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The ferry was actually great after i booked the hotel i realised it was not in canary wharf itself but across the river so i was expecting to spend a lot of money on taxis but still slightly inconvenient if planning to go out at night One of the men on reception was a little rude and not helpful at all which is a shame as all the other staff were brilliant and very accomodating My friend and i do not know London that well and he talked to us like we were idiots , Really lovely hotel we got complimentary breakfast because i had a gold card which had so many choices Very clean hotel 
125407,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I spent the weekend here with my partner the hotel was clean and staff were extremely friendly Hotel facilities were great and the location of the hotel was ideal as there were a variety of transport options to get you to and from the centre of London We particularly liked the complimentary ferry link between the hotel and canary wharf We had an excellent trip to London and will definitely use this hotel again and recommend it to family and friends too 
125408,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only problem I had was the location as it was further away from the centre of London than I anticipated However the ferry service operated very frequently which helped alot , The bed was very comfortable and the buffet breakfast was very pleasing 
125409,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing , Although there had been a slight hiccup with our booking we were upgraded for free to an executive room allowing us to use the executive facilities which were brilliant the stay was perfect It was my boyfriends 21st and the whole experience was brilliant The boat shuttle service is a brilliant way of getting across to Canary Wharf where there is excellent restaurants bars 
125410,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location for sightseeing was great however if would have wanted to stay and eat late after the show we went to to see public transport doesn t run too late, Bed was very comfy lots to chose from at breakfast
125411,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room service was excellent and really quick The staff were more than happy to deal with any request we had Breakfast was 10 10 Large choice of food 
125412,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Service charge added to food bill in restaurant without prior notification Food prices already high enough so I felt that this was a quite cheeky , Warm welcome by staff inc a warm cookie Clean spacious room with free WIFI Windows and balcony door that fully opened to allow fresh air in Free ferry across to Canary Wharf direct from hotel pontoon was superb 
125413,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Great big noisy chimney type thing outside our room you could here it over the tv so I had no sleep Was supposed to check in at 3pm but room wasn t ready so got in at 4 30pm I m disabled and needed to lay down and take meds Whole room and bathroom stank of sewage phone didn t work breakfast was late and totally wrong Also towel heater was broken Shoddy and staff unhelpful Now at holiday inn in canning town so much nicer and cheaper NEVER EVER stay there again, A burger 
125414,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location makes transport an issue I booked well in advance didn t get a river view Felt like I was in a bit of a box , Atmosphere is lovely
125415,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom needed refurbishing The bar prices were a little too steep , The location That they provided free tickets for the ferry to Canary wharf The price of the room 
125416,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The Manager We have had previously stayed here and had complained about a few issues we had We thought we would try again as the location was great for our trip Upon arrival we spoke to the manager who was on the desk for check ins My word if customer service was always like this there would be no complaints We were given a lovely room and he would personally make sure that everything would be to our satisfaction and he did So thank you for making it extra special cookies too How to look after your guests and get them back we have booked again for 2017 brilliant 
125417,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was too small and just one blanket The view was so bad we were looking on a parking lot it did not meet our expectations, The staff was really nice and friendly
125418,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The front of house staff were very professional but not that friendly Would have been nice to have a hello and smile on the times we walked through the hotel and saw staff management , The woman at breakfast who wore the bunny ears was extremely friendly and definitely deserves a pay rise 
125419,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We had to ask for the air condiitioning to be turned off in the restaurant at breakfast it was so cold our food got cold and I had to put my coat on which was ridiculous This was a big put off , A good choice for breakfast 
125420,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Car park abit tight but can t be helped, Excellent service Fantastic food Amazing view a great weekend overall Plus the boat being included in the price definetely worth the money 
125421,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When myself and my partner arrived we were first given our card key to a room that was extremely small very hot with a fraction of the river view I was extremely disappointed with this as not only was we lead to a very poor room but there was no champagne waiting that I organised as a surprise for my partner I was left quite embarrassed and had to go back to a reception immediately and inform them that the room was not what I expected and was not what I upgraded The lady confirmed the room was an Executive Queens Deluxe however I knew this was not the case as I did carry out a lot of research on the variety of rooms that the hotels offers when I upgraded the room to a maximum price I could afford Without arguing she immediately gave us a new card key for another room which thankfully we were very happy with Unfortunately another problem occurred in the morning when we arrived at the restaurant for our breakfast We were informed that breakfast was not included in our room I had to bring up the confirmation on my phone to confirm with them to be allowed in which again left me fairly embarrassed in front of my partner Bedroom Although our room did have a wonderful view the bathroom was very small The bathroom tap was leaking and from what we could see this was a problem in the room for quite a while as the bathtub was fairly green under the tap The bathroom was very hot and stuffy and there was no vent , Firstly arriving on the riverboat ferry from canary wharf pier to the hotel s private pier was very impressive with the beautiful views of the river Thames and surroundings it was definitely a great start Our view out the room was superb We had the Executive Deluxe Queens Room that overlooked the River with Canary wharf into the distance The restaurant for breakfast had a very wide option of different foods ranging from a fry up to fruit yoghurt cereal pretty much anything you can think of was there The restaurant was big and very well decorated busy but well organised 
125422,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Travel distance to the city centre is about 30 mins by river ferry but the travel distance is outweighed by the experience of traveling up and down the Thames to get the hotel A swimming pool would make the hotel the ideal place for a family to stay in London , Great hotel and staff Free river ferry across to Canary Wharf was a great treat for the kids Playground outside the front door was a pleasant surprise 
125423,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I think the breakfast was very overpriced We booked a room that didn t include breakfast as I thought we d see how much it was when we got there Almost 20 each is very steep which is why we went elsewhere for breakfast once we checked out , The whole hotel was absolutely amazing The decor and style was fantastic the rooms were really clean and had everything you would need for your stay The free ferry across to Canary Wharf was also great and provided a great link to more pubs etc 
125424,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our room was very cramped as it had a sloaping wall and the window was on that so the curtains just dangled all night and I m the morning the light shone in far too Much and you couldn t close the curtains as if the wall position , The bed was comfy to sleep on and We lloved the fact we could collect the boat right outside to cross the river 
125425,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked a King Double as a treat for my wife s birthday and emailed this to the hotel hoping for a room with a nice outlook of the Thames but got a ground floor room overlooking the car park front entrance with the smallest bathroom ever it was a bit like the Mrs Brown s Boys under the stairs toilet sketch easier to reverse in than walk in , Nice and easy for the O2 arena bus stop right outside C10 to Canada Water in around 10 minutes and then 2 stops on the Jubilee Line
125426,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No temperature control in room very cold in the bedroom and too hot in the bathroom, Very convenient ferry to Canary Wharf runs frequently at peak times
125427,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Last morning no fried eggs chief was just cooking omelette but those who love eggs with their breakfast was disappointed went up checking with hubby several times but still none , Breakfast great choice Loved the ferry across the themes
125428,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Catching the boat to cross the Thames might be a bit annoying if you are not a tourist and time is valuable If you have time I would even say it is somewhat an attraction , I ve stayed in many hotels in London and this is one of my favourite It is an old industrial building renovated in the typical dock lands industrial style a lot of character rooms are nicely laid out bar is great 
125429,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing Everyone was so helpfull, The staff were amazing I had arranged to propose to my partner while staying at the hotel and they set aside the library area for us decorated it with candles put our music on a wireless speaker and also put lights on the balcony where I proposed overlooking the Thames Truly memorable 
125430,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was a lot of noise and I wasn t able to sleep well due to the amount of noise the delivery vans were loud and I could hear the staff making noise from outside Found it very difficult during the evening to get a good sleep, The food was lovely the room was beautiful 
125431,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We got raw sausages for breakfast on the Sunday which we complained about after eating a few of them to the manager who showed the chef Was sick later on that evening and it really spoiled the idea of eating there again On the sat the breakfast was brill so was gutted on the Sunday Also a timetable for the ferry on the bed would have helped a lot as we were told on the sat last ferry is at 1145 but we never new that was only at the sat and not the Sunday so cost us 35 plus around 45 mins wait to find out it wasn t coming Also room 328 bath is cracked and gone rusty, We were blown away with our visit it was amazing the cocktails the staff and the rooms We re all really nice except bath 
125432,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Being charged 58 room service when we hadn t had any room service The charge was removed because the girl on reception couldn t find a receipt as there wasn t one But had we just have dropped our card in the express card box then this would have been debited from the card I used when we check in , Lovely relaxed atmosphere in the bar areas bar waitress staff nice friendly 
125433,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Plug in sunk wouldn t open so couldn t use sink Reported it to staff at reception went out hadn t been fixed when we returned late that night Had to brush teeth in bath Was given discount , Bed very comfortable 
125434,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing at all, The room was spacious with nice area to sit room was very clean bed comfy and a nice place to relax Checked in very quickly and is a lovely hotel
125435,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The angle of the TV in the room as it could not be extended enough to watch it whilst in bed , Loved everything about this hotel The location was perfect Was nice and quiet in the evening with a lovely view of the city Definitely would recommend 
125436,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the receptionist tried to charge me fifty pounds extra without telling ne untill i realised when entering my pin number the room was tiny for a queen size room and it felt likitwe was put in the abandond corner of the hotel no local shops just a small pub outside, the reception area of the hotel looked nice
125437,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked a room on booking com with the idea of what we would have however the room we were put in wasn t anything like the one we had selected it had no view what so ever and the Windows didn t even open I was quite dissapointed with this as I had planned it for a surprise for my boyfriend and he wasn t impressed at all, The staff were very friendly and the place was very nicely set out
125438,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room and particularly bathroom was tiny Bed was very creaky , Great location for river views and ferry to Canary Wharf You get a bit more for your money than central London and the journey in was less than 20 mins by bus and tube 
125439,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Hotel is fantastic throughout from reception to the bar rest to the bedrooms hotel is so clean and staff that were around were so helpful and always had a smile on there face service and quality of the food was superb location is great for the o2 and bars over the way by ferry ive worked in a 5 hotel for 14 years and travelled to a lot of 5 hotels and this is up there with them great hotel
125440,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Reception staff not understanding English which resulted in me being charged an extra 14 instead of credited 14 Took nearly 20 minutes to check out and we thought the issue had been resolved when we left but clearly not the case , Rooms very comfortable Bar relaxed and welcoming
125441,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Surcharge, Should tell people there s a surcharge before hand rather then giving a receipt with with it added with no explanation we were not the only couple that complained 
125442,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Stayed in the Queen Guest Room and the views were amazing as they overlooked the docks Very peaceful out on the balcony at night and the room service was really good as well Would definitely recommend 
125443,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Very expensive bar for fairly poor food our room was at the back so woken up to bottles being throw in to main bins every morning not a great location , Beds were poor rooms small and the bar closed to residents at 1am If you missed the last ferry it was a very expensive taxi back from the O2
125444,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We could hear people leaving the lift in the early hours and in the morning The hall ways could have been updated a little to match the rest of the property , Comfy bed great views in comfortable surroundings The bar and terraces were great also We also appreciated the possibility of express checkout 
125445,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room service Requested replenish of coffee milk not restocked by morning maid Requested at 23 15 and told it would be 30mins as they were very busy finally arrived at 00 45 Next night trouble with safe Rang reception at 23 00 no one came to room so went to reception twice and finally around 00 40 told that there were no staff who could deal with it until first thing next day After chasing at 7 00 the same person who d been on duty the night before came at 7 15 and fixed it in minutes A stay here was an expensive treat for us and we had to go to work straight from the hotel it was not a restful experience , Great balcomy views of the City and over the river to Canary Wharf from the room Liked having to get the ferry across and seeing the beach as the tide came and went Breakfast staff very pleasant even when busy 
125446,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had some problems checking my booking hence the upgrade I simply wanted to know if I could check in early and if we had two double beds as per the website The effort it took to find this out was less than good and spent 20 minutes talking to 3 people to find this out I even called the hotel and was told to talk to my travel agent Also had problems ordering some sandwiches and room service just after 11 An hour and half later we cancelled the order They waived the parking fee to compensate , Fantastic location and a lovely hotel recently refurbished We got an upgrade to a 2 room suite having had problems with the booking This room is normally 300 a night and t is easy to see why Two 6 double beds 3 TV s lounge area and shower room Room and balcony overlooked the Thames and Canary Wharf There is a free ferry boat across the river to Canary Wharf to the Clipper which runs to the centre of London and O2 Very convenient for all this Nice bar and restaurant with huge selection of options for breakfast We parked under the hotel too Will certainly stay here again for O2 and other Lady running the restaurant was excellent 
125447,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The heating in my room didn t work and it was cold seeing as I was by the riverside room, The views and links to other places the hotel itself is beautiful loved the boat services too
125448,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom was a little small Found empty bottle of water in from which was discovered after a chair was moved, The complimentary ferry to Canary Wharf Very pleasant and helpful staff Bed very comfortable and spacious Good range for breakfast
125449,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Me and my boyfriend booked this for Valentine s Day and booked a king with a balcony I chosen this hotel as it was so close to the river and had wanted a room with balcony with at least a decent side view of the river in the booking I asked very nicely if it would be possible to have a room with a decent view as it was my first valentines I m originally from London and absolutely love the river when s we arrived the room we received was over looking a car park we were at least four rooms away from the view of the river from the side that was visible through literally a crack in between buildings I didn t even feel like we were next to the river at all I appreciate that there are many rooms but seeing as I had specifically asked very nicely and there were many rooms that were closer to the river even from the side or ones that over looked a a small artificial lake would have been fine but I may as well have been in any hotel in London the view was the opposite direction to all of the classic London sky line so basically could have been anywhere I couldn t help but feel very disappointed it s not like I was not willing to pay for a room with a decent view but this was the most expensive room that had a balcony this was my first ever Valentine s Day as I have never been in a relationship before and I can t help but feel like it was a let down as I had booked this hotel specifically for the view of my beloved Thames, The hotel in general was nice the room was clean and comfy the staff were mostly lovely but not very helpful the cash machine in the hotel was broken at the time and when I asked member of staff where the nearest one was I recieved no answer which left me and my boyfriend blindly searching for one on our own
125450,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms were really small The food was terrible and undercooked It was impossible to find our room We paid for a view of a car park Not worth the money at all , It was tidy
125451,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Parking was expensive and hard to get in and out of plus our TV didn t work Staff weren t too helpful , The bed was comfy and the decor was nice River boat was good 
125452,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, ist room no view covered windows no tv reception told staff no response till complaining again next day got a upgrade very happy also new pictures in dining area changed why not of history as before did not like heavy uncovered hot air blowers over doors had to dodge them, beds comfy made up every day breakfast excellent as always expensive if not booked in advance with a deal nice area free ferry crossing to other side a bonus
125453,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Just a shame about a couple little house keeping department issues but the way the staff sorted these out was a credit to the hotel and very professional , The location decor staff was amazing and services and staff are a credit to the hotel The staff really professional and always there when needed Excellent customer service and will now be my hotel of choice when visiting London in the future
125454,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, we were in a room near the boiler flues in the car park so it was very loud at times The Tv signal was very poor which made it impossible to watch But this wasn t a real problem as we wer on a weekend away, The breakfast was great Staff were very helpful and attentive Room was very clean and comfortable 
125455,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room had no heating the second room did but u couldn t turn the heating up so the room was still freezing U can hear the lift buzzer going constantly and room was very small and the bathroom was tiny , Comfy bed great view great choice for breakfast
125456,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The TV remote control didn t work The heating fan was too loud at night waking me up every time it started up , Bed was very comfy and every where was clean The hotel generously acknowledged my husbands birthday and honoured my request for a river view Nice food for both evening and breakfast Thanks
125457,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Not enough tea and milk in the room and maybe some biscuits would have been nice Didn t have breakfast we thought it was too expensive, The cookies though as my daughter has a nut allergy and alternative for her would have been good
125458,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The Tv was not working properly so couldn t get any movies , Great location food service was lovely and staff were very friendly definitely worth paying extra for the bigger room and view of the city I will definitely stay again 
125459,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, girlfriend couldn t see TV from bed but I prefer ed the view from balcony , great view of city and river small issues resolved by staff very easily nice big bed 
125460,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were on the 4th floor and the curtains in the room drove me crazy seems a small thing but the roof was sloped and the curtains were the wrong size so didn t block the sun light out and it didn t give me much chance for a sleep in , First time we have stayed in a 2 bedroom family room and it was perfect and really good value for London 
125461,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room service too expensive for what you get, The room was lovely and the staff were very friendly Good facilities and nice location overlooking Canary Wharf There s also complimentary cookies upon arrival and a free ferry ticket to take you over to the wharf Would stay again 
125462,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was not as expected and although we had a river view it was out of a side window The sink in our room was super tiny but all furnishings were in good condition , Breakfast was included in the rate which was a nice surprise Extremely good spread 
125463,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Temperature in room and public areas could be better controlled Both were a little underheated, Great view from the room good breakfast Complimentary cookies were excellent 
125464,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff upgraded room which usually would be great but upgraded to a king from a twin I was staying with my mum so I had to sleep on a camp bed , The view was great and I liked the free ferry across the Thames Staff left a little birthday cake in the room for my mum which was a nice touch 
125465,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, How small our first room was it did not look this small in the photo and was very disappointed However our room upgrade was amazing , View from the room Breakfast was great Staff were very helpful when we were not satisfied with our room and helped to upgrade us at a small price 
125466,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Just one staff member and only one spoilt the show short suited manager in Resturant efficious manner no smile no apology for waiting to be seated for breakfast , Amazing choice of breakfast Upgraded to lovely room overlooking Thames very grateful for this Very impressed with female manager in Resturant warm friendly efficient and professional lovely bright personality 
125467,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Everything is this hotel was fabolous From the warm cookie gifted at arrival to the transfer to the airport Nice staff wonderfull breakfast nice ride to London city trough the complimentarry ferry There is also a very nice pub close to the hotel some steps with nice food and beer 
125468,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was freezing as considerable draft from the patio doors on the 6th floor We resorted to warming ourselves up with a hairdryer Hot water was turned off and we were told about this by a letter outside our door We were unable to shower before we left , Nice hotel with great views Nice ferry service too 
125469,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The boiler was broken so the room did not warm up The water was cold and we were told in the morning that we wouldn t have water from 10 00 13 00 The managers were very helpful and compensated me for this, The bed was nice
125470,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms were Okay Just like in the picture Bit dark in decor My son remarked no toothpaste no hairdryer and I was disappointed to find no tea or coffee in the rooms just bottled water Maybe that was because we had the lowest priced room , The Location What can I say Amazin Felt like a proper holiday on an island with the free ferry service and water all around and the walkways over the water The outside terrace could have sat there all night with it s view of Canary Wharf and the blankets Sat in every seat in the bar and the library up the stairs with the two fires view of Canary Wharf and outside balcony Proper plush The decor was really indulgent and comforting for us Good food in the restaurant too Coffee terribly expensive nearly a fiver but okay for a treat was Costa The free hot cookie on arrival was a blessing Bought a tin 
125471,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, salt pepper in open bowls instead of cellars unhygienic like mintballs in an indian restaurant everyone delves in not all wash hands first lack of parking facilities no dressing gowns slippers positioning of tv on wall 90o to bed, view
125472,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, N A, Had a lovely weekend at the hotel The ferry was ideal for getting to the tube stop and the hotel was everything we wanted and more Great value for money 
125473,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The heating was difficult to control either too hot or too cold the bathroom wasn t very nice the river view on the ground floor was obstructed , The ferry was free to the other side of the river the breakfast was amazing lots of choice tasty staff helpful
125474,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I was told I would have a queen room with a view I was on the bottom floor with a view of the car park didn t like that and was put in the smallest room wasn t happy, Was in a great location
125475,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Every thing was good no negatives, The room was lovely Massive comfortable bed Room was nice and warm we visited in February The staff never ignored you every one spoke
125476,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing really apart from the slightly on the expensive side food and that 11 30 is the latest water taxi over from Canary Wharf if you fancy a late night drinking spree that said there is a great bar in the hotel itself , Everything was great Food was excellent if a little expensive breakfast is fantastic staff are very polite and helpful the gymn is great rooms were very nice and clean and the bed was more comfortable than mine 
125477,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Service in Resteraunt very slow Booked through Booking com no information given ref free ferry to hotel poor instructions on how to get to the accommodation , Clean comfortable bed room Good breakfast 
125478,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Staff were courteous and helpful We had a number of queries and they listened and provided us with useful information When we asked for a specific issue to be rectified it was immediately and without fuss We would particularly like to thank Helen the Duty Manager who dealt with us on Friday 19th February 2016
125479,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room cold No additional blankets or pillows available Bed very hard and uncomfortable Poor view , Breakfast great Plenty of choice Breakfast staff nice very helpful 
125480,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Walked in room and curtains had fallen down They sent someone straight away to fix it but wasn t offered alternative room or anything Rooms very hard to find with different lifts and block layout Felt v much like converted 60s council flats Got a deal for 100 but definitely wouldn t pay top rate for it River bus useful but Canary Wharf station much further walk than indicated on site at least 15 20 mins Bar and restaurant quite upmarket room service extortionate with plate charge DoubleTree brand much better in other locations Leeds is beautiful , Car service brill much cheaper than taxis Super comfy bed and very quiet room with balcony and river view Bargain if you can get a room for around 100 
125481,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only draw back was that there isn t enough parking, Everything was lovely the staff were very helpful and approachable Would happily stay here again
125482,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bar was very expencive nothing to do around the hotel and fire alarm went off at 1 in the morning on Valentine s Day was not impressed, Nice hotel pretty clean
125483,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No heating in the bathroom Breakfast not included nearly everywhere includes it these days The bar charged 16 a GLASS for red wine , Bed was comfy no traffic noise great view over the Thames Free ferry over to Canary Wharf
125484,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I loved everything the receptionist was amazing He offered us cookies and was very approachable and lovely The view was great We had everything we asked for There is a bus stop just where the hotel is which allowed us not to struggle to find transport towards victoria They offered us ferry tickets for free All the staffs were amazing they are the real MVPs Loved it
125485,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Unfortunately this visit was poor Our room was very small and in the loft area room 417 even though I had booked a King Guest Room this was appalling and although fire alarm test was planned Wednesday morning at 11am we had 3 tests undertaken with the alarm siren in our room Very upsetting visit this time round , Been at Doubletree Hilton riverside few times now and venue and location is ideal and nice 
125486,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our first night was spent freezing in a room with no heating We made several complaints After receiving extra towels and a thin blanket to stay warm finally the manager came with a portable heater He was very apologetic and we did receive a discount room transfer for the second night and complimentary breakfast However the first night was very uncomfortable due to the lack of sleep and temperature I have recently been very unwell and being so cold all night was certainly not ideal ,No Positive
125487,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room could have been abit more cleaner The wait to get checked into the hotel was very poor I was waiting for over an hour even though I was told the room was ready we was just waiting on the keys , The room was nice and I liked the fact we was able to use the ferry The staff was friendly and the view was lovely 
125488,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The wifi wasn t free in the room according to my girlfriend I didn t use it and stuck to 4G The room was really nice but in the booking it said we d receive a city dock view and we faced the opposite way it wasn t too much of a big deal The room itself creaked LOTS The doors and floorboards from our room and the surrounding rooms creaked and the bed was although comfy hard to settle in because it was by far the creakiest thing An alarm did go off at 11 30pm which was incredibly loud We didn t know what it was but it could have been because the heating was up We had no warning this would happen and it my girlfriend was a little shook by it , Friendly staff and a great atmosphere It was welcoming and felt sophisticated but relaxed The room was incredibly nice and decorated well Free warm cookies on arrival is always a good thing The free ferry trips were incredibly useful and saved us time and money giving us more time to discover little areas we knew nothing about 
125489,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The organisation of this place was ridiculous Was given the wrong room in fact we had entered a room that was already occupied the ticket for room service wasn t taken and the toast on our breakfast wasn t even toast it was bread Absolutely disgusting They kept giving us the wrong keys for the rooms eventually after 45 mins we was put in the right room not what we had chosen but it did , Nothing it was awfawl 
125490,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was much smaller than I imagined especially the bathroom I also had check out at 2 00pm but we had the cleaners knocking at our door at 9 00 in the morning saying they were here to clean the room We informed them that we were not checking out till 2 00pm however we had another cleaner knock on our door at 10 00am for the same reason and again we explained we were not checking out until 2 00pm , The view was beautiful and the design of the bedroom was nice The staff at the reception were really friendly and I liked the free complimentary cookie that was warm 
125491,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The cookie they gave the moment we entered so that we atleast feel good about the cookie if not anything else Our stay was horrible They were not cooperative or welcoming or value for money Very rude expensive for no reason Youll find better places to stay in london this is a warning dont go on their rates its a sheer dissapointment
125492,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, That dinner was one price was a bit too much if you just wanted one meal but menu was set , Hotel was lovely nice atmosphere and liked the ferry to Canary Wharf 
125493,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The breakfast wasn t the best but parts of the breakfast was great and it was free due to a mishap with rooms so it made it even better I also think they should have a little more for there guest to do , The room and bathroom was nice the bed was extremely comfortable and view was beautiful 
125494,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Booking in and checking out could of been less of a wait but other than that we had an enjoyable stay, Size of the suite was excellent and the view was amazing Catching a ferry across was a really pleasant addition to our stay 
125495,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The heater didnt work The room was very small and the location was horrible From canary wharf i had to take a taxi which cost 20 , The food was decent and the staff were quite welcoming 
125496,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room wasn t as it appeared in the picture I was shown when I booked Couldn t see tv from the bed They took 50 extra from my bank account for each night we stay incase I decided to use the hotel services , Room was v good Free free crossing 
125497,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The temperature of the shower could have gone up slightly higher but that is all , Everything about this hotel was perfect I went with my boyfriend for a weekend away for Valentine s and the service was impeccable really friendly staff who were attentive and would go the extra mile View from our junior suite room was excellent Thames view beautiful Room was clean a big comfortable size bed was very comfy Complimentary breakfast and executive lounge with canap s and alcoholic and soft beverages throughout the evening Will definitely stay here again Thank you 
125498,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Did not like to first room we were allocated you could feel the springs on the Mattress after complaining we were upgraded to the New side of the hotel, The 2nd room we had was perfect comfy and spacious
125499,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We arrived quite late to check in and were quite tired from a day walking around London We got to the room and it was pretty nice until we started noticing small black hairs all over the place We ran a bath and just before getting in noticed a number of these hairs floating in the bath Then went to the sink and more hairs there Went to phone reception and to my surprise there was even hair on the phone Reception didn t answer despite a number of calls so we ended up having to go back to reception to complain We were given a new room but this isn t really ideal at midnight when all we wanted was a relaxing bath and to get to bed The staff seemed too used to dealing with complaints and even at this time there was a queue at reception where we overheard a few more complaints , The view was nice and the rooms although small were nice 
125500,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was cold bed was uncomfortable woke up at 6 15am by banging which was unloading of a Lorry outside our window Breakfast was messy and not a lot left at 9 00am ,No Positive
125501,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location could have been better They should also provide a more frequent ferry service on the weekend Also the lighting was really dim and dingy in our room and the glass on the Windows doors were frosted so didn t let much light in , The bathroom was really nice 
125502,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was no hot water in the morning resulting in cold showers The rooms were very small a lot smaller than expected from the picture The bar was massively over priced Paying 23 for a 7 bottle of wine , The overall d cor was nice and it was all very clean and the staff were nice and polite 
125503,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room want as clean as expected it was smaller than expected Heating in the bathroom was so hot and unable to switch it off Bed want very comfortable Have to get a boat to and from the hotel to Canary Wharf which we didn t not know about prior to our stay Also the television in our room was so poor half of the channels didn t work , Costa coffee in the hotel reception
125504,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I thought I had booked the hotel near the Tower of London so was disappointed when we arrived The hotel location was quite a distance from any sightseeing places and with the ferry that takes you across the river finishing at midnight we felt like we were on a curfew Our rooms felt like loft conversions with slanted ceilings not great with a 6 4 husband and you could feel and even hear the springs in the mattress so no sleep for all the wrong reasons Our alarm went off on the final evening of our stay with no explanation whatsoever To top it all off the towel rail was positioned behind the bathroom door so sprang back every time you opened the door causing injury on the last day to my arm , The breakfast here was lovely and the rooms were clean 
125505,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The first room we was given 1 out of 5 radiators worked which meant our room was freezing very small room considering price we paid We got moved to another room which was also very cold We arranged for breakfast to be brought to the room the same as many couples at the hotel and after waiting an hour our breakfast did not arrive and didn t think the overall service was acceptable for a valentines weekend stay at a Hilton hotel , The hotel itself was lovely great location food was good
125506,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Generally nothing Loved every minute , The hotel was excellent Excellent boat service helpful staff fantastic room We had a brilliant stay Would highly recommend it 
125507,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Was supposed to be a junior suite and it didn t even have a mini bar Staff charged me for the room twice on top of a 100 deposit Staff I spoke to were rude and dismissive Wouldn t stay here again , View was nice
125508,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, A bit difficult to get to and from Quite expensive Deluxe king room a bit small Step into bathroom a pain , The bed was very comfortable and the view was amazing The staff were very friendly and the food service in the restaurant was exemplary The steak was excellent 
125509,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The reception area was very cold and the corridors weren t clean i e 1 2 eaten apples in the ice machine wine glass on the floor in the lift coffee cups on floor in corridors These stayed there for hours as passed them numerous times whilst walking too and from the room Shame the communal parts of the hotel didn t match up to the rooms , the novelty of the boat ride friendly staff Rooms were lovely Good breakfast 
125510,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room was very cold and it could not be fixed Staff brought the extra heater and asked me on the last night if they could compensate it The location is very deserted , Staff going extra mile to solve the problem Nicely decorated old building
125511,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Parking a little on the experience side but then again it is London most probably about avarge , Decor of the hotel comfy and well equipped rooms Ferry across the Thames from the hotel to Canarie wharf for free 
125512,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only downside we encountered was that the bed although very comfy was extremely rickety and creaky I woke up on numerous occasions during my stay due to creaks and groans everytime me or my partner rolled over , The staff very extremely welcoming and the food and drink in the restaurant was beautiful Also the added addition of complimentary ferry tickets completely rectified the isolated position of the hotel 
125513,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Getting back to the hotel late at night was very tricky tried to attempted to ring the hotel for a taxi but went round in circuls with the options on the phone so gave up did ask for some flowers and bubbly in the room as was a birthday weekend but didn t receive this and no reason as to why, The breakfast was beautiful as so was the staff xx the bed was lovely and comfortable to
125514,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Use softer toilet paper what they used was awful There ya go I ll take my own next time now I know, The huge bed and the room We upgraded and it was lovely The only bad point was when we upgraded the receptionist said the room overlooked the river it didn t But hey ho it was a lovely room anyway 
125515,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff didn t answer the phone I called the Careline three times and each time gave up and were not very informative Hotel is not so easy to reach though the free shuttle boat service is good , Breakfast was very good Big choice of food once we found it Room was comfortable if small 
125516,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Took a while to get to the central London but not their fault I suppose , The bed was comfy loved the free ferry service and lovely welcome when going into the hotel
125517,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was super super small 140cm not a cm bigger and we couldn t get a room with a bigger bed So the sleeping part was terrible , Great location with parking nice view 
125518,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact that I had wasted my phone bill and rang customer services straight after I had booked the hotel room asking for a small favour to make that one night very special for my girlfriend as it was her 21st asking if they could give us a room with a good view or anything nice and on the phone they did say they will book us into a good room with a nice view but when we got there they had given us a room with a backyard view and very Denced space I wasn t happy at all I had to make the effort to ask if they could change the room which they did but not what I expected for me this was very embarrassing Overall The fact that I had rang customer service and had it planned 2 weeks before the arrival and still walking in to something completely opposite to what I expected Not happy , N a
125519,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing , Loved this hotel nothing was a problem for the staff Rooms were small but clean and comfortable especially the bed it was extra comfy I have to mention David in the Columbia bar excellent customer service and always smiling 
125520,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, For a hotel in this class one would have expected a mini bar or at least a fridge in the room An outside seat and table on the balcony would have been a bonus , Fantastic riverside location with idyllic ferry service across the river Only 3 minutes from Canary Wharf Comfortable room with a view Excellent breakfast Friendly polite and efficient staff Bus service C10 right outside the door to Rotherhithe and Victoria 
125521,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, A better view as requested prior to arrival The full English breakfast charge is extortionate 20 for a breakfast And the boat service to Canary Wharf finished at 11pm on a weekend It would be a lot better if that ran later on weekends at least as people want to go out , Cookie on arrival Professional staff and comfortable room 
125522,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The fact that the hotel cannot guarantee an early check in and when you re travelling a long way to get to your destination it s not ideal to have to wait until 3pm to get in a room you ve missed all your day nearly , The hotel is in a great location A ferry ride across the Thames from the hotel s pier to the Docklands pier and you re ten minutes from the tube to get you where you need to be We had no problem with parking the car as the street outside the hotel has many spaces for people to choose from or you can pay the 12 and park in the hotel s car park The hotel room was clean and comfortable so no complaints there We had a room up on the 4th floor but it didn t matter to us We didn t eat in the restaurant but the food looked really good Overall we had a great weekend 
125523,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I d have liked a little more detail on the travel around from the hotel as we walked a long way from Rotherhithe Overground train in the cold when it would have been easier to go to Canary Wharf station and take the ferry across to the hotel which is free , Comfortable bed good views of the Thames from the room Great boat service to Canary Wharf once you know its there 
125524,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Using the boat to get to Canary Wharf was great especially when it s free to residence , We stayed here 5 years ago and the hotel was tired since then they have done a great job in sprucing it up into a lovely hotel It s great to be a bus boat and tube ride away from most of the destinations 
125525,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I wish we got a Cookie when we left , Love the free river boat to Canary Wharf was the highlight of the stay Also love the cookies on arrival to the hotel 
125526,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The soap provided had dry suds on so it seemed like the bar of soap has been used before , Free ferry service was excellent They let us into our room 3 hours before official check in time 
125527,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Tv on wall perpendicular to the bed so not watchable when in bed and only one comfy chair with suitable TV viewing Booked for a river view but had to lean over the balcony to see the river from our window , Bed was very comfortable and spacious Shower great Nice warm cookies on arrival 
125528,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room bathroom although comfy clean was a litle to small for my liking but nevertheless warm cosy , The location was excellent we also enjoyed the free river boat trip across to the shopping centres attractions Breakfast was a bonus too with a variety to choose from 
125529,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The whole hotel is clearly tatty and slightly tacky The hallways the doors the woodwork in the rooms are that old dark brown stained bashed up wood used in seedy cheap B Bs around the UK They have pipped an artificial sickly sweet air freshener via the air conditioning which makes a dreadful noise when on into the corridors and bedrooms Truly nauseating if not a health hazard The shower bath very narrow and difficult to climb into for a shower and slippery had rusting taps and mould between the all the edging The towels and flannels were actually shredded The beds were so creaky you daren t move for waking people up And you could hear everything that was going on in the neighbouring rooms Oh and finally if you are into all things brown this is the hotel for you Not at all what we expected for a so called 4 star hotel Shame on you , The area around Surrey Quays is an interesting area
125530,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Corridors plain narrow dark and a bit intimidating My room in no way could be described as feature as had been expected re the booking info It was a box with unfortunately an uninspiring view of the main entrance Ferry a nice touch If you want to get anywhere quick though transportation is a little cumbersome, The location opposite Canary Wharf was inspiring with a good view from communal areas Nice hustle and bustle about the place though with an overall relaxed out of city centre atmosphere Very unique in it s style plus Hilton high standards Arrived late but stress free check in and nice cookie touch 
125531,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Have stayed here before and would happily stay again The staff go out of their way to help you and an I love the complimentary cookies on arrival The ferry taxi makes it so convenient for getting in and around London with Canary Wharf station just a 5 minute walk once you ve crossed the river Lovely views day and night from the room 
125532,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We decided to spend a little more and have an executive room we were slightly disappointed with the basics , We have stayed there several times we love the location and everyone is welcoming 
125533,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No shampoo in rm No hot water in the morning Being a vegetarian at breakfast the vegetarian sasauage tasted like rubber and cold I suggest someone to taste them ,No Positive
125534,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bins rubbish area was outside our window and even with it closed you could hear the trolies banging quite early , Loved the free cookie when you check in Room was gorgeous 
125535,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, n a, loved this hotel really comfy bed tea coffe facilitys a free ferry ride from the hote to restaurants and shops on the other side of the thames 
125536,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Reception staff very rude TV in room broken Asked four times for it to be fixed was still broke when I left Room service very expensive , Breakfast had great variety friendly staff The free boat crossing was great as the hotel wasn t in a good location for travelling to London city centre 
125537,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Couldn t turn the air conditioning down so was too Hot at night also requested a water front bedroom to actually get there and have to pay 25 pound more than was told , The breakfast was very good 
125538,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Damp smell in corridor and claustrophobic feel of particular room I stayed in and couldn t see outside, Style Ease of access to facilities relaxed atmosphere warm cosy room
125539,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Heating unit too loud but telhey provide a seperate heater All was ok, Customer service The quality of room The room size Comfort of the room Definetly worth staying in the suite with river view
125540,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, loved the welcome and the cookie we had early check in which was much appreciated room service was great the ferry service was awesome and they kept the ferry open later for us highly recommended and will be back soon 
125541,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the staff when we first got there were useless the tv did not work, the manager pauly christian was amazing really helpful and upgraded us after a horrible day made us feel really welcome room was really spacious and breakfast was fantastic 
125542,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, No free wifi throughout hotel, Hot chocolate cookie on arrival Free ferry tickets which we used to get to Canary wharf then tube to O2 Very comfy bed Great views Bus stop right outside hotel Good breakfast First hotel I have not been wakened by other guests doors banging or noisy lifts 
125543,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I was initially given room 052 which was right next to the main entrance so the traffic noise woke me early on the first morning When I complained I was moved but that room had no hot water the following morning Had to take a cold shower as I needed to be at an early appointment Apparently there was no hot water in that part of the hotel , The ferry across to Canary Wharf was smoothly operated by friendly helpful staff Breakfasts were well prepared with plenty of choice 
125544,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Everything was good, Staff were very helpful and cheerful Breakfast was cooked very well with an excellent selection Restaurant and bar staff helpful and welcoming
125545,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The walls are really thin and it s quite noisy didn t get the best nights sleep however beds were comfy, Lovely room good location and nice views of the Thames
125546,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, that you only get 60 mins free wifi in certain areas The rooms can be expensive and having wifi avaliable all round would make this hotel even better for people, Loved the warm cookies Although we didn t get them on arrival but as soon as we made staff aware they apologised and handed them to us The organisation of both the hotel boat and the clipper from Canary Wharf was excellent
125547,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff came across a little rude trying to rush us through check in Maybe as there was a que but still we had travelled for over 2 hours and it didn t feel very welcoming We only had 2 milk sachets in the room so when we returned from an evening at the o2 we went to reception to ask for more milk so myself and my partner could have a drink from the room facilities but it seemed we interrupted a conversation between 2 members of staff I Felt uncomfortable On departure when checking out the receptionist did not tell us about stairway in the building down to the Carpark so we went outside and found we couldn t exit the way in which we had arrived as the metal shutter gate to the car park was down This wasnt down on arrival down the ramp So we came back up the ramp into reception to be told of a stairwell in the main reception going down to the Carpark then after going downstairs we found out that you need a coin to exit the Carpark which we were not given After returning upstairs a second time and feeling rather annoyed after having to que and ask to get the coin it all felt very unorganised , The location I can t fault it was excellent great view and comfortable beds although I wish we were told about the free ferry it would of saved us a long round trip to the O2 
125548,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The heater in the room didn t actually heat up so the room was quite cold at times Also it was difficult to close the wooden shutter because the heater got in the way But overall they seemed quite minor , The room was very similar to the photos on the site lovely decor and spacious It was a nice surprise that we got a free ferry ticket for the duration of our stay The welcome cookie was also a nice touch 
125549,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I had difficulty connecting to the wifi as I couldn t figure out how to connect to it and when I tried con aging the restaurant on our room phone nobody answered , Very friendly staff and a free room upgrade with a beautiful view Also found the free ferry tickets extremely useful and the hot cookie on arrival was just an added bonus 
125550,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bar was a good place to sit but there was a cold breeze so too chilly to be comfortable for long , I enjoyed the short ferry ride to the hotel the room was very clean and staff were happy and helpful Close to Docklands bars and restaurants A little tricky with travel in to town but not too bad once we d worked it out A
125551,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 35 minute wait to check in receptionist did not relay much or relevant information forgotten to give us water taxi tickets advise of facilities or where anywhere was located heating wasn t working so reception was freezing was 1 degree outside no heating in room quickly got moved to another hotel location far further than stated from tube stop , Free water taxi across to canary wharf quay complementary cookies and waterwatered arrival great rooms good taxi service from hotel cool bar 
125552,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When we arrived at the hotel the room that we were given was not as described I was promised a river city view but all we could see was the flats opposite so we asked to change rooms The second room we were given was beautiful and had a lovely view The room was clean however the toilet had not been flushed The air conditioning was on full blast in the middle of January and couldn t be turned off We had to get a maintenance man the come to our room to switch the system off completely The room was still freezing so we had to get a radiator sent to the room We found the staff quite rude When we called reception about the air conditioning there was no answer My partner went down to reception and asked why there was no answer and the woman shrugged her shoulders and said I don t know , The room in the hotel was beautiful the view was lovely and the room all in all was very comfortable 
125553,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We were left standing at the bar and other customers came after but got served first and we were due to check out at 12midday but the maid knocked and came in our room at 11 then again at 11 40 , The rooms
125554,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, the bed was pretty hard, Location was ideal for travel in to London with 2 different buses a stones throw away from the main entrance and a ferry going from the hotel to canary wharf scenery was lovely at night with all the skyline lit up from the buildings on the other side of the river 
125555,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The facilities are poor They have had a refurbishment and there are many problems if you stay on the Wharf side I wouldn t stay there again and regret my booking with this hotel Approached staff and Hilton customer services with regards to no hot water poor water pressure noise issues but no solutions Very poor , Thames Ferry docks at the hotel Great link to the rest of the city as nearest tube is a good 15 minute walk via parks Wouldn t walk this at night obviously 
125556,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Great location and love the ferry back and forth to Canary Wharf Our room was fantastic with a view of Canary Wharf in the evening We had a free upgrade on our arrival too Beds and really comfortable room was a great size all clean and tidy Fantastic time 
125557,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We didn t get the room we had booked we had asked for and paid for a river view and ended up not getting a view at all The heating didn t work the television did not show the main channels the hair drier didn t work , The location was perfect for what we wanted 
125558,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The shower sprayed water all over the bathroom when used They did provide you with extra towels for the floor , The great free ferry service from their dock to the other side of the river The room was large and spacious The staff were very helpful We had a view of the river which was a lovely surprise 
125559,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I ordered room service pizza chips and some noodles I had to wait for over an hour for this When I finished you was told to leave the plates on a tray outside your door which we did it was very dangerous and the corridor was very slim but that wasn t my main concern When walking to breakfast the next morning me and my partner walked in a private room next to the elevator mistaking it for the stairwell and in there was the tray with the plates and leftover food on I have photo evidence The room was clean but bits were obviously rushed and missed there was what seemed to be a pubic hair on the telephone and long blonde hair in the bath I have brown hair overall it was an average hotel to stay in nothing like it makes out to be I recently stated in the hotel In Leeds doubletree which was amazing and is the only reason I went for a Hilton doubletree again Very disappointing, It was very convenient that the hotel offers a free boat to Canary Wharf
125560,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location was a bit tricky to get to charged an obscene amount for two sandwiches and some crisps Kitchen closed at 11 but we ordered foor at ten to and were told it was closed Cold Tesco sandwiches x5 the price was massively out of order , Beautiful room lovely hotel free transport over the river for guests
125561,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, If I was being hyper critical the service in the restaurant was a bit inconsistent , Lovely hotel Amazing value though I did book as part of a January offer Very comfortable and would stay again 
125562,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room service turned out to be a bit more expensive than expected as well as the wi fi in the rooms , Very good location out of the center of London quiet Transport was quite easy Clean rooms and warm atmosphere 
125563,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Checked in and agreed to a standard room instead of the river view room that I had booked and was willing to pay for The room is uncomfortable noisy area of the hotel kept thinking someone was going to come into our room Was disturbed when having a bath with men knocking on my door wanting in to service the bathroom when I was still checked into the room Drilling began at 9am each morning Never told when checked in that needed a ferry ticket luckily had my oyster card but was 2 70 to get across when could of had free trip if the hotel had of told me Checked out with my bill expected it to be paid on that day and not 7 days later the hotel now take the money leading my bank into overdraft Look elsewhere Yes it s nice hotel but really not worth it , Ferry from the hotel to Canary Wharf
125564,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I m not sure that it was the faults hotel but when booking this for New Years Eve through Booking Com I was led to believe I had booked the Hilton beside Tower Bridge We therefore had planned out entire day thinking we was in another part of London when in fact we was the other side of the river This caused a few issues as we had tickets booked for the theatre a restaurant booked for the evening and even tickets purchased for the fireworks all on the South side yet we was no where near any of this The hotel is lovely yet very disappointed with Booking Com as their description of the hotel is not up to date there is no swimming pool and the king suite does not have a kitchenette nor does it look anything like the pictures they are advertising , Clean spacious lovely breakfast
125565,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I have booked for an riverside room however I had got the most smallest and horrible room ever I have been advised by Booking com that I had booked for a riverside room but when I get to the hotel after 3 hours of driving it was a terrible mistake to go through booking com you have let me down You should get for what you pay Terrible ,No Positive
125566,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It was quite difficult to find the right elevator for the right section where your room was located It was like a rabbit warren or a maze There wasn t enough staff on at reception causing long waits for service, I liked the fact that you could take the ferry over to Canary Wharf It was delightful to walk over there 
125567,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We booked a deluxe queen room with a balcony and they gave us the key to a 2 single beds room and no balcony Complained at the reception one of the members of staff was absolutely useless however a gentlemen got involved and managed to find us a room better than the one we actually booked for the same price , The view
125568,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Poor ventilation in our room and No mini bar Expensive wifi 15 per day for wifi in room is a bit too much , Excellent view from restaurant Amazing breakfast and loved that frequent complementary ferry to Canary warf 
125569,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff had the cheek to tell me the queen size balcony rooms were unavailable Offered me a double supreme room and said that it was more expensive than my originally booked room but won t charge me extra A little research later and I find out that it is in fact 40 CHEAPER Poor service sly methods of money making and staff who lie On top of that a room I had booked 3 weeks prior is unavailable No one offered to carry our bags either , Clean hotel nice cookies on entrance
125570,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hotel was quite out of the way as the tube station was quite a walk as we found out with bags in tow There is a bus service which runs from Canada Water station to outside the hotel which was useful but next time I would rather stay more central as we spent a lot of time travelling in and out 20 95 plus a 5 tray charge for breakfast was rather extortionate however it was nice , Rooms were nice clean and modern Staff extremely helpful and ferry service useful The outdoor seating area off the bar is fantastic on the Thames and over looking Canary Warf 
125571,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I booked a smoking room as an essential part of my stay with the intention of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever with plans of giving up for 2016 so my partner and I arranged to do it in style only to arrive at the hotel and be told they have never had smoking rooms We decided to stay anyway since we had made the trip trying to park was also an issue as the shutters did not work so I had to leave the car and walk back in to inform staff who let us in manually I believe we checked in at 10pm and checked out at 12 30 because what I had prepared myself for in terms of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever became much more stressful than I had anticipated so much so that i had to check out and we deemed it better to go home rather than stay in the hotel room , Location 
125572,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff advised breakfast was from 7 we got there at 730 only to be told on New Year s Day it s 8 We weren t the only ones I ll advised , The building and travel desk 
125573,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, A little out the way for tube services as its either a long walk to canary wharf or a short bus ride to Canada water however the river bus service made it reasonably easy and added a little extra to our trip, Great staff lovely breakfast and clean rooms yummy cookies on arrival
125574,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 3 friends travelled and we each booked a room would have liked the rooms to be adjacent to each other or at least on same floor , Decent price for London complimentary ferry to take customers across the river
125575,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I am probably a bit picky since generally it was very clean But could just do with a deep clean ie corners etc , Staff were great did their best if we had a problem always ready to accommodate Really friendly and helpful made us feel welcome Thank you Great with kids smart hotel but not too posh that you are scared to let your kids run around Things were made easy for us with kids It was a good balance The location was ideal since located in quieter side of London but great accessibility to tube ferry About ten mins overall to get to the jubilee line with kids obviously faster without kids Breakfast options were great beyond what we expected Great choses for kids too We would stay again 
125576,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The noise from the staff sorting bins outside our window woke us up At breakfast staff told us they never expected this many people but surely they should have as u need to pre book, It was clean
125577,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The check in was very slow only 2 people on reception and the hotel was full We checked in and then had to queue again for nearly 15 minutes when we returned to collect our key , The hotel was nice and comfortable boat service was very reliable and easy to use 
125578,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, even I ask them a room on high level the room I stayed was on ground floor and also definitely different from the picture on Booking com hallway gives off stinky smell , The view from the room is really awesome 
125579,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I fell in the hotel which resulted in a broken ankle and 4 hours in St Thomas s missing out on all booked surprises I think staff should have been more supportive then trying to diagnose and offer taxi to hospital which cost us 25 I slipped on carpet in the bedroom, We had difficulty locating hotel maps and directions sent were poor quality On arrival a member of staff did her best to sort out the problem for us which resulted in a discount a the end of stay Good helpful staff
125580,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff never answered the reception phone and were not overly friendly A long wait to check in as only one desk open , River boat shuttle cookie on arrival and hotel appearance design
125581,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The problem was the boxing day tht 25 12 and 26 12 there was no boat transport and 25 12 general no public trasport and almost everything closed but that doesn t have to do with the hotel , Everything 
125582,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The walls are so thin we could hear the people next door and the people in the hallways conversations very clearly almost word for word This made it very difficult to almost impossible to get a good nights sleep This was a very disappointing way to end an amazing trip , We loved the view of the city 
125583,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, They charge for tv channels didn t say any thing befor if you wach sky it s extra charge dis casting they charge me 39 pounds for no region they shod tel customer befor tarm and condition bad sarvices
125584,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Further from central London than I thought but river taxi service was good , The hotel was clean and comfortable the breakfast was very good service as well staff were friendly and helpful 
125585,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Toilet was blocked during our stay and a few holes covered up in the tiles in the bathroom, The views from the balcony looking over the thames was amazing 
125586,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The room was not well laid out There was no windows in the Queen bedroom just a frosted door which when opened led to the fire exit Probably not the easiest place to stay if traveling into back and forth from the hotel to central london,No Positive
125587,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Paid the room at the start of the week When checking in another 100 was taking and we were not made aware of this It was later explained when I asked about it The next day my bank ring fenced the payment so I was 200 down and not told I explained I had bank charges because they did not have me sign anything upon checking or even explain the process First room given was not what I paid for it was not until I raised a complaint they changed this ,No Positive
125588,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hotel is very isolated unless the ferry to Canary Wharf works for you I chose the hotel because Booking com told me it was only a couple of miles from the venue in Wapping I was spending the evening at It didn t point out there was a bloody great river in the way and the taxi fare to get across was about 40 so the need to use bus and overground meant I had to leave before the end , Modern hotel nice view across the river to Canary Wharf although my room wasn t facing that way Warm cookie on check in although I had to remind the receptionist 
125589,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Customer service was awful at check in nobody seemed to know what was going on Service was also bad in the bar took ages to get served several times We asked could we order food 3 times It was only when I got angry that they bothered to take an interest Food was nice when it eventually arrived , Room was lovely
125590,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Didn t like the disorganised parking facilities and having to return a key card before leaving for the day Didn t like where the TV in the room was placed as it was impossible to watch in comfort, I loved the welcome and felt a valued guest
125591,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing oh except the bar prices are a bit steep but then it s a 4 star hotel in London , Friendly accommodating staff Relaxed atmosphere and cosy room with floor to ceiling window balcony and great view over the Thames Lovely breakfast Got the Guest of the Day award of a bounty bag of snacks Nearness to south bank and best bits of London Near to a Thames Clipper boat station Or can walk to Borough Market in 50 minutes without stops Looked as though the place has been refurbed since our last stay Very warm and inviting bar and restaurant areas Good sandwiches in bar in evening with chips Shame the pool has gone but then we would not have time to use it this visit anyway 
125592,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Drinks at bar were very expensive unfortunately, Loved the welcome cookie and the ferry tickets were a nice touch This hotel is exceeded our expectations and was very easy to get to Canary Wharf
125593,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, treatment from other staff had to wait a long time for room to be ready was told Queen Riverside view Got a double bed and a view of a wall Costly and no different to a Travel Lodge Premier Inn, The concierge on arrival was a nice guy
125594,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, wifi is not for free and the hotwater has something wrong in 1 morning and happened when I was showering cold to die and altough the ferry is good but still a little bit borning in the evening , the bed is awesome and had very good sleep there 
125595,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bed is not very comfortable shower need a bit more power The food at the bar was average but rather expensive and I did not like the fact that service charge had been added without asking, Location Room decor General decoration
125596,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Lack of information in reception about car parking the receptionist wasn t sure how it worked costs etc , The room was very spacious comfortable and clean Location was excellent with free access to the ferry Nice views to the river 
125597,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Not a fault of the hotel just make sure you know how to get to the hotel if arriving by tube , Great location for meetings across the river at Canary Wharf A ferry runs from a jetty connected to the lobby Super night time view from the bar terrace 
125598,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Dreadful dingy corridors small rooms tiny bathrooms bar manager and his staff rude and ignorant Reception staff not very pleasant Hilton really dropped the standard in this place Breakfast was overpriced factory canteen food Disgraceful, Ferry to Canary Wharf and Costa coffee in the reception That s it 
125599,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Member of staff told us we hadn t paid upon checking out when we had paid upon arrival Charged twice for stay had to ring to get money back Maid walked into our room before our checkout time without knocking , Location is good and ferry service very helpful
125600,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I hated the bed and the fact there was soo much noise during the night I could hear the room next for taking a shower The bed was ver uncomfortable and squeaked at every turn , I loved the location
125601,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Just a little niggle the bathroom radiator did not work so a chilly start to the day And the mattress needs replacing , The staff location and ferry service were excellent 
125602,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, The hotel was very quiet and the service was good The location was good too Had a king room with a great view over Canary Wharf Had access to the executive lounge which was a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the bar The ferry service was really efficient and regular Easy to walk to town if you wanted to The breakfast was really enjoyable I would definitely stay here again 
125603,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, I loved the free warm and delicious cookies on arrival they went perfectly with tea in the room The hotel was beautiful and the suite we stayed in was very comfortable with a gorgeous view of the river and Canary Wharf Room service was quick and delicious with every thing we needed We felt right at home

125610,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our TV didn t work I m sure if we d asked it would have been sorted but as we were only staying a night we didn t bother Shame it wasn t checked beforehand though The main issue is with the wifi The code didn t work in the room and we had no phone signal I really think such a massive hotel chain should provide free wifi in the rooms , Love that you get cookies on arrival at Doubletree Hotels The room was surprisingly spacious considering it was the cheapest option It was also nice and quiet

125617,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The taxi company you use for your hotel guests is a rip off How they can justify charging me 20 for a 3 mile journey early saturday morning when there is very little traffic is a joke The driver didn t know where he was going and kept hitting the curb Rubbish , Lovely comfy bed I was upgraded when there was a slight problem with my original room Great showers great view helpful staff very quiet 
125618,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It was not convenient for the attractions and the nearest tube station involved a bus or ferry trip Too far out from things and nothing in the immediate vicinity shops etc , The staff were really welcoming and friendly

125626,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was rather small We had reserved a King Guest and the description suggested a large double king size bed The bed was a small double Room 187 Requested a river view and overlooked a car park didn t really matter as the weather visibility was poor , The hotel was very good v good breakfast and nicely furnished
125627,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Leaving to go home , Such helpful staff and we got upgraded for free as soon as we got there as a surprise Amazing place to stay Lovely bar and gorgeous room and views 
125628,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The narrow double bed in our room We assumed that being a Hilton hotel it was a queen size bed, Riverside location though from our room the river view could not be seen 
125629,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Had to que for breakfast then breakfast hall was very crowded Expert that a hotel of this standard would we able to supply wifi , Very Nice and helpfull staff 
125630,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Televison didn t work some sockets wouldn t take plugs river view was actually of a car park main light in room wouldn t work, Location
125631,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Utter waste of money you book something and they give you a random room no Wi Fi no parking , Don t book room here Regardless if what you book wither delux or with balcony they just give you a small random room with no view no balcony 
125632,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I emailed to find out about the ferry to get to the hotel but received no reply I called to check and the person I spoke to told me it was complicated to get from the tube to the ferry so recommended getting the bus It s actually very easy to get to the ferry from canary wharf The room was okay but as I have found with lots of these rooms on booking com in London they are huge rooms that the hotel really has trouble selling or need upgrading and don t really represent a deal as such , View from the terrace and outside bar area and breakfast Ferry to canary wharf
125633,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff are untrained and inexperienced 2 big events on in the area O2 concert and World Cup Rugby and there were not enough staff to cater for all the guests well enough Poor communication and badly stocked bar no Guinness Insufficient food to fulfil the menu , Rooms are comfortable and staff are friendly 
125634,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The size of the room for what we paid was quite small There was no main light or floor lamp in the room so in the evening it was quite dim The mattress on the bed was not comfy you could hear and feel the springs again for the money you expect more, The location of the hotel was excellent the water ferry was very convenient and it was great to use the river rather than just land transport Balcony in the room was a plus 
125635,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The tv didn t work we had to psych 50 per payment which was not mentioned before hand, When s liked the balcony and the room size including our bed
125636,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Didn t have a working television There was no hot water On complaining in the morning reception staff said boiler was faulty didn t really help our predicament Breakfast not worth the price , Beautiful setting on the river Was able to sit outside until late into the evening as blankets and patio heaters were provided Bedrooms ideal lovely comfortable bed 
125637,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The length of time it took for us to actually check in was ridiculous I had always been told double tree are great hotel and give you a cookie on arrival where as this wasn t something we experienced on our stay but did see others had which isn t great service also we had booked the king suit and this looked nothing like the pictures there was no telephone in the room to call down reception and we was on the 6th floor 8 staircase so as you can imagine this would have been useful also the hotel added 10 on to our taxi fare and we wasn t made aware there was an additional charge for the hotel calling the taxi overall I was disappointed I wouldn t choose a hilton or doubletree again I would recommend a Novotel , I liked the fact there was a free ferry ride over to canary wharf the included breakfast with the stay was worthwhile
125638,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Noise from adjoining rooms upstairs children running round banging doors , Wonderful view excellent room and facilities Clean and tidy Could not have asked for more 
125639,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, room not ready at 3pm fro check in Room very dusty Breakfast chaotic and dis organised, The room was tastefully decorated Some of the reception staff were excellent choice of breakfast and quality was above expectation 
125640,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Some of the rooms on the ground level are a little bit older than the rooms on the higher floors from my experience with this hotel , Good value for money in the off season During summer the rates can be a little on the higher end as it is considered a four star hotel The staff seem to maker an effort to give customer service based on HIlton standards 
125641,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing apart from the bath plug needed a bit of maintenance, The welcome when we arrived after midnight The view The ferry ticket The lovely breakfast The quiet room Every member of staff was cheerful and pleasant
125642,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Being given the wrong information about what level my room was on , A unique experience of the Canary Wharf skyline at night great room with desk etc the breakfast is excellent as are the waiting staff who serve and want to help guests It was a pleasure to be served by polite staff I will always check out this Hotel everytime I am in London henceforth 
125643,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 TV installed at 90 degrees to bed weird 2 Room over car park very noisy most of the night 3 Toilet seat broken 4 Chair broken 5 After complaining they agreed to move us to another room and agreed to move our luggage When we returned late on Sunday night they had not moved our luggage and seemed confused 6 Breakfast at 21 pounds was cold pre fried eggs and hard bacon 7 Summary while staff seemed eager to please there seemed to be a general lack of management, Spending two days in London 
125644,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I booked a bigger room with a balcony and had to settle for a small room without a balcony , The hotel was beautiful and very modern The food was amazing 
125645,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The only thing that I would point out is that the room was cold and there were no instructions for the air conditioning system We stayed cool , We my 10 year old daughter and I arrived late and tired having got ourselves lost on Canary Warf and then missing the shuttle ferry The young man at reception was delightful updgraded us and cheered my daughter up with warm cookies Breakfast was lovely we didn t have the hot option but really enjoyed our fruit yogurt and croissants
125646,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff were acting funny because we wanted a refund as we didn t get the room we booked for After 20mins of going back and forth we were offered a suitable room offering city and river views , I liked the bathroom mirror which was perfect and bed so comfortable

125649,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Asked for a balcony with a nice view Received a room without a balcony altough paid for one Had to change rooms once changed really disappointed with the view from the room which was over a car park and of the housing building next door Made the stay so unromantic ,No Positive
125650,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, False advertisement on the pictures of the room The picture outlined was not what we got in the end I didn t like the fact we had a stone wall in our room was extremely cold Fire alarm was set off due to a guest smoking in their room even though it states on booking com that you can have a smoking room we were stood outside for 10 minutes because we weren t allowed in the building When we eventually got in the ambience was very cold no one to greet us no music no heating all staff approx 10 were running around like headless chickens unsure of what they should be doing when in fact should have made all guests aware of what was happening We were then told that we would be charged 13 for parking our car I refused to pay and the concierge waivered the charge which we were grateful for The room itself needed a re vamp Hard bed old furniture with stains on even the food menu was covered in red wine ,No Positive
125651,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, It wasn t like other hiltons rooms were ok , There was a problem with our room and the supervisor upgraded us and provided excellent customer care

125653,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The rooms are very small for a 4 star hotel and you can hardly move around in their bathrooms , The Breakfast and accessibility to transport was very good
125654,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, When you don t know about the ferry coming from City Airport it is a bit of a hassle to get there DLR Underground Bus , Great location very near Canary Wharf and excellent connection with the ferry
125655,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Room definitely not like pictures Completely misrepresented Website showed nice balcony had Juliet balcony also misrepresentative 1 curtain was hanging light didn t work tv didn t work fridge didn t work Etc etc etc etc Had a kid one bed suite with a normal size bed come on who puts a normal size bed in a suite Due to small bed and snoring I had to sleep on sofa Left a day early couldn t take it, View was terrific
125656,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The service at breakfast wasn t very good the staff sat us down and didn t explain How the breakfast worked we wasn t offered tea or coffee we sat down wondering if we could just go up to the buffet or if we had to wait for a waitress we then had to get someone attention to get a tea and coffee, We loved the location of the hotel we think we would of struggled to get to the hotel if we didn t have the use of the ferry so this is very convenient
125657,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Firstly our room we booked wasn t the one we was given Bathroom was tiny view wasn t what we booked river view our room looked at the bar restaurant Charged me 50 pound extra even though the receipt showed correct amount my bank statement says otherwise Poor hotel all round will not use again , Being in london
125658,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Restaurant food was disappointing and some staff were welcoming As a single woman I didn t want to sit in the bar to eat but was not allowed to order from the bar menu and be served in the restaurant One of the more expensive places I have stayed in the area and the least satisfying, Reception staff were friendly and helpful Moved me to a quieter room with out any question
125659,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff were very slow to respond to calls from the room room service response in particular needs improving need also make sure all room facilities are in place and good order, Very good sized room staff very friendly and good location for Canary Wharf
125660,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The ferry over the river is difficult to find when you first arrive on canary wharf side When you eventually find the dock there are no clear directions Not particularly good when you arrive late in the evening very tired Also TV in room was not working so having arrived late and unpacked we had to pack up again and be moved to another room The hotel sorted it quickly but inconvenient having to be moved all amenities should be checked prior to arrival to avoid this , The room was very comfortable clean and spacious Just a quick trip over the river to the hotel Welcomed with a warm chocolate cookie Value for money
125661,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Car parking facilities inadequately explained Phones not working in two rooms Room standard booked was not provided and had to be changed New room was not to the same standard as booked 24 hour room service not as described in brochure i e nothing other than supermarket sandwiches after 11pm When ordered not delivered Both rooms had broken desk drawers Flaking paint plaster in stairwell With the exception of one member of staff attitude and advice from staff unhelpful Radio did not work , One member of staff was actually helpful 
125662,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I booked a queen suite however was extremely dissapointed to find the bed was only a double I confronted reception who offered us free breakfast but no offer to put us in the correct room At breakfast the service is shockingly bad We sat out on the terrace and i had to go looking for for cuttlery and glaases for drinks when people inside were waited on at tables Would never reccomend to anyone , The location is good as is the free ferry over to canary wharf The room was clean 
125663,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The location isn t a massive problem and the majority of the time the walk to and from the tube station was quite nice However when in a rush or carrying bags it s much worse and having to wait for the boat can be quite frustrating , The foyer and the bar were well designed and the rooms were too The sound of the waves washing up on a morning were a particularly nice suprise 
125664,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast on the Sunday was very busy 600 people staying at the hotel We turned up at 10 00 and we had to queue for a table and then we had to queue again for a cooked breakfast Not enough staff to cope with the demand which resulted in uncleared tables no plates and glasses at the food stations and not very happy customers Though once you got your food it was very good with a wide selection on offer Location was a bit too far out for central London but once we located the right tube line at Canary Wharf situated within the shopping centre which is a bit of a maze we managed to get into Covent Garden , The area the hotel is situated in is very nice and the view from our balcony was lovely Hotel very modern with a free ferry to take you across the Thames to Canary Wharf though if you want to get back around midnight you need to double check the crossing times 
125665,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Step to the toilet , Very efficient staff Room excellent though very dangerous step to the bathroom Breakfast chaotic as not enough plates etc Beautiful views and great free ferry 
125666,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Food was burnt Had to wait an hour for someone to pick up the room service phone Housekeeping walked in on me twice Once when I got out of the shower Our bed was broken They gave us a room with a small double instead of a queen sized bed This hotel took nearly 400 out of my account for a 1 night stay which was only 135 and was extremely painful to get back Dreadful establishment ,No Positive
125667,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Couldn t sleep because of a fan that couldn t be switched off Moved to a new room Found some hairs in the bathroom No toothbrush or toothpaste Charging for Wifi in 2015 what the , Staff tried to make up for things 
125668,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast service seemed unprepared for number of guests wanting food at 10 15 and a longer than normal wait for a complete range of hot food , Free ferry across to Canary Wharf and river transport into central London 
125669,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The staff are not warm or friendly The stare when a god evening sir is expected I understand it s a British hotel and the rudeness is complimentary but it is an American chain I expect better manners, The style of the hotel and location
125670,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Our room didn t look over the river and for what we paid this was a disappointment but the bar seating area outside was open till late which made up for this , The staff in the Columbia bar were more then welcoming having a laugh with us and other visitors It was lovely to feel so comfortable The free ferry was also a huge bonus so that we could go over to Canary Wharf
125671,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, In the past if I ve booked a docklands hotel it s usually walking distance from Canary Wharf I booked this hotel in error this hotel should be titled Hilton Surrey quays not Hilton docklands as this was misleading Our taxi driver which cost us a fortune as the boat was on a break said a lot of people make the same mistake On arrival the reception had no record of our booking luckily I had my paperwork and email on me however they had no record of me bringing my children even though I remember I had to input their ages when I made the booking To be fair the hotel rectified this and put my husband kids and I in a very spacious 2 bedroom suite My parents however mum was celebrating her 60th birthday were put in a tiny room overlooking the carpark and was kept awake till 3am with crowds leaving the hotel and car doors slamming Lesson learnt Read the address of this hotel don t just look at the title and assume , Rooms very clean 
125672,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bit of a shambles getting seated and served for breakfast , Mentioned was anniversary And they made us lovely cakes and gave us a great view Lovely cookies and pleasant staff 
125673,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Called reception several times no answer Breakfast awful very disorganised dirty food areas no glasses had to find waitress to ask for tea or coffee lack of food Squeaky bed, Room was clean great boat service
125674,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Staff money was taken from our account by the hotel without our say so we didn t use room service or anything our bank is now dealing with this, Room and hotel was lovely
125675,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Creaky floorboards squeaky room doors corridor doors slam hot water takes 5 minutes to come through nowhere near a tube station no view the layout of the hotel is shocking even the staff haven t a clue which lift guests should take took me 15 minutes to get to my room with the help of three staff members Somehow my auto generated rating of this stay was 3 8 no way I d give it 1 for cleanliness , Clean and modern room
125676,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, I did book a room on boking com a day before but for some reason it never went though so had to rebooked was 50 00 more can t get the same room I wanted The breakfast is very cold the sausage was revoting I thought as a english sausage would be a good british one but no can t eat it at all , the new beds people in the bar area 
125677,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Upon check in we got a card for 60 minutes of free wi fi For any more we would have had to pay This seems ridiculous to me Everyone has free wi fi these days I m willing to pay a little more for nice things at a nice hotel but paying for wi fi in 2015 is just too much , Everything was very clean and looked very nice The staff were all friendly and professional Room service was a reasonable price for room service There was a wide selection of food for breakfast everything I had was delicious Our room was spacious and comfortable The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I ve slept in almost as nice as my own 
125678,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Nothing bad to say, Carolina on reception was really welcoming She arranged for us to change our room so we could have a river view and we ended up with a bigger room which was grear The warm cookies on arrival were a lovely touch Breakfast was vast and really tasty The C10 bus which goes from Canada Water directly to the hotel was really useful 
125679,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Check in very miserable staff same on check out with a 10 minute que room was good had everything we needed but we didn t sleep most of the night as the bed was awful very time you Moved you could feel and hear the springs in the bed The pillows wear lifeless This really ruined out stay at the Hilton As we were very tired the next day we came for a treat for our wedding anniversary and said we would have come back for a celebration we have later in the year but the uncomftable bed and no sleep as put us off , Location and free hopper to docklands
125680,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast was by far the worst that I ve experienced in some time Completely disorganized and chaotic Buffet dishes not stocked food not restocked no orientation directions given by staff My table was even given away to another guest after i initially sat Also on check in no attention had been paid to my advances requests, Brilliant location and exceedingly comfortable room
125681,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The heating on our room was extremely loud all night to the point I could not sleep I called reception but the phone was not working also so I had to go to reception in pjs which was quite a walk away I was told there was an issue with the heating and nothing could be done other than a refund of 25 of my room rate I had to call to chase this up and not even 20 of what I paid was refunded , Complimentary water taxi
125682,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Breakfast could be more organised Nearly finished cooked breakfast by the time tea had arrived though cooked breakfast was ate fast as only luke warm , Views of London great from the hotel reception and bar areas Cleanliness and lovely d cor in rooms and reception area and restaurant etc

125684,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Facilities were great good value for money Room had the perfect view Breakfast had so many choices Courtesy water taxi was a god send Hotel was clean and tidy
125685,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, We were initially concerned about the location on the south of the river but the frequency of the boat across to Canary Wharf made it fun to go out and about We also walked into the city along the Thames Path which was both pleasurable and tiring 
125686,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Need more parking spaces although we did manage to park outside the hotel on the road for free anyway , The staff were so friendly and polite One of the best hotels I ve ever stayed in by far 
125687,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There are no toothbrush toothpaste and slippers in the room Paid WiFi in the room Very noisy 1 flow room with river view , Breakfast was really good Good location Nice view from the window

125689,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, i cannot refund my last night of stay i had a change in plan but because it was prepaid through booking com i cannot refund it can booking com give me back a credit,No Positive
125690,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 All 4 pillows on bed very soft Perhaps consider providing 2x soft 2x firm pillows which might better suit majority of customers Or have the 4 soft pillows on the bed but leave a couple of firm ones in the top of the wardrobe to use as needed 2 Plates for cooked breakfast all stone cold plate warmer required , Polite friendly staff Excellent riverside location courtesy ferry across to Canary Wharf Clean well presented room well equipped Quiet location virtually no traffic noise so very relaxing
125691,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bathroom was so small that I was hitting the toilet seat with the door to get in Sink very small and ended up splashing water all over the floor Bed also felt like large single bed rather than double TV connection was poor with very poor picture quality Horrid and glary room lighting with very unpleasant colour for the LED reading light At breakfast we had to wait for ages to be given cold cappuccinos Would not stay again , Not much but I have to admit the room was clean 
125692,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, having to pay for wifi which we chose not to do Reception was far too busy rooms although lovely could do with a refresh no complimentary drinks or mini bar in the room , View from the room was beautiful rooms were nicely decorated nice brick work great location and good parking facility
125693,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, At check in we were given key cards They did not work as the receptionist had put an incorrect room no on card so we had to return to desk to query I found your quality of toilet paper poor for such a hotel of its standard It was the same quality that one meets in some public lavatories cheap non absorbent paper which is very thin and requires several layers to work efficiently , We have stayed before and the Hotel is very comfortable 
125694,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was a horribke horrible smell in the room it was horrible we were told when we arrived that we have to have an adapted for disabilities room we said we did not want that so we had to wait for half an hour for a normal room we then tried to phone reception about the smell and it just kept ringing no answer The bedsheets did not look clean drinking glasses were dirty it was freezing cold I was very disappointed as it was not cheap I would rate the hotel 2 and a half star ,No Positive
125695,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Large and sprawling you can walk a long way to get to the bar It is also a bit out of the way for mainstream London visiting Saying that the ferry gets you over to docklands quite quickly Hilton need to get with the times and provide free WiFi for all in the hotel , Once again the staff at Hilton were excellent When our taxi did not arrive the duty manager drove us to the event we were attending personally a nice touch This is a comfortable hotel with good facilities and we got a very good price on the room for London

125698,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Restaurant staff came across as a little unprofessional not particularly helpful when asked if we could order food manager berating staff while we were waiting to order and not a very professional attitude from some of the younger team members , Lovely hotel good location and value for money 
125699,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, no hot water in shower water was warm not suitable to take a bath or shower Bar staff are not helpful we waited 30 minutes for a drink and another 20 minutes to order food service in the outside eating area was very poor Television is in a awkward place on the wall to watch tv , nice modern decorated room Comfortable bed 
125700,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, At a few points during friday eve the bar was left with only one person to serve which resulted in a long wait to be served However the bar staff were more than apologetic , The breakfast was amazing The room spacious and comfortable Views were spectacular from the terrace and nice friendly vibe Ferry was very handy 
125701,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Only thing was I did not have a room with a city view but putting everything into perspective it was not an issue the hotel was great, The staff were amazing the views were great and location excellent the free use of the complimentary ferry was very convenient
125702,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The person at the front desk that instructed me to my room gave very discreet direction which led me to be lost for about 10mins, Lovely furniture design cleanliness was great view was beautiful
125703,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, There was a confusion with room service and our door number and our pizza and sandwhich s took over an hour to reach us so when it did it was cold We requested a taxi to be called from reception they said the earliest any taxi could get here was a 45 minute wait when we had somewhere to be We requested on the phone please could you call us if it arrives early we will come down 10 minutes before it s due We waited and no taxi came We then had to que for a further 10 minutes to speak with reception who did not take any responsibility and we explained that we needed to be somewhere and we were made to feel in the wrong A lovely taxi driver picked us up and explained there was not a 45 minute wait on taxi s Leaving us to miss part of our venue and feel very disappointed with the service , Lovely room and view very happy with location 
125704,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Everything was perfect and convenient nothing disliked at all I would definitely come back, The staff were absolutely lovely and so friendly Loved the fact we got free boat service to Canary that was excellent The bed was super comfy after a tiring day had an amazing sleep and the view was extremely beautiful
125705,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, The bed was very hard and we thought we was getting a river view when we complained a staff member left us waiting for half an hour and we gave up waiting, The hotel it s self is absolutely beautiful and very clean I really recommend the accommodation stunning views and beautifully presented
125706,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Even though the Canary Wharf area is beautiful I do NOT recommend this to anyone planning to visit the touristy areas because they are just way too far Also there is no free wifi , Great beds views area free river shuttle 
125707,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, Went as a birthday treat for my husband staff left a lovely cake and bottle of wine in our room Very helpful friendly staff especially the Spanish receptionist Lovely location 
125708,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location was further out to travel into centre of London than used to This made meeting up with friends a little long winded with buses tube All manageable but would need to think of somewhere closer in future Room was well presented the bed was not comfortable at all and didn t sleep well with air conditioning issues that were resolved by reception next day , Was a lovely hotel with views over river The free use of the river boat over to Canary Wharf was a great thing to have use of 
125709,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Aircon not adjustable unpleasant smell in room but not too bad that I could not stay in , Room comfortable tea making facilities iron and board good bed desk After a complaint about aircon and smell in room I was given a free breakfast quite unexpected breakfast was excelent 
125710,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, 1 It took a while to check in at reception as all the details was not received from Booking com apparently 2 One reception staff unhelpful when confirming that I asked for a special request She said that it was not on the system until she was asked to look again and then it was there 3 The window stills in the restaurant was dirty while eating at the window it was quite visible 4 Customer s children spilled food on the floor and it was not cleaned the whole time we were having breakfast Staff and guest just crossed over the mess 5 No swimming pool 6 Room very costly when I booked 7 It was my 10th wedding anniversary which I choose to celebrate at Double Tree and I was told that wine or fruit would be sent to the room but received nothing , 1 The fresh cookies given at the reception 2 My room was changed with no problems 3 The bed was super comfortable 4 The views and balcony was fab 5 Very spacious room in the Deluxe King size 6 The staff particularly in the restaurant were friendly and helpful particularly Francis she was such a happy and welcoming lady 
125711,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside,No Negative, We thought the hotel to be a really good place to stay We did have a little difficulty understanding couple of the staff but they were still good The bar and dining area we found to be really nice well designed and pleasant to sit and relax there are several lovely terraces to relax and or eat by the water The rooms were also good and clean
125712,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Yes I did had a slight bad experience I wasn t booked into what I chosen on line The room given was one or two down in it s standard Still awaiting a proposed gesture from Duty Manager as a compensation , The location and the view scenes within and around the hotel was exciting and excellent 
125713,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Free wifi was only for one hour and this was a continuous hour rather than being able to access wifi for a few minutes at a time, Lovely hotel great view helpful and happy staff Very comfy bed 
125714,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bad points are staff only seemed to be member of staff on front desk meaning I had to queue to sign in Came down in morning and asked guy on reception when next ferry was free service he took a while to find out surely he should know then when I got off other side I got stopped and asked for a ticket The guy should have told me I needed a ticket when I asked him the times I obviously wouldn t have thought I needed a ticket as it s a free service and literally goes from the hotel to other side of river it s not as though you could have jumped on half way The woman insisted I proved to her I stayed at the hotel it s the only place I could have come from she wouldn t call them for me to check either Also apparently the maid barged in on my boyfriend even though he had shouted to say he was in there and not to come in , Lovely setting nicely decorated quiet and clean 
125715,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Sunday night water taxi finished too early meaning we missed it and had to go back to canary wharf tube and go through catching tube and bus back to hotel Should be highlighted that sunday night is not as late as normal weekdays Our fault for not checking but all the same would be helpful if there was a special notice , Position overlooking the thames Free motor taxi to canary wharf General surroundings
125716,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Bathroom was very small The room had a sort of maritime feel to it being next to the river which was not really to my taste The television was in an odd location in the room Location of this hotel was remote for London Good for Canary Wharf but thats about it , Nice interiors Right next to the river with nice views from the room and restaurant Nice breakfast really good food Reasonably priced for London actually This is a good hotel 
125717,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Hard to find from main road not signposted Surly uncooperative staff Unable to lock room securely one small bolt to outer door Noisy air conditioning system , Location close to Canary Wharf and free ferry across the river 
125718,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, In spite of the mass sporting event on the weekend and unlike the Novotel Cardiff The Hilton made no provision for an early breakfast for the large proportion of guests attending the event At the last minute water and bananas were laid on Considering I d paid a rate including breakfast I was aggrieved that the only way to get it would have been to pay 20 for a room service option , The Hotel was in good condition with helpful staff Room was a good size with lovely aspect and well designed As the hotel has been refitted into an existing Victorian warehouse the layout is rather chaotic with tight very narrow corridors and small lifts The lifts were only accessible by first using a flight of stairs Just to be clear though overall a satisfactory if pricey stay 
125719,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, We didn t like the bed It was not as comfortable as the double tree by hilton s bed near wembley which was what we were really looking forward to ,No Positive
125720,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, we liked everything at this hotel , we like the food here and we like going over to canary wharf to do shopping and then coming back on the boat over to the hotel 
125721,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Location Was out of the way of getting to the other side of the river once the boats had stopped at night Almost 100 in a taxi Also disappointing how hot the rooms were and the air con was limited to a certain coolness , Rooms were nice and clean and the staff were lovely Loved the free cookies 
125722,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Water bottles in our room were not replaced after the first night Had dinner on the rooftop terrace on Friday night We were escorted to our seat by a lovely friendly waiter however service after this was appalling We were asked by our waitress to provide a credit card as our room didn t have credit She then took my credit card away with her to keep until we had finished I didn t feel comfortable with this so I asked for it back from another member of staff after a long wait to find someone After our meal well about 20 mins after we had finished the waitress came over to the table to collect our plates lifted them up and set them back down on the edge of the table while she went to another two tables to serve other people without excusing herself each time cutting it short and ignore diners to move to the next table She then cleared an empty table and disappeared for about 15 minutes before returning to our table to remove the dirty plates We had to ask her for the dessert menu and the bill and ended up going to the bar to pay as she took so long getting back to us She seemed flustered and appeared to be the only one serving the whole terrace which shouldn t be the case on a Friday night Our bill was wrong as we had been charged higher prices for our food and drink than were stated on the menu This was resolved but took a while to sort This whole fiasco ruined our evening and took away from the outstanding food we received , The room was lovely clean and very comfortable with great views from the balcony Reception staff were friendly and welcoming Food in the restaurant was delicious Great ferry service to Canary Wharf 
125723,DoubleTree by Hilton London Docklands Riverside, Parking should be free for guests, Loved the balcony room with river view also the hotel has its own river boat to transport you to other side very handy breakfast was a good variety overall enjoyed it
