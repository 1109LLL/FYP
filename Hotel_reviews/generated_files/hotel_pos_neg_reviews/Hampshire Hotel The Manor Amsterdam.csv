371164,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam,No Negative, Comfy bed and menu food and service in the restaurant was excellent staff were polite helpful and courteous the bar next door The Kuiper was excellent also and very handy for a 3am finish Would definitely recommend and stay again although a little bit pricey not best located although tram line is on your doorstep and taxi was E60 each way from airport 
371165,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, I personally thought that although the room was classed as superior double it was not in my opinion There was only a shower i sometimes think that they keep smaller basic rooms for the likes of booking com etc, small single beds not queen size cosy though
371166,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Nothing, Spacious Very welcoming with plenty of reception staff available Italian restaurant in the hotel very reasonable Gave us a free upgrade even though only stsying one night 
371167,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, the bed twins put together very soft not so good for people with back problems, great staff great room they gave me an upgrade with nice view on a park 
371168,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Apart from the cleaning crew leaving my door open for literally 12 hours but nothing got stolen it is difficult to find anything not to like about this hotel Try to avoid ground floor rooms Too much traffic for safety when your door stays open and not enough light , The hotel staff was very very helpful kind and polite even cracking jokes as they were investigating who had left my room door open for the whole day the cleaners while I had been in meetings Altogether very friendly and competent The rooms designs are very friendly and modern with very nice bathrooms 
371169,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Staff were so so day staff helpful night staff pretty appalling hairdryer in room hopeless bring your own cheap looking decor , Decent facilities for a mid price hotel good transport links quiet comfy bed and good shower 
371170,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Plumbing issues in first room which were resolved by changing rooms , Tram outside to take you into centre Concierge very friendly and helpful Bar staff accommodating 
371171,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The people at the front office should review their way of communicating Apart from the tall guy meno and the chinese guy at the reception with a huge smile the rest is just of pure joke and I m saying that on the fact that I travelled a lot and work in the hotel industry before as a manager , Excellent Rooms the front office need to be reviewed Meno the chinese guy will take care of you the rest need to get extra training to work in the hotel industry House keeping is on fleek Bike rent is a good option Tram very easy to hop in Overall nice 
371172,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved this hotel The location was perfect It was outside of the city center in a nice safe and lively area It had a yoga studio Yoga4all right across the street I could take yoga classes at multiple bus lines are 5 10 min walk away main train station to travel inside and outside the city is 10 min walk away many restaurants shops cafes bars ect all 5 20 min walk away wonderful park across the street and safe happening area The staff were very friendly and helpful the generously upgraded me for free because I love rooms with a balcony The room itself was very modern wonderful view clean and spacious I have no complaints at all and have recommended the hotel to multiple friends visiting Amsterdam When I return I will be staying here again 
371173,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Breakfast is on the expensive side , Good option on the outskirts of Amsterdam Is a little ways away but a quick taxi will get you to the city center Front desk was helpful getting a taxi within seconds 
371174,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Hair dryer did not work Little Lights by bed did not work when paying final bill they didn t discount even a coffee as a gesture That s all it would have taken, The balcony was lovely The room was pretty
371175,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Small problem with restaurant first evening they were busy and said we could not have table service outside service was good but warm Second evening we sat inside again and everybody else sat outside we realised too late and our service was terribly slow Food is good and reasonable price Second day we came back after having been out for 8 hot hours and room had not been cleaned Sat down for 5 minutes then a knock at the door and it was suggested we left the room while they cleaned it as they had had 8 hours we said no get on with it and work round us they did We mentioned both these things at checkout and they made a couple of decent deductions and very apologetic We did not find a lounge bar snack service area maybe we missed it , We did not want a city centre hotel as they are small and no private parking this hotel is on the outer fringe of the city centre very well placed for walking and transport AND you can park in front of the hotel at a fairly normal charge for city parking Staff are v helpful with advice in house cycle hire attraction tickets tram tickets routes etc CARE there are cyclists everywhere and they have priority there are also pot smokers everywhere and some cyclist smoke pot while they are cycling and answering their phone at the same time so YOU have to keep your eyes open Breakfast is excellent standard E15 or plus E5 00 which includes cooked to order eggs Benedict etc with good service We had a Junior Suite with small balcony on the back overlooking a v small quiet park room very quiet even with all the windows open 2 minute walk to tram stops and Oosterpark a nice green park use the trams they are easy with good route message screens cost 7 50 a day and save miles of walking we came back one evening on a tricycle taxi very refreshing on a warm night Decor is Art and corridors a bit vivid and rooms quirky but not unpleasantly so Nice hotel for our 3 nights
371176,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, There is no A C It was a little warm while we were there so we had to keep the window open Well cracked actually because the window wouldn t open very far The layout of the bathroom is a bit odd as well , Easy to get on the Tram as it stops in front of the hotel Makes getting in and out of the downtown area very easy 
371177,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The bed was really comfy my only complaint was that the pillows were too plump Also breakfast was quite steep at 15 Euros each but we found a lovely bakery just a few doors away which served lovely waffles croissants and breakfasts , The hotel is located outside of the main city but just a short tram ride away It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of central Amsterdam and enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere around the Oosterpark The hotel was excellent very clean the staff were friendly and the room and facilities were fantastic We ate in the restaurant one night which was nice but a bit pricey 
371178,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Compared to my previous two stays at the hotel the staff service was poor When we arrived we explained we had two rooms booked as my girlfriends sister was accompaning us to which the front of house lady was quite adament that we hadnt even though we had double checked confirmation a few days prior and had already paid in full for the room The lady then found the room and offered no apology as to how stern and adament she was at first Dinner service was slow and not very good We waited about 30 minutes for our starter and then 40 minutes for our main both were ok but nothing worth waiting for Breakfast has changed from self service to wait and order by the waitress which both mornings i had to go up to them to order as i was tired of waitiing for them to take my order even though they wasnt very busy I have stayed here three times in total and thats why i returned this time but i will be looking for another hotel the next time as the service wasnt good enough this time around , Cleanliness was very good beautiful building nice area
371179,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, We got the deluxe room that costs approx 200 euros per night The facilities were a disappointment the mini bar was empty had only a complimentary small bottle of water for 2 persons and for 5 nights In the bathroom there was no soap bar no shampoo body lotion etc Sound isolation is poor, Location of the hotel interior design
371180,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Parking lot had a high extra cost 25 euros per day , Excellent Staff Rooms are clean and nice The location is perfect Tram stop is infront of the Hotel so you can be at the train station downtown in 5 minutes The rooms are quite small but great if you stay with your couple Overall perfect Hotel 
371181,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The restaurant Enoteca at hotel despite not really being full seems like staff has trouble coping with the limited number of guests present and I think service at the restaurants needs a big step up , Bed was comfortable Room slightly small for two people but manageable Staff generally helpful and friendly 
371182,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Maybe one would expect milder design and colours in a hotel but it was still cool, Clean and big rooms helping staff very good breakfast Very convenient ride to to city center with the tram
371183,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The room decor is a bit off putting red orange black But that would be our only negative comment , The breakfast buffet was excellent at the attached restaurant and we were given a good rate for breakfast Staff was terrific I had fallen on the sidewalk and everyone was gracious about helping me be comfortable Also very helpful staff in telling us how to get around and where to go 
371184,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, This hotel is on the eastern side of the city so isn t really in walking distance from the main sites of that tend to be central and on the westside It s biking distance or tram distance for sure But hey renting bikes and public transport are great ways to get around in Amsterdam , The hotel was quite posh the decor was urban and cool and the breakfast was great The front desk staff were all so helpful and nice Since I was unfamiliar with Amsterdam before my trip I chose this hotel mostly due to ratings photos and price It is on the eastern side of the city but there are a couple of trams that stop very close to the hotel so getting to other areas of the city aren t an issue 
371185,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel for the price Lots of cool cafes and bars near the hotel Any easy train ride into the city Stop is right in front of the hotel Distance about 1 5 2 miles
371186,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Not keen on restaurant evening meal Disappointing choice Some staff were very serious looking we do like service with a smile , Bed very comfortable Room facilities good though would have liked English breakfast tea and milk in the rooms rather than just powder milk for coffee Net curtains would have given privacy without having to close the curtains and put the lights on Buffet breakfast good Would definitely stay again 
371187,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, There was no one available to help with our luggage We were told to ask concierge for assitance but we found him aloof unfriendly Did he think this group of 18 Asians would not tip him Actually only a few needed the help but he was unconcerned Truly the first time I ve seen such an uncaring staff member or maybe both evening and morning concierges had similar nonchalant attitudes The 2 BIG negatives with your otherwise nice hotel One other thing though one house keeper had washed the drinking glasses in the room but was seen using the used washcloth to wipe it dry eeuuyyy , The ladies at the reception desk and the housekeepers were very nice efficient and friendly Sorry I can t say the same for the concierge 
371188,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, There is no iron or board in the room but if you ask they will bring one It is a little way out of the centre 15 mins on tram although the tram stops nearly outside and is only E3 so not a big issue , Everything was great friendly staff good sized clean room
371189,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, One floor up above the terrace and people outside talking loudly until 2 30 am Then at 4 a member of staff outside on their phone Reading lights kept going on and off even after they had been fixed Not a 4 star No toileteries Felt it was a bit like a premier inn but cost more , Nice clean room good size and a comfortable bed 
371190,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Air conditioner was ineffective during this very hot period Washbasin was cracked , Very friendly great service Easy access to transport Room over the main reception with balcony was perfect Information for tourists very good 
371191,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Most staff were helpful but personally encountered a waitress in the breakfast room who was quite unattentive which made it difficult to order my omelette , Comfortable bed nice room size Great location for bike rental 1 2mins walk if hotel has no bikes available Fun safe easy route to the centre Situated very close to a friendly coffeeshop good for ending a long day out in the sun 
371192,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, there was no different kind of pillow in the hotel All pillows are very soft However I can not sleep with very soft pillows , The Hotel is very close to public transportation which is good You can easily reach which destination you want to go It was very clean which is very important for me Breakfast was good but I think it can be a litle bit better than now All staffs are very helpful and kind So I strongly prefer this hotel to stay in Amsterdam 
371193,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, A very small detail the master switch has no delay so when you remove you card it s instantly dark, Excellent continental buffet breakfast You can even order pancakes or omelets Everything is very fresh Nice room with two televisions no noise from outside nice big bathtub 
371194,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, way too expensive for what you get common problem for Amsterdam Check in at 3pm check out before 12am so you pay a lot for less than 24h , easy to get around the city location is good clean and good size rooms

371197,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, There was nothing to dislike, The staff were excellent and the hotel was easily accessible Trams stopped outside the hotel A very short ride you were into the centre of Amsterdam Excellent choice for people not wishing to stay in the centre The rooms were quiet although hotel is located on a main road
371198,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Not the cheapest hotel but they charged for water They ran out of bicycles by 11 30am , Good relaxed hotel fair room size Beautiful view to courtyard from our room Nice bicycle ride to center

371202,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The food in the restaurant was good but a bit pricey for what it was and there could have been more selection , This hotel was lovely and clean with very friendly staff It was only a short tram ride into the centre or about half hour walk Amsterdam is such a lovely city and I will definitely be visiting again

371208,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Nothing , I was a great loacation It was close enough to the center of the city but also far enough away to experience the quieter side of Amsterdam 
371209,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Unfortunately the toilet flush ran constantly when we arrived after informing the service staff someone came upstairs immediately but had no clue what to do so I had to repair the toilet flush myself There was no chance to get another room since the hotel was fully booked that Sunday night The bathroom was always perfectly clean the room itself should have been cleaner though On the first day the teaspoons from our tea making facilities were replaced by dirty ones on the second day we didn t get any at all It was very easy to get some from downstairs though The large tray from our and at least five other room service breakfasts was taken outside into the hall by the room service but sat there until 7 p m , extremely friendly and competent concierges very warm welcome bike rental at hotel quiet and spacious room fridge tea making facilities friendly room service clean bathroom shower

371213,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, No air conditioning Had to sleep with the windows open each night to keep the room cool We had a room right above the street very noisy there There is a delicatessen across the street that is open until 2am each night there is a lot of activity going on outside that deli and it gets very loud between that people ambulances mopeds etc street side If you want less noise get a garden view room , Location is not close to the center of Amsterdam but is just a 10 minute ride on the tram Hotel has a charm to it Breakfast was good not a huge selection though You can get a better breakfast outside the hotel for much less than 12 50 15 Euros the hotel charges 
371214,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Rooms not cleaned properly Tea making facilities very poor and not topped up no milk No dressing room tho stated in the hotel description and room not carpeted Was told by staff that carpeted rooms on higher floors were very dark Certainly not Deluxe apparently deluxe means only that you don t overlook the road Only 2 hangers provided in wardrobe was given more on request , Beds were comfy Good size bath Easy transport links Could leave luggage Modern

371219,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, If I was to fault anything and this is a minor personal thing was that the room was too hot , The hotel staff were extremely friendly It was our wedding anniversary and they put a bottle of bubbly in the room along with a note wishing us well The room was perfect Also when you come out of the hotel take a left under the bridge and there is a little shopping area which we found by chance on the last day Trams are very easy to use hop on hop off Wonderful city and would go back to the Hampshire again 
371220,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, 1 Distance to the city centre if you re a night owl the last tram is at midnight so it might take an uber cab to get back home should not be more than 8 euro though , 1 Great customer service we were upgraded to a Junior Suite following a complaint about the bed size bathroom issue The staff was very accommodating and understanding and the issue was handled instantaneously Great customer care 2 Neighborhood we liked the authentic Amsterdam feel to the surrounding area Close to the Oosterpark nice patch of restaurants next to the hotel and a great vibe throughout We will definitely be coming back

371223,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The ventilation and lighting to the room was very poor The main and only window to the room offered poor natural lighting with the lights being required to be switched on at all times , The bed was one the nicest beds I have slept on outside of my own

371227,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The tall man followed me asking can I help you Because he thought I shouldn t be staying there I didn t like that it made me feel unwelcome but he had been very helpful up until that point so maybe it was just because I wasn t with my group of friends, This is the second time I ve stayed at the Hampshire and this time I brought all my friends I love it its so convenient to get to all the main parts of Amsterdam I ll definatley stay again and again 
371228,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The pillows could be bigger like normal rectangular pillows It was difficult to get sleep with the square pillows That s probably just me , The hotel is inca quiet neighborhood but has all the necessary places around it in close proximity Good food places weed coffeehouse massage places train and tram station even a zoo

371290,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The carpets and wall paper in the corridors of the floors should be changed as a matter of urgency The picture of the outdoors of the hotel is deceiving it gives you a feeling that the hotel is a standalone building this isn t the case The International standards of a 4 star hotel are slightly higher, Clean comfortable rooms slightly small

371299,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The room has two single bed rather than a king or double bed Sound proof wasn t great , Close to a tram stop beautiful hotel I was given a room facing the back of the hotel which is more quiet and I like the room with floorboard 
371300,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, As a couple having 2 single beds pushed together instead of one large bed was a little uncomfortable Also was surprised at the lack of features in the room and bathroom considering the hotel is 4 shower caps cotton buds slippers robes for example , The location of the hotel was great Overall a comfortable stay housekeeping did a good job keeping the room tidy and clean 
371301,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Twice they forgot to make our room The other days they just did the beds and arranged the towels Not actual cleaning , The location was good The staff very good

371307,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, I think I got charged twice for the city tax and the room service wasn t that good for the money that it cost , It was the only place in the two weeks of my trip that had a tv which was wonderful The beds were very comfy Being right next to a tram was wonderful My traveling companion was arriving late and the staff was very helpful in ensuring he could get access to the room

371313,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Only negative was some noise from street outside , The staff were lovely welcoming and helpful We had a double room on the 2nd floor which was smart and comfortable Our room overlooked the main road so there was a little noise on 2 nights but there was no noise from inside the hotel We would definitely stay at the hotel again 
371314,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The worst item of this otherwise nice hotel The water pressure was absolutely miserable The staff explained that this was due to Holland being flat but surely water towers exist in Holland too or failing that standard 1970s plumbing technology allows for the installation of a pressure pump As the hotel purports to be of a high standard it would not hurt to add this little trick to an otherwise excellent experience Other remarks No aircondition Our rate did not include breakfast The hairdryer was as is often the case of the weak sort The very nice and beatiful modern shower had no curtain or rim on the floor leading to a regular inundation of the whole bathroom floor Several coffee shops i e Marijuana smoker places are near to the hotel adding a slightly seedy tone to the otherwise nice area , The Hotel is nicely located on the south eastern edge of the city center in a nice neighborhood This is not the right place if you want to be in the absolute city center but it is highly accessible being located at the intersection of major avenues with multiple tram and bus lines stopping in front The hotel has a dated outside but the interior is nicely renovated in a modern style We especially liked a fun gag at the reception There was a toy robot which could dance sing and communicate with guests It made for a nice start of the day The staff was nice and helpful We got the room at a last minute discount rate normal rates seem overblown for what you get 
371315,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, We booked a superior triple room with a city view Arrived to find all triple rooms on the ground floor Misleading information which meant the price comparison for the room was skewed Also had a problem checking out Would not accept my Halifax Clarity card despite me using it at 10pm the previous night at Caf De Jaren and 30 minutes after leaving the hotel at Centraal Station Incurred a currency charge as a result , Nice part of Amsterdam near the zoo and botanical gardens Very good breakfast and pleasant restaurant staff 
371316,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, I missed having bathrobes and slippers I m not a fan of all in one washing liquids Multi stage lighting is a must , Although the hotel isn t in the city center connections to city center are excellent The tram stop is couple of meters from hotel entrance so you re never really far from central attractions I imagine this would be very useful for getting around the city if you re not cycling or driving neither of which are recommended for first time visitors or those who don t know their way around Amsterdam Oosterpark not to be confused with the famous Vondelpark is a 2 minute walk there are many general stores nearby to fulfill your living needs and if you re feeling peckish at 2 in the morning 24 7 room service has you covered On premise private parking was available at a reasonable for Amsterdam 27 per day The hotel has an aesthetically pleasing fa ade which some might even find grand Our high ceilinged room was spacious by European standards All my encounters with the staff were positive It is a safe neighborhood and there are some nice coffeeshops within walking distance if you want to unwind at the end of the day 
371317,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Breakfast was very disappointing and expensive The staff moody and lazy in there Greasy thin bacon cold boiled eggs awful stiff scrambled eggs average bread for toasting and no tea pots I had breakfast out of the hotel after my experience There are some great places to eat nearby , Cool funky decor in 4 star comfort The staff were very accommodating letting me choose out of 3 rooms I even got upgraded as I expected a Bath aswell as a shower

371332,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, wifi was terrible tried to charge you for it we were treated like a group of school kids i couldnt change my money into euros as we landed late explained this to the manager and said i would pay when it was changed they took my passport as a precaution the next day we were called three times while we were sleeping for payment once at 9am then 11am then again at lunch think if we were a family or older couple we would have been treated better charged a deposit which again wasnt mentioned on the booking nice hotel if you are an older couple but if you are young prepare to be patronised and treated like a child, tram line right outside the hotel easy connection to get back to dam square or red light 
371333,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Breakfast was expensive for what it was Glass panels in bathroom were a little off putting You should only stay here if you know someone very well , Amazing staff we were shown all 3 room options personally Friendly and helpful Corridor decor very interesting Lovely to have a balcony Lots of information in foyer Tram stop outside hotel BBC on the TV so kept up with the news at home 
371334,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Bathroom door doesn t really close off the toilet and shower so there s not so much privacy Road right outside with trams so it can be a bit noisy, Check in quick and simple Large and spacious rooms friendly and helpful staff Located a bit outside of Amsterdam Oost but there are three different tram lines that will take you anywhere in no time walking into the city centre is also really nice Would I go again It s a really nice hotel But for my next visit to Amsterdam I would probably choose a hotel located next to a canal in the city centre for the real Amsterdam feeling I saw they have other Hampshire hotels in Amsterdam located more centrally so I would probably consider those
371335,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The floors seem to be wood and we stayed on the 2nd floor so we could constantly hear ppl above us as they walked around the room If you re a light sleeper this may be an issue for you especially if the ones on the floor above are early risers , Staff was excellent friendly and very helpful went an extra mile to check us in early when our flights changed Location is awesome too

371347,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, We were on the ground floor so the traffic noises were a little loud at night Also in the bathroom we weren t supplied with complimentary shower gels or shampoos but instead there were installed dispensers which felt a little cheap , The concierge and staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and couldn t have been more helpful We were invited for a free drink in the bar by the restaurant manager who was also delightful Room was comfortable and spacious with beautiful high ceilings 
371348,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, There wasn t a thing that I could possibly fault, Great location for any coffeeshop lovers Coffeeshop right next door shop right across the road Oosterpark around the corner and it s only a lovely 30 minute walk into the city center We never took the trams The staff where so friendly and helpful Never slept in such a comfortable bed in my life It was our 1st in the Dam and we will definitely be back and will be staying at The Manor again 
371349,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, A little expensive for what you got , Staff was great and facilities were just what you need no frills Coffee maker was great in the morning Hotel is right by a tram stop for easy access to most of the city and the front desk sells tram passes 
371350,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, ordering food into the room was rather expensive, The staff were really nice and friendly there was a problem with transacting the money to pay for the hotel but they ve managed to help and sort out the problem The hotel has also given me and my partner a better suite than what we paid for due to them running out of double beds It was a lovely stay really nice location next to a beautiful Park easy to get to the city centre but yet still quiet and clean area The beds were comfortable and the decor of the place was fab Would recommend to anyone considering 
371351,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, 12 15 euros each way for taxis to central Dam also the bathroom separation to the room is glass screen that allows no real privacy , hotel is modern spacious and good environment for couples and families breakfast is good with fairly good choice rooms comfortable 
371352,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, As we went there with a baby and we mostly do take out for our dinner we see that may be is not polite if a cleaning service gives us more plastic bag for the trash If it additional 1 or 2 it is Ok but a bag full of it , The location is near by public transportation you can go to city centre and also Amsterdam Arena easily
371353,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, Messy breakfast arrangements quite ok breakfast options could have been better though , Easy access to tram station 100m safe looking area clean and stylish hotel and rooms Staff were friendly the curtains blocked all light in the morning if needed A and there was no extra noise The hotel were already prepared to store our luggage after we checked out which was also nice

371372,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, I had to pay a cautionary sum of 50 for the bar drinks but there were no bar drinks present in the room The shower wasn t so clean in some parts mold was present Price for a long term rental , The position Is easy to reach by train or tram 
371373,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, The restaurant staff was quite rude some of the dishes on the meny was sold out 7 pm They do not refill the breakfast the last hour be early , Use the tram for easy transport to the city or hire a bike 30 min walk to city centre 
371374,Hampshire Hotel The Manor Amsterdam, All good, We had a fantastic stay here in the Hampshire Hotel from the pleasant staff comfort location next to the tram line corner room with two windows and a very friendly Concierge who went out of his way to help us enjoy our time in Amsterdam he designed us our own special walking tour of the city from places to eat and museums to visit Thank you so much Sir Cheers Aiden Ps loved the sweets at the counter
