59752,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, The bathroom was small but shower was amazing great pressure However the leg space for the commode was too small narrow we stayed in 502 almost for a child it wasnot comfortable Would be nice to have a complimentary bottle of water per guest on day1 but that is a small thing Decent selections for breakfast but per person cost of 16 too steep Better to have outside many options available around 10 Hotel should consider this and also give varied breakfast packages instead of a flat rate for all choices , Staff were amazing and helpful with great sugestions always We moved from patio facing room to street facing room with balcony upon request at no extra cost Also staff helped with early checkin which was great for resting and very prompt check out and taxi bookings Free coffee machine available all times in the reception 
59753,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia,No Negative, Reception staff very friendly They are speaking a lot of languages when we came we spoke some Polish Russian English with reception workers Room very beautiful gorgeously decorated with amazing light s in the ceeling under the bed Bed very big and comfortable very big choice of the pillows we had 3 different types of pillows per person in the room A lot of usefull things free of charge soap shampoo bath salt some cosmetics Bathroom very clean and nice Unfortunately we have stayed only for one night When it comes to the breakfasts in this beautiful hotel they are very different then usuall breakfasts in hotels Very homely atmosphere and big choise of food comfortable seats and a lot of drinks I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to visit Paris with girlfriend or wife Best regards Tim Ira
59754,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, In the evening when we returned to our room tiered from a full day of discovering Paris we asked from the young man that was working at the reception at that time for a recommendation of a restaurant He was initially hesitant to give any suggestion just saying that there are plenty of restaurants around and after we insisted a bit more he suggested that since we would like to have some typical french steak and fries kind of dish we should to hippopotamus At the time we didn t know the place but googling it and then walking outside we realized that he sent us to fast food chain restaurant Of course the hotel stuff is not required to be able to give suggestions to guest about dinner options but this is something that I in general greatly appreciate and at this hotel I was disappointed , It was a very nicely decorated hotel both the lobby and the rooms The room was on the small side although I reserved their more spacious room but I think for Paris standards it was good the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the breakfast was great The stuff was overall friendly and helpful but see also bellow in the negatives sections about some small complains we had 
59755,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, We realized in the middle of the night that the thermostat did not seem to turn on cool the room so we opened the window This cooled the space off but then you have the street noise , Super comfy bed Super clean Small but very well appointed space unique and creative Loved it Everything in the room was uniquely designed but with a useful purpose The staff is friendly and welcoming The lobby is small and cozy a great place to sit and have a cup of coffee or wine There is also a small outside patio We loved the place and the location

59757,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, Very slow but free Wi Fi Flooded room after a quick shower drainage needs some renovations Staff speaks just some basic English , The bed and pillow were made from Tempur like foam which is very pleasant to sleep on Great location close to many interesting restaurants

59767,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, They helped us book a taxi in advance when we were going back to the airport first they called me 5 40 in the morning telling us that the taxi had arrived when we booked for 6pm Then in the evening they had booked us a black cab that took wrong turns every now and then and the ride took twice the time they said because of that, The staff was really helpful and the beds the most comfortable I ve ever slept in at a hotel

59781,Legend Saint Germain by Elegancia, I was taking medication and had to rest a lot and my husband could not move easily around the room after placing our luggage in the room After one night we were able to move to a slightly larger room which helped but we were still cramped and had to move to another hotel after that The hotel manager would not allow us to move out after 1 night as I wanted to without having to pay for that night but the hotel staff really tried to help by providing a larger room the second night even just by a few feet I would not stay here again but if space is not a concern it is a nice room in a good area , Good location close to restaurants and Gare de Montparnasse Staff was very understanding and accomodating I felt that they really tried to help me
