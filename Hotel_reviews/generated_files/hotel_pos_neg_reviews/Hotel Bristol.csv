473742,Hotel Bristol, The staff could look happier and nicer Breakfast the ham was in plastic boxes This is Italy I was expecting some fresh ham And when I asked for a second cuf of coffe the waiter seemed annoyed , Very good location a 5 minute from the central station The staff was nice enough 
473743,Hotel Bristol, nothing to dislike all good, All in all a very pleasant stay at this Hotel will definatly book again if the prices remain reasonable The hotel is efficient and clean It was good value on this particular trip Have stayed in many other 4 hotels in the area Bristol hotel is good value 
473744,Hotel Bristol, Spend some time to figure out how shower is properly working , Great location near Milano Centrale very easy to find just turn on the left side of train station and you can see big sign Very nice personal that actually help you to get to your room small but very authentic and with tissue covered walls Breakfast is standart for Italy some fruits yogurts boiled eggs different croissants no meat through

473746,Hotel Bristol, Too many things were bad First the toilet was the filthiest I have seen in over 25 years of travel hair hair hair everywhere Water temperature in bath fluctuated Most complicated safe Old facilities room furnishings toilet etc No a c and it was hot Staff first time was playing on his mobile and couldn t be bothered to look up at me Second encounter was ok seemed like they would rather work elsewhere Not friendly This is a 3 at best and not a very good one I stayed 4 nights starhotels anderson 150 and moved to Bristol which is next door for 140 Big mistake Then moved to glam hotel next door for 125 and that was very very good I would only stay at Bristol if the rate is atleast 40 below these 2 hotels , Croissants were nice Sitting area in bf area was spacious The bf itself was very basic Location was ideal very close to milano centrale 
473747,Hotel Bristol, Maybe because I booked over Bookings com I felt being put away in the servant room Old fashioned water and toilet pipes noise from the rooms above located directly next to the bed s end will wake you up all during the night Mattress extreme hard room not good isolated from street noise Glass ready to drink some water was extremely dirty looked like wiped off with a cleaning cloth they used to clean the rest I forgot the rest and enjoyed a wonderful night at another hotel in Milan it s possible , near the train station as many other hotels
473748,Hotel Bristol, Old fashioned hotel of th 80s with little done afterwards simple breakfast, Just in front of the Central Station excellent price for the level of the hotel good service
473749,Hotel Bristol, heavy keys haha mineral water offered by the hotel for free has a metal cap but the room doesn t have a bottle opener, location is perfect just a few minutes away from the central station warm welcome clean room lots of stuff for bathroom shampoos etc tv channels in different languages good breakfast

473752,Hotel Bristol, Traffic noise a problem and room on the hot side so in summer would be a real problem Walls are thin so constant noise of running water toilet flushing etc No tea coffee available in room Safe in room but no instructions how to use it No information in room on check out times or meal times , Good location for transport links but poor for restaurants and bars Staff at reception were helpful

473755,Hotel Bristol, Bathroom was big but shower design was unpractical as the water would splash and leak everywhere If you leave towels on the towel rack they will get wet after shower as well The service was fairly old school with bell boy open the door for you take your luggage to your room as well as show you around in the room Of course in return be prepared to tip It got us by surprise and we could only tip in lose coins , Very close to the train station Breakfast was fine Room was in a long narrow shape with a separate lounge area Staff was friendly enough and helpful however don t expect too much on warming smile
