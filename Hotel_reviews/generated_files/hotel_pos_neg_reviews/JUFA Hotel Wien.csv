379254,JUFA Hotel Wien, The first feeling which I got from receiption are really bad Hotel room is not reserved properly it looks like the receiption don t receive right document from Booking The price is higher than offer on Booking The garage is under internal reengineering but through broadcast the staff said it s too late to park in on 21 25pm The car should park on the street again no right place on the street , The dinner is good in the lobby the taste and size are really enough

379258,JUFA Hotel Wien, Not easy to park around breakfast not included, Room was new and with a lot of space Loved the architecture of building Subway station next to the hostel
379259,JUFA Hotel Wien, dirty room it seems they forgot to clean our room and lots of hair we found at bed bath rooms and they informed on booking com they have free parking but it s a big lie free parking means to park at street if you can find and their parking is costly if you wanna use ,No Positive

379266,JUFA Hotel Wien, If I am very picky I would say that it would be wise to relocate the smoking area away from the path between the main entrance and the U bahn station Better and more international television film options would be welcome A lockable baggage storage room would not be unwelcome The front desk could be a bit more efficient and quick , This place is very well arranged for families with children There are activities of all sorts and a range of food and drink options both on site and nearby Public transport is very accesssible from this place as well 
379267,JUFA Hotel Wien, Nothing , The hotel was very nice looking upon arrival and the staff was very friendly It was a little hard to find with construction going on around but didn t affect our experience The room was big and a crib was provided for our little one Bed comfortable and within 5 10 minutes walking distance to public transportation Very clean would stay again Didn t get to try the breakfast You can park for free on the street or pay 12 for 24 hours in their parking garage

379270,JUFA Hotel Wien, Some hotels in Vienna in the similar price range have in the lobby a PC available for guests who would like to read their arrived e mail messages This is a possibility for this hotel to upgrade their service for guests Otherwise it is a nice hotel with good service , Great breakfast But it would be even greater if available non aromatised green tea Pitty current green tea is aromatised probably with artificial lemon aroma which masks nice green tea taste Hope next time I will find real green tea

379275,JUFA Hotel Wien, The only bad thing was a la carte restaurant The food was awful we order a plate of salmon but the bread was burned Pizza looked like it was from the supermarket frozen and then heated up We asked waiter about the wine and the answer we get i was pretty sure you dont know nothing about wines in the cart Yeah thats is true that s why we asked for your help , Thank you very much for amazing welcoming to receptionist miss Chrisdina she was really nice helping and pretty much give all details we need Also thank you for upgrade We will definitely come back only because of you 
379276,JUFA Hotel Wien, The TV set is quite small , Easy access to the highway public transportation about 15 minutes on the metro to the city centre and shopping Convenient facilities for organising events 
379277,JUFA Hotel Wien, The first night there where no hot water for shower Although this problem was known since the day before no one told me that at check in so I didn t have the option to decide if I wont to stay there or not After 21 hours of traveling and working it was very annoying to discover in 23 00 that I should take a cold shower , The room is big and convenient Breakfast is very good 
379278,JUFA Hotel Wien,No Negative, Hotel is very neat and clean The price quality ratio is very good The region is little out of town but it is close metro station so not a huge deal

379282,JUFA Hotel Wien, Room must be paid in advance at check in Everyone knows who is paid in advance Hotel is settled in industrial area close to nothing Although breakfast was rich and varied it was not posible to order omelet or scrambled eggs or any kind of warm dis of whatsoever ,No Positive
379283,JUFA Hotel Wien, Occasionally water in shower was not hot enough , The unassuming nature of the staff comfy beds excellent transport links the quietness and friendliness 
379284,JUFA Hotel Wien, There were no fridge in the room I suppose to have as a 4star Hotel I order a double bedroom The room we had was a twin when I asked the staff to change it to the double one they just cane and make the beds close together Actually it was not a double matters it was very close twin mattress There was no phone in the room when you want to order something you had to go to reception and order it face to face and even it is 2am There was no tissue in the room I bought myself The entrance was terrible It s correct at the smoking zone My room was a room of connected rooms which was connected with a door to another And of my bad chance my neighbor had a very noisy children It was good the manager or related personnel considering the condition when arranging rooms , We staid from 30th December 2016 till 3rd January 2017 The only good item that seems to me what the chocolate that the reception staff gave us as a goodbye gift

379325,JUFA Hotel Wien, The overall four stars ranking induces expectations the place does not factually confirm Lacking refrigerator and crowding four beds into a tiny room plus apparently new furniture of deficient design and poor manufacturing endorse lower cost than paid With unsecure window handle operation and air conditioning system under expected parameters one may say the room was inhabitable yet resembling a social shelter rather than a four stars hotel in Vienna , The positioning as described is good Breakfast as expected in 3 4 stars places in the area Back side area looks better than the front 
379326,JUFA Hotel Wien, The area when getting there after dark didn t seem very pleasant We got there at around 22 00 with two small kids and at first they gave us a room with only 2 beds although we reserved 4 beds We had to go down again to ask for another room and they immediately gave us one with 4 beds , Stayed there for one night and left early for the airport Driving to the airport took about 20 25 minutes The hotel seems ok but we didn t actually used its facilities The room was nice Access from the parking zone was convenient

379361,JUFA Hotel Wien, Double bed is actually two single beds attached together I asked to change the room because I had thought that these are actually twin rooms but I was said that all the rooms are the same There are no telephones and mini bars in the room which is extremely inconvenient expecially if you live on the 5th floor The location of the hotel is not ideal too far from everything , Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly Fruits on reception were good
