105873,H tel F licien by Elegancia, 4 00 checkin was far too strict of a rule There must have been a single room cleaned and ready to go between 9 00 am when we arrived and 4 pm, Reception was very accommodating
105874,H tel F licien by Elegancia,No Negative, We have stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and it was EXCELLENT the location near by the Eiffel is EXCELLENT the staff was very HELPFUL and SERVICE ORIENTED
105875,H tel F licien by Elegancia, All, Nothing actually I feel sad becouse e expect to much As i love nice hotel to stay Room is too small cant evem moved Not worth for the prize we payed
105876,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The shower door was faulty lots of water going through the spa is really tiny the hot tubs as per the hotel pictures are only for 2 suits not for all guests , Good location friendly staff few good restaurants nearby
105877,H tel F licien by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff members particularly Julia and Paula were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our entire visit They offered wonderful suggestions helped with some language barriers and were generally always ready and willing to help in any way possible The accommodations were wonderful very stylish and comfortable and the breakfast was an added bonus We especially liked the quieter residential feel of the neighborhood around the hotel A welcome break from the noise and congestion of the middle of Paris with ready access to the bus and the Metro to get anywhere we wanted 
105878,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Hated that there was no coffee or mugs in the room despite there being a kettle and sugar When we asked for some mugs and coffee we were told we would have to buy from the bar so we asked for tea bags they didn t have any ordinary tea Eventually we got some coffee but the milk had gone off We were also given directions to the wrong bus stop which could have been disastrous if a kind lady didnt notice and send us to the right one , Bed was comfy and staff helpful
105879,H tel F licien by Elegancia, This isn t a negative so much as something to mention but the check in truly doesn t begin until 4pm It s not like America where you show up and the hotel finds you a room However we were served very delicious coffee drinks while we waited for our room , The staff was extremely friendly The hotel was extremely clean and comfortable No complaints 
105880,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Not up to 4 star hotel standards 4 star hotels pay attention to the little things The pool is very small The rooms are small The inner doors in the room are annoying , The breakfast was good 
105881,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The pool was absolutely tiny You couldn t swim in it and in pictures it looks much bigger This was a shame as my boyfriend is training for triathlons and an ironman hence why I chose a hotel with a pool The sauna was nice but the steam room was also a let down , The room was lovely and the bed was super comfy Lovely shower and the decor of the hotel is cool Staff were also very friendly My boyfriend and I both slept incredibly well as the curtains totally block out all light the area is very quiet and the bed was so comfortable Best nights sleep I ve had in a while 
105882,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The swimming pool was tiny only really suitable for a couple to splash about in, The staff were great hosts They were willing to help at all times and remembered my name 
105883,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Room needed a bit of a deep clean A bit of dust in the corners and on the floor Also the toilet had a bit of a funny smell , Staff were nice and helpful beds were comfy Location was good Room was cleaned every day 
105884,H tel F licien by Elegancia, All very good Only thing was that hammam was intolerably hot , Very comfortable room Lovely staff Classy quiet hotel Calm street With a lift which I think is unusual for Paris hotels Pool tiny but lovely for one or two Bathrobe and slippers provided 
105885,H tel F licien by Elegancia, We request no smoking room which we got BUT our opposite room guests smoked a lot and the smoke enter our room and we cannot do anything about it , The room was clean with modern decoration 
105886,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Nothing to fault , Staff were extremely friendly welcoming and particularly helpful nothing seemed to be a problem for them great service Hotel was within walking distance to tourist attractions yet quiet area at night so great night s sleep also 
105887,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The swimming pool was a lot smaller than expected but this did not take away from our stay , This hotel was fabulous A great location and friendly staff Each room has it s own character 
105888,H tel F licien by Elegancia, We had to wait a while for our room to be prepared The reptionist said that it wouldn t be long but we were sat waiting for an hour In the end we left our bags and came back later Other than that I couldn t complain , Everything was just perfect The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful They made the occasion extremely special 
105889,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The decor is very chic post modern with a dark motif It was fine but not normally to my taste , The breakfast was excellent with French breads and pastries vegetables and fruit and a standard spread of hot breakfast foods and cereal 
105890,H tel F licien by Elegancia, We booked this hotel because of the advertised roof terrace and hot tub but when we arrived we were told that this is only for specific rooms This was not mentioned on the website or offered as an option at the time of booking so we were not happy we would have booked a different hotel had we known this , Style of the hotel was quite quirky and we liked that Mini spa was nice after a day out too The breakfast is expensive at 18 euros each but there is a supermarket two streets down 2 mins walk with other a fresh orange juice machine for 1 39 a bottle and fresh croissants every morning We bought breakfast and walked or got the batobus to the Eiffel Tower to eat every morning The Batobus stop is 5 mins walk away just across the bridge brilliant for sightseeing and getting around easily 
105891,H tel F licien by Elegancia,No Negative, Short walk to the metro easy access to the rest of the city Located in a great neighboorhod with local shops restaurants Staff very helpful and extremely friendly 
105892,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Was desapointing that we couldn t use the jacuzzi Only when we made the check inn was informed that the roof jacuzzi was only usefull for the suite ,No Positive
105893,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The swimming pool s water was a bit cold and steam room over steaming But that s all I found so well done on the overall experience , The comfort of the room lovely bed crispy sheets and cosy atmosphere The staff was very nice and helpful Ideal location for Eiffel tower Seine walks and sightseeing 
105894,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The spa was very disappointing the pool was to cold the sauna didn t work and the Turkish bath was far to hot ittook your breath away very hazordous no proper lighting couldn t see if you were partially sighted you would have had a problem it reminded me of somewhat seedy I think it was to give a sensual overtime but it wasn t c that impression the spa was a very hazordous area Bathroom was a nightmare you had to be a cortonoist to have a shower it was very slippery the floor was dangerous when i got out bed I nearly slipped one lift didn t work and the room was sombre couldn t make tea or coffee in the room very inconvient staff were great and very helpful great they were but the concept of the hotel was designer but not at all practical and that was big factor in the stay I was concerned that I had to be aware of the hazards it s totally dysfunctional for staying anylonger than a couple of days it doesn t work for the client but works for the staff who maintain the hotel , I liked the location it was convenient the hotel was ok it was clean and staff very helpful but bed were comfortable very residential
105895,H tel F licien by Elegancia, At first glance very modern unique design but the hotel is very small and I feel not made the most of the space and clutterd the area instead staff show some inexperience on how they deal with situations and the atmosphere is awkward sauna was closed when I wanted to use it something I really was looking forward to do and main reason I booked this hotel overall disappointing and a let down from the first look like a beautifully wrapped gift but the actual gift is not as good quality as it looks, modern design spa facilities
105896,H tel F licien by Elegancia, room bathroom are bit small 16 me arrondissement is quiet good for sleeping or travelling South of Paris , great interior design and facilities efficient friendly staff spa will make you sweat for sure
105897,H tel F licien by Elegancia, No tea or coffee in the room Cost a lot of money and I then had to pay extra for tea and coffee Never stayed in a hotel that doesn t have complimentary tea or coffee in the room , Modern and fresh
105898,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The selection of food at breakfast was not really in line with the price and when things ran out they took a long time to be replenished , The hotel was very clean and the majority of the staff were very friendly 
105899,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The food from the room service menu wasn t very nice and the breakfast was a bit overpriced for what we both ate at 18 , The pillows were soft the room was amazing the pool was nice as well as the steam room and sauna everyone at the hotel was very nice
105900,H tel F licien by Elegancia, I would have liked to have had tea coffee making facilities in the bedroom , The reception staff were excellent and being non french speaking this did not present a problem as the receptionists English was excellent The receptionists were extremely friendly helpful and efficient The beds were exceptionally comfortable and cleanliness was of a very high standard 
105901,H tel F licien by Elegancia, The pool was no more than a Jacuzzi which was disappointing , Lovely hotel in nice residential area outside of the city and within short walking distance of river Seine buses Metro and trains Pleasant helpful staff very clean and modern Art Deco style 
105902,H tel F licien by Elegancia, I was made to wait for 3 hours in reception for the police this was terrible as it was late at night I had been working all day I wasn t offered a drink I was frightened as I was a woman alone no security didn t sleep well , When I arrived at the room there was a naked man in my room I went to reception they retrieved the man who was a homeless man who had somehow managed to gain access 
105903,H tel F licien by Elegancia, No iron in the room or tea coffee facility s , A ten minute walk to the nearest RER line which gives you access to the whole of Paris which was ideal The free use of the spa facility was a nice little extra while staying at the hotel 
105904,H tel F licien by Elegancia,No Negative, Absolutely loved our stay Nothing to fault whatsoever Beautiful elaquent room every little detail has the Felicien f on it great touch The bed is the most comfortable in the world Staff were excellent Really nice touch to have rose petals on the bed upon arrival Wifi was very good no problems The spa is a dream and romantic Couldn t rate my trip any better fantastic stay and will be recommending to others and will return myself

105909,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Didn t like the fact that we booked the hotel based on the picture of the rooftop and jacuzzi which is only available to people staying in two of the rooms in the hotel, Staff were excellent
105910,H tel F licien by Elegancia, Booked this hotel with the prospect of rooftop access according to the website On arrival told this is only for those staying in suites very disappointing Lighting in bathroom inadequate if you are a female trying to apply makeup etc Not wildly keen on very dark paint on bedroom walls rather gloomy but others may like Gym tiny and really only suitable for one guest at a time Bar was very very gloomy due to the lighting and dark coverings on windows Even on the sunniest of days it was like sitting in a blackout Breakfast appallingly overpriced , Boutique modern hotel in a residential part of Paris Rooms modern and comfortable Quiet and clean Some pleasant caf s and restaurants close by Also couple of small corner type supermarkets Modern shopping centre also walkable Short taxi ride to the Eiffel Tower Staff friendly Keen cleaning staff
