368178,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Not close to the central area Although there are trolley s closeby There are really no restaurants around and the one in the hotel is not great The hotel is awaiting a liquor licence so you cannot get a drink although there is a grocery store nearby that sells wine If you want ice they give it to you in a plastic bag that leaks in minutes and if you want cutlery they give you plastic ones , The bed was comfy bathroom clean 
368179,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Room wasn t clean curtains were mouldy blood on one of the pillows ac ventilation did not work at all Price was too high for what looked totally different in the pictures, Staff seemed friendly lobby was clean and tidy
368180,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, No mini fridge or microwave in room only one sheet on bed which was a top sheet which meant that if you move in your sleep they automatically came off and the entire mattress was bare Overall it was a fine stay but would not do it next time considering how much it costed,No Positive
368181,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel,No Negative, We got a top floor corner room and the view size of room was great Hotel is in a great location tram stop just outside staff are friendly and helpful and the parking facility is excellent
368182,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, I didn t realize the hotel was so far away from the tourist sights It is too far to walk and driving in the city was difficult so we had to take a cab uber to get around Not bad but it added some expense to the trip , Very nice facility Clean friendly and great atmosphere
368183,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel,No Negative, This is our second time at Best Western We loved the property from our last trip and were quick to book it when we saw it this time The room was spacious and clean The tram station was 2 minutes walk from the property and they also have a grocery store in the lane 
368184,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Seemed like there was renovation going on so the lobby wasn t very tidy , Excellent access to metro tram and bus stops Some good shops available close by as well 
368185,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Took ages for the hot water to get to us Had to turn the tap for on for at least 5 minutes did mention to staff on our departure who said she will get maintenance onto it There were three lifts but one was out of action so had to wait a while for a lift the steps were very steep and narrow so was hard to use them They were upgrading the rooms with new toilet systems we were lucky to have one but the new unfitted ones were left at the entrance in the foyer that looked a bit unsightly , Excellent breakfast and a large diner Great views from our eighth floor room The transport system was just out the door so caught trams and buses to the main attractions on a hour pass we purchased from the hotel cheap way to travel 
368186,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Awful customer service , The worst customer service experience i have ever had The staff are rude and very unhelpful they told me i did not have a reservation and left it to me to provide as much proof as possible lots of time wasted trying to deal with this matter and no apology after realising their mistake Also had items stolen from our room and reception staff were unwilling to help instead they told me it was a police matter This is a lovely hotel ruined by its rude staff 
368187,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, I didn t like that they would not give me rewards points for my stay because I booked through a third party site The neighborhood near the hotel is not really nice It didn t feel unsafe but a lot of unsightly apartment buildings , The hotel was close to public transportation tram line to city center The rooms were clean and comfortable There is also a small shopping center next door where you can get groceries and other items 
368188,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel is not at the heart of the city It is located a little away from the city centre which made walking to the main areas difficult However the tram bus and train station is just a 1 minute walk from the hotel , Very friendly hotel staff That rooms and the other hotel areas were kept very clean The hotel also has good tour discount coupons available at the reception 
368189,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Booked a twin executive room but was told they only have double beds They did offer to put us in standard with breakfast but it should have been clearer when booking ,No Positive

368191,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, A place to sit and have a glass or two of wine or be able to have a meal in the hotel accompanied by a bottle of wine We would never have booked the hotel if we had known that it had lost its licence , The staff were excellent
368192,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The ceiling paint in the bathroom was peeling in places due to the lack of a fan system in there We had to prop open the door of the bathroom to allow air to circulate but it didn t impede our enjoyment of the facilities at the hotel , All of the staff were really helpful and forthcoming with useful information making our stay a lot easier 
368193,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The lifts are terrible take ages when called rooms are pretty small too, Most staff were friendly the rooms were clean and east transport links to centrall and anywhere you wanna be
368194,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, If I m honest not much maybe just adding a fridge into the room maybe , The staff were very polite friendly and the overall hotel was constantly kept in good condition 
368195,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, General appearance of hotel in lobby rather odd they had boxes toilets stacked giving it an unwelcoming presence Other than that all good, Transport location links are good staff helpful Decent size rooms
368196,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The lift I understand that lifts break occasionally So no big deal that I was stuck in one at this hotel But when I pressed the alarm there was no feedback No one to say they had heard the alarm and that an engineer would be coming Just silence And no emergency phone number posted inside the lift OK They got us out after maybe 15 minutes But of the lifts I ve been stuck in during my life that was probable the worst And no apology from the management That was weak customer relations , The staff were attentive And the breakfast was up to standard
368197,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Nothing Everything was great didn t try the restaurant as we were out most of the time but came back always to a nice tidy room , Fresh towel and close to public transport Staff are very helpful Great value for money
368198,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Smelly corridor dusty rooms broken basins perhaps because the hotel is still under renovation We are a bit disappointed with the hotel facilities , Very friendly and helpful staff We got the rooms we requested Though the safe in rooms I booked were not functioning a staff came to repair them Public car park next to the hotel 12 per day No 21 bus or No 14 tram to central station and Dam around 12 to 18 mins There is a short cut on the left side of the entrance to the bus tram stop takes less than 3 mins walk 
368199,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, A little far from the center making it inconvenient to come back during the middle of the day and go back out again , Nice room with a good view Comfortable beds and shower Wifi was working although a bit slow They have bikes for rent onsite Easy to access with various trams buses Good Turkish food nearby 
368200,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Wasn t happy with the room at all my lights in the room wasn t working and I had to get into a argument with the staff member just so I could change room tying me there s nothing he could do about it the staff have no manners especially the skinny blonde kid,No Positive
368201,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The wifi was very slow at times especially if there was more than one person connected to it at any one time The hairdryer didn t work and when we asked for another one they told us they would bring up but never did , The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfy The hotel was a stones throw from the tram stops so even though the hotel itself is a little out of the centre it is really easy to get there and only takes about 15 minutes The staff were pleasant and the facilities were very good 
368202,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Hotel falsely advertised the price of a taxi to the hotel from central Amsterdam they said it would cost 40 when it actually cost 12 if you didn t book a taxi through the hotel Hotel made it look quite complicated to get into central dam using public transport It is a lot easier than as is made out, Trams and buses went from right around the corner of the hotel into central Amsterdam Good price for location and accessability
368203,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel,No Negative, The hotel itself was very nice and clean The room was set up for 4 adults and yet there was still ample room for walking and maneuvering around luggage The bathroom was big and had toiletries The a c worked very well and quickly cooled the room The hotel has 3 elevators and a large lobby area with plenty of brochures and coupons The location is close to a tram bus stop but the metro was not too close Overall we enjoyed our stay

368207,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The bed had bed bugs and I have many pictures to prove it after complaining to the hotel they told us they were fully booked and could not move us and that housekeeping had gone home so there was nothing they could do I appreciate there was nothing they could do but I thought they could have called someone to try and make it better for us change the mattress maybe I had to stay in a bed bug ridden bed for another night woke up with more bites and it ruined my stay and made me feel ridiculously dirty , The staff were extremely friendly although a little slow at times they were a very warm welcome 
368208,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Drainage odour in bathroom ceiling tiles lifted when window open coffee machine broke asked to be replaced when out for dinner but not done told on check out that could have been moved but fact that room offered originally despite issues is disappointing Other nicer hotels nearby, Spacious rooms away from busy centre
368209,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, It was very hot when we stayed so it would have been nice to have a fridge in the room We had to fill up the sink with cold water for our drinks , Lovely hotel with very friendly staff Extremely easy to get the tram to the centre 
368210,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Costs of taxis and other prices in Amsterdam , The location was ideal if you liked a little walk Easy access to central when you know where you need to go 
368211,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, When we booked this hotel with Booking com we were not aware that it was a no alcohol hotel We have never heard of a NON ALCOHOL Hotel so it was not something we would have checked for We did not discover this until we looked up the hotel web site during our journey to the hotel For this reason we did not use the hotel restaurant , We upgraded and had a nice light corner room 
368212,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The room could be more spacious A fridge would be useful, The coffee machine and the bath tub the spacious double bed and the teas and coffees available

368216,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, It was a lot further out of Amsterdam then I expected from the description in Booking com Stuffy room A C didn t work properly, Easy access to the trams and buses clean room
368217,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, No very obvious if you wanted a beer in the lounge and where it was from foyer , Lovely big bathroom and comfortable beds The number 14 tram from just across the square was very regular and took us to dam square within 15 mins The number seven across the road takes you straight to the museum district Excellent transport links all of our visit and on such a cheap 3 day travel card so we treated ourselves to a flat 40 fare taxi to the airport on our way home which the hotel sorted 
368218,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, First of all we checked in and there was stains all over our bed sheets after unpacking we decided to get a shower and freshen up before going back out The drains made the smell of the bathroom almost unbearable My partner used the shower where we found the hook for the shower wasn t secure which made the actual shower head fall off and smack him in the face causing him to have a black eye Before we went out we passed this on to the staff who may I add was lovely young girl with dark hair she said she would look into getting the shower fixed and bed sheets changed we said we d see if the smell of the room had calmed down before we had to move as we had unpacked and we had little time to start with and loads we wanted to do We didn t arrive back while 3am the next morning and to our surprise the shower head was still in the same position unfixed the bedding was still stained but the smell of the drains had gone so we stayed in the room and decided we would mention it the next morning as it was late and been on the 11th floor it was a bit of an inconvenience having to go all way back down we where really disappointmented that the staff had made promises to them just ignore our requests When we went down stairs the next morning we mentioned it to the staff on reception who was really rude advising basically that she wasn t going to do anything because we didn t mention it last night as soon as we got back try going to the 11th floor at 3am and wanting to come back down we left it with her hoping something would get sorted Arrived back that evening still nothing had been done and also NO fresh towels and the smell of the drain was back As we where checking out the next morning we left it and decided we would right a complaint instead When we woke up the morning to pack there was a beetle type creature crawling in our bed sheets the same mucky stained ones wed litrally stripped of the bed and slept with only the pillow , The room and hotel was very modern and we where put on the top floor as requested despite having to walk up stairs due to lift not going all the way up we where told this when checked in so no problem 
368219,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The wifi signal is bad and slow And it takes around 10mins by tram going to center, The bed is comfy They gave us 2 pillows one of them is softer and the other is harder Which I think is good
368220,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The rooms were not that nice went in the bathroom an the curtains where full of black mould I complained an got my 3rd room which was not bad after I took pictures of all the dirt in the rooms an not once did any management come an see my even when I asked, The first room I had the bathroom toilet was dirty

368223,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, My only crticism is that the breakfast wasn t great There was plenty of food but perhaps it was too continental for my taste , The hotel is close to bus and metro transport links I found the staff very friendly and helpful especially in giving advice on getting around Amsterdam My room was clean and comfortable 
368224,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Everything , This is a no alcohol hotel The rates are good but you only get what you pay for mould on bathroom curtains stains on couches naked wires on hair drier 
368225,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The rooms are ok but lacking things like spare pillows a plug for the hand basin etc , About a 15 minute bus tram ride to city centre this is a convenient hotel for fleeting visit and convenient for airport The reception staff were excellent the hotel was adequate but value for money 
368226,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, We were charged about 70 euros more for a double bed instead of two single beds which was not clarified by the clerk before the payment Expensive for not including breakfast , Beautiful view Comfortable bathroom Convenient location

368235,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Can see why the hotel is called Blue Tower as looks like a block of offices with blue windows not appealing from the outside and not a nice area to return to late at night also next to a very busy motorway so noisy when window open Ask for a high floor away from the road , We just used hotel to sleep so cant comment on restaurant etc but Reception were very helpful Clean comfortable and spacious room with good travel links into the City and the airport

368246,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, There was no privacy from the highrise buildings overlooking the bathroom except for a dirty mould stained curtain The main bedroom was let down by a curtain that was hanging of the curtain rail and gave a poor overall impression of the room I felt given what I paid for the room this was unnacceptable , The bath shower toilet were good 
368247,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, 40 minutes walking to the city center Not very convenient in case of touristic stay We are OK with public transportation but each night going by bus is a kind of boring thing There s one more issue how to deal with the location get on a bike Amsterdam is really a place for long bike rides so use this to turn location disadvantage to a marvelous bike tripping opportunity , Cozy stay not far from Sloterdijk station Only 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by bus from the Station Sloterdijk is connected with the Airport via Airport City train only 11 minutes Okay is the right word to describe The facilities are pretty convenient the neighborhood is quiet with many stores and a beautiful market around Nice transport connection with Central Station bus 20 min and Museumplein tram 20 min

368325,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, the staff at the restaurant were very nice but you just hear them talking loud all the time as if they are selling fish at the market Also sometimes they didn t bother to clean a pile of plates from a table where people are having their breakfast they preferred to clean a table when a couple left the restaurant First priority always those present just stating this in a good way to improve not to be harsh on the staff I m a Supervisor myself so maybe that s why I noticed these things , The receptionists where very helpful and kind mostly the blonde guy who opened the restaurant just for us to get us some crockery The room was spot on with a comfy bed and very warm The breakfast was excellent and yes the croissants were extra flakey

368351,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The area itself was a little out of the main city but the 14 tram or 21 bus would bring you to the heart of Amsterdam in just under 15 minutes The area felt a little bit unsafe at night as we were a group of females and there seemed to be a lot of men hanging around the streets after dark But this was obviously no fault of the hotel , We stayed in a triple room on the tenth floor and the views were stunning at night The room was luxurious for the low price we paid and the bathroom facilities were excellent Just beside the hotel were two supermarkets which was convenient for snacks etc There was also a market which took place on the saturday of our visit in the square behind the hotel Staff weren t necessarily friendly but they were always helpful when approached with questions

368357,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Firstly upon our arrival the woman that was at the reception was not very smiley nor very friendly After I wanted to pay a city tax was added to my fee that was not mentioned in my booking confirmation After arguing turns out a very small font says 5 city tax not included was there I thought that was horrible and should be highlighted since not all guests are willing to do math and its not a very convenient way When we received our rooms the safe was not working We called the reception for help it took them 1 hour to come to our room and fix it which delayed our outing The rooms where not very nice and their vintage look was not very successful for it looked poor and cheap The pictures aren t very true to reality During our stay we noticed poor housekeeping since the floor was never vacuumed and dust was everywhere The major disappointment I got from this hotel was that the day we wanted to check out we woke up at 5am and there was no electricity in the whole hotel We were on the 8th floor and had 3 big luggages with us but no elevator I went down to the reception using the stairs which are super steep and dangerous to find a guy on the reception telling me Amsterdam has a black out I asked for his help to bring the luggage down the stairs he refused in the begging but then helped us The poor guy went up 8 stories then down 8 stories with 3 big luggage I understand the black out was not he hotel s fault but a hotel as big as Best Western Blue should have a back up generator no All in all I enjoyed my stay in Amsterdam but sorry Best Western Blue I do not recommend you , I can t really say I liked anything at the hotel But to be fair its fairly located in 25 mins away from centrum and has decent rooms with a not bad view

368360,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, A little bit expensive they had smaller prices when we searched for rooms a few days before our arrival Some of the stuff was a bit cold and annoyed when we had questions Also the room was very small , The city is great with tons of museums 
368361,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Breakfast was a little disappointing but I think that was our fault as we went down late in the day and some of the food was a bit dry like the beans and mushrooms , The hotel was very clean and comfortable staff were friendly and helpful Good bus and tram route into the centre of Amsterdam which was needed as the hotel is on the outskirts of the city Journey in took about 15 minutes Your room could be cleaned daily if you wanted but being as we were only there for 2 nights we declined the offer and extra supplies of toiletries and towels were given to us by the cleaning staff Supermarket nearby if you want to buy milk for your room and an interesting selection of shops and a market to explore in the area

368412,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, On both mornings of our stay we were awoken early by the fire alarm both of which were false alarms Although this was not the fault of the staff they offered little explanation and no apology or compensation Staff were not very welcoming and their were lots of workmen around the hotel moving furniture and fitting new doors One morning we waited 10 minutes for the lift because all were being used by workmen moving furniture and pots of paint , Nice decor comfortable room and good ensuite It wasn t the nicest area to stay in but there was a tram stop and two supermarkets around the corner which was really convenient

368416,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Location too far away for cheap taxi rides or walk to the city centre Not sure whether usual approach attitude but staff was very straightforward and I don t think that I have seen anyone from the staff smile even once perhaps a cultural thing in Netherlands so it may be just my ignorance The area where the hotel is located is residential and slightly dogy There are no many nice coffee places around here and the only food place open after late is KFC and kebab place , The price comfortable beds very firm quite clean easy access to the city centre by public transport not by taxi We did not have breakfasts included but other guests were very positive about it Close to two large supermarkets with good choice of food bear in mind that there is a fairly limited choice of pre made meals ready to eat like sandwich or hot food

368428,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Part of the room of our ceiling fell off because of a leak in the air conditioner they kindly helped us to change to a better room and clean my clothes The hotel seems old you can see they have a lot of moisture in the walls and ceilings Also rooms don t have a minibar so no option to cool your own drinks , It is pretty close to a tram line that will take you directly to the center of Amsterdam in a 15min ride and it comes every 10min you can find trams until midnight

368437,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The rooms were poorly furnished awkward to use and with very old furnishings The bathroom was okay and the best bit The beds were uncomfortable and the duvets had a very cheap synthetic filling The kind that makes me very hot indeed and suffocates rather than lets your skin breath through it The tea was awful there were plastic plastic spoons and not enough cupboard space at all The internet in the room for the most part was almost unusable due to speed I had to go to the lobby to access the internet A very uncomfortable stay which would have been fine at 50 per night but at more than 100 Wow that is expensive and I ll never stay there again , Nothing to like at all

368525,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel is not located 25 min from the Centre walking as written in te description and as the recepsionist told We had to walk every day more than an hour to arrive at Dam Square , The conditions of the hotel in general are good for the money you pay 
368526,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, That the hotel didn t have a very good shuttle system It cost a lot to use the shuttle which considering the distance from the central area of Amsterdam it would have been nice to have complimentary discounted service , The design of the rooms allowed great views of Amsterdam Clean and tidy

368532,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Unlike other hotels there was absolute nothing to keep you out of the cold when standing outside to wait for a taxi or to smoke even a small shelter to put the luggage when checking in or out you had to suffer cold and rain , Clean descent hotel good access to center by bus and tram it s not in the center 
368533,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, That the restaurant wasn t open Sunday and Monday s Not even the bar so you are unable to get a drink before you go to bed which I like to do When asked a member of staff anywhere nice to eat dinner near the hotel there wasn t anything , The rooms were very big and well furnished They was posh with big bathrooms Lots of toiletries given

368537,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The room was big and elegant but it wasn t prepared properly The sink wasn t flowing there was marihuana smell coming out the air conditioning and a shower cap covering the smoke detector which shows they don t take seriously their own super strict Non Smoking Policy once I told them the answer was does it bother you I would like to ask them the same question, Location isn t great but it is well connected I loved the taste of Turkey and Arabic countries in the neighbourhood but if you are looking for a bit of Holland or a beer no alcohol it might not be your perfect area 
368538,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The restaurant did not serve any alcoholic drinks but did not advertise this correctly When we ordered a wine they said it had a low alcohol percentage when it was actually alcohol free We felt like was misleading and that we paid for something we didn t order , I thought the staff were very helpful and informative The room was comfortable and clean

368540,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, we had problem with the WIFI connection in our room We were in a group staying in 3 different types of room so i thought maybe the others might also have problem with the connection but it turned out that it s just us so I called the reception they answered after i called 4 times and a receptionist named Peter just answered he cannot do anything about it What a customer service I even asked him if he can kindly try to restart the modem router just to solve the problem which fortunately worked out thanks to me One more thing I asked for a coffee in the morning on the day of out check out at the reception but nobody bothered to bring me one luckily the cleaning staff were so kind to help me out the facilities aren t that great but if the staff were trained well then the experience staying here would have been great , I appreciate the female staff that worked at night when we arrived and the male staff that arranges the linens in front of our room on the day of our check out who was so helpful Thanks to you guys 
368541,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Room could be a little more clean The night receptionist gave paracetamol to a guest as far as I know this is not allowed , Friendly staff upon arrival trainee can t remember his name he was most welcome to help us even though we came before the check in time Check out was good and they stored our bags so we could return later on and pick them up 
368542,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Sometimes the wifi didn t work and the shower had a small gap between the bottom and the doors of the shower so the water gets on the floor all the time , The room size was fine equipment of the room was super staff was nice and it was really clean And they had great towels

368550,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Room on 10th floor meant sometimes quite a long wait for the elevator especially at breakfast time Next time will request a lower floor , Good size bedroom helpful staff and reception About 15 minutes to the city centre however I was aware of this when booking so not a complaint I m certain a similar hotel in centre would have been double the price so the 15 min tram or bus ride was really no problem and was actually quite a pleasant experience with reliable service Plenty of shops restaurants in the immediate area about 50 meters from the hotel 
368551,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Not a great area The rooms really need an update No signage facing the most accessed routes during the day could not find this hotel without phoning It is BEHIND the shopping centre , Helpful staff The hotel is on a shopping centre with direct access to the carpark Fresh apples at reception Close to public transport

368555,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The distance was abit of an issue And would of preferred to have had an option to a smoking room Which differed from hotels I ve used in Amsterdam in the past, overall the staff really made the hotel what it is their friendliness and help made us overview things we disliked in points 
368556,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel,No Negative, The staff at Reception were generally very helpful The breakfast was very good except that I think scrambled eggs should be prepared on request only as they do not benefit from being prepared in bulk 
368557,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel has seen the better days The interiors are getting shabby and worn out You can t open the windows but the air con is pretty old fashioned They tuck the blanket into the bed so it is very short up to middle of your chest then and I was bitten by bedbugs There are tourist groups staying at the hotel so be warned The location area is not welcoming , The TV was pretty big and had UK and German channels The size of the room was decent The bathroom was with a functioning shower and other utilities 
368558,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Need bus tram to get into city centre Local area is not great Only fast food nearby and no bars No alcohol in hotel Breakfast wasn t great and very busy we had to clear and lay our own table Loo seat was broken Loo roll holder broken , Public parking 12 per day with access from lobby Handy for bus tram into town get 2 or 3 day pass from reception cheaper than buying on tram or bus pass is good for both Helpful reception staff 
368559,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Not in the city centre so if you want to spend a lot of time in Centrum this hotel is not an ideal location although there are trams and buses available nearby which take you to Centrum or Centraal in 20 minutes , Nice clean hotel Good breakfast Spacious clean rooms Pleasant staff Overall good experience 
368560,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel turned to be far away from the center it s rather old many things in the bathroom were broken or didn t function, The staff was friendly the facility clean
368561,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Location is outside city centre and there is not much around in the area so if you want to travel into Amsterdam prepare for 20 30 minutes each way by tram or bus which stop nearby , Clean rooms and hotel good breakfast efficient staff rental bikes luggage storage and taxi call facilities 
368562,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Although the hotel is in the city it s far from main tourist attractions Staff at the reception could be more friendly I understand the lady could be tired it was end of her shift but we didn t feel welcomed We did not like that City tax wasn t in the price of the room and that breakfast was something extra to pay for , Good standard but you expect it for this price 
368563,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel wasnt as clean as I d of liked The walls in our room had dirt marks all over and the bathroom and bedroom could of done with a scrub down The rooms are a little old fashioned and Also the staff at the beginning where a little unfriendly , The location wasnt as bad as I had assumed from some of the reviews It wasn t in the centre but was only a tram ride away from outside the hotel We got a 25 three day travel card so wasn t a problem Plus we payed 16 18 euros for a taxi home from the centre 
368564,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Located in the midst of the turksih district of Amsterdam this very Chinese looking hotel does not feel like a 4 it claims to be The many pleasures of Amsterdam musea local markets shops restaurants etc are all far away What you save in room rates you pay in conveyance , Nothing specifically
368565,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel,No Negative, We went jogging in the morning from hotel to Rembrandtplein square it is a good way to enjoy this city Good bakery shop as and 2 super market nearby very convenient 
368566,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Location It is in the least Dutch area great if you want authentic Turkish food or clothes shops by that I mean not your recognised high street shop but it was not a dislike so to say just lacks the authentic cultural Dutch side , Anywhere you looked was immaculately clean from bathroom to restaurant staff were very helpful our bathroom door lock didn t work and the door didn t shut as well as this the safe didn t work We went downstairs and told reception and they arranged it to be done first thing the next day and it was very happy after that The breakfast is average but nonetheless edible I think people expect too much and I m a fussy eater yet I still ate and was satisfied The area is far from the centre but there are several trams and buses that come regularly and if you do your research can get you to the exact location in the centre you would like to visit within 20 mins 
368567,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, 1 Location About 20 25 minutes from Central Station, 1 Breakfast very rich and tasty 2 Staff helped and answered every question 3 Room pretty big room with all needed equipment safe kettle etc 4 Tram and bus stop in few minutes of walking 
368568,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, The hotel has lost its alcohol licence so there is no bar We had to go to the local shop to buy a bottle of wine and then sit in our room Our quadruple room could have done with a good clean as It was very dusty and there were many marks on the carpet Also the air conditioning didn t work The restaurant had a limited menu and ran out of vegetarian options , Good position for public transport to Amsterdam centre Had a secure car park next door Our quadruple room was spacious and comfortable

368574,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, One male member of staff was not particularly helpful and we felt as though we were taking up his time The area appeared a little run down however it had everything we needed Breakfast was 14 95 euros each so we went out to a very local supermarket and spent a lot less Parking was extra , The location and the huge rooms Each room was 50 euros and we were given a family room Good clean bathrooms Easy trip by tram into Amsterdam
368575,Best Western Blue Tower Hotel, Hotel rooms require serious upgrade Room Carpets were worn out furniture outdated so were the bath towels which were worn out Bedroom cupboards were dusty Can become a great hotel if improved, Close to transport network and airport Staff at reception were friendly and well informed and gave good assistance
