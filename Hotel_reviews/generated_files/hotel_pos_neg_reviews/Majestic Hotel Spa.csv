143888,Majestic Hotel Spa, This hotel suffers from lack of proper and competent management Since changed it has been suffering and deteriorating for years Zero vale for money , This place is overrated it used to have its good days The new management lack competence 
143889,Majestic Hotel Spa, Lifts to rooms were a bit confusing Breakfast limited in choice and very expensive at 35 pp Had dinner in my room again really expensive at 55 for steak chips and salad , Staff really helpful and friendly Small hotel in quiet location Swimming pool spa are really good 
143890,Majestic Hotel Spa, Nothing, Extremely friendly and helpful staff Although an expensive hotel it met all the standards one could ever expect and we didnt get near to the Spa Perhaps breakfast a bit limited 
143891,Majestic Hotel Spa,No Negative, Myself and a group of friends stayed at the hotel whilst on a business trip The staff were all very friendly and helpful Our rooms were beautiful and spacious The spa area was lovley and relaxing The food was delicious We will be staying here again Thank you
143892,Majestic Hotel Spa,No Negative, My husband and I stayed there for one night as a wedding anniversary getaway and it was just perfect It s a classic hotel with modern touches and a feeling of understated luxury We booked a deluxe double room online but then were given an option to upgrade to a larger newer room by paying around 80 more on check in As with many classic hotels in Paris some rooms haven t been renovated yet I suppose The beds are ultra comfortable the room was spacious with a small kitchenette and table and the service was great But the big plus of the hotel is its excellent location It s just steps away from the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe yet it is discreetly located on a surprisingly tranquil street We ve stayed there before in a suite with our two kids and were able to use the swimming pool and gym Compared to other larger hotels in the area with similar facilities it s actually a good value You can easily pay double or triple the price for the larger flashier hotels in the neighborhood 
143893,Majestic Hotel Spa, just a little too far side street from main attractions to east of Paris i e Montmartre Marais Louvre and Place des Vosges, Could not fault staff were extremely pleasant and helpful facilities were excellent and room was very comfortable making our stay all the more enjoyable 
143894,Majestic Hotel Spa, Room was old fashioned and slightly tatty and very noisy despite the double glazing This meant the room was hot and the windows could never be opened especially at night The building opposite is the delivery entrance for another hotel and deliveries start very early in the morning and are very noisy However the price was keen and the service excellent , Good value for money two room suit in central Paris ifor 300 odd a night is not much more than a very good flat and the swimming pool is a bonus
143895,Majestic Hotel Spa, It s a 5 hotel but when we checked into our room the drinks in the mini bar were empty and hadn t been replaced If they had neglected that what else had they neglected to clean When we called room service they sent a maid to replace the drinks No apologies were given Rubbish I was not happy , Location is excellent And concierge is very helpful providing tickets for public transport etc
143896,Majestic Hotel Spa, We booked two same rooms at nearly same time but the price is differrent Hotel did not support to change to same price I called booking to negociate with hotel reservation team but the answer is no It is indeed a little pity in Paris , The location is very convenient the bedware is comforble and tiny I like the small kitch and coffee machine 
143897,Majestic Hotel Spa, Noise at night and during the day from children in other rooms Sound insulation inside the hotel was not good , It is a nice modern property in a very good location and with friendly and efficient staff 
143898,Majestic Hotel Spa, I didn t like the adjoining door to the room When I inquired if there were any rooms without the adjoining doors the manageress informed me that 95 of the rooms did have adjoining doors , The hotel is in a good location It is sitauted in a quiet road which is a two minute walk to the Champs Elysee The room was large and the bed was very comfortable The staff were all very freindly and helpful The room had a small kitchenette which was useful The decor of the room and hotel was very pretty 
143899,Majestic Hotel Spa, This is our second time at this hotel Nothing to dislike , Closeness to the Charles De Gaulle subway station Close to everything Restaurants all around Good pool and steam room Not crowded Very good staff Very helpful conciege staff able to direct you to anywhere you want to visit
