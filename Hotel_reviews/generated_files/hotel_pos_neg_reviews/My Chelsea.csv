158947,My Chelsea, The curtains were a bit loose so the light was annoying The safe box was not functioning well That s all, The hotel staff are trained well they do understand customers needs and they act immediately The atmosphere of the place is awesome The manager upgrade us to better room the moment I complain about the room size Absolutely great location facilities around the place name my trip much fun and easy Near tube station
158948,My Chelsea, Room too small Wifi did not work properly No room service but room rate was high Breakfast was basic Amenities need upgrade, Friendly staff I like the location Bathroom was the best part of the room
158949,My Chelsea, The rooms were really tiny even by European standards So much so that if you had a regular suitcase you wouldn t be able to find floor space to open it The bathroom door was a sliding one that didn t shut completely and was paper thin so privacy was minimal Cupboard space was tiny too , The location
158950,My Chelsea, Only one thing is not good too small bed in the room it s narrow for the pair and too short for the usual man, it s nice hotel in quiet place near Chelsea and Kensington we slept with open windows to the street close to underground station very tasty breakfast and comfortable cafe lounge
158951,My Chelsea, The staff were not communicating with each other The check in was delayed for over an hour and we were given conflicting information about the issue they were having with our booking I was promised compensation and so far have only received some of what they intimated Poor service and contradictory information means that I am unlikely to use this hotel again which is a shame as it is rather lovely , Breakfast was lovely for continental style
158952,My Chelsea, Breakfast was continental no cooked option and this wasn t completely clear to me on booking The big space downstairs is used for breakfast the cafe a meeting spot for business people and it seems is the working area and check in desk for the staff It gets a bit hard to find a table where you aren t sharing a meeting The bathroom while large enough has a small basin for shaving and bathroom activities with no space for putting anything The water was HOT very nice , It s right in the heart of Chelsea within walking distance of iconic shopping areas museums public transport and lots of good restaurants Staff couldn t do enough for you really made us feel welcome and valued Shower was very good We drove our hire car in to deliver the luggage before dropping it back at Heathrow and getting the tube back in it s a bit far to wheel 4 largish bags from the station There is no parking on site The rooms and lift were a little bit larger than others in the price range but not much Value for money is hard to determine London is not cheap 
158953,My Chelsea, For breakfast I had coffee on the first two days espresso and cafe latte I do not know why but it was lukewarm on both days The machine needed warming up time As on both days I was the first customer to ask for coffee I opted for tea afterwards People seemed to be enjoying their coffee so it was probably just accidental Or maybe I like coffee very hot which might be wrong preference , They provide very good ham pastrami cheese fresh from the oven croissant yoghurt and fresh fruit cocktail for breakfast in a very nice room like a conservatory Very comfortable bed in a neat and stylish room 
158954,My Chelsea,No Negative, Beautiful hotel restaurants around the area are gorgeous Easy to get to and the location was beautiful I d recommend it and can t wait to go back 
158955,My Chelsea, The room smelt a little of cigarette smoke perhaps from outside and of perfume which i am allergic to , I enjoyed the bar restaurant and the staff were friendly Comfortable bed 
158956,My Chelsea, The ground floor room was dated red black decor not the most relaxing chipped black paint , Great reception bistro area staff v good helpful great central location
158957,My Chelsea, The bedrooms were shabbier than the pictures portrayed and not up to the standard of the lobby Bar stopped serving drinks at 11pm , Funky reception decor nice staff near mostly all amenities great location on a quiet street 
158958,My Chelsea, We are used to a king size bed so this double was a bit small for us but comfortable We felt that the bathroom was fine but the bedroom was rather small and for that reason the value for money was not as good as it might have been, Loved the location friendly staff and downstairs covered courtyard for breakfast 
158959,My Chelsea,No Negative, Room was not large but comfortable enough and in this part of London was comparative good value Walking distance to South Kensington tube restaurants the museums and Hyde Park 
158960,My Chelsea, The choice of breakfast it was exactly the same as when i stayed there the first time with not one single bit of variety That was a huge turnoff , I have stayed at the hotel twice love the hotel the staff are fantastic and the rooms comfortable they can however improve on the breakfast They have exactly the same thing every day and the choices are too limited I think a simple adjustment to create some more variety in the breakfast menu would be a huge plus for the hotel the Chef needs to be a bit more creative no one wants to eat the same thing day after day 
158961,My Chelsea, Im disappointed with the rooms following the refurb I always loved this hotel because of its quirkiness and cool unique rooms Now quite frankly you could be in any Hilton or Novotel in London All boring cream colour and furniture looks a bit cheap When I asked it was apparently to create a feeling of calm I d say it was really just dull In a superior room I also expect a large double bed With a partner of 6 foot 5 small double beds are hopeless for us so I always book a superior room for that reason But I still like the hotel Ill just make sure I get a large bed next time and hopefully they ll keep some of the old rooms, Ive stayed at this hotel a lot in the past few years and its a great location and good value After the refurbishment the bar area is very good and breakfast informal and a nice chilled atmosphere 
158962,My Chelsea, I could nt say anything to improve as it provided what we needed clean modern room good location Husband would have liked breakfast included and thought 15 00 each was too steep even for central londin, location central to all areas we wished to visit would recommend to friends and would stay here again
158963,My Chelsea, The room was very compact and whilst it had everything you would need there was little spare space and with two of us in the room it felt cramped , The location was excellent A quiet residential part of Chelsea but within easy walking distance of the amenities 
158964,My Chelsea, Overpriced hotel Cleanliness wasn t up to the standard and same applies to the hotel facilities The staff looked passive and not well trained to handle customers issues without a management support on the site too The breakfast was another disappointing part of the stay not only in terms of choices but also in terms of the presentation and services , The hotel location is good due to its closeness to the public transport Kensington is a great area for museum lovers it also benefits from its walking distance from one of the most beautiful parks in the city Hyde Parks Two most significant city landmarks The Kensington Palace and the Buckingham Palace are both within walking distance which makes it a desirable location for many tourists 
158965,My Chelsea, We were there for 5 days and during that time one of the two lifts was out of order This meant a maze of corridors and stairs for some patrons including us if we had not asked for a larger room Our initial room was so small there was nowhere to put suitcases and you could hardly walk round the bed In our friends room the safe did not work even though it was new and they could not replace the battery even after 5 days Towel rails did not heat in either bedroom , The look of the hotel is great They have paid attention to the decor and furnishings The staff is friendly though a little amateurish When we complained about the size of our room they gave us a larger one 
158966,My Chelsea,No Negative, Good location very friendly staff good breakfast But this is not a 4 star hotel Maybe it will be once all rooms are refurbished Got a non refurbished room so can not say 
158967,My Chelsea, At first a room was given that was lower standard from what had been reserved small bed no noise insulation from the noisy road etc Finding this out at 23 30 arguing with reception and moving things at that time of night was not great We were lucky there was a nice available room and night staff were helpful So the experience turned back being more positive , Once brought into a good room experience turned positive
158968,My Chelsea, The lift was out of order for our whole stay This should have been sorted as a priority The checking in process was time consuming One person checking guests in and taking them to their rooms The poor girl was really busy especially as a number of guests arrived at the same time Someone should have acted as a porter to assist her and speed up the process , A well appointed room with all the facilities we needed for a short break The room was compact but clean and comfortable and the hotel was in an excellent location Very peaceful and quiet especially given it was only a few minutes walk from the local amenities
158969,My Chelsea, Not enough milk for a decent cup of tea could easily have used 3 of those tiny sachets in each cup Not much in the way of surfaces to put things down like suitcase etc Couldn t seem to get properly cold water to drink , Nice firm bed Newly refurbished room very clean and smart Efficient check in and check out and friendly staff Good shower Lighting was bright enough to read and adjustable enough to be relaxing Weird but fun bedside lamps were touch sensitive 
158970,My Chelsea, I have been staying here for 10 years the bar is now closed to residents after 11pm and the hotel feels deserted The refurb has given up space to the spa which makes the hotel less comfortable, The location is great Intimate and trendy
158971,My Chelsea, Free still drinking water should be provided in bedrooms not bottled water for 2 75 , Very well maintained and tastefully decorated The redone bar dining area is great Very comfortable stay Highly recommended 
158972,My Chelsea, Nothing, Quiet location yet only 5 10 mins walk from Sth Kensington tube 5 minute walk to Chelsea and the Kings Road with its great shopping lovely reception staff who helped us get the early check in we requested very comfortable beds with excellent large shower 
158973,My Chelsea, The Breakfast was not ready at 7 00 am The hot water for tea was cold The milk was not put out and nor were a lot of other things Only skimmed milk seemed to be on offer As we needed to be away early breakfast was poor value , Quiet bedroom
158974,My Chelsea, The service is getting erratic and housekeeping is really bad The bed linen was soiled due to an accident but were not changed And could not be changed in the evening when we came back and discuvered it We had to sleep for another night in the dirty linen , The location is wonderful And it is basically a very nice hotel
158975,My Chelsea, The room was on the first floor and above near to the entrance so although the hotel was in quite a quiet area there was a bit of noise from taxis coming and going people talking early and late so If going back I would choose a much higher room away from that area Also note no fridge , Clean fresh and comfortable room opening windows comfortable bed good shower and bathroom reasonable size friendly efficient staff Pleasant area 
158976,My Chelsea, When the water was turned on in our room and the other rooms the pump noise was very noisy , Room a little small but the bathroom made up for this very comfy bed very clean and shiney 
158977,My Chelsea,No Negative, I thought the first room I was allocated was very small Although the staff member said it was the level of room I had booked he gave me another room which was double the size and a better layout They are in the process of renovating this room wasn t renovated but the bed was comfortable it had large windows I could open It was a pleasant roof top outlook The hotel is very close to the south Kensington underground walking distance to Kensington gardens kings road harrods museums etc a brilliant location 
158978,My Chelsea, A bit of chaos around a new system that meant I walked into my room to find someone already in it But they managed the mistake well , It s quite quirky not the place if you like your hotels slick and polished but I liked the understated look and feel after too many weeks traveling on business It won t be everyone s taste for that reason but I liked it 
158979,My Chelsea, It states there s a 24 hour bar but this wasn t really the case Rather limited in selection and I would have felt very bad making the gentleman running it stay up all night as he was closing down when we came in at 11pm and was there again the next day , Great location for South Kensington tube station Lots of restaurants around and about we didn t opt in for breakfast as we found a good local cafe The street the hotel is on is nice and quiet for an inner city location and was very clean and comfortable for two of us in the room A bit pricey for what it was for one night but that s London for you and it is a lovely area 
158980,My Chelsea, Nothing, Nicely located in the center of Chelsea two blocks from the Kings Road and four blocks from the South Kensington tube stop All kinds of restaurants can be found within walking distance Striking out in all directions for longer trips is easy with the No 11 and No 22 buses on the Kings Road At 150 pounds sterling a night in early May we felt My Chelsea was a fair price We chose not to opt into the 15 quid breakfast though and had breakfast on the Kings Road each morning for less than half that 
158981,My Chelsea,No Negative, The hotel is located in one of the best and luxury parts of London Kensington and Chelsea near to the underground station shops and restaurants The room decorated in English style was clean and comfortable we were very pleased to stay here 
158982,My Chelsea, It would have loved to be informed about the reconstruction work in this hotel before I booked Due to modernization work are large parts of the lobby not in use and the entire lobby has now a hostel like appearance It is not the service but the flair which is missing and for which you book this hotel Although the bar is working there is limited service But I am sure that it will be a fabulous place to stay when they finished construction works , I have been to this hotel before The location is fabulous and the staff is very attentive The bed is comfy 
158983,My Chelsea,No Negative, Extremely friendly staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome upgraded us to the premier honeymoon suite at no extra cost as it was free Would fully recommend 
158984,My Chelsea, Bed was too soft A lot of scuff marks on furniture and hallways No double glazing windows so it was drafty and noisy Blinds don t shut all the way, Room size location
158985,My Chelsea, small room even smaller bathroom with tiny sink no safe box strange humming sound when turning on the water you could hear the water from other rooms going down the pipes at 2 AM loud breakfast not very varied, good location nice breakfast clean room daily kind staff
158986,My Chelsea, Everyone good , Great location in between Kings Road and Fulham Road so perfect for shopping cafes restaraunts Larger than average room size especially for London 
158987,My Chelsea,No Negative, Perfect location and the staff was very friendly The hotel is only few minutes walk from the tube station You don t even have to leave the area tho you ll find museums restaurants pubs cafes and loads to do right there 
158988,My Chelsea, windows not sound proof very basic breakfast room a bit tired, great location if you like Chelsea King s road Joseph French Brasserie Conran shop kettle in the bedroom with coffee and tea
158989,My Chelsea, There was construction work happening on the property which would have been nice to have been made aware of prior to booking, Staff very helpful bed very comfy great shower tasty healthy breakfast
158990,My Chelsea, It was small for a superior room the furniture is tired but bed comfy and linen clean Small bathroom No bath only shower , Lots of hot water and towels and windows could open for fresh air 
158991,My Chelsea, False advertising the room we placed in was completely different to what we had viewed online The room wasn t clean the sides hadn t been dusted for a number of weeks or more The TV signal wasn t great so weren t able to watch with a good picture or without interference We had informed staff to see if it could be resolved but was told it couldn t be helped due to the wind , Good location close to the tube restaurants and cafes
158992,My Chelsea, Our room was pretty small but for the price we paid for it it was perfectly fine And the bed was super comfortable , We loved the location Chelsea it is a very nice and safe area with pretty houses The staff was friendly and helpful all the time Especially Eddie The breakfast buffet is open from 7 11 It is a small buffet but the food was good The tube is only 500m away which was awesome as well It doesn t take you long to get to the different spots in the city Around the hotel there are a few caf s and restaurants I would really recommend this hotel 
158993,My Chelsea, Very small room it was like a closet with a bed , Great location friendly staff metro connection in walking distance caf s and restaurants nearby as well as the musea Science Natural History etc 
158994,My Chelsea, Bathroom could use a little bit of an update , Good hotel with friendly efficient staff Rooms were well maintained and had everything you could need including great wifi Bed was lovely and comfy and the fresh continental breakfast was excellent quality Decent work area in the room with lots of power sockets and good coffee 
158995,My Chelsea, We were not aware of the ongoing refurbishment but it didn t really affect our stay We would have probably used the hotel restaurant had it been open but didn t mind too much , The hotel was really clean comfortable bed and a fab breakfast Very friendly staff we really enjoyed our stay 
158996,My Chelsea, All good at this gem, The bed was comfy Room size great Location excellent Close to the Sth Kensington Station which had the Piccadilly line that runs to Heathrow terminals 1 2 3 4 This line also connects to all the London Underground
158997,My Chelsea, Internet connection not very good Television picture was poor , Great location Nearby main shopping areas and close to Natural History and Science Museums Bed very comfortable 
158998,My Chelsea, Location of mirror back of room door Distance between mirror and nearest plug socket made it difficult for drying hair Noisy construction work taking placduring our visit , Upgraded to superior room bed very comfy facilities good 
158999,My Chelsea, the TV didn t work the shower pressure was no existent the toilet wouldn t flush, it was clan and the bed was ok very much like a old travel lodge
159000,My Chelsea, The room was very small but this is not unexpected in London It is still a fair deal for the money , Very cosy and clean room with a good sized bathroom Location is perfect Staff are very friendly 
159001,My Chelsea, The room was to hot during the night and in the morning we only had cereal and a fruit juice yet they tried to charge us for two full English breakfast costing 30 The error was soon rectified though , Very friendly and helpful staff
159002,My Chelsea, Walls thin not very sound proof, Big showerhead and spacious walk in shower Bed firmness just right Location perfect for business venue also close to Kings Road whilst away from high street traffic
159003,My Chelsea, for its boutique type of hotel there was nothing that was unacceptable, great location walking distance to the Kings road restaurants friendly staff small but comfortable room
159004,My Chelsea, The room was small but still nice There was a crack or hole in the shower so ended up spilling water over the bathroom floor but once fixed there shouldn t be a problem with the room , Beautiful area quiet rooms everything is within walking distance small boutique hotel comfortable bed nice look and feel nice view from my room window very friendly and accomodating staff helped me with indicating all the main attractions on the map arranged to get food for me even after kitchen was closed and housekeeping was clean They also include an umbrella in the room which is convenient 
159005,My Chelsea, Overpriced Dated rooms that felt dirty Air con mad no difference Noisy Could hear other guests easily No bottled water in the room Poor showers Basic , Not a lot 
159006,My Chelsea, When a room turns their taps on there is a very loud humming sound Annoying but bearable Room is a little small but you expect that in London The luxury and sports cars in the area will make you feel very envious lol , Staff very friendly short walk to South Kensington tube station which meant most destinations were within 15 minutes away Lovely area with everything you need very near by 
159007,My Chelsea,No Negative, This was a great place to stay The staff are very customer focused and really make an extra effort so that your stay is truly enjoyable Couldnt recommend highly enough
159008,My Chelsea, Although a quiet location There was a little street noise late at night However I am a very light sleeper , Warm and comfy on a cold day in London Room was small but adequate I was on my own so not a problem Room freshly decorated Great location 
159009,My Chelsea, Nothing, Everything Location facilities clean and airy room coffee lovely Lions brand varieties and teapot milk and soy milk good quality linens and towels fresh Chelsea air attention for preserving enviroronment bee sanctuary on the top new experience of raw food restaurant Evening freshly made salad boxes never seen anything better healthier fresh and for 4 pounds in the hotel available in the bar with complementary cucumber infused water It was a real surprise meal after my late return from Cadogan hall Friendly and I mean it staff This hotel is designed and running with people and nature in mind Health and spa in the ground floor excellent restaurants and walks around close to several tube stations South Kensington I also walked to Sloane Square Lovely local shops and cafes to explore Recommend Finns gift shop for postcards with good old British humour and Paxton and Whitfield cheesemonger founded in 1797 Chance to talk to locals in London Chelsea physic garden is walking distance so as Michelin house and Cadogan hall 
159010,My Chelsea, Breakfast was a bit hit and miss but if you kept to the Continental breakfast it was OK , Arrived late on a Friday and upgraded to a superior room what more could you ask for Location is great for all the attractions in Chelsea and Kensington Only a 15 minute walk to the Albert Hall 
159011,My Chelsea, No restaurant available Only sandwiches and salads well a few leaves and essence of chicken Had I known that I would have booked elsewhere as I stayed alone and had to go out to get something from a restaurant Had to ask for an upgrade and pay an extra 20 as the room I was given was spartan and frankly depressing , Location 
159012,My Chelsea, Small rooms old style faucet in bathroom quite annoying and bathroom long and narrow No safe Lift wobbly TV limited and small Should be a 3 and not 4 star at best, Great location and comfortable bed Great towels Friendly staff
159013,My Chelsea, It always upsets me when the sink in the bathroom is too small and there s nowhere to put your toilet bag in the bathroom , Quiet location clean good sized room with comfortable bed and great pillows I enjoyed the breakfast too 
159014,My Chelsea, The room was not 19 m2 but very very tiny Bed was far too narrow for two 131 cm The room was equipped for one person toiletries etc There was no minibar and no safety box as promised in hotel description One of main reasons to choose this hotel was the raw food and superfood restaurant Tanya s Caf which was told to be an integral part of this hotel Disappointment was big because the restaurant was closed and nobody had informed about this Definitely not four star hotel It didn t help that the staff was very friendly and we got free breakfast You should trust that you will get what you have ordered , The hotel is good situated Staff friendly 
159015,My Chelsea, So being at the back of the hotel there s not much of a view The bathroom had water stains on the ceiling just a lick of paint and it will be like new , Location was excellent great room size 
159016,My Chelsea,No Negative, We had a suite not expensive compared to the major chains Location was perfect 5 min walk from South Kensington Tube Perfect for Kings Road Museums and the Albert Hall 
159017,My Chelsea, can t think of anything, style of the hotel more like an apartment attention to design detail in the rooms was very good and the extras like a few magazines and a complimentary umbrella you could buy all much appreciated Staff very friendly 
159018,My Chelsea, The roomsize is as often in London at the lower end of the comfortable range It would have been to small for staying with two people , Nice interiror and good breakfast 
159019,My Chelsea,No Negative, Bed very comfy room very clean relatively inexpensive hotel for where it is in the heart of South Kensington Chelsea Lots of Bars Restaurants in surrounding area in walking distance 
159020,My Chelsea, The bed was a bit too soft , Clean nice and lots of space in the room AND bathroom which is not always common in London hotels We found the room too cold and got another room at once without any problem So very helpful staff Great breakfast too 
159021,My Chelsea,No Negative, Perfect location for Chelsea and Kensington V A Natural History and Science Museums loads of restaurants nearby Superior rooms have huge beds Friendly and helpful staff Good transport links bus and tube 
159022,My Chelsea, The room was absolutely tiny The sink flooded Most of the power points didn t work The lamp didn t work It was boiling hot in the room so you woke up sweating Massively disappointing considering how much it cost , Location was excellent close to everything
159023,My Chelsea, Neither TV worked properly one control to work two TVs with no picture on one and no sound on another And the lifts were out of order , Nice room great big bed and a full size bath 
159024,My Chelsea, Typical small London city hotel micro rooms compared to most other cities Room was overheated typical for UK with central heating radiators that are not easily adjusted Open the window sleep with your headphones on and ask for a plain flat sheet instead of the duvet One lift was being repaired but at least they had a second lift down the hall No refrigerator and over priced snacks water available on a tray in the room Shower door fell off the track Toilet flush handle fell off of the pull chain all by itself , Good location Safe neighbourhood Good wifi Nice mattress ok pillows 
159025,My Chelsea, Very easily hear guests in the room next to you I was woke 2 nights in a row by people arriving and making noise at 1 am and 2 30 am , The room has everything you need 
159026,My Chelsea, Hotel under renovation so no lift few public areas open Did not know about renovation until checking in time , Hotel is quite stylish ambience good Staff very helpful friendly 
159027,My Chelsea, When you offer WIFI it should work WIFI is commodity and I don t understand why I need to connect with my phone to get my stuff done, Good size of rooms nice staff
159028,My Chelsea, Breakfast expensive and poor costs the same as at Tom s Kitchen round the corner but Toms was far superior We asked to change our very small Superior room to one with a bath fortunately this was facilitated by the friendly staff the room was a little larger which made our 3 night stay more enjoyable , Location
159029,My Chelsea, Heads up that there are about eight steps to get into the hotel WiFi erratic Reception an underwhelming stand in the cafe I arrived to witness a scene with a mildly irate guest as I was checking in I was told at one point they couldn t provide room service because they were short staffed They seemed at the end of their tether Wouldn t prevent me from staying again though , Excellent location conveniently placed between South Kensington and Sloane Square Good access to underground shops and eating places Pleasant modern nicely decorated room comfortable bed large bathroom 
159030,My Chelsea, Wifi didn t work in the room at all the TV reception was poor although it didn t really affect my stay it would others , Great location lovely breakfast nicely decorated throughout 
159031,My Chelsea, the worst nights sleep ever The plumbing was a nightmare early hours of morning banging and gurgling very loudly horrid , location bed small double but reasonably comfy
159032,My Chelsea,No Negative, We love to stay here when we are visiting London We had a smaller room compared to previous visits but it was still very good value for money Staff are always friendly
159033,My Chelsea,No Negative, We were given a lovely large room on the corner of the building This was perfect for us and our little daughter The location of the hotel is great for our visits My daughter loves the fish tank in the entrance 
159034,My Chelsea, Got in at 10 30 p m wanted a drink from the bar but no one on duty, The bed was extremely c omfortable and everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff couldn t have been more helpful or friendly
159035,My Chelsea, I didn t like the small reception area and was difficult with luggage also no safe in the room On my departure asked if they could order me a taxi which they could t do due to problem with HUB website and instead a far more expensive chauffeur driven car without telling me and didn t accept card payment Had to take it anyway because of limited time and pouring rain My room was also not ready at allocated check time Didn t think the staff were helpful or very friendly , Cosy room little but nice 
159036,My Chelsea, The bathrooms need exhaust fans The thermostat for the heating air conditioning wasn t working but they said they wouldn t do anything about it because it was part of the central system Fortunately the weather was mild so it didn t bother us too much but it will be an issue when the weather gets colder The breakfast was very disappointing They told us they had no bread because they couldn t be bothered getting it from another part of the hotel Eventually they got some but they also said the toaster wasn t working The hotel manager did cancel the charge which was appreciated , Great location The staff are particularly friendly and helpful Easy to get everywhere and a short walk from Kings Road Loved that it was quiet even with a room on the ground floor The room was clean and the staff friendly and helpful The vegan restaurant is wonderful even for people who aren t vegan like us I would recommend this hotel to others 
159037,My Chelsea, One person on the reception may keep you waiting for quite sometime serving other clients Beds are very small I think we got 130 cm as a double bed that was very uncomfortable , The location is really great and very quite great facility cleanness and friendly stuff 
159038,My Chelsea, Further than advertised to walk from Sloane Square took 15 mins, Really loved this little hotel Great location near Kings Road Loved the treats and mini bar selection 
159039,My Chelsea, door of mini bar was about to come off shower is in need of a refurb a lot of mould and no handle on the inside of the shower location wise not the best for me personally a little too far from main centre where I had a fair few appointments, friendly staff cool cafe retaurant bed very comfortable room even tho small was nice cosy bathroom nice and spacious nice quiet hotel fairly quick to Kings Street and other little streets surrounding good for travellers who want their peace and quiet
159040,My Chelsea, Parking was a nightmare 35 for 1 overnight in a car park around the corner with Hotel discount Long wait at reception each time I needed to talk to them or check in out as only ever 1 staff on , Bed and linen very nice and comfortable and all very clean and modern 
159041,My Chelsea, Aircon was not effective and bed was way too soft for me this may be me as I have always gone for a firmer mattress , Location availability at short notice quality of hotel bathroom
159042,My Chelsea, Bed could have been a bit firmer for our tastes , Nice big room high ceilings plenty space traditional but modernised style Quiet location in Chelsea with great shopping and eating options nearby 
159043,My Chelsea, Nothing , The decor was fresh and stylish the room was quiet and very clean and the bed was very comfortable There were a number of herbal tea bags offered along with the regular tea in the room a simple but very welcoming touch 
159044,My Chelsea, Small niggle but there was only one coffee bag in the tea tin Everything else was plentiful , The room was well furnished with beautifully soft carpet Bed very comfortable good choice of teas in the room Staff were polite with a friendly edge which was great Location for us was perfect near to South Kensington high street and tube station where there are many eateries 7mim stroll and near to The Royal Brompton Hospital 6 min stroll where we had an appointment The caf was very pleasantly set out and the food was very nice We will definitely be staying again 
159045,My Chelsea, Nothing, Room small but comfortable loved the decor Good location 5 10 min walk from south keningston tube to kings road 20 30 minute walk to Victoria station Good value for money will definitely stay again
159046,My Chelsea, Requires more of a restaurant Not everyone is into raw foods The rooms are very small , Quaint very clean very comfortable reasonably close to the tube 
159047,My Chelsea, Breakfast is overpriced they offer a good variety of bread fresh fruits cheese etc but still pricy knowing that there is no hot food station no omelettes or pancakes , The hotel is new rooms are spacious compared to London s tiny hotel rooms very well decorated clean the toilet is new and clean as well The bed is very comfortable sheets are clean and crispy The location is excellent 5 minutes walking from South Kensington station and few minutes by foot to Sainsbury s Starbucks and a pharmacy There are several restaurants nearby but you have you to find them as the hotel is not on the main street I would definitely stay there again 
159048,My Chelsea, No drinking glasses in room despite mini bar and no facilities to dispose of sanitary products would of liked even more competitive pricing potentially to include breakfast, Location was key and it more than met our expectations
159049,My Chelsea, A very noisy shower pump somewhere in the hotel that woke me at 5 am The shower pump in my room made a terrible racket as well We have just fitted a new shower at home and it is very easy to soundproof a pump The hotel needs to get maintenance onto it immediately , Comfortable room Excellent value for Chelsea 
159050,My Chelsea, The front steps should have a ramp alongside both for the physically challenged and to ease the movement of luggage , Excellent attitude of staff This was a return stay and I d continue to choose this property 
159051,My Chelsea, The plumbing Wow is it noisy Not only in your own room but you other peoples rooms too Perhaps it was just because we were at the top of the building there are 4 floors but really not great Also although the bed was comfortable to lie on it was small Obviously didn t have a tape measure handy but couldn t help wondering if it was even a full double , The place is spotless and nicely decorated Walls paintwork bathroom everything looked new 
159052,My Chelsea, not at all satisfied I won t book again this hotel the room was really small even if i have booked a superior room I have asked information regarding gatwick express and the staff at the concierge told me to check the web site since it was not their duty to provide information , the location is great perfect position in a wonderful area 
159053,My Chelsea,No Negative, I love the atmosphere of this place The room was pretty small but anyway I was away all day Very close to Saatchi Gallery and all the brand shops V A Museum Science Museum wonderful 
159054,My Chelsea,No Negative, Breakfast was gorgeous the staff were very helpful and welcoming The rooms were beautiful they upgraded us as it was our anniversary which was a nice surprise 
159055,My Chelsea, Air conditioning so room was very warm even with the fan very helpfully provided by staff , Bed was very comfortable and a great size and the location was excellent Staff were also very helpful and friendly 
159056,My Chelsea, Room was far too hot and air con didn t work staff gave us several fans but they made very little difference Size of room was disappointing considering that we had upgraded don t trust the pictures on the website , Nice bathroom and a clean quiet room Interesting minibar 
159057,My Chelsea, Duvet wasn t big enough didn t reach right across bed perhaps would be better to have two separate ones on such a big bed as they do in the Netherlands , Room was spacious for central London hotel also very quiet Breakfast was excellent as was the internet 
159058,My Chelsea, Bathrooms tired the shower in particular could have had the shower tray replaced and the grouting re pointed Room service menu was very limited and not overly nice sadly despite the service that accompanied it Check out was painfully slow why when at a time of day most people will have need of reception was there only one person available The whole point of checking out should be that it s swift and efficient , The location great for Kings Road and a nice walk to Chelsea Harbour Housekeeping were vey friendly smiley efficient and helpful The bed was very comfortable and the room thoughtfully lit 
159059,My Chelsea, There was air conditioning advertised Whilst the weather was uncharacteristic it was extraordinarily hot The A C didn t work and the fan replacement was disappointing We were extremely and very unpleasantly hot to the point of an earlier departure than planned Discount was given which was good but unfortunately this tainted the whole trip , Good size rooms good amenities
159060,My Chelsea, Room was tiny Shower didn t work properly Toilet didn t flush properly , Location is great As it was a Sunday evening I was able to park right outside the hotel 
159061,My Chelsea, The room was tiny It didn t worry us as we were only staying one night and were out between 15 00 hrs and 01 30 but it would have been too small for longer stay However it was still good value for money and it was a bright and comfortable room , Staff were very friendly and helpful Location perfect for us attending a wedding at Chelsea Registry office Hotel had a very nice feel to it 
159062,My Chelsea, The breakfast options were limited Also the tv didnt work in my room there were no channels saved and I couldnt figure out how to work it , The location was great I got upgraded to a suite which was amazing 
159063,My Chelsea, The room was extremely hot and the shower so tiny I could not really move, The setting and location were wonderful The incredible raw food restaurant was a real treat
159064,My Chelsea, I had been staying at this hotel almost every year since 2007 It was friendly comfortable and a quiet retreat in an area I like It was very disappointing to see this year that they have chosen to substitue good service to clients for the sake of becoming a pretentious upmarket place without the perks with rude staff and who are only interested in profit I will not be returning ,No Positive
159065,My Chelsea, would have loved a couple of electric outlets by the bed for my phone and ipod a small mirror and some tissues in the bathroom would make it perfect, perfect very quiet spot in town super restaurant Tanya s caf easy access from airport real nice and comfortable room
159066,My Chelsea, Nothing not to like , The location was fantastic walking distance to harrods the museums and many other nice spots Staff were exceptional and went out of there way to accommodate us and even upgraded us to one of their top suites We will def be returning here once again 
159067,My Chelsea, Very little to not like Maybe hotel restaurant a bit too basic and not in overall keeping with boutique theme of the hotel There is an independent organic raw restaurant internal to the hotel but opening hours were from around 11am so i rarely used, Great hotel great location If you like a more boutique orientated hotel experience in a great quiet but central location close to shops and restaurants then this is for you
159068,My Chelsea, The room was too bright in the morning Not very sound proof either Could hear word for word people s conversations in the corridor Windows only single glazed All being said these things caused us no problems but are areas that could be improved , Location excellent Was worried it d be too far out but it s great The bed was comfortable and there was a choice of firm or soft pillow Reasonably sized room we had a superior double room Air conditioning was great touch 
159069,My Chelsea, Ac was not functioning a portable Ac was provided after discussion so window shall be opened and imagine the noise from the street A very rude attitude from a staff when asking to leave the room she called at 12 reminding me about the checkout then without any other notices she came 1pm and aggressivly knocked the door and impolitely told me to get out of the room now , Location design of the room
159070,My Chelsea, On the morning of departure we entered the breakfast room at 3 minutes to 8 am and a very unfriendly lady told us to leave as breakfast service starts at 8 am, the great location
159071,My Chelsea, The hotel is a small boutique hotel and as such has few extra facilities This wasn t a problem for us as we were out and about most of the day and were looking for something quiet and comfortable which it certainly was , Excellent location in the heart of Chelsea and very quiet as in a residential area The bed was extra comfy Would definitely choose to stay here again on our next visit to London 
159072,My Chelsea, Housekeeping knocked on our door three separate times early morning of the day we were leaving felt like they were trying to get rid of us , Small but comfy and clean rooms wifi worked and everything was clean and modern Superb neighbourhood with everything within walking distance 
159073,My Chelsea, tired shower wrong blinds in Bathroom great window natural light blocked by night blinds instead of opaque daytime blinds, Great bath towels fluffy and always new
159074,My Chelsea, The d cor of the room was dated The curtains didn t do a good enough job of blocking out the light in the morning as they were poorly fitted for the windows The pillows were uncomfortable, Staff were friendly and helpful and the mattress was good
159075,My Chelsea, The first room offered had a lot of black mould in the shower We called reception who came to look said it was ok We objected and after a long wait we were moved to a new room The shower was better but still had black mould just not as much as the first The bedside lamps did not work Only one coffee bag and one milk for two guests was strange We wouldn t stay here again , Bed was comfortable Air conditioning worked well Room was quiet except for some noise when other guests were in the hallway late at night 
159076,My Chelsea, As always in London rooms are on the small side, Very comfy bed charming and helpful staff bath in the bathroom not just a shower nice bathroom products Quiet street but in walking distance of great restaurants and bars 
159077,My Chelsea, Not the greatest food A lot of health nut type of food Im more of an eggs and bacon eggs benny type of gal , Lovely room Comfortable Good area 5 10 minute walk to South Kensington tube 
159078,My Chelsea, I was disappointed that the original restaurant was no more It was a real haven for me on my first visit but the buffet breakfast and all day snack bar now just didn t cut it for me compared to the proper restaurant of old Fortunately there are plenty of eateries nearby which I suspect caused the change to the restaurant , I just liked the welcoming staff who did everything they could for you The rooms were comfortable and cosy and the location was perfect for me 
159079,My Chelsea,No Negative, The boutique feel The room was comfortable and clean The dining kitchen was a nice mix of tables settees armchairs Lovely art on the walls that reflected the fact that there is a bee sanctuary on the roof 
159080,My Chelsea, the hotel is comfortable and we recognise that it is in an expensive area of London and our stay was at a weekend but we felt the rate charged was rather over the top for what was offered especially as it cost an extra 15 pp for breakfast, convenient location for our family party the flexibility of breakfast room lounge area to sit in for extended breakfast quality of breakfast good with a good choice of food
159081,My Chelsea, Poor Wifi in room needed to be in reception to log on No blind in the bathroom Sliding door jutted out at the floor meaning even with the door closed you could see the person in the bathroom moving about in the mirror on the room door rather strange, Nice room Comfortable bed
159082,My Chelsea, Our room was on the first floor by the little outdoor seating area and each morning it was quite noisy when they started moving tables and chairs Also this room seemed very dark and dated compared to others Howevet the bed was quite comfy , Location was great and the staff was awesome They were very helpful in booking tours and helping book a ride to catch National Express at Victoria Station so we didn t have to walk The price was very reasonable too Very close walking distance to just about everything in Central London 
159083,My Chelsea,No Negative, A beautiful boutique hotel with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff It is in a quiet beautiful neighborhood with a short walk to the tube We loved it 
159084,My Chelsea, Room absolutely tiny few room amenities such as iron ironing board Little choice for food room service following late check in Breakfast started too late for my early exit for work , Great location friendly staff
159085,My Chelsea, Every floor had muddy footprints due to renovation work, Complimentary mimi bar and free access to my kitchen because we were in a suite Extremely helpful and friendly staff
159086,My Chelsea, The price was a bit high considering no breakfast was included The restaurant only catered for vegetarians really and being a meat eater the restaurant was not suitable and prices were high for fancy vegetables , For our need the hotel was in a perfect location 
159087,My Chelsea, Staff should know the grade of disability access We needed wheelchair access without any steps up or down We did not stay at the hotel and booked another which had no steps and had full wheelchair access , The staff made every effort to accommodate a wheelchair user but the access was not wheelchair friendly My husband cannot manage even one step and this was a high step to manage Chair lift only had one arm rest 
159088,My Chelsea, None I can think of , Hotel is in a nice and quiet area with a lot of nice shops around The nearest tube station is South Kensington Nice room and good value for the price I paid o7
159089,My Chelsea, Breakfast too expensive for us But plenty of places to eat elsewhere , Perfect for a short break in London Convenient for sightseeing but don t expect any cheap shopping 
159090,My Chelsea, We did have a small room this time but as only for one night not a problem , Location is perfect and good value for money We always try here first if we can 
159091,My Chelsea, In the room there was no wardope and no any cupboard Imagine , I like hotel location But the worst thing there is no wardrope in the room I had to hang all my clothes one hanger It was teribble disaster for Such a 4 stars hotel 
159092,My Chelsea,No Negative, A lively hotel in a quite residential area yet 10 minutes walk from the museum areas The small village area just south was a delight with restarts cafes and regular shops If a little tired the 360 bus stops 50m away and takes you directly to the Albert Hall I would fully recommend this hotel 
159093,My Chelsea, Little disappointed in the room looked a bit dated tv had problems with signal doors a bit stiff in the bathroom shower, Good location nice hotel with appearance exterior and interior
159094,My Chelsea, There was constant very loud noise until about 10pm from the restaurant and then there were strange loud noises like someone dragging furniture across the floor for about half an hour until about 11pm At 1am a group of people were standing outside my door discussing where my room was and I thought they were about to let themselves in All in all a very unsettled night , The room was very small but otherwise well appointed There was a good array of things in the mini bar The bed was comfortable and the shower facilities were good The restaurant is really excellent with very friendly staff and great food if you re a vegan 
159095,My Chelsea, Rooms very small even a superior double as we were upgraded In room 32 I had a superior double but the bed was two singles pushed together with two totally different sized mattresses TV signal in room 34 didn t worknow and tiny room Room 33 damp and shower damp mini fridge cool if that and pool of water at the bottom end and the room smelt of cigarette smoke again meant to be a superior double but really very small I would say more like a 3 start hotel Oh I could literally hear everything in the next door as if they were in my room with me , Lovely friendly staff and Great location is the best thing about the hotel 
159096,My Chelsea, Mattress sagged in middle TV not working Wifi connection problem No ironing facilities in room , Location Reasonable price Windows opened good room temp control Staff comp d two drinks due to problems with TV and wifi connection 
159097,My Chelsea, The rooms are a bit small however we didn t spend a lot of time in the room as there s so much to do , I love the bed it was amazing The hotel is so central it s great Bath room is beautiful very powerful shower too 
159098,My Chelsea, Nothing major We chose to eat out for Breakfast good locations nearby , We upgraded our room as offeed by the hotel result was an excellent and quiet room with a large bed Surprisingly spacious for London Staff very helpful 
159099,My Chelsea, Could not work out how to use the bedside lights gave up and couldn t be bothered to call reception An quick reference instruction paper left on bedside table would be so handy for basic room operation , CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN Room and bathroom v clean Air conditioning brilliant Bed super comfy Great pillows and enough of them
159100,My Chelsea, Pillows not great feel very foamy Wobbly coffee table and room looked a little bit tired including shower unit , Fantastic location and very friendly staff 
159101,My Chelsea,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming on check in check in was smooth and quick Enjoyed the Eat Raw restaurant Room was comfortable and housekeeping discreet Mini Bar was replenished daily 
159102,My Chelsea, LET S IMPROVE ON THE BREAKFAST QUALITY OF THE BACON AND SCRAMBLED EGGS VERY AVERAGE JUICE TEA GOOD, THE LOUNGE AREA ONCE AGAIN VERY HOMELY 
159103,My Chelsea,No Negative, Had my breakfast in my Room chosen from the little cafe expertly brought up and cheerful service Helpful on reception and very fresh food in the restaurant and helpful service 
159104,My Chelsea, Asked for early check in as we were going to twickenham to watch the rugby and wanted to get changed they said no asked for a first floor room given a ground floor room Room was dark and dingy bed was ok and sheets were nice and clean Bathroom was incredible basic Cold water tap didn t work at all on the bath so scalded ourselves in the boiling water Loo didn t always flush first time Wouldn t return, Location
159105,My Chelsea, 1 I asked for a quiet room and was giving one downstairs Unfortunately there seemed to be work above so there was drilling early evening and morning 2 After booking I was offered an upgrade to a deluxe room for 17 This sounded good value as deluxe rooms included breakfast On arrival I was told it was only the room that you paid for I felt I had been misled and would never have upgraded had this been clear , The location was good in a quiet street The staff were helpful It had a relaxing feel 
159106,My Chelsea,No Negative, It was the 1st Time we use this Hotel in The area and it was an excellent exp rience The staff was very helpful We were Also upgraded to a bigger room There is also a bio restaurant on the ground floor which is very practical 
159107,My Chelsea, Nothing It was my 3rd visit in 6 months sometimes in a group and I m back again with a group of 6 people for a night , Very comfy homely Chilled with a very relaxing ambience The small bar with the open fire is almost like being at home 
159108,My Chelsea, Hadn t twigged that breakfast was extra The room was a bit small for a longer stay but well put together , Excellent place for an overnight stay Absolutely spotless with comfortable bed Convenient for lots of places and the tubes I hadn t realised that breakfast was extra and a whopping 15 each Luckily we hadn t booked this as we were still full from dinner the night before Lots of lovely breakfast cafes near the station though We d definitely book here again 
159109,My Chelsea, Noise woken 3 nights I stayed 0nce at 3 30am by call from reception in error Fridge in bedroom did not work and reported 3 days in row Internet in bedroom terrible No reception Front room over main entrance and I asked for quiet room as it was work trip , Staff location Clean towels and linen but bathroom needs face paint 
159110,My Chelsea, The mattress seemed to have quite a sag in the middle There was no storage just three hooks on the wall It was all a bit too pink and purple and a little bit faded around the edges , We asked for a quiet room and received one
159111,My Chelsea,No Negative, Great location Easy access to underground station Nice room for the price Very clean They also let us store our bags for 24 hours free of charge while we made an excursion to Cambridge Would definitely stay here again Excellent find in London 
159112,My Chelsea, Nothing, Friendly and helpfull staff relaxing atmosphere cute room great bed The raw restaurant looked amazing but we didn t have the chance to eat here
159113,My Chelsea, Overhead light didn t work and staff could not locate the switch for it Property could use some sound proofing as the neighbors have barking dogs all through the night and there is road noise Staff wasn t particularly friendly or welcoming and didn t really share any of the amenities available to guests , Cute and modern close to the tube and great shopping safe area clean room and updated bathroom with great rain shower I loved the dairy free vegan touches to be eco friendly 
159114,My Chelsea, The wireless internet connection in the room was terrible This should be fixed We need internet as much as food now , Good value for your money Nice location close to transportation 
159115,My Chelsea, The shower head was broke and so we couldn t have a proper shower until maintenance fixed it No robes or slippers in our superior room , Perfect location with shops restaurants and tubes located within walking distance The hotel room was clean and perfect for a young couple
159116,My Chelsea, The room was a little too warm but the staff provided a fan which was perfect I d recommend going out for breakfast The hotel s breakfast isn t great But there are plenty of options close by , The location is great Very quiet in an area that has lots of great cafes and restaurants that are frequented by locals Close to both Kings Rd and Brompton Rd The size of the room and bed were really good nice and big Also very clean and the staff are so friendly 
159117,My Chelsea, The blocked bathroom sink which they couldn t repair while I was out and I was too tired to start all over again when I got back , Not a bad location friendly staff 
159118,My Chelsea, room very very tired looking and noisy being on the front had asked for quiet room one f b outlet not open on a Monday if other rooms better decorated and furnished would consider staying again No english breakfast tea in tea selection so we went out for a drink as did not want full breakfast, location great and managed to park very close by too easy walk to Sth ken tube and Albert Hall bed was quite comfy 
159119,My Chelsea, The staff were terrible Barely spoke in English Tanya s kitchen terrible service and uncomfortable being sat so close to other people when trying to talk privately, Decor location vibe 
159120,My Chelsea, Lights were dim in bedroom You had to pay for all tea coffee and extras in bedroom A fair walk from tube, Modern looking clean tidy and very reasonable price wise
159121,My Chelsea, Only comment to make is that check out in the morning was slow but I believe this member of staff was fairly new to the role He was very polite though and helpful in arranging a taxi for our gropup , Lovely little boutique hotel with friendly staff good food and comfortable clean rooms Good location 
159122,My Chelsea, Had to wait 15 minutes for an iron to be brought up to my room despite being told that there should already be one in there Had to chase it 3 times too , Big room nice breakfast good value
159123,My Chelsea,No Negative, Quiet location and mini bar stocked with healthy snacks and non acoholic drinks I had to get up and out and didn t have time for breakfast so it was good to be able to grab a cereal bar 
159124,My Chelsea, I d stayed a week but they still couldn t let me have a later check out on the day i left This would have made the difference of a couple of hours And I was sick with flu , Comfy bed Friendly staff Great location Quiet 
159125,My Chelsea, room much too warm air con however too cold very dark room and uncomfortable bed caused by the design which is narrowing the open space on the heading section overpriced which is in line with most of London , superb Location in SW
159126,My Chelsea, Be careful with booking breakfast I had booked 15 per person breakfast which they had no record of on arrival but when I showed them my confirmation they agreed I should have had breakfast included The next day when we went down for breakfast they wanted to charge us for it and again I had to explain that I had already payed for breakfast which was a bit annoying but the staff were very friendly when sorting it out, The rooms we booked were very nice large though I think they might have upgraded the rooms for us
159127,My Chelsea, Reception smells like an Indian restaurant Carpets need replacing Wifi didn t work for me , Good location safe clean quiet Very friendly and helpful staff Nice restaurant 
159128,My Chelsea, Expensive bar 11 for two bottles of beer May have been organic and gluten free but no other choices available, Spotlessly clean Very pleasant staff Comfy beds nice hot shower quiet during the night so we slept very well 
159129,My Chelsea, Had booked a double room and expected a double bed but on arrival discovered two single beds pushed together , Very comfortable bed room very clean and staff very helpful 
159130,My Chelsea, There was no lift the staff didn t know the area they would call me back with info and they didn T Shame the healthy restaurant in the hotel only served breakfast from 9am , The location was good for me 
159131,My Chelsea, Elevator did not work Rooms are small but this was not a disadvantage for me The available space at floor level compensates, Great location Spacious and enjoyable room to have a coffee breakfast or dinner Friendly personnel
159132,My Chelsea, The interior is no good pink The staff is indifferent Not very smiling , The location is perfect Close to Underground St Close to restaurants Small hotel 
159133,My Chelsea,No Negative, I loved The hotel Even if i got room on ground floor its size design quality And comfort Made up for it Very friendly staff Unusual restaurant with great raw Vegan food and cocktails with superfoods added Very friendly price polisy for solo taveller the price for one person was approx 40 less for the same room 
159134,My Chelsea, WI FI was a disaster every 5 minutes the network disappeared I stayed 3 nights and it was always the same to use internet had to go to the lobby The location even though is not bad is not very convenient , The hotel is very nice the room we got was really cool The staff was very helpful 
159135,My Chelsea, Some might prefer a big breakfast buffer whilst this hotel offer breakfast as per order Room on the small side yet its London so acceptable , Very friendly staff and superb quieter location As I prefer small and quieter hotel this is a good choice 
159136,My Chelsea,No Negative, The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way for anything I needed Room was quiet and clean It felt like home versus those monster hotels I usually need to stay at 
159137,My Chelsea, I booked in for two night When I checked in I was allocated room 6 which is situated on the ground floor behind the bar I checked in at 4pm and entered room 6 and found the room to be very small with the majority of floor space taken by the double bed As the room was situated behind the bar the noise from the bar was horrendous and there was no way I could relax after my 4 hour journey to London After contacting reception I was allocated room 44 for the second night this room was OK but had been recently decorated and therefore had a strong smell of paint which was unpleasant , Location is great
159138,My Chelsea, Expensive but then that s London prices The tea and coffee in the room were both terrible Not that they are ever good but this was worse than normal , Good location walking distance to South Kensington Station Chelsea museums Clean and comfy facilities boutique hotel style 
159139,My Chelsea,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff The hotel is in quiet area a short walk from shops and stations The raw food restaurant is great as was the food from room service The room was clean and comfortable 
159140,My Chelsea, Lift out of action and we were on 4th floor but couldnt be helped check in was an hour and a half late due to late check outs by customers and had to ask for a free drink for the inconvenience but apologies were offered by staff, It was in an ideal quiet location midway between kings rd and south kensington station the room was spacious with a lovely powerful shower and lots of toiletries had plugs near mirrors which i always usually moan at because u cant blowdry ur hair properly staff helpful

159142,My Chelsea, Leaving , I have been staying at my hotel Chelsea on and off for 12 years and it is perfect everytime it seems to be better and better if that is possible see you very soon Dr N LEWIS 
159143,My Chelsea, The booking form stated a complimentary mini bar was included but although I only had one beer and pointed out the description clearly shown on the booking form there was no attempt to offer this There was also confusion over the room number and name which was unhelpful and slightly annoying , Great location and a good breakfast Bright and cheery decor 
159144,My Chelsea, wasn t a twin bedroom available although i had especially requested it and called hotel twice about it so had to share a bed with my sister slept badly, location
159145,My Chelsea, We requested an early check in but none of the rooms were ready However we went back an hour later still early and our room was ready It was a little further away from the station than we thought but still not very far The shower was not powerful at all and this was the biggest negative really , The bed was very comfortable and the decor of the room and hotel in general was very nice There was a good range of toiletries hot drinks and they even had things such as slippers vanity kit dental kit shaving kit and a little pad and pen which I thought were nice touches There was also a very tastefully stocked minibar which was quite reasonably priced 
159146,My Chelsea, The hotel restaurant where breakfast is served was not very organised no English mustard to eat with breakfast sausages Come on Also the barman does not know how to mk a decent dry martini and they did not hv martini glasses , Location comfort spacious bathroom I had the blue suite great bathroom ameneties
