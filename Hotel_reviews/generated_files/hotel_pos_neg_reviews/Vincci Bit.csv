352164,Vincci Bit, Note that the hotel is on the outskirts of the city You can take the L4 metro 20 min to the city center , Modern hotel with well designed rooms that are different from your standard 4 start hotel Great shower and comfortable bed Nice detail all floors have a different design The rooftop bar is an excellent place to have a drink in the evening It s a 1km walk to the beach and the hotel will provide you with towels There is also a shopping mall close by where you can get your Starbucks in the morning or go to one of the bakery s in the neighborhood for a more authentic breakfast 
352165,Vincci Bit, The only minor negative point is the key card didn t always work however a thank you to the lovely maintenance man who I diverted from fixing a safe in another room also the duty manager who also sorted out access on a couple of occasions , I was in Barcelona to celebrate the birth on my first Granddaughter who was born in a local hospital and is now living in the area Eva enjoyed her first dinner at 5 days old in the hotel roof top restaurant where the staff made her very welcome The graffiti style decoration gives the atmosphere of a boutique hotel which is very appropriate to such a beautiful city The hotel had clearly read the comments I made when I booked which I appreciated The discreet manner in which the roof top restaurant staff dealt with a guest who had clearly had too much too drink 
352166,Vincci Bit, Really minor things that did not had an impact on the amazing time we had there Sunbeds by the pool were changed and the new ones are no longer reclinable Eventhough the staff is amazing one particular member does not seem to fit in when it comes to the amazing customer service everyone else provides This is Kristina that was on the breakfast area one of the days Not particularly friendly makes you feel that even if you ask for an extra napkin that is a hassle on your way out says a very dry Bye while everyone else is lovely and makes you feel welcome The hotel is starting to show small signs of wear and tear but can imagine that is being dealt with as for instance the sunbeds seem to have been replaced Computers were running a little slow , Spotless clean room Confortable big bed and pillows Amazing staff Great buffet breakfast Lovely decoration different in each floor Free wifi Free to use computers Swimming pool Free cold water close to reception on peak of heat Location close to the beach tube and shopping centre with food clothes shops hypermarket cinema and gaming zone 
352167,Vincci Bit, We couldn t manage change into a one big bed room and sleeping together all the time someone fell in between the beds , Everything was perfect but after check out we can t find a pair of ladies shoes in our bag 
352168,Vincci Bit, if you want to be close to the beach this hotel is situated really close to the beaches but if you want to go to the city centre around the Ramble area you need to walk 40 minutes or catch a cab , The room was spacious and very clean The bed was comfortable and wifi was great Coffee in the room was available Bathroom was very clean Roof terrace was great pool also available Lunch and dinner on the terrace was very good Department stores and restaurants close by 
352169,Vincci Bit, The gym is so small Only three machines running cycling and another one In order to access to the gym you need an additional card from the reception which was annoying The pool was really small Dont be fooled by the picture , The room the design clean and the lighting The breakfast is good 
352170,Vincci Bit, The stuff was veeeery slow the elivator always don t want to see my card and I spend always 5 minutes inside to make it go up really not very logical system Swimming pool is lovely but so small looks more like a bath , The location is just perfect 10 minutes of walk to get to the nearest beach calm area clean and lovely rooms good WiFi connection 
352171,Vincci Bit, They don t change the duvets there are no duvet covers so the room smelled like BO despite the cleanings The chicken at the restaurant was under cooked and full of connective tissue Sunday night I asked the receptionist the rate for the following night and he stated 130 which was close to what I paid previously The following morning the new receptionist tried to charge me 181 They conveniently could not reach the other receptionist by phone They were rude and insisted it was my fault for not getting a printed confirmation why would I would assume a 4 star hotel would be dishonest about something like that , Location was close to the beach 
352172,Vincci Bit, There are not many good eating options near the hotel except for the mall , The location of the hotel is near the diagonal forum mall and few eateries are available around it the beach is at a walking distance from the mall which is what I wanted The staff is friendly The metro station is at a walking distance and 15 minutes away from the sagradia familia
352173,Vincci Bit, Card had to exchange often because it did not work any more , Great roof terrace including the bar wunderful DJ Night at thursdays and delicicious breakfast 
352174,Vincci Bit, All was good sorry , Every thing is perfect My favorite place to stay in Barcelona This was the second time and I intend to continue using in the future
352175,Vincci Bit,No Negative, It s my 3rd time at Vincci Bit hotel everything was perfect comfortable beds and pillows Especially I want to highlight the curtains with blackout it s really dark 
352176,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Easy to find using public transport Close 10 minute walk to the beach Quiet area and short metro trip to the busier areas Would definitely recommend 
352177,Vincci Bit, swimming pool could have been bigger but it is also nice that it is there , Good location of the hotel in reasonable distance from the centre close to Diagonal Mar shopping centre and the beach close to the metro station taking you to the main stations in the city very nice decoration of the hotel for urban art lovers and great service was possible to leave the luggage at the hotel for some hours when I went to visit the city 
352178,Vincci Bit, Make sure to be early for breakfast sometimes it can get a bit crowded , This place was amazing the decoration is beautiful and the bed is incredibly comfortable You won t need to eat much after that huge breakfast 
352179,Vincci Bit, A nice enough hotel but by far not good enough for that price 200 night during our stay not worthy of 4 stars and I would expect to pay 100 120 night maximun for what it was ,No Positive
352180,Vincci Bit, Poor breakfast not 4 star Noise outside in the room I stayed corner to the road Traffic starts at 5 a m , Close to big shopping mall Diagonal mar with lots of shops and cafes Cafes are working even on Sunday you don t have to spend time to find food just 400m to the beach this part of beach even on Holiday is not so busy Very good underground parking not expensive for Barcelona Bright and clean room Very close to Underground station just 4 stops to City centre In this area No tourists around 
352181,Vincci Bit, It was expensive June , Good food service Very friendly helpful staff Room was very clean good size Handy location for Convention Centre 
352182,Vincci Bit, Every night around 23 30 they received supplies right under my room window and that made a lot of noise that went on for half an hour , Friendly staff good location that is close to the beach diagonal mall and metro 
352183,Vincci Bit, Rather noisy airco solution was to cool the room during the day while we were away in order to have a quiet and cool nightrest Non optimal efficiency at check out We had to wait for over 20 minutes with taxidriver waiting for us because of a group of 4 people checking in , Spacious clean well equipped well sound isolated room Very good breakfast Helpful staff 
352184,Vincci Bit, Not that convenient to commute to the city centre and you may need to as there is not much around to do restaurants bars etc Great facilities but still 215 night seems quite expensive for standard double room in mid June , Design comfort cleanliness english speaking staff and very nice breakfast are among the positives of our stay Would recommend the hotel for those want to be close to the beach 10 min walk though visiting the city centre might be a bit of a hustle 
352185,Vincci Bit, TV had only 2 channels in English Russia Today and Al Jazeera would be good if they had bigger choice or English subtitles for Spanish programmes Small cupboard for clothes , Great stuff no request was ever an issue for them helpful reception great service at the pool and during the breakfast good food reasonably priced Location was close to the nice beach but further from the city centre which could be not for everyone although it is well communicated through buses metro and tram On the plus side there was also very comfortable bed and we could check in to the room in the morning straight after arrival and enjoy pool and food already 
352186,Vincci Bit, There was some problem with the shower no button to switch between the modes If you travel by metro good location but on foot it s quite tiring to get So if you re in the city center and left something in the hotel you ll not go back to take it , The beds are really comfortable very cool after a long journey Everything s good about the room cozy and relaxing 
352187,Vincci Bit, Reception staff unhelpful and quite rude Bar very poorly stocked with poorly trained staff expensive paid 35 00 for 2 whiskey s Rooms quite small so little space for luggage Pool and deck area at the top of the hotel small with limited sun loungers for guests and bar closed even though summer and mid afternoon Hotel more for business guests than tourists leisure guests and a long way from main attractions city centre and good restaurants On last night requested breakfast box for a 0600 departure as breakfast paid in advance and take away offered as a replacement upon check in only to be told that the kitchen closed and unable to meet our request despite people still eating in restaurant and only 2200 hrs After complaining told that a box would be provided upon check out The following morning our breakfast consisted of a pre packed unappetising cheese and ham sandwich apple and small bottled processed orange juice which we left in disgust Surely a pastry coffee and or fresh juice wouldn t have been too difficult to source at 0600 Finally we were advised that an airport shuttle provided by the Hotel would be cheaper and more reliable than a taxi despite having arrived by taxi at 0100 easily and comfortably for around 30 We accepted their recommendation which ended up costing 35 the car arrived almost 15 minutes late making us stressed late for check in and gave us no time for breakfast , Beds very comfortable and good breakfast
352188,Vincci Bit, We stayed here while attending the Primavera Sound festival which is a ten minute walk from Hotel Vincci Bit While it s a handy location for revellers at the festival or business people visiting the Parc del Forum at other times of the year it s a bit too far out for enjoying the city centre The airport can be reached by taking the metro to El Clot where you then get a train Or get a taxi 40 The local area is a little bit run down and is residential it has a few basic caf s but no bars or restaurants Having said that two metro lines are on the doorstep as is the tram and journeys to Catalunya top of the main shopping street Las Ramblas or Jaume I heart of the bustling Raval area take about 15 minutes You can walk along Avinguda Diagonal up to Glories in about 40 minutes where several museums and the beginning of the city centre can be found It s a nice broad tree lined avenue , Excellent standard of service from the various staff members pristine rooms with comfortable bedding efficient air conditioning and large well equipped bathrooms with a lovely waterfall shower The hotel concierge allows you to leave your luggage if you have a lot of time between checking out and departing for the airport 
352189,Vincci Bit, Beds My partner and I had to sleep on 2 single beds with a gap of 0 5 metre on first 2 nights out of 4 no iron noisy when people walk on the timber floor, Location Near a good beach and shopping centre
352190,Vincci Bit, The hotel has got worse over the years Some staff are rude They now charge an extra 3 euros for each time you order room service We did not feel we were treated well they did not know we are regular customers and it was our honeymoon and they did not recognise that When we checked in we told them again and all they did was look at my ring I guess to confirm I was telling the truth and say congratulations This will be our last stay here They charge to much for what you get , We have stayed here many times and we like the rooms Some staff a really good Location is a short metro ride away from central barcelona 
352191,Vincci Bit, A little bit noisy sometimes need to improve acoustic isolation , One of the best options for those who want to spend a week or two in Barcelona Good price quality ratio comfort stylish and well functioning hotel Service was good enough for 4 stars We chose this hotel instead of apartment rent based on location not so far from historical places in city but not in the center the sea beach is 10 minutes by walking price if exclude breakfast then the price becomes reasonable booking com placed voting looked through a bunch of photos and read several opinions expressed by totally different types of travellers we realized that it should be really nice and comfort place Next time in Barcelona we ll book the same Hotel 
352192,Vincci Bit, Billed me twice Waiting for refund more than 30 days Smells in corridor and after cleaning in room some chemical or acid but feels like cats pee There was a table in room not big but enough for work I moved it close to window for work but every day they put it back while cleaning I dont understand for what reason , Good location with good parking Big room Value for money 
352193,Vincci Bit, Pillows were very soft and unsupportive there was a lot of noise overnight I could hear people clearly going in and out of the room next door and maybe the lift room on 2nd floor near lift with a party door joining to next room which was locked but why was I put in this room as a single traveller , Staff bathroom free parking outside cleanliness
352194,Vincci Bit, elevator is a nightmare is supposed to work with your room card but doesn t always no desk to work on lighting not well connected some lights don t switch off with the off botton next to the bed very expensive bar some staff not serviceable group discount already negotiated not applied, decoration climatization
352195,Vincci Bit, Our room was quite noisy During the night because of the wooden floor when your neighbour is walking in shoes and with open windows is also hard to sleep because of the traffic , The location is quite good in case you not prefer to sleep next to the very noisy and crowded citycenter We rented a scooter and it was very easy to moove to everywhere The Metro is 5 minutes by walk and 3 minutes you find a very big shoping center with many restaurant The beach is also 10 minutes by walk Breakfast is expensive but you find enough food to eat and they cook quite good it was easier to take a breakfast and start our day In the surrounding you find many other opportunity to get food Coffe is horrible But all other thing are ok 
352196,Vincci Bit, All good nothing I didn t like, Big rooms very comfortable beds modern design great wifi aircondition close to the seafront 10mins walk very friendly staff 
352197,Vincci Bit, On a few occasions we needed ice for the room and they insisted on charging 3 euros for about 5 ice cubes This was annoying, The location was amazing Call near by and all public transport on the doorstep 
352198,Vincci Bit, It is easy to access to the bus or metro but takes time to reach the city center , Staff very helpful The hotel decoration the breakfast room is very comfortable and all the walls artisticly decorated Very reach breakfast worth for price The room was big very clean well furnished very comfortable bathroom is great You have everything what you need 
352199,Vincci Bit, Far from center and airport Far from Metro 15min There is nothing in the surrounding except a shopping center Operating the elevator needs your card key all the time they should find a better way , Cleanliness Good breakfast 
352200,Vincci Bit, Rooms are not sound proofed and it gets really loud Despite being on a higher floor we could still hear people talking on the street It also was quite loud when guests above walked through their room wearing heels The cleaning staff did not help getting some rest as they kept slamming doors and furniture throughout the rooms really badly from the beginning of their shift in the morning Despite the racket though they avoided doing the bed properly some days and just tucked in the sheets leaving the filling exposed We would not have minded this so much if we had not suffered from them being so loud , Friendly staff and spaceous clean rooms Nice lounge terrace Public transportation to city center is nearby We enjoyed a lot having an excellent view from our window to the constantly changing street art exhibit across the street 
352201,Vincci Bit,No Negative, It s my second stay in the hotel it has big comfortable rooms very good shower everything is clean and smells nice The breakfast is great The location is bit far from the center but it s 5 minute walk from metro station Great hotel 
352202,Vincci Bit, If you don t like long beach walks to downtown Barcelona or prefer more authentic and lively neighborhoods do not chose this location as you would have to use cabs or long public transport rides to reach the center of Barcelona Nothing important but I was given a token for a free drink upon arrival to be used when ordering food only I forgot to use it at night when I had dinner at the inside restaurant bar the day I was leaving when I got back in the afternoon to pick up my stored luggage to leave for the airport I was very thirsty and asked if I could get water in exchange for the free drink and presented the token at the inside bar but the free drink token was bluntly refused because I did not order food with it at that moment After a four day stay and dinners on site and coming straight from travelling in Asia where culture service are very generous it just seemed pretty cheap to me , Oh my god the breakfast was A M A Z I N G Also appreciate the little outdoors space for breakfast and the coziness of the inside restaurant bar The rooms although a bit too artificial in style and quality were very cozy and functional The location is nice if you like taking very long walks along the beaches to reach downtown Barcelona and if you like modern lifeless neighbourhoods Close to beach close to Diagonal Mar shopping mall 
352203,Vincci Bit, I was tiring to find a place in the hotel to make a business call and they didn t had any place the personal didn t gave me any solution I was there with my partner and we ask for a doble room and the bed had a division and it was very uncomfortable , I like the decoration of the hotel the room and the bathroom 
352204,Vincci Bit, The hotel is situated slightly outside the city centre however there is a direct metro into the city centre and it is very close to the beach, Nice clean hotel
352205,Vincci Bit, The housekeeping woman took the key card in the room I told it at the reception and they gave us another card We had two keys we took one with us and we left one in the room When we were leaving the reception desk called a cab for us we had to pay 7 euros more than the counter mentioned just because they called him this is the first time I didn t like this I wished that such a hotel takes at least a confidential company Thanks for you feedback , Almost everything people at the reception desk wore more friendly the years before people have changed also in the restaurant they were more friendly before Rooms were very clean and very comfortable Breakfast was top Location very good tophotel for a top location the prices have although rised with 300 euros for 5 days last year I paid 492 euro this year 792 with breakfast this is very regrettable 
352206,Vincci Bit, Probably the only hotel on my EuroTrip that was worth negative comments The reception has no hospitality Probably all of them have a sly eye There was just one guy while we were checking out who was decent The others were just pathetic The room entry cards refused to work in lifts several times and the door took too long to respond , The room was awesome Superb design and awesome facilities 
352207,Vincci Bit, The internet speed was bad The location wasn t great The fitness room was poor The card system to get into the rooms lifts often failed , The bed was comfy 
352208,Vincci Bit, One of the lady staff she ignored me even though I was standing in the queue thankfully the person behind me asked her to entertain me first Otherwise everyone else were really kind and helpful , Room was excellent spacious and beautiful decor Bathroom too good 
352209,Vincci Bit, Key cards stopped working for the lift so we had to keep resetting them at reception , Hotel had a lovely atmosphere all the floors are decorated differently and our room was lovely massive bathroom and shower Just a 10 minute walk down to the beach but anywhere between half an hour to an hours walk to the city area and further 
352210,Vincci Bit, The stuff during check out gave me someone else s receipt I noticet that in train and came back to hotel I spent too much time because of that She gave me money and took it back two times ,No Positive
352211,Vincci Bit, The hotel is probably not bad but I saw there things what I didn t see my 15 year travel experience Did everyone saw that a four star hotel charge money for lending cutlery or if you want to let open your wine bottle 3 i was shocked it s like someone when you enter the hotel a security gut with his army dress is waiting on the front like a prison the management should be changed urgent I know other Vinci hotels ,No Positive
352212,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Staffs were so kind room was so cozy and comfortable to use and sleep Very clean Also not so far from the center of Barcelona if you know how to take transportation 
352213,Vincci Bit, It s taking forever for the hotel to release the prepayment back to my bank account despite them stating that they do so on a arrival , It is nice and modern Rooms are a decent size and the bathrooms are well designed Our room had a large shower which was great 
352214,Vincci Bit, You need to insert the card to go up the elevator which didn t work and was very disturbing Far from center of city, Really liked the room And nice breakfast
352215,Vincci Bit, Wi Fi is so slow that I used the 4G network The bathroom is very modern and stylish but with few lamps It is almost impossible to see much of your face in the mirror it s so dark in there The black walls don t help either Not recommened for women who need to apply make up , Very quiet at night little traffic but you can hear other guest s TV and phone calls through the walls beds comfortable and not too soft 
352216,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Reception was very helpful with all my needs The room was very high tech and exquisite The bed was also super comfy definitely coming back here again 
352217,Vincci Bit, if you are not looking for a hotel in a walking distance from the city center its great, a very nice hotel room felt super cozy great bathroom as well nice big shower
352218,Vincci Bit, no free water in a room, very cool lightning in a room good shower cabin the bed is also very soft internet is stable shopping center is really close
352219,Vincci Bit, At night I kept walking into the suitcase buffet as it was in the walkway to the bathroom, That each floor was decorated differently and the space within the room
352220,Vincci Bit, Staff, Staff was really rude unhelpful Cleaners used fifty mop in room Did not have pool that works And staff don t have good service is not near to central its 30 mins walk to centres
352221,Vincci Bit, When people wake up in the morning and pass through the corridor you hear too much noise including from next rooms walls are too thin , Nice design and colorful comfortable beds and quiet at night if you want to sleep in the sleepless town 
352222,Vincci Bit, The corridor paintings were spookey , Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were good If you want a hotel that is close to the CCIB but not to close then this hotel is for you 
352223,Vincci Bit, The other person at the lobby the 10th of february at night was very unpleasant I believe she has to work with smile it s better The room was very noisier unfortunately We didn t go at the reception because it was very late maybe 1 am , Location Cleanless Asad at the lobby is a good communicator and very pleasant 
352224,Vincci Bit, Thin walls mostly silent though remote location the TV has all the channels from around the world except anything english , The room is well equipped small wardrobe kettle bathtub safe table and chairs etc They make up rooms to perfection every day Felt warm and relaxed during five days of stay 
352225,Vincci Bit, Sewage smell in hotel room We kept the windows open even at night but it did not help We noticed that there were some undesirable type of guests in the hotel the kind of people you would not expect in a 4 star hotel No sound insolation the noise of the neighbouring rooms and those talking in the corridor would disturb your night sleep The toilet is not cleaned even if you flush for several times so you end up using toilet papers to clean it up You put the towel on the floor to be changed but when you come back you find out that they have just folded the dirty towels and put them back in the shelf , Nice staff Modern style new building Proximity to the metro the shopping centre and the beach The cleanness in general Discounted price In room coffee tea making facilities Restaurant in the hotel Modern style and cosy lobby Complete and comprehensive in room toiletries such as shower gel body lotion comb shaving blade slippers etc
352226,Vincci Bit, odd picture frame in the room , amazing coffee sachets of templo coffee along with a good selection of fresh fruits for breakfast front desk staff was very helpful in understanding the location and advising on commute beautiful sunrise visible from the room 
352227,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Great for business stay as I did but also for city travelling even if it is not straight in the center But that makes it very quite while public transport or taxi gets you to the center quickly Walking distance to the nicer beaches that are not so over crowded Great breakfast and very nice staff 
352228,Vincci Bit, Location a little of from Barcelona city center , Superfriendly and helpful staff Clean room Silent area Quite near to metro tramvia and bus buy tickets at vending machine in the metro station Walking distance to shopping center Diagonal mar and to the beach 
352229,Vincci Bit, Location is a little out of the way as it is not in the city centre itself as such It is 15 20 min by metro into the city and the station is close with regular trains so not a major issue There is a little bit of cross room noise but generally was quiet should be ok unless you are very sensitive to noise , Modern hotel with quite funky interior design etc Well priced everything is clean and tidy very friendly multilingual staff Metro station is a few hundred meters away as is the Diagonal Mar shopping centre There is a bakery 100m away with the best chorizo croissants 
352230,Vincci Bit, Lack of sound proofing in room, The hotel is good value The rooms are clean and nicely decorated They are a bit noisy as I guess there is no sound proofing and we could hear a guest shouting on her phone at 1am Apart from that it was a pleasant stay 
352231,Vincci Bit, everything was good, The staff was amazing The breakfast was full of various stuff and delicious The room was perfect and the location was good with shopping center just around the corner and the beach 5 minutes walk I felt lucky because I didn t even pay that much for 4 nights 
352232,Vincci Bit, Absent sound proofing I could hear any of the neighbours every step Having extremely noisy all night partying neighbours did not help , Cleanliness of the room 
352233,Vincci Bit, The WiFi is the only thing I didn t like here You have essentially zero privacy on this network they can monitor and store all your internet activity according to their terms and conditions and due to an unencrypted connection , The staff was very friendly and the room facilities were excellent 
352234,Vincci Bit,No Negative, The staff were super friendly explained everything clearly about the city they also provided a metro map so u can know your location and how to go to the city center 
352235,Vincci Bit, I have one small issue when it rains heavily the drips falling down are quite noisy against the window sills but I guess this is just an issue when it rains , It s very well located for the convention centre in Barcelona I was attending a convention The rooms are well appointed and decorated great shower heated mirror etc etc Each room seems to have its own character and each floor is decorated by a different artist Breakfast was good good quality coffee bread yogurt fruit and fruit juice Staff were friendly and helpful 
352236,Vincci Bit, It was impossible to take shower without making bathroom floor all wet And I mean impossible First time I thought that maybe I didn t close shower door good enough or something No later I was as careful as I could asked staff to clean the drainage so water comes out quicker and put cloth near the door Still some water on the floor There must be a leak in tiles or something like that A lady at reception crumbled my passport and had so grave accent so I thought she was speaking Spanish to me while it was English They tried to double charge my credit card after checkout though I already paid the bill and didn t answer to my e mail regarding this Though at checkout I informed them that I need to pay for mini bar usage buy the man at reception told me that I don t need to Strange To get to gym you need to get a special key at reception But honestly you shouldn t It was the smallest hotel gym I have ever seen Probably it was smaller than my room There were three aerobic machines and two or three couples of dumbbells And two kettle bells as I recall Biggest one 8 kg probably Oh and yes I came at midday to hear that my room is ready and I can check in right now For 13 euros Not that I think they must let me check in earlier but that is so petty , Well Funny decorations shopping mall with Starbucks nearby cheap That s it 
352237,Vincci Bit, There was no air conditioning the fans were blowing out hot air as it was considered winter Our room was extremely hot and we were unable to sleep on one night , Staff were excellent and very helpful 
352238,Vincci Bit, difficult to cominicate with the front desk staff most of the guests are english speakers why do they have frensh spanish only , clean seems new quiet and safe neighborhood value for money close to a large mall
352239,Vincci Bit, The price was outragious I thought it must have been because there were several big conferences going on that week and the remaining hotels doubled their prices I have stayed in Barcelona for considerably less money The location was great for me because of proximity to the office it is a 10min taxiride from the center though , The decor is quite cool with artists who decorated one floor each my room was very funky with lots of modern artworks The furniture is modern functional and bright The breakfast area and bar are very comfortable and cozy All clean and new the staff friendly and helpful 
352240,Vincci Bit, , Nice and modern hotel with friendly and polite service Pretty interiors have everything you need during stay I reccomend to check the library in coffee bar and a lovely balcony at last floor where you can rest The location isn t the best if you are first time in town not too close to all attractions But the area is calm with nice buildings around and close to the beach big shopping centre and museum blau There is also a metro station nearby L4 The price was also really attractive comparing to other hotels 
352241,Vincci Bit, A little bit far frim city center but all facilities are available in the nearby , Receptionists were good in english and cooperative soundproof rooms comfortable beds good WIFI and excellent room service 
352242,Vincci Bit, Provide a decent breakfast and water and ice are basic need provided free of cost by any hotel a limited quantity The Pool is a kids pool Gym need a Treadmill more and pressing machine , Poor Breakfast since we do not eat Pork the only dependable food was Eggs and very limited fruits It was another surprise few ice cubes are charged 3 Euros and hardly they serve it Not found a bottle of water complimentary but charged 2 Euros where a can Beer also cost the same The Gym has only 3 equipments so if engaged you have to wait half n hr minimum The rooms are spacious and clean bathrooms as well Location is good easy to access to nearby beaches and center 
352243,Vincci Bit, Value for money cold staff cold ambience our corridor full of pieces of paper glued to the walls is supposedly art but does not seems practical for cleaness Floor 1 where the toillets are and 2 parking have drawings on the walls that make it very difficult to find the right door Seems rather inappropriate for a hotel We will not return here , I made a mistake on my reservation dates unfortunately hotel was on high demand and prices where four times what I had paid for just one week later But the manager of reservations Mrs Eva was kind enough to accept our pre payment for two nights as part of payment for one single night Not sure yet this was good or bad at least she showed some flexibility unlike Anna at the reception 
352244,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Really interesting artistic decor luxurious fittings especially the room lighting The staff were unfailingly helpful and reliable The bistro food was creative and well presented There was no problem checking out and getting a taxi at 5 a m I would definitely return on a holiday visit 
352245,Vincci Bit, There was nothing to not like I think The hotel met all my expectations The value for money was good and the area is safe and convenient as well , I thought that the staff was excellent Polite great manners cheerful and extremely helpful Would most certainly repeat and I highly recommend 
352246,Vincci Bit, I waited for the 30minutes to be served at the check in desk and no apologies for keeping me waiting The room was not worth 250 pounds a night which i paid Breakfast was not good Black coloured room corridors looked very dark , The room was fairly clean room coffee making
352247,Vincci Bit, Smelled of drains in our room not nice Terrible coffee Only 2 glasses cups etc when 3 in room, Comfy chilled modern clean 3 separate beds for 3 friends
352248,Vincci Bit, In my opinion the hotel is dishonest by putting together for the same price the Twin and Double Rooms On the booking page right near near the room selection you have the possibility to pick between two options large double bed 2 single beds I chose large double bed but surprisingly or not as I have understood later when I got there the room had 2 small beds Don t think that they ve been considerate enough as to let me know prior to going up to the room Upon me calling the front desk the answer was cold and short I m sorry sir that is only a preference so it s optional for us They offered me the option to change the room for the second night of my stay conditioned that I come to the front desk in the morning before noon and let them know I said OK so again I ve compromised in spite of their uncaring attitude The second day around 10 when I got there surprise The hotel is fully booked and no large bed rooms are available I tried explaining that they have suggested we do this with just 12 hours before The only answer to all my raised issues was We re sorry we re sorry I talked to Booking which have proven to be of the slightest help in this matter also the Hotel suggested it is their fault for placing the selection of the beds there in a deceiving way Nothing could have been done I was very upset and I really believe that I was entitled to be so as even if the bed selection that was a preference why would you make me select something that you don t intent to offer at all It s like asking me if I would like some coffee and then say We re sorry we don t have any coffee Why ask in the first place Moreover my reservation together with the preference was booked AND PAID FOR with a month before my stay So in fact it s if at that time the hotel had a room which matched my requirements and preferences they were supposed to KEEP , I only stayed 2 days 
352249,Vincci Bit,No Negative, The beds and especially the pillows were very comfy Good power shower Great breakfast choice Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay there again 
352250,Vincci Bit, When booking the room I obtained a huge discount on the room price which meant that for 3 nights of accomodation for a standard double room the full price would have been 1900 Eur Instead I paid 450 eur The hotel is definitely not a 1900 eur per three nights one and 450 is a bit pricey for what you get also There are not sufficient toiletries in the bathroom housekeeping is performed even though you leave the do not disturb sign and you expressly mention you don t want your room to be cleaned they go through your stuff and the breakfast is really poor I would not go back , The decor was very nice and the air conditioning worked fine 
352251,Vincci Bit, the bin wasn t emptied in the room also the smell from bathroom problematic it took many days to free my credit card charge had to call the hotel twice after leaving too expensive for such service also mass hotel feels like a hostel a bit , nice pool and cool decor in lounge
352252,Vincci Bit, The size of the room a bit small and the location needs car and some times the price git higher, The hotel is supper clean and this was my second visit and still like it very comfortable and nice decorated rooms
352253,Vincci Bit, I would expect a cleaner room from a 4 stars hotel Moreover there was no air or a windows into the bathroom so after a shower all the room was very hot you had to turn on air conditioning to took off the condensation Even if August the room was very moist and the beach towels did not dry at night since there was no place where to hang them They gym consists in 3 tools only plus a little place where you could do some work on the floor The swimming pool is very little and only 1 meter high Not sure why but they do not provide a toilet brush in the bathroom I would not come back to this hotel as the price is not consistent with the service offered , Staff were nice and always available and helpful We had also rented bike from their supplier pretty much 13 euro per day including assistance if needed Please note that the bike person does not accept credit card so you have to get the money cash Good view of the city from the 8th floor Please note that the hotel is far away from the center of Barcelona 
352254,Vincci Bit, The MTR station is a bit far when you come back at night , The staff was very kind and helpful Cute pool sunny terrace with bar charming room designed by an artist clean and big enough for the price We recommand this hotel 
352255,Vincci Bit, That we left a bag of clothes to be washed expensive clothes mind you and was supposedly thrown away by the cleaning people Asked immediately where and why Nothing only to finally be told that there was an empty bag of chips on top of the clothes so was mistaken for trash We lost about a 1000 in clothes and the manager told us to go across the street and they d give us a 30 credit to spend My response I won t put on here but wasn t nice basically told them where they could stick their 30 Sad, Rooms and hotel nice and neat 
352256,Vincci Bit, Pool only open 11am 19 00hr which is just ridiculous considering checkout is midday and the sun doesn t set until 21hr Instead of a double bed as requested we got single beds pushed together that pushed apart and away from the wall Wasn t very romantic , The rooms were nice and modern Breakfast was good and the staff friendly 
352257,Vincci Bit, The ac in the room didn t work well Internet didn t work well The water leaked from the bathtub My friend fell twice in the morning from that The location is a little bit off although it close to diagonal mar mall which was good but apart from that I wouldn t stay there next time , The breakfast was good Design was decent 
352258,Vincci Bit,No Negative, We happened upon this hotel as our car rental drop off was across the street we really loved it Nice design comfortable and price in relation to the rest of the city was very good It is 3 minutes from a big mall if thats what you re looking for and 7 min from the beach otherwise you would need the metro to most other places of interest Worked perfectly for our quick 1 night stay 
352259,Vincci Bit, If it rains you will hear the noise sometimes , We have been there at least 5 times now and I would stay there each summer as it is close to the beach around 12 min walk and we enjoyed it each time Also there is an Alcampo Auchan and a Diagonal Mar Mall if you want a quick lunch or buy something in the room 
352260,Vincci Bit, The pool was extra small and only for dipping It was also very cold That s my only complaint , The bed was the best I ve ever tried Excellent The hotel breakfast was also incredibly good and the staff was lovely and helpful The rooms were bright and clean and the whole property has a wonderful high design feel The location at first seemed far but then you realize how close you are to the beach and the promenade That made for wonderful morning walks 
352261,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Personnel was always friendly and helpful Stylish hotel design our room was very comfortable and cute Nice location Llevant beach in 10 minutes by walk 
352262,Vincci Bit, Soundproofing in the room was poor and the room wasn t terribly big It s a long way from the centre of Barcelona , Comfortable bed large bathroom close to Diagonal Mar shopping mall and fairly close to the beach 
352263,Vincci Bit, They charged me also for the extra one night to check the availablity of my visa card And I was totally unaware of it until I saw my bank account history I think they have to let the customers know at the reception also , Very clean room Excellent breakfast
352264,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Great location if you travel with children Close to seaside and a lot of parks around Also very good if you traveling as a couple and attending Primavera festival 5 7 minutes walk to Primavera fest Breakfast is great and fairly priced Room was big and comfy Very clean Everything was great 
352265,Vincci Bit, Make sure to review the charges on checking out not sure if it was intentional or an honest mistake but my bill contained a number of items from the mini bar which I did not have to their credit they did adjust the bill to reflect reality but it was a rather begrudging adjustment , Good blackout curtains in the room 
352266,Vincci Bit, Checked out but left coat in the room Went back to retrieve it but staff said they couldn t find it even though no one had checked into the room after it had been cleaned For a four star hotel I am very disappointed as you pay a premium for a more trustworthy service ,No Positive
352267,Vincci Bit, Lack of wifi, I had the opportunity to stay in an authentic trullo house in the hills of Puglia I was taken aback by the landscape of the property Inside had all the modern creature comforts yet kept a nostalgic throwback appeal Five stars and I look forward to visiting again very soon Two thumbs way up 
352268,Vincci Bit, I had requested to stay in a room with a double mattress The room had two single beds pushed together I didn t receive the complimentary drink on arrival as stated when booked , The staff were very helpful on check in 
352269,Vincci Bit, Breakfast very poor Bar downstairs only open on Sat night rooftop not open till 10am no one serving till 11am , Nice Comfy bed Good shower very clean 
352270,Vincci Bit, Location is great for the beach but not great for visiting the town , Interesting room design Furniture and fittings looked new Breakfast was good value for money
352271,Vincci Bit, Very expensive for two nights Gym facilities open late and are poor with machines that could not be used needed to call maintenance to get them to work because something was switched off Terrace pool area opens late at 11am Lighting in bathroom not good , Breakfast was good and location very central to conference centre Staff were friendly
352272,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Nice staff rooms and breakfast but not the best location within town Close to a Shopping Mall and walking distance from the Sea but next to a not very pleasant area in town 
352273,Vincci Bit, Internet was free but a little slow and the onsite parking was a little expensive No coffee machine in room, A quirky hotel where the floors are all decorated differently Very friendly and helpful staff and clean and bright rooms Very close to a very large shopping Mall with plenty of restaurants and within easy walking distance to one of the stops of the Barcelona tour bus and the sea front 
352274,Vincci Bit, The comfort of the room More space for clothes Better lighting in the bathroom We had a connecting room with very noisy neighbors , The staff the breakfasts decoration 
352275,Vincci Bit, Breakfast a little pricey , Staff excellent room very good value pool small but nice to cool off in only downside was it was quite a way in to the tourist attractions not walkable 
352276,Vincci Bit, The wifi both free and premium wifi were slower than 3G I wouldn t call that a wifi at all , I was looking for a close place to Parc del Forum and this hotel was perfect for that But for those who want to see the city this hotel is not close to city centre The breakfast menu is good 
352277,Vincci Bit, You could hear the rain outside pretty loud , The hotel is really good with nice and wellcoming personnel The rooms are big and clean and the bed very comfortable The hotel is close to the metro and tram and also to the beach aprox 15 min walking without being in a hurry We have stayed here for a week and we would definately come back anytime The price is a bit high but if you search for some offers and promotions then its really worth every cent 
352278,Vincci Bit, Staff were not too helpful with some things They didn t book is a taxi and forgot the alarm call Quite friendly though , Comfy room and good breakfast
352279,Vincci Bit, We booked room for 2 nights after first night we went to town to do our business and when we come back at 4pm We found out our room was not clean and we had to go for a meeting at 6pm and we had no clean towels for take shower We called at reception and the lady said they cleaning time is untill 5pm I t was really a bad reply in a bad way of talking Later we call again and ask to talk some one superior then 2 ladies come with cleaning staff and we wrote a complaint form and they said that hotel authorites will contact with us by email or phone but till today no reply from them The hotel staff said that their priority is clean room first for new customers who is going to check in for us it was really a bad excuse that mean they just care for new customers to have money and they do not care of old customers who already in the hotel ,No Positive
352280,Vincci Bit, It was super far from most places 15 20 cab each time Food in the restaurant had a lot to be desired , Rooms were clean and tidy bed was huge 
352281,Vincci Bit, Location is a bit dull and isolated , Very clean interesting and different d cor style great staff and the food was above average for a hotel like this 
352282,Vincci Bit, I have booked for 3 days but everyday the breakfast is the same wi Fi is not fast it s so far away from the citycenter no swimming pool no sauna ,No Positive
352283,Vincci Bit, Sometimes the coffee cream was missing , The room is very trendy and I was on a high floor Quietness was very important for me and the hotel ticked it perfectly 
352284,Vincci Bit, The bar were too busy to bring drinks to the roof terrace despite offering it as a service I booked a double room but should have double checked as it was actually a double or twin and the twin beds slid apart so not great for a couple The shower was weak The location is good in terms of the closeness of the beach and there was a nice beach bar at the very start of the beach but if you re looking to be more central then this is maybe not for you as it requires a taxi in out of the city centre , Very clean stylish and staff were friendly 
352285,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Excellent location close to a nice quiet beach and great place to go running Convenient for metro and tram and could get to all the main tourist sites easily
352286,Vincci Bit, Other doors closing in the hallway was fairly loud sometimes but not a big deal except on weekends , Rooms were very nice Yolanda gave an amazing massage 
352287,Vincci Bit, Nothing, The rooms are a great size and the bed was very comfortable Located about a 2 min walk from a huge shopping centre and from Tram Metro and Bus stops although it is a little far from the city centre the transport links are so good you don t really notice I didn t try the breakfast so i couldn t say on that 
352288,Vincci Bit, Location is a bit far from the center without car charge for delivering ice to the room and breakfast cost 15 euro , Nice hotel super clean will designed spacious room fast internet nice smell with safe parking Close to the mall 
352289,Vincci Bit, Also when i reserved and also at the reception i ve asked for a double large bed They said they dont have and gave me twin beds The hotel was almost empty so the only explanation is that they just dont care , the terrace on the 8th Floor 
352290,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Very cute hotel helpful staff good Wi Fi very comfortable big bed spacious room and modern bathroom Overall great value for money especially for Barcelona 
352291,Vincci Bit, Far from the main attractions and downtown , I liked the service that was provided The rooms where clean and the hotel was very close to the metro Excellent WIFI 
352292,Vincci Bit, A bit out of the way of the centre shops nightlife etc but once you figure out the trams metro its not too bad , Everything was excellent Staff cleanliness lovely hotel 
352293,Vincci Bit, Location may not be perfect for public transportation I drove a car No problem in the garage 14 night, I stayed for 3 nights and it was great experience My room was very clean and all staff were helpful 
352294,Vincci Bit, The walls were very thin and we could hear our neighbour coming leaving and using the bathroom The wifi connection was VERY poor We were only on the second floor and if we both tried to use our smart phones it stopped working , The room was as pictured very modern fun and funky Great bathroom with a rain shower head and very spacious 
352295,Vincci Bit, Location as its a bit hard to find and when you ask people for directions they did not know where the hotel was They need to advertised the hotel more so it s easy for people to find , The bathroom was lovely and clean and the shower room and shower was amazing The bedroom was cosy and warm and the bed was perfect 
352296,Vincci Bit, It was on the outskirts of tge city wasn t a problem for us as we jumped on snd off the metro but might put some people off, Was really modern and not noisy
352297,Vincci Bit, The hotel is made of cardboard You can hear your neighbours people above and below and everybody walking outside your door When it rained it sounded like nails on tin No English channels except Euronews Hotel is in run down neighbourhood in warehouse and storage area Dirty linen was reported to Vice Manager after 3 nights of no improvement ,No Positive
352298,Vincci Bit, location was not a good far from plaza de catalunya although hotel was near metro and tram station from hotel to plaza de catalunya takes 20 30 minutes by metro , clean and comfortable reception was kindness 
352299,Vincci Bit, No indications found on where to find the fitness sauna pool Breakfast was rather expensive but of good quality , Nice decorations hip cool to see all of a sudden that Ducati inside the hotel for a Ducati event 
352300,Vincci Bit, double bed was actually two single beds that kept sliding apart a little uncomfortable , good breakfast excellent location close to diagonal mar shopping mall and transportation
352301,Vincci Bit, We stayed for a whole week and never got fresh bed sheets The gym opening hours are ridiculous 8 to 8 , Close to beach and town a few bars around too Hotel has everything you need the art needs some getting used to 
352302,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Comfortable bed Good breakfast You may park your car free of charge on the street I was lucky and parked my car just at the hotel entrance Interesting artistic design of the hotel each level is different like mural s festival A library at the lobby with many art books I asked for a room with shower not a bathtub and it was large and comfortable Good access by car located outside center And good access to public transport Metro about 10 minutes of slow walk tram about 6 minutes and bus 2 to 10 minutes depending on the line Most of tourist places in the range of 30 50 minutes by public transport door to door including walking to from tram metro bus 
352303,Vincci Bit, It s gonna be good if lift tell about what level to go to the car parking and swimming pool and gym on top and when we go out to the parking It s difficult to see what door to go to much confusing graphic on the door When we stay cannot go to the gym because it s close , Good breakfast and have parking inside Close to shopping mall Very good design in the room 
352304,Vincci Bit, Selection of cheese at breakfast , Great hotel with great art paintings on the walls very modern and decorated nicely close to metro station and to a shopping mall supermarket and to beach In a quiet neighborhood away from the crowd Good food for breakfast 
352305,Vincci Bit, The only I have to complain is that many rooms and the aisles are smelling strong I cannot describe the smell it is something like old water in walls This need to be fixed then it is a 100 good hotel,No Positive
352306,Vincci Bit, Nothing that makes me unhappy , A new hotel with a functionally socially superb and practical facility and atmosphere Close to CCIB International Conventional Center Barcelona Close to metro which takes you Plaza Catalan in 20 minutes Travelling 1 3 of my time staying in many 4 5 star hotels and others Vincci Bit was far best experience of mine in last one year Close to the beach 
352307,Vincci Bit, El Maresme Forum Metro station L4 is about 5 8 minutes but take at least half an hour to get to as Bartseloneta , Very good conditions for the best price Elegant aesthetic hotel Each of the eight floors painted in separate original way Great bathroom Good breakfast reasonable price when it is for two or more days agreed on the spot at the reception You can buy football tickets for FCB mach on reception which is great for last moment fans 
352308,Vincci Bit, Two single beds put together does not make double bed Couldn t be bothered to waste time complaining becaus there was a queue at reception and only one person on it , Funky Decor Car park convenient
352309,Vincci Bit, The location si a bit strange and slightly off the grid but it s overall okay for the price Not very nice scenery around it It s in an actual older neighborhood Not a big variety for breakfast but one could survive with it , Not quite in the city center but the quality of the hotel was worth it We loved doing a trip on foot to visit We could walk to Sagrada Familia Casa Milla Casa Batllo Agbar Tower All in one day by relaxed walking about 10 12km round trip Very nice and modern interior Very comfortable beds Very friendly staff Very cheap minibar in the room Secured underground parking It is very close to a shopping mall and the forum building It is 10minutes away by car to Sagrada Familia or 45minutes away by foot walking but we really enjoyed exploring the city on foot 
352310,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Receptionists were amazing always had smiles on their faces and helpful Everyone knows English even the housekeepers Walking distance and access to metro and mall Good buffet breakfast Quiet neighborhood 
352311,Vincci Bit,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful staff super friendly super comfy bed wifi works great wonderful bathroom parking at the door free amazing value for money My fave place to stay in BCN 
352312,Vincci Bit, quite far from the city center it took about at leasst 30 minutes to get the city center , everything was perfect from interior to nice staffs big and quite shopping mall right in front of the hostel
352313,Vincci Bit, There was nothing to dislike, We liked everything about this hotel from its unique d cor to the wonderful staff It is out of the centre of Barcelona but only 200 metres from a Metro station tram stop and in a quiet area The staff were most helpful and booked tours for us The breakfast offered an amazing choice of foods The metro to the city centre was swift and the stations in fact the whole city are very clean we loved the hotel and the city of Barcelona
352314,Vincci Bit, Almost none except a small incident when the one of the replaced clean towels was actually dirty We were provided with a new one immediately though, Clean nice hotel close to tram lines and the subway Definitely worth the price 
352315,Vincci Bit, Madly hot I mean unbearable I was in Malaysia recently and the room all night here was way hotter My stay was in December They put air con on apparently a bit during day when I wasn t in and staff blamed heat on weak sunshine through double glazed windows , The scoring doesn t take into account visually beautiful surroundings lovely staff HOWEVER the extreme discomfort that it was tropically hot and staff were unable to alter temperature of room I needed to bring scores of some of the good things down to bring ridiculously high score down a bit 
352316,Vincci Bit, The AC wasn t working during the day time and also during the nights it was not fully functional The room was very hot and we could barely sleep , The staff was good cleanliness is good as well as the location 
352317,Vincci Bit, Scorching hot room in January even the open window barely made a difference , Nice and modern hotel spacious enough rooms superior rooms anyway Friendly staff 
352318,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Modern accommodation big and light and airy room very nice bathroom with a great shower window can be opened for fresh air nice quiet residential part of town close to the beach shopping mall nearby amazing value for money for Barcelona
352319,Vincci Bit, The air condition is weird that you never know what exactly the temperature is The bed is uncomfortable , The location is good It s close to the subway and nearby there s a shopping mall Inside there are restaurants 
352320,Vincci Bit, Smell in the hotel which claimed to be your home s smell Definetly not mine , Close to subway tram your are in the downtown in 20 min Quiet room nice upper terrace good and lots of breakfast 
352321,Vincci Bit, Hated the graffiti corridor on our floor Very dark and depressing like walking through the Bronx , Overall the hotel was very comfortable and a nice place to stay Would definitely stay there again 
352322,Vincci Bit, the sauna is not opened in the morning and gym closed too early at night , Staffs are nice breakfast is good 7 minutes walk from Metro 9 stops by Metro to PI Gracia
352323,Vincci Bit, no rooms with smoking options , Well mannered staff clean nice breakfast and good quality WIFI service makes this hotel at very reasonable rates the good choice for the stay during business trips to Barcelona
352324,Vincci Bit, Had to wait 2 hours to get checked in as room wasn t ready Location isn t great although the tram and bus services are nearby if you can work out the routes, The Hotel was exceptionally clean Close to beach and shopping centre
352325,Vincci Bit, The breakfast was good but the same every day when you stay for multiple days a change is nice They do have a good variety of options though Location is great when you re at a convention in the convention centre It s quite far away from the centre of town 20 30 mins by taxi but then that costs about 15 euro s to get there so it s not too bad We tried to find find the beach and while we got to the seafront easily enough the beach was harder to find , Nicely decorated hotel friendly staff and quiet rooms 
352326,Vincci Bit, It is a 20 minutes drive from the city center But it s a convenient metro drive and on the other hand it s very close to diagonal mar shopping center and to the beach so it s a great area too , Room was nice Big Modern Hotel is modern Good design in the space 
352327,Vincci Bit, Turkish Bath was a bit smelly and not too hot, Quiet Rooms Pillows I d like to swap them for mine Lighting in Rooms Friendly Helpful Staff Copious Breakfast Comfy Bar with IMACS Excellent WIFI Coverage
352328,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Beautiful new hotel great wifi excellent bedding and pillows parking is free and safe enough on the streets next to hotel cheap and tasty food from patisserie across street
352329,Vincci Bit, Wish it was in a little more convenient location But that want bad really , The bed was comfortable which shouldn t surprise me but as stupid as it seems to me few hotels have comfortable beds So that puts Vinci Bit high on my list Room nice too 
352330,Vincci Bit, Nothing, Staff was very nice helping us locate the train station for the following day They allowed us to leave our car parked after check out as our train left later Very clean room and hotel Also Very Good Breakfast Selections

352332,Vincci Bit, We booked for 2 night but for 2 more night unfortunatly they increased the price 60 location is very far from city center , Everything is new room has enough light staffs cooporation were very good 
352333,Vincci Bit, They couldn t give me a French bed when I asked them to put the bed together with one sheet I was told to wait for the next day I was only staying 2 nights this is a response you expect from a one star hotel not a four star hotel, I made a mistake for my arrival date but they were nice enough to accommodate me that was the only thing nice about this hotel
352334,Vincci Bit, Overheard someone inquiring about the price of a room for 2 for the night and found that my room was almost twice what they are offered When I asked about the difference I was told that it is the luck of the draw and I just booked my room at the wrong time and that the room just happened to be only 69 that day , Beautiful hotel quiet close to subway Very helpful staff 
352335,Vincci Bit, Check in and reception was really slow Took forever to check in or ask a question at desk Only ever one or two members of staff at desk , New hotel nice roof deck and pool Close to subway 8 stops and about 15mins to la ramblas 
352336,Vincci Bit, Beds could be better very narrow parking lot to park a large car Tried to get an extra night but the price went up 5x , Decoration in the hotel excellent bathrooms at the room breakfast was good and staff friendly and smiling
352337,Vincci Bit, Felt like a 3 star hotel that is claiming 4 star status and charging and treating customers accordingly The normal staff were all lovely but there was a senior staff member with a high opinion of himself and not such high opinion of us because we dared to ask if there was a laundromat nearby the cost in the hotel for our modest amount of laundry would have been 70 , It s not a bad hotel and it s in a good position but I wouldn t write home about it 
352338,Vincci Bit, Slow ineffective staff at reception Both checkin and checkout took over five minutes with lots of mistakes issues etc Electronic keys didn t work No food available at lunchtime , Small oil on roof Comfy bed
352339,Vincci Bit, Shower strangly positioned making complete bathroom wet , Beautiful clean rooms with inspiring art on the walls Staff is very friendly especially at the bar great cocktails small but clean sauna and swimming pool Good breakfast 
352340,Vincci Bit, Dinner is not great at restaurant but the quick breakfast coffee and crossiant was very good for price A bit far from sights but depends if you mind, Just about everything once we were there Close enough to walk to beach Excellent room size clean amazing shower very comfortable bed Pool is small but nice to dip in after a hot day out seeing the sights 
352341,Vincci Bit, They didn t change the sheets in our 4 night stay just tidy the room and changed the towels Location is far from Airport and Majour tourist spot the nearest metro is in 10 min walk , Interior design was very nice 10 15 min walk to a nice beach loved the shower close to Diagonal Mal and some small super market 
352342,Vincci Bit, The keys to their doors keep locking out you will have to go to the reception every couple of days to change and get access to your room The gim time isn t brilliant the opening time for gim should be early so you can exercise before going out , Good price and good location
352343,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Roof terrace with pool and restaurant is a real bonus Loved the decor of dining room corridors and bedroom Situation ideal for beach transport and shopping 
352344,Vincci Bit, Not many night time eating places within walking distance , Decent size rooms very large shower and within easy walking distance for Tour Bus Metro and large shopping mall 
352345,Vincci Bit, Wireless conection is so poor and if you want good conection you need to pay some money We live in 20th century You pay your money so wireless should be perfect,No Positive
352346,Vincci Bit, Location far way from city centre walking distance from a mall Room Service I missed a comb after coming back to my room Asked in the reception about my comb and at the end of the day it was found Did not like it , Confortable rooms very nice breakfast
352347,Vincci Bit, Too expensive given the quality Smell of the carpet deodorant in the public areas Windows facing the dirty badlands across the street Pool is on the roof extremely tiny suitable for children only you can not swim in it , Reasonable size of the room Good quality of the interior interesting design of the floors Big shower cabin but no bathtub 
352348,Vincci Bit,No Negative, This hotel is really cute and modern Very clean and bright LOVE the shower and the breakfast The air ventilation also works well Kind and helpful staff Good value for the money 
352349,Vincci Bit, Not much of a bar and poor breakfast But space is right in such a hotel , Poor bar and pool Very small though didn t use it Breakfast was cold but room was nice and clean too Staff were friendly 
352350,Vincci Bit, The walls were very thin You could hear the people above us moving about their room , Very cool decor Close enough to a metro stop They hold your bags behind the front desk if you need temporary storage after checking out 
352351,Vincci Bit,No Negative, Clean and cool hotel with good size rooms and perfect bathrooms Great airco free WiFi and roof terrace Close to a shopping center and walking distance towards the metro and beach 
352352,Vincci Bit,No Negative, No complaints Our stay was stress free and easy the room was perfect very luxurious the staff were welcoming friendly and helpful and the location is good close to the metro and a shopping centre but in a quiet peaceful location We would definately come again and recommend to others
