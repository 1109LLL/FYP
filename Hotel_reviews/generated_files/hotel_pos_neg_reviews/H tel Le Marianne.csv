34604,H tel Le Marianne, Had coffee cheese and a croissant for breakfast and was charged 19 Euros Told that was the charge for breakfast regardless of what I had Thought that was not a very good feature of their breakfast on site , Room was clean and the bathroom was excellent and large Modern decor with all the amenities required for a pleasant stay 
34605,H tel Le Marianne, Request another room as balcony windows let a lot of noise in during the night where you hear a lot of cars groups of people Kept me awake a lot of the time, Fantastic attentive staff Made our stay very pleasant and would definitely return 
34606,H tel Le Marianne, I had problems with noise from the street and light coming up from the jammed curtain , The staff is well above average I m a very frequent traveler and I can say this Very kind and helpful The breakfast is very nice as well 
34607,H tel Le Marianne, I always love to have a bathtub but fine with forgoing it for a few days The white marble bathroom was a lovely and well appointed , The room in this charming and efficient boutique hotel was sparkling clean with a comfortable bed and lovely bathroom The storage space was smart and ample and I loved the in room espresso machine The room was also very quiet not a sound from the outside The staff couldn t have been more friendly and accommodating I highly recommend It s a few blocks off the Champs Elyssee a two block walk 5 min and it s nice that it s in a mixed residential and commercial area I was a woman traveling alone and felt very safe and secure in the surroundings 
34608,H tel Le Marianne, I got a classic room which was all I needed but it might be a bit small for some people there is no space to leave luggage on the floor for instance but the closet is spacious , Charming boutique hotel in the heart of Paris Small but very elegantly decorated and with the amenities of a larger hotel bathrobe slippers quality bath amenities The staff is extremely kind and helpful I had to change my booking due to illness and they were very accommodating And the breakfast buffet is the best I ve ever seen in Paris including hot food 
34609,H tel Le Marianne, Room was very small for a superior room room amenities were quite modest We couldnt change the climate function heat AC on the the thermostat climate control we can only the change temperature and turn it on off breakfast section was too small and pricy for the options available It s a cozy boutique hotel but quite expensive for what it offers frankly not worth the value for money All in all the only convenience for us was the location , Location was very central and has easy access to champs elysees Staff were friendly but seems to be a one or two man show 
34610,H tel Le Marianne, The lighting in the lobby could be dimmed and more subtle as it is too bright at night The breakfast should have more variety , The bed was super comfy and the general aesthetic of the hotel was lovely The location is fantastic and it is very quiet considering 
34611,H tel Le Marianne, Room a bit on the small side Pillows were uncomfortable Breakfast was terrible not worth 25 euros per person recommend to eat breakfast at a caf , Loved the style and feel of the hotel very chic and new Staff very pleasant Very clean Would stay here again however would eat breakfast out and ask for different pillows 
34612,H tel Le Marianne, the door cannot be locked inside and in one midnight a strange man opened the door and wanted to pee in my bath room the hotel insists the door was open I cannot believe I didnot close the door for whole night furthermore the employee is not in good manner to response this incident they simply want to get rid of the resonsbility from this incident not a word to appology at all unbelivable , no
34613,H tel Le Marianne, I have no complaints it was exactly as i expected , The previous reviews that i had read were spot on so it was every thing i expected Location is great very modern and clean Rooms are on the small size but that is normal for most hotels in Paris Overall great stay no complaints 
34614,H tel Le Marianne, Construction out front Not the fault of the staff or hotel , Spotlessly Clean wonderful staff delicious breakfast great bath room and shower probably the best shower in a hotel room I ve ever had A overhead rain head and a hand held with perfect temp control and great flow
