386209,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not sure about the bathroom configuration , Very friendly staff great location loved the quirky interior lovely surprise of chocolate champagne in our Son s room for his 21st birthday 
386210,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, It was all great , We were treated like royalty We arrived on my 73 birthday were upgraded to a suite and received excellent assistance in planning a side trip to the Canadian War Memorial in Groesbeek a key purpose for staying in Amsterdam after our river cruise 
386211,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms are really small which is disappointing for the amount charged per night , Staff are simply fantastic Really helpful and very cheery Hotel was fantastically located and is a very interesting concept 
386212,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We booked a twin room and if I had any complaints I would say it was a bit on the small size but as we were only able to stay for one night it was adequate , All the hotel staff were extremely helpful friendly and whoever is doing the in house training is doing a great job we look forward to visiting again it is a very unique hotel In its previous life it was a printing press and the hotel decor reflects this 
386213,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, 8 of us arrived early in the morning We were happy to wait around the corner in the lounge while people checked out but were not impressed when we found others lined up behind us had checked in before us On the plus side we were very grateful for the early check in and the extra we paid to not have to wait for one did give us a room we were very happy with Breakfast was a little costly we found a lovely cafe on a nearby corner that provided a tasty and healthy alternative Many cafes do not open for breakfast early one told us 11am , Really quirky hotel themed around its previous days as a printery Very handy location with lots of cafes and transport nearby Our room not at the front of the hotel was very quiet Loved it 
386214,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Would have preferred the all of the bathroom wash facilities to have been in another room although it was well presented Breakfast at 20 Euros day each was a little on the high side in my view, The hotel was in a good location with everything just a short walk away The trams stopped opposite the hotel which was very useful for discovery other parts of Amsterdam Bars and places to eat near the hotel Hotel was well presented with nice breakfast room and bar along with quite areas Good breakfast but a little pricey Staff were friendly and helpful Close to lively Dam Square and the fantastic canal areas Amsterdam is a great city and we will return
386215,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Being charged for two breakfasts when we hadn t had them This was rectified and refunded , The decor of the whole hotel was very modern and tasteful The layout of the bedroom was nice The bar staff in the evening were very informative and helpful and very good at making a Gin and Tonic 
386216,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was one night that I was given unclean towels but the hotel was very quick to change apologize and give me a couple drinks on the house , Staff and location make this place They go out of their way to make you comfortable and answer your questions concerns And location is wonderful definitely a bit touristy but perfect for a first visit to Amsterdam 
386217,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The hotel was unique new paper printer theme running through out from the wall paper to the restaurant to the employee s uniforms The employee s were super helpful and very pleasant to work with It was pretty much a flawless stay at a great place I marked them slightly off for price which was a bit high Given everything I would stay there again and recommend it to friends with no hesitation at all 
386218,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, No complaints, Great spot just a ten minute walk from Centraal Station The staff was very friendly and helpful We arrived early after a long trip and they were kind enough to let us into our room early That turned the day around for us There is a tram stop about 100 meters from the front door and across the street an alley takes you to any number of shops and restaurants 
386219,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not enough wardrobe and drawer space Rain shower head Prefer normal shower , Great breakfast and dinner Staff wonderful any questions were answered with a smile Nothing was too much trouble for them Great position Clean and mordern 
386220,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast could have been continental OR full ie continental only The food itself was very good quality but not everyone can eat a full breakfast and 20 is expensive for a continental breakfast , Breakfast snack pre dinner drinks and dinner were all fantastic best food so far in the Netherlands as a tourist
386221,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, be careful when choosing clasic room they are different, delicious breakfast very good location helpful service stylish room with the plan of the Amsterdam on the wall
386222,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The sound of the mini bar fridge Otherwise the room was quiet , The room was designed with ingenuity very cleaver use of space Contemporary yet still having the character of a print factory Very comfy beds and great shower The staff are super friendly reception cleaners restaurant and bar staff Location could not be more convenient If you need to use public transport to get somewhere a bit quicker than walking there is a tram right outside 
386223,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Way too pricey but it might also be the period of the year July We basically paid the same amount for 3 nights in this 4 star hotel in Amsterdam and a 5 star hotel in Rotterdam just before Locations are different though The room lacked in storage space too Parking is very expensive in the area 50 day but the hotel offers a 20 discount per day still too much for parking your car no but that s Amsterdam , We liked the design of the hotel and the room Especially the map drawing on the room wall A book by the same artist is provided in the room The general design of the hotel an old newspaper printing house is great Staff was very useful and welcoming Very big fridge OK location close to Jordaan and Red Light District 
386224,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We didn t take the option of breakfast on offer as it appeared a little overpriced for our liking , The location of this hotel was excellent close to Amsterdam central station Great to walk to bars and restaurants nearby We were celebrating our wedding and we had a beautiful room It was the perfect mini break after our wedding 
386225,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The hotel felt a bit expensive but I think all of Amsterdam is expensive so it was probably in keeping with local prices , The INK Hotel is in a fantastic location near the Nine Streets and The Jordaan both picturesque areas within a network of canals The hotel is comfortable clean and friendly 
386226,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Upon arrival we were greeted by a very arrogant young man who looked down on us and the other guests He was in training Not sure why he was so arrogant We were nt in France We were very dressed in business attire and were friendly We were given a room that was tiny with a small bed with sloping roof My husband is tall and bumped his head The bed was tiny a double and I had booked a King We complained and were told that in The Netherlands a Queen is actually a double Lol what BS We were upgraded to an acceptable room for the money we paid It was very nicely designed I was working for a few days and even took a few publicity shots from the room as it was really cool , Great location for walking around Amsterdam Very cool interior design I often find that some MGallery hotels in the Accor group use the hipster interior design to charge more for inferior rooms e g small no bath and caravan like plastic showers This one was no exception but it was comfortable quiet and clean It had a small fridge to cool our champagne and store the cheese we purchased nearby The staff bought us a champagne bucket with ice and glasses in a good timeframe when we asked 
386227,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room quite small but not sure if this is standard for Amsterdam Soap shelf broken in shower and no shower door so water runs into the bathroom , Nice lounge and bar area etc Fantastic location Good coffee facilities in room 
386228,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Staff is extremely helpful Bar is fantastic Room is thoughtfully appointed and the bed is one of the most comfortable in Europe The design of the hotel is artful and a delight Love everything about this place 
386229,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Iron was supplied on request very quickly but it leaked all over the shirt , Breakfast was great room very clean and had what was needed expensive for the size of the room but in city centre probably par for the course 
386230,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Location location Room size was pretty good Good shower Nice lounge Reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful Local restaurants Transport at the door 
386231,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Excellent location Walking distance to the Central Station river cruise ship dockings Dam Square shopping and many of Amsterdam s other attractions We did a lot of walking at different times of the day and the immediate area felt safe always lots of people out and about While the room was small by North American standards it was very comfortable with a queen size bed had a small coffee pot and kettle it was clean had lots of hot water and interesting decor I would definitely recommend and stay there again 
386232,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The mirror in the wash basin area was too far away an additional articulated magnifing mirror would be a good idea storage was rather poor The question re walking around the neighbourhood was marked low we arrived to the hotel using this route and it was very off putting when exiting the hotel to the right past a few resturants was a allyway that was badly kept The stench of human urin was very high and also human faeces not a good route at all understandably this is not part of the Ink hotel however I would suggest is used by many of your guests steer clear walk a little further along the main street and take the next right , Complimentary coffee and water were replaced when the maid came not just for the arrival The beds were fantastically comforatble Cleaning of the room was thorough however it did take a long time 
386233,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room being small and no privacy in the bathroom with no door to block the bedroom once you got out of the shower Especially not good when your travelling with a friend , We end up paying another 15 a night for a luxury room but it was so small They were trying to tell us the room we paid for was small that we should pay the extra for a bigger room I would have hated to see the other room we had booked 
386234,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was no view from the room at all Just straight into the property next door However as the hotel is slap bang in the middle of Amsterdam its understandable Breakfast was very expensive for what it was and very little choice for a vegetarian so we ended up eating breakfast just down the road to save some money Having said that it really wasn t a problem and completely down to our choice , The hotel was centrally located very easy to get to all the places we wanted to go The hotel was lovely very modern and funky We had a lovely room the staff had even decorated it with balloons and left some fizz as it was my son s birthday Everyone was really friendly and helpful We were very well looked after 
386235,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms are tiny but to be expected , Friendly staff good food and wine in restaurant location is close to everything Would stay again if we return to the city 
386236,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The hotel was clean and modern The room was very nice and comfortable I had a problem with the shower I didn t know there was a cover over the drain I had a lot of water in the shower and on the floor My husband figured it out We ate breakfast there and it was good 
386237,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Our stay at the INK Hotel was delightful The location is very central an easy walk to the train station and there is a GBV tram stop right outside the front door The staff was quite helpful and pleasant When we checked in they were having system problems but they worked quickly to resolve them We were in Room 501 for our thirteen night stay which was marvelous It has a high pitched ceiling with exposed beams It was almost like staying in a beautifully renovated Dutch apartment It was extremely quiet and the bed was very comfortable The WiFi throughout the hotel is quite fast One of the employees Sri was especially welcoming and friendly He gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and we always enjoyed interacting with him when entering or leaving the hotel 
386238,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Toilet space design small room upgrade a rude nasty desk clerk on the morning we left A large man with a very bad attitude He left a bad taste in our mouth We waited outside for our taxi because he was still berating us , Location clean mostly helpful desk clerks Cool decor 
386239,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room 229 can be a little noisy if tables in central well are occupied in the evening, Easy to access from train station Close to city Centre attractions
386240,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Our room had a problem with the drain in the shower the smell in our room was very unpleasant after the room had been closed up all day The alley outside the window was noisy , The hotel was in easy walking distance of the train station We had an issue with a smell in our room the staff were quick to help sort the problem out The croissants for breakfast were wonderful We loved the map on the wall in our room A great hotel Staff were very good 
386241,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The hotel is centrally located the staff is very nice so don t hesitate to ask for recommendation Room are small but confortable the design of the hotel is outstanding
386242,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Terrible value for money no view atall location wasn t described accurately took a good 45 minutes at reception to gain access to my room , I liked the interior of the apartment also the lobby dining area 
386243,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I did not like the fact the bathroom and toilet was in a glas walled room with a glass door without lock meaning that on our romantic holiday we had to technically go toilet in full view of each other Did not see the charm in that Especially not after burritos , I liked the hotel itself and location very cozy and staff were friendly and attentive 
386244,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Nice breakfast buffet Well appointed rooms with interesting decor Very helpful reception desk staff City center and public transportation nearby Quick walk from the train station I would definitely stay here again 
386245,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The food for breakfast was not what I expected It was buffet style and was an added cost of 50 for two , The pictures online were exactly what the room looked like no surprises The staff was very professional friendly and helpful 
386246,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing in my opinion the rooms were great staff were great winner all round, If u could have taken the bed and shower home with me i would have the bed was super comfy and the overhead shower was spectacular cant rate it high enough 10 out of 10
386247,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Prices were pretty high 250 euro per night but I guess that s typical for downtown Amsterdam , The hotel was in a perfect location for our 4 night stay We were within walking distance of the train station and the Nine Streets area We spent many hours wandering along the canals nearby There was also a tram stop right outside the hotel which we took to the Museum Area Albert Cuyp flea market and Dutch Resistance Museum The hotel had a restaurant and bar area that was convenient for a drink at the end of the day They staff was very friendly and helpful We arrived early and they stored our luggage during the day and were very helpful in suggesting restaurants and offering directions to sights 
386248,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing it was perfect , Loved everything about this hotel We walked everywhere from here in minutes Very clean and modern The staff is very helpful Great location 
386249,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The classic queen room which we stay is extremely small Even it is hard to move two person at the same time , Location is perfect Tram stop is in front of the hotel which is also the main road of the inner circle of Amsterdam 
386250,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There were two issues On two mornings of a four day trip I did not receive my requested wake up calls Also staff was NOT great with giving clear directions leading to confusion on two occasions , Room though small was neat and clean Great location Easy for walking and access to Tram 
386251,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Airconditioning was abit hard to work in the rooms Drinks at the bar onsite quite expensive , Great location close to everything Very clean hotel friendly helpful staff Very nice room comfortable bed Definitely recommend 
386252,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, N A, The staff were extremely friendly and provided a small bottle of presecco and some chocolates for my partners birthday Little touches like that mean a lot They were also able to accommodate and early check in Which was fantastic 
386253,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was a leakage with the shower that caused the carpet near the bed to be damp , The hotel was beautifull really nice beds and the best location u could ask for I would recommend everybody to stay over here 
386254,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The shower leaked a bit , Amazing hotel Great location and decor great attention to detail stylish rooms Friendly and helpful staff We would definitely stay here again 
386255,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The air conditioning didn t go cold enough so the room was quite stuffy which meant we had to open the window this unfortunately meant u heard the noise from the street in the night We did ask the hotel re this they said there is an eco system in the hotel which controls the temperature The bathroom in our room was quite open so you will need to be comfortable with your travel partner The other room in our party had more privacy so if this is a problem for you make this request when you book I would still definitely stay here again though very cool funky , We chose this hotel as it had an elevator for our on the guests in our party The design of the hotel was very modern sleek and brilliantly themed to reflect the previous history of the building as a newspaper office The location was great 5 minutes walk from the central station but far away enough to avoid the noise of the main station buses trams The room was modern clean luxurious Very big comfy double bed Breakfast was lovely Tea coffee juices hot bacon eggs etc cereals pastries cheese meats fish We added this on when we arrived for 20 each which is a little pricey but very nice with great quick service from the staff 
386256,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The coffee machine wouldn t work on the day of departure We could hear people talking in the next room from he bathroom That means they could hear us , Hooks in the bathroom to hang more towels bathrobes etc
386257,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was absolutely nothing to complain about All needs were catered for , Excellent location wonderful staff very comfortable and quiet rooms beautifully decorated Would highly recommend 
386258,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, We absolutely loved this boutique hotel The location is fantastic especially for first time visitors to Amsterdam it is close to Amsterdam Central Station and has trams directly out the front which are frequent and easy to use The staff are friendly and went our of their way to make our stay unforgettable Special mention to Guest Service Manager who made my son s birthday holiday so wonderful Our twin room was small but comfortable the bed and pillows were amazing and it was very clean We loved our view of the Amsterdam rooftops and listening to the church bells ring Breakfast was good plenty of choice and a lovely environment although a little expensive but standard price for a good hotel We would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heart beat 
386259,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, It is very close to Dam Square which is kind of an advantage but also make the area a bit too busy in my opinion If you are looking for a more quire picturesque location I would go a further from the square to the surrounding canals , the hotel is great nice design and practical in terms of location services shopping and restaurants 
386260,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The noise of the Hoover in the morning Went on for two hours We asked to move rooms which we did Was on the 1st floor, Enjoyed the location the room was very comfortable Bar and restaurant nice 
386261,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The rooms where quite small but this didnt really effect us as we wasnt there for long however of you stayed longer than a weekend or few days this would get a little crowded But it was perfect for our little city break , Beautiful layout lovely staff comfy beds The place was just beautiful A little out the way so your not sat directly on the main high street so your not kept awake by noise all night but only a road away so that in a 2 min walk your slap bang in the centre Its a perfect little location Staff where helpful and understanding The place was incredibly clean and they lay out was perfect Very easy to find I really would recommend this hotel to anyone its classy chic and cool 
386262,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, 1 Price 2 We didn t bother with the breakfast as the hotel wanted 25e per person simply not worth it, Extremely overpriced for what we received
386263,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not really enough wardrobe space The double doors on the wardrobe are locked obviously for storage and the small end isn t very big Most clothes had to stay in the suitcase as there are no drawers either , Great ambience and very comfy rooms Excellent breakfast with a good choice All the staff are very friendly and attentive 
386264,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Disappointed there was no bath in the room Gym It was a disgrace to even call it that it had a rower bike and cross trainer and no treadmill Very poor I just don t think that the hotel represented value for money We paid 375 euros for 2 nights Monday Tuesday with no breakfast included I expected more from the hotel in terms of fitness facilities and the size of the room and to have a bath included Had the room been significantly cheaper then I wouldn t have been as harsh in my critique , Hotel room was very small but the bed was comfy Staff at the reception and hotel bar were very nice and friendly The hotel is in a good location 
386265,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, An itemised bill would have been easier in English, The beds were comfy but the bedroom was very small The staff were very friendly and we will stay again
386266,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, No privacy for toilet shower no water source inside toilet eg bidet the room has tiny walking area because of big bed, The bed was huge the area is perfect
386267,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Staff we so nice and helpful bar area was lovely and the rooms So helpful having a map of the city on the room walls Right in the middle of everything and about a 5 10 minute walk from train station Would highly recommend 
386268,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room was small and the shower door didn t close properly so flooded into the room after every use The room was very hot and even using the thermostat did nothing Room clean was poor didn t even put the decorative pillows on the bed again or give us clean towels Had the ink hotel salad and it was average advertised it came with flowers no flowers and I complained I would say 3 star not 4 , Bed was very comfy staff were nice and the cocktail bar was very good Easy check in and check out Very good location 
386269,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms are quite small no privacy in bathroom and toilet area so you better hope you re sharing with someone close Also I ve had a bad experiences with them deducting money from my account The cost of two nights plus 50 was held at check in which is standard procedure and fine with me however on check out I paid in full and still 6 days later they haven t released 500 that was held so currently my value weekend away currently cost me over 1000 I ve emailed twice with no reply and had to call to chase I should get my money back however I feel it s important to ensure anyone staying here takes this into consideration I had the available funds but if you don t you might get caught out , Pressroom staff are fantastically helpful the garden outdoor courtyard area Great location 
386270,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, A bit far from the museums and concert hall , The room and the unique book in the room are both very interesting Through the picture story book I get to know a few interesting stories associated locations in amsterdam 
386271,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Big thanks to the staff of INK Hotel that really made an effort to offer us a memorable stay in Amsterdam In the midst of the hectic life of the most central part of the capital we got a quiet and cozy room filled with surprises for the birthday of my fianc The breakfast buffet was rather pricey but definitely a nice treat with many options also for ppl with allergies My warmest recommendation to travelers who wish to enjoy a piece of European luxury 
386272,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room was a little small for the price we paid and compared to another hotel we had stayed in previously , Great attention to detail from the staff Room cleaned and well maintained with a fixed UK plug in the room already 
386273,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The set up of the bathroom is not a very practical one and our window was facing a wall meaning there was no natural light whatsoever in the room We had non stop noise coming from the alley on the Sunday morning from a machine not really sure if anything could be done about it , Wonderful design of the hotel welcoming staff and very good location for Central Amsterdam
386274,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing negative to say about the hotel, Stylish boutique hotel in a good location with a great bar and delicious food in the restaurant Excellent breakfast and very helpful and friendly staff Would definitely go there again
386275,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Gym isn t very equipped no treadmill no 3 and 2 kg weights room is VERY small Maybe it s Amsterdam standard but I found it hard to handle no place to dress comfortably and privately Water was getting out from the shower to the room and it was annoying Plus the mini bar didn t work very well and our food spoiled because of that Overall I think that with 4 stars and such good reviews I expected more , Location wonderful staff espresso machine and bath robe Comfortable bed 
386276,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Would select a superior room or suite next time and the room was a little in the smal side Could have done with more storage space for clothes , Very stylish excellent friendly staff great central location One in the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in 
386277,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Absolutely nothing everything was perfect, Very friendly and helpful staff room was lovely and comfortable and spotless and great location and great wifi
386278,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms slightly small but everything needed was available, Hotel design was modern and contemporary Staff extremely helpful with recomendations for food and drinks outside of the hotel Bar staff polite attentive and cocktails amazing 
386279,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I tried to book the room with breakfast but could not and mailed to ask if breakfast is included in the rate but got no answer When we got there we were told that breakfast is 20 pp or 25 the next day I also didn t like the fact that they tell you about the tax 5 pp levi upon checkout It feels like it was a hidden cost, The design is great Rooms very clean and bed and pillows very comfortable
386280,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Room was stylish and cosy Bed was the perfect for me and my partners Drawing mural of a map of Amsterdam on the wall was a great touch and funny Loved the bar and staff too 
386281,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, So the price you pay for the room was nearly 200 a night or more and the size off the room was very small Think maybe lower the price off the room Also some staff where very blunt and assumed we where paying by credit card so it took ages for them to change the payment, The best was comfortable Show was amazing the location was great
386282,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The staff in the restaurant were pretty poor which was a bit of a let down after the check in, Check in staff were incredibly helpful and in 5 minutes planned out our weekend s activities 
386283,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I cannot think of anything the rooms are perhaps on the small side , The hotel is in an idea location being a short walk from Central Station were were we arrived Dam Square and several of the other main attractions The hotel is clean modern and quirky the staff were all very helpful and friendly 
386284,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The reception desk has received two packages sent to me by mail but has NOT confirmed even I have asked three times along two days Only after I have checked with Amazon France and got the name of the person who received them which as a benefit for such person I will decline to identify perhaps because he she may be not the responsible I have got the confirmation and received them , Everything as expected 
386285,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, the door between our room and the next wasn t sound proof we were woken earlier than would like to have been by business people chatting , the location is perfect the staff were helpful the lobby bar is so welcoming you would pay more for less being this central modern interiors there were a mix of what looked like professionals and people having a weekend away it was so quiet for a central location 
386286,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Great location but stayed in a superior room which was 200 a night and found it quite small Over all clean hotel now staff but quite expensive for what you get ,No Positive
386287,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I found out after booking this on Booking com that the hotel actually had an internal promotion stay a while longer whereby if you booked directly through the hotel for Friday and Saturday your Sunday night was free So always check promotions with the hotel directly Midweek the hotel has networking events this was great if you wanted to joint in set menu and late after party with DJ not so great if you weren t expecting it , The room was amazing we stayed in an executive room and it was worth every extra penny It was our anniversary and after telling the hotel the staff made very special adjustments to the room with chocolates prosecco and a little note Perfect 
386288,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room was on the small side considering it was a superior king Didn t ask for an upgrade as we were happy enough Breakfast was quite expensive at 20 each but very nice and plenty of selection , Comfy bed helpful staff great location lovely bar for drinks and relaxing 
386289,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Brilliant location less than 5 minutes walk into Dam Square Staff were very friendly and very helpful always happy to help The room was beautiful coffee and tea maker amazing shower room and all toiletries included Would definitely stay again and great value for money

386291,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Reception not the warmest Room a bit cramped dirty curtains and no bath , Location room was very small but good Enjoyed our stay staff need to look like they enjoy the place and their guests 
386292,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Hallways and landing bit basic rooms small and no privacy in bathroom, Bar and reception very welcoming and nice place to hang out with a drink or coffee
386293,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing we didn t like , Stayed twice in January Amazing place to stay Modern rooms and warm with great customer service throughout the hotel Location is fantastic and the staff couldn t have been kinder and more helpful
386294,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, No bath in bathroom no water provided mini bar not stocked limited non existant room service menu over emphasis on design no substance eg Shower door does not fit so bathroom area floods if not careful poor power point location and no international plug point option so remember to bring your adaptor if staying here Limited storage space so if staying more than one night be prepared for a messy room Better value elsewhere in town than Ink sorry to say A, Location
386295,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Surprise city taxes charge Also still waiting to have deposit reimbursement, Beautiful hotel Cleanest I ve ever seen Fab molten brown toiletries Fab coffee 
386296,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room was so small The bathroom had a frosted door so there was no privacy at all Shower had no screen Room wasn t worth 308 , Was very clean and in a well known place

386298,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The size of our room was too small, Excellent staff restaurant was superb fantastic location for getting around the city with the efficient tram service 
386299,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, When we arrived it was around 11 in the morning we hadn t slept in almost 18 hours so we couldn t wait for our bed we were told our room was ready so we rushed upstairs to hop in to our disappointment when we opened the door our room hadn t been attended to since the previous Guests Used bed sheets and towels and rubbish It was quite a disappointment we went back downstairs and brought it to the attention of one of the younger male staff members but he didn t take much interest he just asked did we want our bags taken for a while We told him we saw the cleaners on our floor so we ll come back in an hour we arrived back about an hour and a half later and went up to our room and there was stil no joy Nobody had cleaned it I was more upset at this point as I felt nobody cared about us So we went downstairs and brought it to the attention of a different lady who was extremely helpful and apologetic and tried everything she could to get us a room Sadly there was none available so we had to leave for another hour and come back When we came back an hour later our room was finally real dy We were never so happy to see our bed They were very apologetic and advised this never happens and I understand mistakes happen but i was shocked they didn t offer an apology gesture or something they didn t seem to care very much once we had our room in order It was just Bad start to the trip because we were so tired but it was absolutely beautiful and amazing after that , Fantastic location lovely staff the design of the hotel was incredible and the map on the wall of Amsterdam was actually very helpful 
386300,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Bathroom was not of a high standard No shower curtain and the shower was over the bath In an Executive room No carperts in the room only a hard floor , Location very frendly staff Interesting room with a history of Amsterdam on the wall Plenty of power points and a huge bed Clean and good air and heating

386305,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing to do with the hotel but central Amsterdam had a lot of cheap fast food type restaurants Finding the nice ones is a challenge in itself although there are some lovely ones nearby , Fantastic location only 5 minute walk from central station Close to the red light district but far enough away to avoid any noise or crowds Coffee shops galore a stones throw away Very friendly staff Fantastic rooms with extremely comfy beds They even upgraded our room for us as it was a special occasion Would highly recommend 
386306,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room was small even by European standards But we did not care very much as being in the hotel was just too much fun , The format around printing was interesting and aspiring to us journalists The whimsy expressed by the decor made us feel relaxed and welcome It was just FUN to be at this hotel The staff and I mean everyone was friendly and great to interact with 
386307,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Bathroom was small and the prices a little high for the size of the room Breakfast room struggled to seat all guests at a peak period, The Ink team are great bed very comfy location is central breakfast was good quality

386309,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Roomsize is very small the room was kind of dark withkut lots of natursl right therefore not worth the money to my mind, Nice located and pretty concept Very comfortsvle bed
386310,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room was quiet small and the cleaning staff opened our door for room service at 7 30 I did not have the do not disturb sign on door but 7 30 is too early , We were celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary which I stated at booking On check in we were greeting with a bottle of champagne and some love heart chocolates in our room lovely touch
386311,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not enough privacy in the bathroom area Some of the staff in the reception were not patient compare to other hotels we visited At the end of the vacation they didn t treat us the same as the beginning , Location Wi Fi and cleanliness 
386312,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room and bathroom area is very compact Reasonable if you re traveling as a couple but could be slightly impractical for others, Loved the location The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful helped us when renting their bikes suggested a few night spots to go to and went out of their way to get us the carrot cake we loved Plus the breakfast was lovely 
386313,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The shower leaked causing water to spread over bedroom floor Room was dusty in places Amenities in room were poor , Bed was very comfortable Food and drink were very nice Staff were very helpful and friendly 
386314,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing , Where do I start From the beginning of our visit to the end this hotel was fabulous The staff are very very helpful and friendly The breakfasts delicious We had dinner on the last night and it was superb The Manager of this hotel should be very proud of his staff 
386315,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room service menu could be better with more food choice , The decor is nice and the in room amenities are very well equipped Breakfast is fantastic Lovely hotel 
386316,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast was dry probably due to it not being busy that morning had been stood there for sometime staff addressed it and we only paid for a continental breakfast instead ,No Positive
386317,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Would have liked a bit of a better and more private door between the toilet and the main room as the frosted glass doesn t give much privacy and as ours didn t quite close properly , Lovely polite staff throughout the hotel Great central location for a fantastic price Lovely rooms comfortable cosy and stylish with everything you need We really loved and enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in beautiful Amsterdam 
386318,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The beds were extra comfy the breakfast choice was fantastic the quality of the actual food was delicious Overall the hotel are very accommodating I asked for champagne glasses and they came along with some ice when my bag broke I needed help with a mini screw driver to fix this All these little extra things to help make my stay comfortable and enjoyable was an absolute pleasure 
386319,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing at all, The attention to detail was great and the fact that the ink staff had made a special occasion of my birthday with prosecco and chocolates certainly gave us the wow factor 
386320,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, No hairdryers and safe in the rooms My room was not cleaned after my first night stay Came back after a whole day out at 6 pm Wanted to relax before dinner No explanation It was cleaned when I went out in the evening, Location is great One road behind dam square Loved the downstairs of this hotel Very modern Not sure of the black walls in the passages Stayed at this hotel when it was The Convent It s totally changed 
386321,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast was far too expensive at 25 per person We were offered a deal of 20 per person which was still too expensive , Very central location Tram stops outside the door and only 10 minute walk to central station Lovely decor and beds were really comfy Would definitely return
386322,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Layout of bathroom which meant if you got out of the shower anyone in the room could see you , Great breakfast Dark quiet rooms Friendly staff Loved the Wallpaper 
386323,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms are extremely small Also the bathrooms have no privacy definitely not good if traveling as a couple Door has no lock and is permanently stuck ajar door is made of glass yeah that was not ideal , Great cocktails at the hotel bar
386324,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I don t have much to complain about if I had to pick something would be the toilet paper in the rooms It s very very thin also maybe they should give a discount voucher to use if you are staying for the restaurant , Mostly everything Location was excellent staff were very friendly didn t hesitate to help One of the best hotels in Amsterdam I ve ever stayed in 
386325,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The location while convenient being close to dam square is less than ideal having a major street in front of it instead of a charming canal You also have to cut through some alleys to reach the main streets that lead to dam square , The staff were helpful and friendly They even arranged a house call for a doctor when i was sick The design of the hotel is gorgeous and the rooms are beautiful 
386326,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Check in was disappointing We were basically given our room keys and told to park the car It is best to do this first as it is not possible to stop close to the hotel Other guests who were dealt with by a different member of staff seemed to be given more time however I did witness staff explaining the hotel etc and showing maps of the local area whereas for some reason we weren t even told the times for breakfast We had to queue for half an hour for the car park Our rooms were ok We paid for the better room whilst the girls had a classic room The rooms are very small and the most annoying part is that there wasn t anywhere to put your belongings which couldn t be hung in the closet We had a sofa but couldn t use it as the bed was right in front The toilet and shower are frosted glass and right next to each other The floor is quite dangerous when wet I slipped twice The fridge in the room is within the drawers of the desk and is incredibly noisy so we kept it turned off Regrettably it was not replenished either We ate in the hotel once in the evening the food was very good and the staff were lovely Breakfast is a but of a free for all I was not offered a hot drink on any of the three mornings Overall this is an ok hotel at best The corridors were quite worn and it certainly wasn t the cleanest hotel we have stayed in It s really a glorified express hotel We had also requested quiet rooms but were woken every morning at 5 45 by noise from the alley way downstairs , The hotel is central although it is a 25 minute walk to the museums The majority of staff are helpful 
386327,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Booked a superior room which was 440 for two nights it was a standard in my view so not worth the money that was requested , The blackout window cover was great 
386328,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We arrived too late for dinner in your restaurant due to flight delays so we ordered your room service pizza To say it was horrendous would be too kind We could have purchased better from the frozen section of a local supermarket It is an insult to your guests to serve such food Room service menus should in our opinion and experience reflect the calibre of your hotel Yours does not Our experience of your room service menu was so awful we were reluctant to even try the menu in your Pressman restaurant and so ate outside the hotel , Your staff are excellent They are welcoming friendly and very helpful 
386329,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, We stayed at Ink prior to a Viking Christmas Markets cruise It was wonderful centrally located to everything we wanted to visit lovely restaurant bar where we enjoyed a great breakfast each morning along with some of the best coffee we ve ever had and finished the day with a cocktail or two before turning in for the evening Our room was spotlessly clean with a super comfortable bed And the staff were incomparably professional friendly and helpful They intervened in our frantic efforts to locate our delayed luggage contacting local airline representatives to get immediate answers about when we could expect delivery Through their help we received our luggage before we had to depart on our cruise This hotel does indeed deserve an exceptional rating across the board 
386330,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, No laggeges helpers the receptionist will direct and help you with all your belongings , Beautiful Hotel keys to all attractions perfect location everythings maximum 10 min of walking If I go to AMS again I ll definitely stay at INK Awesome staff with great attitude 
386331,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, It s very expensive but very high quality I would stay here again if on business but for my personal I d get I prefer something cheaper , Lovely hotel just 10 minutes walk from Central Station Beautiful and quirky yet tasteful interior The best breakfast I ve had in Europe and I m a seasoned traveler This place is perfect for Americans who want a nice quiet American style hotel near everything but not located in the heart of the redlight district 
386332,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The staff had a Christmas party in the lobby area They invited us which was very nice One of the employees which I guess didn t know we were invited approched us when we enjoyed some snacks and water roodly asked us to leave the place Well one apple , Great staff great service Great rooms Best breakfast ever Location is great 
386333,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Perfect location very central could walk to everywhere Beautiful rooms and hotel Great breakfast and welcoming staff Wouldn t change a thing and really made our trip 
386334,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, In our room where you poop was 4 feet away from the bed and the glass door in between had 1 inch gap at both sides Also our view was a wall only 20 feet away from our window Not all rooms this bad though Ask for a better one in case , Location and personel were great Lobby design was smart 
386335,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, small rooms the bathroom is open to the room which dose not give it enough privacy if you are traveling with friends there is construction next door , location is great easy to get anywhere in the city Great breakfast and nice service 
386336,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The bed was amazing really comfortable and made me not want to get up the staff were very friendly and nothing was to much they even gave a free upgrade as I was going to propose to my girlfriend Loved every minute of our stay 
386337,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Bit of an issue on our last morning maintenance walked in the room once early in the morning and actually woke us up and then once again whilst I was getting dressed so felt a bit uncomfortable after that , Staff couldn t do enough bar was quite expensive to drink but that was really across the whole of Amsterdam and the actual products were excellent
386338,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, 1 the lady that cleans the room was coming and knock the door 8 9 30am we are a couple that we wake up very early but the second day that we were not answear was knocking again and again i think is better to come after 10 30am at least 2 it will be very comfortabke for us if we had also small bottle of water every day in our room 3 the breakfast can be cheaper 4 the area around the hotel is very expensive a small bottle of water 3euro but if you walk in the next road the are sandwich and other thing in better prices, 1 the room was exactly like the photo 2 the lady that cleans the room make a fantastic job and change eveything that is not clean 3 7minutes walk and you are in the central station of amsterdam and 2 minutes walk you are in the center road 4 we have every day coffee and tea milk sugar and was very good quality nesresso 5 the first day we have also 2 small bottle of water 6 the quality of the towels linen was really really good 7 we had a map when we arrive and a very kind men the other persons in the reception was not so smile we have a fantastic time there
386339,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Rooms are tiny didn t like the glass doors on the bathroom toilet they don t give much privacy , Friendly staff comfortable bed really like the flavoured fresh water 
386340,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The bathrobes I felt were too expensive to take home for the feel and quality of them That the coffee wasn t enough for the duration of one night morning , I liked the warm welcome from the staff very helpful with answering any questions The coffee machine in the room was a great thing to have for a pick me up without much hassle or physical movement at all The open plan bathroom with the glass windows was a great way to give the feeling of more space than there actually was Also bringing more light into the room The free slippers and also the free refreshing fruited water in the lobby The blind on the roof window was easy to use and worked well including the window itself when wanting to view outside and see as much from the rooftops as possible The bed had many pillows and cushions for making yourself very comfortable and relaxed the mattress duvet and sheets were so soft that you d had trouble to get up to turn off the alarm clock which is only a short stretch away The rooms main wall was very instructive and knowledgeable as well as the magazine accompanying it placed on the bedside table from an artist who s work is very interesting 
386341,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Quite expensive compared to other hotels in Amsterdam, Hotel has recently been refurbished Location was good takes about 10 minutes to walk to Centraal Station Restaurant and bar in the hotel is good
386342,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, High design with functionality comfort and location Spent an enjoyable weekend in Amsterdam at the INK Loved the restaurant in room coffee among other amenities extremely comfortable bed and friendly staff Would stay again 
386343,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The bed was so comfy they gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco and a voucher for 2 free drinks at the bar staff were lovely Overall hotel was amazing 
386344,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, amazing place amazing location amazing food we loved our stay so much we spent most of our time in the hotel restaurant and bar i would highly recommend this place the bar man Rio was amazing and made us exclusive cocktails every evening the staff at the hotel make you feel like royalty loved it beautiful decor modern spotless rooms very big Location is walking distance from everything we can t wait to come visit again 
386345,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Everything was fantastic The staff were friendly welcoming and attentive the food was delicious atmosphere calm and chilled the decor was stunning and the bed was the comfiest ever 
386346,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The bathroom was slightly disappointing Not because of the cleanliness or facilities but the design was too ultra modern based on open plan We were there for 4 days and found that in some areas design had superseded the practicality of certain obvious necessities such as more drawers in the bedroom so that items could be stowed away I would categorise the hotel as a transit hotel therefore after 4 days you could pick faults which after all would not bother short stay guests , The hotel was very central and within easy walking distance to places of interest within the old town An excellent tram service was available right outside the main entrance with only one stop to the main railway station Food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was absolutely excellent the latter could have been Michelin starred it was so good Very unusual decor inside which I found very interesting as the interior designer had introduced all kinds of typographics to echo the previoususe of the building as a newspaper office 
386347,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not much privacy in bathroom for two people sharing due to glass partitions instead of walls Stylish but impractical bathrooms , Pleasant helpful staff Good location 
386348,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Toilet wasn t private enough it has a frosted glass window and you can hear everything, Ultra trendy boutique really central staff excellent comfy bed
386349,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, We were not happy that our original room looked onto a wall but staff were very accommodating and charming and moved us to a room on the top floor with a view Room and bathroom linked very well with glass Very comfortable bed
386350,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, While the quality of the bedroom was excellent nevertheless we would have appreciated a few more square feet There was a bit of to me to you when my wife and I were negotiating wardrobe and bathroom wc doors when considering the room rate , Really comfortable double bed Very contemporary style to the entire hotel Staff very efficient and helpful Dined one night in the restaurant and was not disappointed Great location only several minutes away from the main Central Railway station 
386351,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Was so annoyed about the breakfast bento box we ordered Description stated sausage and bacon but we received mushroom and bacon which wasn t even on the menu and I am allergic to mushrooms 25 well wasted on breakfast The hotel also took extra money out of my bank account as security which would ve been fine if they didn t do it without telling me , Nice clean room 
386352,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Sadly room 127 is looking out into the gap between 2 buildings without daylight facing a dirty wall and the neighbors windows at 1m away Rooms like this cannot demand the premium price I paid They should be listed as special offers due to their handicap and be clearly called out in the booking options It s common practice elsewhere to have a higher rate for ocean view vs city view There should be a no view bargain offer Also the hotel could work with its brilliant designers architects to find a creative solution a coat of White paint on the neighboring building for example to compensate brighten the outlook from the rooms on this side of the building Clean bright curtains would help too the ones in room 127 were grey and had not been cleaned in a while To sum it up my experience was considerably impacted by the absence of daylight and the view into a dirty dark creepy crevasse With so much effort spent on the overall design this was a real let down , I loved the overall ambience created by the lovely interior design choice of colours materials and graphics in the lobby restaurant bar and rooms 
386353,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, the price for buffet breakfast was 25 euros, very modern rooms big soft beds staff very friendly only 3 min walks from dam square and only 10 mins walk from the station location is spot on
386354,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Relatively limited space Some consistent humming noises possibly the room was not the best class of rooms Service of restaurant was good on the surface only , Location location location 
386355,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, nothing, the staff was amazing so helpful the breakfast was perfect and the room was super clean the location was amazing close to everything you need in the city would recommend all my friends to stay at INK 
386356,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Had a twin room and a double the twin was much smaller , Lovely hotel well appointed in an old newspaper building Very convenient for the station cruise terminals and scenic parts of Amsterdam 
386357,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The photos shown at info of the hotel are deceptive The hotel rooms were way tinier than the pics shown We couldnt even put our luggages and bags to a proper place The restroom and the shower have no sense of privacy which would make it extremely difficult for newlyweds and couples Room service is incapable of carrying out even the most simplest orders We asked for a fresh fruit in the evening and couldnt get any because the guy at the reception told us that the chef in kitchen cant prepare a fruit plate The rooms are very claustrophobic The reception who is also responsible for concierge and guest relations made us felt like they would only recommend the restaurants that they would make a commission It wasnt worth the money at all Never again , The location was good It was walking distance to the main attractions in Amsterdam 
386358,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, All the staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast is to die for loads of choice big buffet Huge comfy bed Very modern looking Fully stocked bar Great location Great place Would stay again Would recommend to others 
386359,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was a distinct shortage of space in the breakfast room meaning on our final morning the staff had to improvise and put 6 of us 3 non related couples in a side room I have to say that I think it is a bit over priced frankly , Location is excellent only 1 or 2 streets back from the Damrak so very central Staff were polite and courteous and room was clean tidy and comfortable Certainly a very stylish hotel 
386360,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Staff were lovely the hotel is stunning well worth the extra money If you go for the breakfast option you will not be disappointed there is something for everyone and as much as you like 
386361,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing at all , The Ink is conveniently located with less than a 10min walk to Central Station and a 5 min walk to Dam Square Good tram links from both The staff at Reception were so helpful with queries about public transport good restaurants nearby storing luggage etc Even help printing out boarding cards prior to departure Breakfast is superb and most definitely worth including in the room rate Everything about the hotel is lovely comfy beds and quiet rooms with plenty of personal touches upstairs and down My teenage son thought it was brilliant too A real oasis to return to after a busy day sightseeing If returning to AMS I would definitely choose to stay here again 
386362,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The bar men were really friendly remembered us and asked what we d been up to and made recommendations on places to visit and eat The hotel is in a great location too and is really quirky My second stay here and would highly recommend 
386363,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The breakfast area quite small and often had to wait to be seated , Excellent choice of breakfast cooked or continental plus pastries cereals and juices Very good 
386364,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, In general in Amsterdam the hotels had bad quality price a little expensive, Is in the centrum of the city Near the central station Confortable The staff fantastic 
386365,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, It was a little pricey but for what you get and where it is I still think it was worth it , The room was really comfortable the location was great and the staff was very helpful and attentive 
386366,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I can t think of anything, The restaurant serves amazing food Very talented chefs The staff clearly enjoy working at this beautiful stylish hotel They were so very friendly welcoming and always ready to chat about Amsterdam life 
386367,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The smallest double room I think I ve ever occupied and it was expensive There was no view the window was sealed and the air conditioning appeared to be working but wasn t , Although boutique hotels and their gimmicks don t appeal to me this was well placed in the city and very well maintained 
386368,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Very comfortable bed lovely thick bath robes and nice toiletries Breakfast although not cheap had an extensive selection and the coffee was excellent Quirky wallpaper 
386369,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Locations are superior executive actual room executive was really small it isn t high class just regular for everything in it We have traveller a lot and for our experience it s only locations not a site 
386370,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Staff were polite but didn t build up a rapport at all I felt they could have been a little more informative explained the facilities available such as bar times etc If they had we would have been more inclined to eat drink at the hotel The bed was really uncomfortable I woke up with a sore back after our two night stay , I liked the fact we were able to leave our case after we had checked out could collect it later on that day I liked that we had a nespresso coffee machine in the room Also that the hotel was very clean in all areas 
386371,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, N A, Excellent location u can go to the CS on foot with luggage boxes and arrive at Dam Squre in 5 minutes on foot We recommend Yellow Bike Tour for the guest stay in hotel which is only 50 meters awayl and will bring a very interesting journey Besides the taste of room decoration is nice we love the TV wall very much 
386372,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Price I thought for what we paid breakfast should have been free , Location Near Central Station Cruise terminal tour office Tram stop was right in front of the hotel Has a nice restaurant

386376,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room little small diffilcult to open our suitcase It would be good to know in advance how to park because if you arive first time you are lost, Very friendly check in All staff extremely friendly Very young design with sence of humor Dinner quality excellent but to mix individual couples and party group is not good idea should be little separated it was noisy Breakfast good quality and presentation most staff attentative passion fruit smoothie and home made cakes different every day Location just perfect close to all POI and walking distance Comfortable bathrobe
386377,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The brass panel above the bed was absolutely covered in hand prints and finger prints Very noticeable slightly off putting , The room was a really nice size The hotel was a 3 minutes walk from the centre square 
386378,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Funky modern bedrooms with nice features like a Nespresso machine Seriously comfortable beds and great showers Friendly informative staff and very welcoming

386380,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The division in the bathrooms are very modern but not too practical Breakfast too expensive 25 per person , Very nice decoration in a coompletely renewed hotel 
386381,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Probably the hotel s only fault was its lack of a computer accessible to guests , The breakfasts were splendid but what really set this hotel apart for me was its design modern chic with lots of edgy art works 
386382,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The shower leaked if you didn t have it just right but not bad , We went to Amsterdam as part of our honeymoon My husband was skeptical about letting me choose the hotel we stayed in since I am the frugal one but we were both blown away with the service we received The staff decorated our room with a ton chocolate hearts everywhere There was even a rose and a champagne bottle waiting for us Everyone was incredibly friendly and always smiling The breakfast was delicious The coffee was incredible I am a vegetarian and my husband is pure carnivore and we were both very happy We went back for breakfast everyday it was so good including after going out to find somewhere new we returned to the hotel for the breakfast we really wanted The atmosphere is great and the design is unique and so cool We loved our stay and miss Amsterdam already 
386383,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I wouldn t say the rooms were exactly cosy or very good value for money but it s a boutique hotel , It was clean and very stylish The bed was very large and comfortable We got a nespresso machine with free coffee and free water in the fridge The air conditioning was very welcome 
386384,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We did have to call multiple times to get out 50 Euro holding deposit down which wasn t acceptable The hotel admitted fault but it s still not good enough , Lovely hotel and staff 
386385,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room top floor was a little small due to the slope of roof , Good central location close to transport and various attractions Hotel in good condition throughout
386386,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, All pillows and bedding need to be washed as we found a drop of dried blood on one of our pillows , Great location made it easy to get around Staff were very helpful

386388,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The shower door squeaked very loudly so there was no showering quietly if your partner is sleeping but not a big deal Wish there was a sheet to cover with when it got hot rather than just a comforter but that may be a European thing , Although the room is on the smaller side it s very well fashioned and we felt like we had plenty of space Bed was comfortable 
386389,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, You need an illuminated sign on the street you are easy to miss A top sheet Could not figure out the coffee maker A non skid shower deck , The staff were superb the facilities were good
386390,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not having a door on shower as water escaped and not having a person to help carry bags, Position so convenient staff very friendly Room lovely and clean 
386391,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, the dinner meal Not a big selection and didn t enjoy the meal at all But ended up eating out and the rest of the motel was great , the atmosphere of this hotel room was good It had a shower which we prefer over standing in a bath Getting older it is hard to get into a shower 
386392,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, The hotel d cor was very modern which I love The location was close to everything train station canals restaurants Anne Frank house etc The staff was always very pleasant They even decorated our room for our special occasion including proseco and chocolates which were a nice surprise The bed and room were very comfortable The restaurant in the hotel called the pressroom was so good that we ate there 3 times in 2 days The food had top quality and presentation I would definitely stay there and eat there again 
386393,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, For nightly price we paid could have included breakfast as part of deal , Newly renovated well appointed room and bathroom Hotel allowed us after prior e mail request to book into our rooms as soon as we arrived 2 hours early after 30 hours of international air travel Staff including cleaning staff all genuinely happy and very helpful Cleanliness 
386394,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The moment we stepped in we loved it My husband I stayed here for three nights The former home of the Dutch newspaper the design unique quirky Loved the scribbles on the walls of the room Spacious clean modern comfortable room Even though it was right smack in the heart of Amsterdam when you are in your room it was quiet peaceful Great location Minutes to the train station canals and points of interest The staff exceptional Friendly courteous helpful and have a great sense of humor Had a wonderful memorable stay 
386395,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The rooms were the smallest I have stayed in only really ideal for a single person No privacy from the W C and shower into the room , The location was fantastic
386396,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Great location great staff I was there on a stag do and they had a good attitude with us We all said we would come back with our good ladies if we returned to Amsterdam The reception smelt like a Four Seasons too 
386397,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The prize of the breakfast A member of staff at reception making a rude joke about my surname pretty sure that wouldn t have happened if I d been male General mood of staff seemed uninterested , Great location in the heart of Amsterdam Being able to rent bicycles directly from the hotel Quiet at night and close to central station 
386398,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There is a range of rooms which all sound like they would be superior But the space in the rooms bathrooms cupboards are all a bit squeezed into a fairly tight space This was in the case in our Superior Executive Room Supposedly three up the scale , Even at a discount of 20 euros breakfast was expensive 
386399,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The shower door don t close perfectly and wet the bathroom floor, the confort the theme ink No need map it was on the wall with funny comments pleasant to read hahaha Situation between central station and centre
386400,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Can t think of anything to improve , Great location in the middle of the Central City Could walk everywhere Room was very nicely appointed Liked the drawings on the wall Staff was very friendly and helpful Good value especially for location 
386401,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Hotel was very secure Rooms were compact but had all the amenities Beds were very comfortable The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgable helping all the tourists navigate Amsterdam Great location walking distance to Dame Square with transportation available in front of building 15 minute train ride from airport to Dame Square I m sorry we didn t accept the breakfast offer as it would have been much more value for our dollar as they offer a buffet with unlimited choices and coffee Would definitely stay here again 
386402,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, Great location Fabulous staff incredibly friendly and helpful Very comfortable beds Amazing breakfast Overall a wonderful stay in a quirky and striking hotel 
386403,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The lighting in the bathroom was a bit dim for putting on makeup, Bed was comfortable room was a good size loved the mural on the wall Front desk staff were very helpful
386404,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The price of breakfast seemed very high for what was included Drinks at the bar were also super expensive as compared to other places nearby , Fantastic hotel right in City Center The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly Appreciated the free wifi complimentary bottles of water and the fitness center 
386405,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, This property is ideally placed and all the staff were so friendly and helpful The rooms are not overly large but so well planned that it works Particularly like the wall paper telling story of area Restaurant excellent and so helpful to my wife who is coeliac 
386406,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Room size a little small and weekend rate quite pricey This is not exactly a luxury hotel but a small trendy well designed comfortable boutique hotel , Great find Smallish executive room but well planned so everything to hand Really comfy beds Staff were super friendly bar area relaxed and inviting to either eat drink or just chill after a day out Great location for Central station Dam Sq would stay again 
386407,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Booking com s exchange rate is a bit dodgy the hotel turned out to be more expensive not the hotel s fault because Booking com quote in Sterling but you re charged at the hotel in Euros and the two figures bear little resemblance Make sure you look at the small euro figure and not the large sterling price quoted by this website , One of the nicest hotels I ve stayed at I noticed it has won an award for best Amsterdam hotel in 2016 and I m not surprised Staff are very helpful wifi is excellent the whole place is really clean bed and shower are excellent too Breakfast was great with friendly service Step out of the hotel cross the road and keep heading west on foot and in five minutes you are in Jordaan a wonderfully picturesque area with small cafes and shops and atmospheric streets One of the main shopping streets with high shops like Zara and H M but also Hema which has nice stationary and stamps which make great presents for kids runs along the rear of the hotel handy but rather generic I walked everywhere museum district is 30 minutes so after an exhausting day it was great to return to such a nice place And just 10 minutes on foot from Central Station 
386408,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We booked a luxury room with king size bed but the size of room is very limited so that we could not open the big luggage properly It is far from my understanding of luxury room The glass partition for bathtub doesn t work functionally which is too short to block the water coming out So the part of bathroom is easily wet I think it is not a good solution as we shall find the balance between art and feasible solution , It has good design and decoration and he breakfast is very organic and multiple optional The location is very good where you could find very good restaurant nearby The staff are always helpful and kind of guest 
386409,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing to dislike at this excellent hotel , INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery is an excellent hotel Wonderful location in the center of the city with good access to public transportation Reception staff is very gracious friendly and exceedingly helpful with good suggestions about restaurants day trips and other travel matters which they facilitate very efficiently Hotel is very clean household staff courteous and Pressroom restaurant is quite good This is a hotel that we will certainly return to on our next visit

386411,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, nothing you have it nailed , Bed incredibly comfortable room was clean and loved the wall drawings Staff all very helpful great location superb breakfast 
386412,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Very small bedroom room no storage So little space the safe was in the bathroom It was OK for one person but very tight for two We requested a bath instead of shower when we booked several months in advance No one got back to us to tell us there were only baths in the executive rooms and extra 65 euros a night Housekeeping poor The bathroom door which was about twelve inches away from the bed squeaked so loudly we had to ask for it to be oiled within minutes of arriving which was done quickly We had t ask for facecloths and shampoo which were not replaced after the first night The shelf in the shower meant for toiletries was at such an angle it was impossible to use We stayed at this hotel when it was the Convent it has undergone a major refurbishment and is now very minimalist and trendy and obviously geared towards business people We would not go back We did not think it was good value , Location 5 minutes from Central Station and Dam Square UK power and USB points in the room Plenty of power points Thick dressing gowns and nice towels and great shower Very friendly pleasant and helpful staff Good breakfast but very expensive if not included in the rate Air Con not very effective and got very warm as the room was so small No extraction in the bathroom so steamed up very quickly 
386413,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Air conditioning rattled shower drain didn t drain properly so couldn t take a shower longer than 5 minutes without making a mess Also very damp humid in the hotel , Friendly staff great location 
386414,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, I loved the size of the bed and how I was able to blank out all the noise and light I loved the design and layout of the room Will be gong back hopefully in December 
386415,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, We had dinner at the hotel and me and my gf both had same thing The presentation was amazing and mine tasted great unluckily though my gfs meal was abit undercooked We didn t say anything until after because we didn t want to cause any problems , Overall vibe is great super friendly staff and lovely comfy bed 
386416,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and couldn t have been more helpful our luxury King room was lovely We definitely chose one of the best hotel in the area 
386417,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing It was fantastic , The staff were all AMAZING I have never met a more friendly or accommodating staff in any hotel anywhere The location was great too We celebrated my daughter s birthday at the Pressroom restaurant in the hotel and they did an outstanding job I will certainly stay here again 
386418,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The twin room was very small with no hooks in the bathroom for towels or robes We were moved to a slightly bigger room but had I not been with my sister the facilities had no privacy and were way too intimate , Most of the staff were excellent helpful and friendly We had problems at check in with a staff member who didn t know the protocol for taking swipes of credit cards The hotel is cool and quirky and very well located for the Central Station Dam Square and canals 
386419,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Accor did not give us points since we booked on bookings com And that s a really big issue Also the bike rental could be cheaper and option for kid seat, Super staff Theme Hotel Warm comfy rooms Tram stop across 10 mins Walk to Centraal station I ll stay here again 
386420,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The pillows were very odd shaped and 4 days later I still have a very painful neck injury from the last night of stay at the hotel Pillows are normally rectangular and flat so as not to cause injury A pity because the hotel is good otherwise , INK is in a great location and is handy to attractions tour bookings and facilities like laundromat and convenience store There is a one drawer fridge which is handy for milk or water in the room We used it a lot because we only drink bottled water on our international trip Also having real milk instead the UHT crap for tea was a blessing 
386421,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Pretty much perfect but would have been nice for a few extras to be included in the room or upon arrival, Comfy beds lovely quirky rooms modern gorgeous boutique hotel with great bar cocktails and food Great staff too as well as excellent location
386422,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Buffet breakfast at 25 is overpriced especially since we ate only criossants and coffee One member of staff at breakfast did not seem to have been trained very well and appeared a tad surly Free water in the room would have been a nice gesture , General ambience of the hotel Very modern and contemporary Overall friendliness genuine helpfulness and efficiency of staff they actually appeared to enjoy working at your hotel Surprisingly high quality food at dinner evening in the restaurant Location is perfect for a weekend sightseeing in Amsterdam
386423,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The only thing it lacked was some outdoor space to relax in when the weather was good , The staff at the Ink was amazing so friendly and helpful They made us feel welcome and were responsive to all our requests The hotel is modern and stylish Our rooms were cute clean and very comfortable although some didn t have great views 
386424,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Very Small Size of Room Breakfast Varieties we had requested a King size bed and when we checked in we found that they dont have King size beds , Location is very near to central Station and Dame Square with almost a Tram Station infront of the Hotel so you can go every where easily Most of the Staff are very Helpful Breakfast was average
386425,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Very clean room with a fantastic comfy bed Lovely nespresso coffee in room Easy access to central station and near all the best attractions yet very quiet and peaceful area Perfect 
386426,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing could have been better If we stayed longer we might have eaten in the restaurant Nothing to complain about at all , Very modern and clean hotel There was a friendly staff to greet us We got a drink at the bar late and were very happy to find the library where we could talk over some drinks 
386427,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Lack of privacy for bathroom Design of main door from bedroom to bathroom caused it to not fully close Partial glass door wall on shower so bathroom floor always wet after shower , Great location clean and comfy beds Well presented Friendly and helpful staff Coffee and tea provided in room Good wifi 
386428,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Staff are not so compatiable When I raised a question on bills they can only come back with a reason on the overcharged after over half an hour Most of the conversation between the two staff serving us are conducted in Dutch we led us to think that they did not want us to know what were the conversation Eventually that billing problem was resolved but it took an hour to rectify that When we queued to check in it took us more than 20 minutes though we were only second to the guest being served The staff apparently were not focused Rooms are quite small though clean I think the room is not large enough for two guests to stay at the same time , Location It is very near to the train station It is within walking distance to the old town 
386429,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The room could have bee a bit bigger but then I m being really picky , Great location and staff service were excellent Great bar downstairs too 
386430,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Unfortunately we were in a room just above the bar and there were two parties arganised which meant we had a lot of noise from the music Don t book rooms on the first floor at the front of the hotel over a weekend , The cocktails are amazing definitely worth a visit to the bar All the staff are extremely helpful 
386431,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There was a sock under the bed when we first entered the room Didn t like that there were some marks on the wall , Bathroom was clean beds were comfy Good location restaurant food was nice Staff were also friendly

386434,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The hotel was nice My only complaint was that our room was not availailbe for us to check in until after 6 00 pm Since our flight arrived early we had our luggage held since that morning and came back in the afternoon There should have been no reason for our room not to be ready by check in time 2 00 pm Also note if you are not traveling with someone very close to you the bathroom did not have a separate door to provide privacy for showering open to room area , Friendly helpful staff Clean nice hotel Fun wallpaper Espresso machine in room Close to Dam Square 
386435,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The beds were unbelievably comfy the staff were so helpful and polite and the hotel was in the best possible location Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam and I will definitely going back 
386436,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Despite do not disturb we were woken by room service at 8 10am 225 per night for a Monday and Tuesday simply does not represent value for money At check in I was told that the 225 oer night excluded breakfast and when I challenged this as value for money I was told at check in weclome to Amsterdam prices which is far from the customer service expected of this chain The layout of the rooms is odd the superior king room was completely dominated by the superior king bed the separate toilet was very small and claustraphobic and the shower leaked onto the floor outside which given the floor wasn t the bathroon due to the open plan payout was pretty poor Better hotels avasilable in better lcoation for far better money , Bed extremely comfy hotel very modern and boutique style 
386437,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The design of the hotel was very hip Attentiveness of staff from prior to arrival answering and providing solution to our enquiries as well as questions we have during our stay Location was excellent a few minutes walk from Dam Square Breakfast was excellent 
386438,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Should provide toothbrush in room as one of the basic hygiene items Could improve on housekeeping faulty phone in room was not rectified during stay , Location and very nice hotel interior
386439,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I think a light blanket in the room would have been good as the Duvets were very hot and there was nothing else to put over you , The breakfast was great the assortment of food was amazing all very tasty and fresh This hotel should be highly considered for comfort staff food value and location So glad we chose the INK 
386440,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The walls are super thin You hear everything around your room running water maids neighbors The bed wasn t very comfortable , The breakfast was great and the staff always friendly and helpful

386444,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The wardrobe was way too tiny We couldnt hang our clothes properly and never got to unpack really , The front office staff are outstandingly friendly yet highly professional Their command of the English language is excellent Hospitality at its best 
386445,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Because Amsterdam is quite compact the garbage disposal during early hours of morning disputes everybody including Guests on this hotel , Location was excellent with Tram lines near front of Hotel giving choice of 5 different routes

386453,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, We paid extra for an executive room the pictures shown when booking an executive room is nothing you receive rooms are only small so would be better value for money booking a standard room instead of being disappointed apart from that hotel was lovely and modern with very helpful staff

386520,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The double room was too small for us we paid extra and had a deluxe room Would of been nice to have a few drawers under the large desk or by the bedside table it did lack storage space , We ate breakfast and evening meal in the restaurant the evening meal was fine dining wonderful 10 10
386521,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not a problem for me but some guests sharing a room may find the open layout of the bathroom to be a little too exposed to the rest of the room , The whole staff from the front desk to the restaurant and the housekeeping were all absolutely lovely The public spaces are welcoming and my executive room was spacious and well designed Both breakfast and dinner in the restaurant are excellent Centrally located and easily accessible 
386522,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Unfortunately doors leading to the rooms continually banged shut through the night Also the doors leading to the shower and toilet had a tendency to bang if they were not held while shutting All this noise lead to very broken sleep during my stay, sraff were friendly the hotel was clean and tidy

386534,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There were a few disappointing aspects Firstly the view or lack there of The only view was of a wall of the back of a building a couple of metres away which actually made the room rather dark This was an unpleasant surprise as I d paid extra for a superior double presuming that would increase the chances of a better view and I had requested if possible a view upon booking Secondly at breakfast there were a number of issues Both days we had to wait a while to be seated as there was not enough room We were not told about breakfast finishing early on the Sunday due to an event in the hotel Luckily we arrived half an hour before breakfast was due to finish however it appeared the hotel staff were clearly prioritising the event over their clientele as staff cleared most of the pastries and all of the juices away half an hour before breakfast was due to finish in order to get ready for the event so we missed out on some items I noticed some dinners missed out on hot food altogether Also getting a cup of coffee is quite difficult at breakfast time Dirty coffee cups were also left in our room after the first day and the air conditioning did not seem to work well So there were a few niggles which were disappointing for the price but we have great memories of our time here , Ink hotel takes cool to a whole new level The whole hotel is so stylish and edgy All the staff be it the concierge the bar staff or the cleaning are so amenable and helped us book excursions The rooms certainly have the wow factor The drinks at the bar are second to none the bar is certainly worth a visit even if you are not staying at the hotel

386537,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, There is nothing that I can say that I didn t like Location was great with a tram right in front of the hotel , My wife and I went to Amsterdam as our last trip before the baby is born The staff treated her and I wonderfully they recommended restaurants let us borrow an umbrella on the rainy day never said no to anything we asked for The rooms are small not too small but super trendy and functional clean and provide you with robes slippers Nespresso tea along with the other typical hotel ammenities The breakfast that was included was very good and you could order unlimited hot drinks and staff again was very friendly and helpful 
386538,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast was good but but busy and service slightly slow because of it but nothing was too much for the staff and they did everything with a smile The whole print theme is fab the staff are dressed in funky aprons , Rooms are excellent Modern fun and vibrant Beds are huge and extra comfy too Staff are so smiley and pleasant the Dutch are super friendly I think location is superb as you can reach all areas easily you are in the middle But hotel is really great you can t go wrong with this place worth the money to get a decent room

386544,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, I really think they got their colour scheme wrong Walking out of the elevator to black corridors was a bit depressing I know it s supposed to represent the INK but it really doesn t work , The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is very close to train station just one stop on the tram also very close to the centre There was a great choice for breakfast and great service from the breakfast staff The room was very clean and comfy

386546,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Genuinely it was all great All the little things were done , Even with the central location INK wasn t cheap but wow it s worth every penny It walks that think line between Arty and Classy so the room felt very cool The wall had had drawn honest maps of Amsterdam on them which was great for planning our walks Bar drinks and nibbles were good loads of fresh juice and water available though we skipped breakfast 25 If you are looking for something special that will make you appear to have put in even more thought than you have This is the one 
386547,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, My Superior room had a view straight into someone s bed and he didn t close his curtains so I couldn t look out Perhaps Superior rooms should have a better view , The quirky bedrooms with little extra touches were great The staff were extremely professional and courteous The hotel had a cosy but contemporary feel 
386548,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Although the front entrance is swept it would be better to have a cigarette bin out front as it gets untidy with cigarette ends, Rooms were great food excellent bar grest staff excellent
386549,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Spaces are small and narrow just like anywhere in Amsterdam After the first site we changed our classic room to a luxury one for extra money of course but that was not really luxury either Not the one you see on the photo Amsterdam is very filthy why don t they put waste bins in the streets , Modern design nice and creative lobby area friendly staff Food is awesome in the hotel compared to the not so high Dutch standard The city has a very individual atmosphere 
386550,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Too warm the in room air con didn t do anything to cool room down was very stuffy Given the room cost breakfast was an additional 25 when it should have been included For some reason bathroom door when shut left gaps on both sides of door not ideal if traveling with others as no privacy , Very friendly helpful staff at reception Good bar with delicious range of cocktails Handy to Centraal station

386552,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The bad If you re a family with baby ies there is little infrastructure in place for them We were pretty much forced to move to a more expensive room at check in so a hotel provided crib could fit The crib was not very child friendly several plastic pointy edges and the hotel did not have baby seats at their restaurant Elevators were small and slow Eventually one of the only two of them they had broke down so it made things even slower At some points in the day check in and check out there was a cue for the elevators The hotel room was nice but it was more focused on being hip than it was on providing comfort At a point it became full of little nuisances that made it a bit less of a great experience It is still a very good place to stay and good value for your money , The good The staff was outstandingly helpful and nice The restaurant is very good The hotel is clean and very well located 
386553,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, The bar staff were incredibly slow It wasn t that busy and getting a drink was a bit of a mission , The front of house staff were very helpful though

386567,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, Not a bad experience for me but I can imagine that the twin room with the open bathroom is not suitable for people who are not close to each other like colleagues , The way the small space of the room was used in such a useful and comfortable way everything was there very practical Comfortable beds

386587,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, It is expensive and it seems ridiculous the breakfast isn t included in the price If it had been we would have been more likely to have tried dinner there too Also you only receive complementary water the first night It is probably not that suitable for new couples as there is minimal privacy between the bedroom and bathroom , This is a very stylish hotel and the rooms are very comfortable The beds are excellent and the black out curtains work very well I slept really well here 
386588,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The hotel was recently renovated and is lovely and comfortable Marcel at the front desk is an absolute gem Be sure to ask him for advice he s happy to help and so enthusiastic The rooms are really quiet despite being on a busy street We never heard street noise or other rooms The location is great too There s a tram stop right out front so in addition to being walking distance from Centraal Station and a lot of sights it s an easy tram ride to even more

386603,INK Hotel Amsterdam MGallery by Sofitel, 1 For a superior room it was tiny We have stayed in many hotels in Amsterdam which were much more spacious for the price 2 The lack of privacy with the bathroom There was no lock on the toilet door and no separation between the bedroom and bathroom 3 The walls were like paper I heard someone sneeze in the next room when I was in our bathroom Also when people bang their front doors it feels like the whole building shakes 4 The air con was temperamental and there was no guide to help us understand it With no opening windows in the room the air con was essential , 1 The staff were outstanding Extremely helpful friendly and kind No queues for check in check out 2 The location was perfect right in the hub of everything 3 The facilities were great molton brown goodies We felt that the overall rating of the hotel was between 6 and 7 out of 10 and couldn t understand how the majority of reviews were up in the 9 10 mark but now I realise it s because of booking com calculating your overall review score so I had to mark a couple of things down to get an average score of 7 10
