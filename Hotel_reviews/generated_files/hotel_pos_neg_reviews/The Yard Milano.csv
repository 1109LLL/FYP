410282,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Super cool hotel in excellent location Staff were really great rooms were really spacious and uber cool in decor Loved the arrival drink and nibbles and would have loved to stay longer 
410283,The Yard Milano, Is not about hotel but I like warm bfast but is have to pay extra for it if bfast is included why do I have to pay extra for eggs and etc , Everything The first day when I walk in I thought I saw the KFC man seating in the chair was so cute but is not is the owner of the hotel honestly I love this hotel 
410284,The Yard Milano, Hmm everything is perfect Maybe a few more hangers in the room and an iron , Attention to detail Staff very helpful but still honour your privacy Love that you can be on your own have a glass of wine in one of the beautiful sitting rooms but still see other groups of people Love the decor 
410285,The Yard Milano, Nothing everything was perfect, Amazing hotel in the great location great service very cool design staff is very friendly and helpful Will definitely stay there again 
410286,The Yard Milano, Nothing , Suite was great with an individual design for each room The breakfast and the service were excellent No hesitation in recommending this boutique hotel
410287,The Yard Milano, On the day of check out I had to leave the city suddently because of a personal emergency and could not go to the hotel and take my belongings Immedialtely informed the hotel and asked them to pack my few things and keep them for me They refused to do so and kept charging me for the room stating that I had to go back and check out After two days I finally found a person that went to the hotel to pack my belongings and move them out of the room to the storage room When you purchase a 600 euro per night room this should not happen , hotel decor is trendy and stililsh
410288,The Yard Milano, Would have enjoyed if an egg Dish would be included fit breakfast , Cooles Hotel I stayed at and i ve seen quite a few Great staff awesome rooms Location close to Navigli atmosphere is great 
410289,The Yard Milano, The hallways are tiled and not carpeted which means that all noises are amplified beware of loud and inconsiderate guests , The decor of the hotel is stunning Modern boutique hotel with an eclectic range of vintage decorations Stepping inside the lobby is like walking into a furniture shop Great place to unwind with a night cap as an alternative to the bar scene Rooms are spacious and clean with all the mod cons Staff are warm and friendly The closest metro station was a good 10 15 minutes on foot but the tram stop is just up the street with a couple of lines going directly to the Duomo The hotel is not the easiest to find i walked straight past it looking for signage it s behind heavy black metal gates Breakfast is nothing to write home about you get brought a set range of pastries museli yoghurt and juice Anything else can be ordered a la carte at an additional cost Great Roman restaurant a few minutes from hotel Cacio e Pepe which has fantastic authentic carbonara 
410290,The Yard Milano, milanese weather it was pouring when we arrived, wonderful quirky hotel fabulous themed room fairway in our case communal breakfast with lovely couple from Canada location once we explored was by the canals had lots of places to eat and wander
410291,The Yard Milano, our room was on ground floor and it was looking towards the lobby yard and was noisy , beautifully designed hotel very accurate interesting and unique details huge junior suite lots of sitting corner around the lobby and great bar and morning restaurant very friendly and helpful staff beautiful location on the canals 
410292,The Yard Milano, Our A C broke down twice during our stay , One of the most amazing boutique hotels we ve stayed in I highly recommend the stars stripes luxury suite Its on another level The staff without exception were very helpful and friendly The Duomo area is a 10 15min walk away or tram line 3 just around the corner takes you directly to it The Navigali canal with cafes resturants are just across the street We loved every min of our stay 
410293,The Yard Milano, Limited kitchen capabilities but the owners are building a restaurant so this will not be a problem anymore, This has become our favorite hotel in Milan The atmosphere is such that every corner feels like your private living room 
410294,The Yard Milano, I only stayed one night and barely managed to enjoy the full greatness of the venue , Probably the nicest hotel experience I have had in Europe to day even better than a few 5 I have been hosted by given the absolutely embracing and unique environment crafted with wit and heart the impeccable guest service blending international professionalism standards and genuine Italian hospitality and the strategic position in the heart of the city Full grades for a great job with creating a classy and yet warm nest in the city centre looking forward to going back 
410295,The Yard Milano, Nothing, Great boutique hotel Small cozy feels like coming home Enormous attention to styling details which makes the whole difference Big clean rooms Very proffesional and helping staff Excelent bar and cocktails Perfect location by navigly district Lots of excellent restaurants and bars Car parking in house convenient 
410296,The Yard Milano, Hmmm no trash bin in the bathroom , Great Family Boutique hotel As regular travellers it was one of the best hotel we had the chance to visit The Hotel itself is one of a kind with a very good interior decoration and very strong design personality The staff is amazing and makes you feel very comfortable The hotel is cosy the room are spacious and modern Breakfast is very good and serve until late in the morning We try not to came back to a hotel twice when we visit the same city but we might make an exception for this one Thank you for having us 
410297,The Yard Milano, Room was not properly maintained needs a lot of walls to be fixed and painted breakfast was poor and got charged extra for basic scrambled eggs 7 for 250 per nigh Shaka room decor is way to cheap Was expecting WOW BAM got ahah minus , very nice reception staff big room
410298,The Yard Milano,No Negative, ncredible atmosphere and very good designed hotel t makes you smile in every detail From the rooms to elevator from the details on the walls up to very positive receptionists 
410299,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Quite simply exceptional personal touches attention to detail amazing staff that are only too happy to help in any way possible a real boutique experience that we ve not found anywhere else Safe to say we would stay again in a heartbeat Highly recommend if you want something a little different 
410300,The Yard Milano, The only minus was that the toilet didn t smell clean And as always in hotels too many light switches in different places It took me 5 minutes to turn them all off at night , Everything was super Calm and cosy atmosphere Comfortable bed A big plus was the breakfast served at the table no running around at a buffet 
410301,The Yard Milano,No Negative, We did enjoy every single minet Uniq hotel very polite staff great location nayborhood with atmosphere Definitely when we are in Milano will stay in The Yard hotel Highly recommended 
410302,The Yard Milano,No Negative, A lovely quirky place with an unbelievable collection of memorabilia on display that will impress lovely staff excellent service lovely breakfast and one of the most comfortable beds I ve slept in The hotel is within walking distance from the major attractions but if you are not up to a 30 min walk you can always take the tram that stops literally around the corner and is there every 5 mins Loved the place
410303,The Yard Milano, The staff were mixed Front of house and the owner most charming and welcoming The bar staff rather grumpy and struggling to cope when busy Had to wait too long to be served despite sitting at the bar Room was too hot and dark needed to turn on the air con to battle the heating in October , The place looks fabulous lots of quirky and fun objects and furniture A warm welcome and well equipped rooms Loved the breakfasts a unique approach and most enjoyable Also situated in a great part of town
410304,The Yard Milano, The only comment we would have goes to the breakfast which was very nicely presented but not at a level one would expect at a hotel of this level , The whole feeling of the hotel and setup is just fabulous friendly staff that makes you feel at home imaginative interior decor of the breakfast lounge areas with endless detail of design and comfortable theemed rooms provide for a truly unique experience The location is also very nice within the vibrant Navigli district and walking distance to the Duomo and other major attractions 
410305,The Yard Milano,No Negative, I loved the canine mascot Pina She put a smile on my face every time I entered the hotel The staff at The Yards was outstanding and made us feel very pampered The neighborhood is happening lots of restaurants bistros and bars 
410306,The Yard Milano, Cleaning taking place at 4 in the afternoon Maintenance staff leaving tools out in access areas Inadequate lighting on stairs Faulty lock on ladies toilet It all felt a bit chaotic , Stephanie breakfast staff lovely lady Breakfast basket was very nice albeit purely continental without a choice Lovely room and bathroom with a very large comfortable be Lovely toiletries Secure parking Very convenient location 
410307,The Yard Milano,No Negative, There s not a lot I can say other than this is probably one of the best hotels I ve ever stayed in gorgeous decor fantastic staff and delicious breakfasts This hotel alone is worth a trip to Milan Worth every penny 
410308,The Yard Milano, Nothing It was amazing , This hotel is like nothing else It s quirky interior has your eyes darting from one unusual object to the next The bar is amazing with a great selection to choose from Our room didn t have a number but a name Roquet and is on the 2nd floor at the back of the hotel Fantastic room with a lovely view over the tree tops in the courtyard The hotel is also in an excellent location with loads of little restaurants and bars nearby or the number 3 tram into Central Milan just 100m away Would not stay anywhere else in Milan 
410309,The Yard Milano, Quality of the workmanship in our penthouse suite was mediocre sink basin in the lounge room did not have running water no utensils for cooking hole within the tiling shower room and some light switches visible but serve no purpose After waiting 40 minutes on arrival to be assigned our pre booked and paid in full due to a technical issue as we were told Only had one towel one bathrobe the staff corrected immediately after calling the Yard staff , The overall hotel was very unique and quite eclectic creating a very pleasant environment The suite was obviously quite new and reflected the sailing d cor The Yard achieved The floor was new immaculate along with a beautiful navy ocean blue paint throughout Bed size was fantastic balcony was superb with two entry exits on each end Honor system for 3 varieties of Gin in the suite 
410310,The Yard Milano, We paid much more for this small room than we paid at the Garda Lake in a 5 star hotel We paid in Aosta in a fantastic hotel less than half the price In Hotel Leonardo ex Hermitage we pay nearly one third We will never go there again , The croissants were OK The room was a bit small but fairly clean We did not understand why there was wood for an open fire There is no open fire available 
410311,The Yard Milano, Bathroom floor tile joints need re grouting , Exceptionally well designed and run hotel Really felt like a unique place which values the quality of the guests stay 
410312,The Yard Milano, It is starting to look a little shabby might need a new coat of paint in some places , The place was so cool and different I loved the interior design and themes of the rooms I also loved the staff who were so kind and friendly without being fake and the dog Pina 
410313,The Yard Milano,No Negative, The interior of hotel was something else Really cozy and inspiring Rooms were comfortable large with lot of amenities The staff is excellent The position of hotel is close to lot of restaurants nightlife and navigli canal Old city center is also close and you can rent a bicycle from hotel free of charge 
410314,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Excellent stay even though it was just one night room was super clean staff was great helpful with directions So many cool Antiques mixed in with unique lounging eating areas Fantastic continental breakfast included Would stay there again next trip 
410315,The Yard Milano, I could hear the music from the bar in my room it was not loud but you could hear it, Really nice room excellent breakfast and amazing decoration Nice personal in the bar and the reception 
410316,The Yard Milano,No Negative, A hotel that is different in all the right ways Enjoyed everything about this hotel breakfast room and staff The rooms are all on a different sports theme and the public areas are full of fascinating items collected by the owners 
410317,The Yard Milano, Can t think of a thing , Location funky lobby and beautiful rooms with a wonderful staff Very intimate and cozy for those that like a unique and personal experience this is the place Oh and Pina the Hund 
410318,The Yard Milano,No Negative, The staff are very friendly the amosphere and decoration are breathtaking the manager and owner himself took special care of us they gave us a fantastic stay we are definitely going to stay in this hotel in our next time in Milan 
410319,The Yard Milano, The amenities we re second rate The aircon wasn t strong cool and the location wasn t exactly what we expected We had a bar which had a tap sink that didn t work so had to use the bathroom to wash cups glasses , The best feature of this hotel is it s bar lobby and overall decor Also the rooms are a great size 
410320,The Yard Milano, Upon arrival the staff were aloof and did not give the impression that they were interested in servicing the customer In fact the general opinion was that the customer owed them a favour This did not extend to the other two days of our stay and we had a nice time Some initial concerns problems with internet connection which the front desk was not able to assist with and shrugged their shoulders Pina the dog is a nice touch but not when she hangs about the tables when you are having breakfast I like dogs but hate it when they are like pigeons wanting to be fed The hotel charged me for the full amount of the stay in May even though the boooking com confirmation did not indicate that it was pre paid I was not aware of this before our visit so they charged the same amount at the conclusion of our stay Sloppy oversight on my part and theirs , The ambience and eclectic style 
410321,The Yard Milano, We wish we could have spent more time here Value was good Can t find anything to fault , Staff was helpful and interested in the quality our stay Room was large and well appointed Lobby was fun and interesting Area around the hotel was great fun to explore especially south of the canal at night 
410322,The Yard Milano, No room service available it would be good as well to have a tissue box in the bedroom , Veronika Christian were very helpful in recommending nice restaurants and places during our stay The design and ambiance of the hotel are just unique 
410323,The Yard Milano, No hot food but not big deal, Room amazing and the hotel takes you back to in time which give us a vacation mode and discover more inside hotel staff add value to hotel which helpful and welcoming and makes you feel at home location well connected and close by all attraction and good restaurants around
410324,The Yard Milano, a few mosquitoes that managed to enter our lovely room , Excellent service location super helpful cheerful staff brilliant atmosphere british town house camp kitsch which is v charming 
410325,The Yard Milano,No Negative, The staff was amazing location was amazing and the place was so cool and eclectic for the price its hands down the best value and price in Milan was comfortable and quite the staff meet all our needs Highly recommend this place to anyone stopping off in Milan for business or pleasure We will definantly be back Drinks are bar area were also amazing
410326,The Yard Milano, We enjoyed it all nothing not to like , Such a special quirky hotel If you want something different this is your hotel Staff are fabulous couldn t ask for more also great location 
410327,The Yard Milano,No Negative, No Glitz No glam No Marble entrance foyers No tacky gold fittings Just understated eclectic brilliance When your sick of the cliche up market hotels The Yard feels like home 
410328,The Yard Milano, We found a trouble connecting to the wifi from our room It did not recognise the wifi and had no signal I know if you go to visit a city you not want to hang on the internet but that was only way to communicate with our family We just needed to be in a bar until we spoke to everyone It might works in rooms located closer to the main reception as our room was the last on the corridor , Staff were very kind and helpful Bed was really comfy Loved the decoration and the atmosphere I would highly recommend Breakfast was amazing i would definately come back 
410329,The Yard Milano, We like to see more smiles from The Boxer at the door, The reception staff are charming and helpful Our room is very homely and we love to open the windows for the fresh air and the neighbourhood views We also look forward to the simple yet yummy breakfast basket every morning pastries are fresh and beautiful in a most different but nice environment than a normal hotel would have been able to offer 
410330,The Yard Milano, It would t hurt to have a bathroom scale, For mid income travellers the hotel probably is one of the best boutique hotel in Europe for both leisure and business trips And interesting I would like to add it is a living retro museum for guests absolutely not kitsch In evenings we had have no desire to leave it so comfortable and artistic the lobby is a lot of good art and design albums at any place there relaxing lightening a nice non clamant music from the bar Friendly naturally nice staff people 
410331,The Yard Milano, not a thing, Exceptional in the the level of detail the design the mood the breakfast the staff and felt a very rare unique experience I applaude the family of The Yard 
410332,The Yard Milano, Noisy cleaning team knocked 3 times at my door during 30 minutes till they got my signature to prove that I don t want the cleaning at afternoon when I prefered to rest before the opera I, A quiet and large room in a central area A good market on the other side of the street A good and popular restaurant Tricolore at 50 meters Staff very helpful and kind 
410333,The Yard Milano, Wasn t the cheapest place to stay but very difficult to criticise anything about this , Full of character and style This included the bar dinning area and rooms Staff were very warm and welcoming 
410334,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Owner and stuff treated us amazing The bar at the hotel is exceptional make sure you meet Stephano who is the head mixologist even if you re not a big drinker just watch him The atmosphere is so unique with so much character it s hard to describe but think about an authentic collection of antiques mixed with modern rooms and young professionals that run it Get their recommendations for restaurants and have them book it for you Overall a 10 
410335,The Yard Milano, It s a shame that the finishing is not what you would expect bit cheap like f e laminate floors in the rooms We asked the cleaning guy twice to put some tissues in our room but never got them , Very nice bar and atmosphere Big rooms Parking Friendly staff 
410336,The Yard Milano, The only thing i would reccomend the hotel is to open a proper kitchen they seemed to have the space to do that A cold breakfast is okay but it would have been nice to have the possibilty to eat there for lunch and dinner too as it is such a nice place , This hotel is super cool and chic a club ish type very hip and bar packed with beautiful people in the evening Not a family hotel The design is amazing very confortable and stylish rooms Staff very friendly and helpful little dog running around very cute We ll definitely come back 
410337,The Yard Milano, The comfort of the room itself was great beds space etc but the noise from the bar lounge area was obtrusively high until the early hours of the morning , A fascinating place to stay with an eclectic and funky decor individually themed rooms and generally welcoming and helpful staff
410338,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Truly unique hotel with lots of charm The hotel itself was a site and we had lots of fun exploring it The included breakfast is amazing and the staff could not have been more helpful I would go back to Milan just to stay here 
410339,The Yard Milano, We stayed in the Wicked Room which is wonderful although we missed a second sink in the bathroom and there was no place to hang our towels , Very beautiful hotel gorgeous room very helpful and nice personel We loved the breakfast baskets 
410340,The Yard Milano,No Negative, The Yard is an exceptionally good Hotel Not only rooms are remarkably designed clean and quiet but the hotel offers an awesome breakfast in the lounge which is in itself a place to see The location is then perfect if you want to explore the Navigli area and quickly connected 15 mins via light rail tram to the city center duomo etc 
410341,The Yard Milano,No Negative, Not a cookie cutter experience each room a retro collector s haven uniquely designed with the owner s original pieces from all over the world Breakfast completely delicious a basket of home grown goodies served with a warm smile Like staying in a friend s house with all the trimmings
410342,The Yard Milano, Rooms to the front can be a bit noisy Be mindful that the walking distance to the duomo is ca 20 minutes tram is available Maybe less appropriate as business hotel , Very friendly staff with warm welcome Early check in was not available understandable at 10am but nevertheless we were offered some coffee Nice decoration out of the ordinary both the lobby as the room Breakfast was excellent also really pleasant it is served until noon Nice location if you want to explore night life in the Bocconi university surrounding
410343,The Yard Milano, Some timing issues with house keeping on cleaning our room , Amazing bar and eclectic reception area that was interesting and comfortable to sit in particularly key was the great bar drinks for our aperitivo every afternoon at 5pm
410344,The Yard Milano, Nothing, Location Nice Area with lots of restaurants Friendly and very helpfull personel Lovely design decoration furniture Individually decorated rooms Excellent beds delicious breakfast Private parking You feel that the owners and the people that work there put their hart in it We would certainly come back again and recommend it to others

410346,The Yard Milano, Nothing, I simply loved this hotel I do not have one negative about it Cannot recommend this hotel enough About a 25 minute walk to the Duomo but a very pleasant walk lots of shops to look at beautiful church and restaurants nearby Close to the canals very pretty

410349,The Yard Milano, The breakfast was a little too simple Maybe add a bit cheese and ham with the bread and it would be perfect too , The hotel was amazing with all it s details Staff was wonderful they really made you feel like home The whole atmosphere was incredible 
410350,The Yard Milano, Heard some noise in the room and the fridge in the mini bar was noisy not big deal I unplugged it I complained next morning and they waived all my mini bar charges and offered me the parking fee for the car True professionalism in how they dealt with my complain , Great environment Very disruptive unique and charming Amazing design and staff is so kind and engaged You feel each staff owns this hotel
