287156,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Was given a very small claustrophobic room no doubt hotel called bijou could not pass each other if both moving about the room Bathroom tiny and door could not be closed unless towels removed from towel rail Very poor On arrival obvious problem with booking in Reservation lost , Bed comfortable Breakfast serving area messy and inadequately filled General everyday items not available not value for money 
287157,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There was a mixup with luggage that caused a bit of confusion But we got a complementary breakfast to compensate , The room was large and well appointed Very nice shower Walking distance to the British Museum Covent Garden and Russell Square 
287158,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Location was great very central and in easy walking distance of tube stations and buses The rooms were very comfortable even though a little on the small side but you only sleep in them and the friendliness of the staff especially William on reception he can brighten up the dullest of days were really helpful 
287159,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bed wasn t too comfortable room was a little old fashioned Price is generally high in this hotel considering missed out on the small things I e bathroom products not enough sockets in the room near the bed and phone didn t work to call down to reception , Good location
287160,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Smelled musty in hallways and somewhat in rooms Carpet all over needs to be replaced Air conditioner didn t work in two of our three rooms Moths flew out of one room s closet Staff was accommodating when we brought issues to their attention , Lobby area very nice Staff pleasant and helpful Bathrooms upgraded and nice 
287161,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Everything was perfect apart from on the Monday we had a full day out and it was very hot came back to our room to get ready for the theatre no hot water rang reception and they said there was a problem but was being dealt with we had to have a cold shower not happy When we came back from the theatre still no hot water The next day everything back to normal We left on the Wednesday morning we did mention it as we were checking out and they just apologised no mention of any compensation , Location was amazing close to theatres and within walking distance of all the main attractions 
287162,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Air con didn t work fan provided was extremely noisy Second night they opened the window which then couldn t be closed when there was a thunderstorm Another noisy night s sleep as a result Colleague had no hot water in their room on the first night , Location was excellent and easy to get to from Paddington 
287163,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There was a high pitched noise when others on my floor or around my room where showering and at first I thought this was a sound coming from my own room or my AC It took me going out into the hall to realise it was permeating the entire area of my floor Probably not much can be done but when it only lasted for the duration of others showers so it wasn t a problem , Great location very friendly and accommodating staff quiet very clean and modern room and bathroom perfect work environment I got so much work done the night I was here and it was comfortable and a great sleep Will definitely be back if in the area 
287164,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The charges for an international call were disgusting In todays age there should be a cheaper alternative than what is charged at present as sometimes the need to use a land line is due to high importance Loss of credit cards family matters etc 99 pounds for a call at 5 pounds a minute really , loved the location and the room was comfortable and clean 
287165,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We booked a twin room This was on the first floor to the street It was very noisy so we decided to ask for a quieter room We got on in the backyard As we saw it we aksed if it was smaller as the other room which it was but the employee told us no it isn t and talked on After he left and we got our luggage to the room we firstly heard the ventilators of the air condition units which were directly in front of our room The night was horrible and I think this room is a standby room or something like this because the towels were dirty and also the shower and there was dust everywhere We didn t understand why we got this room as we asked for a more quiet room So we asked the next day for an other room and we got help from Martin and also an upgrade Thanks for that, Friendly and helpful staff We only had breakfast once on sunday and it was great After two other rooms we got an upgrade to a room in the 5th floor This one was spacious for London rooms and the bathroom and the rest of the room was very clean I also want to thank Martin for his help with the room The location is wonderful for a city break I ve been a lot in London and the most of the time I walk or go by bus This time I could reach everthing I was interested in approximatley 15 min A bus station is directly in front of the hotel and the next tube station Holborn or Tottenham Court Road is a short walk away 
287166,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The price should have included breakfast , The location of this hotel was excellent for the theatres in Shaftsbury Avenue and less than 10 min walk from Holburn Underground Station
287167,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, My daughter and myself was there to see my grandaughter perform at the Shaftesbury theatre very friendly staff from reception to bar restaurant rooms very clean would recommend to everybody thankyou
287168,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Unclean bathroom tiles Woken by room cleaner at 9am to clean room on Sunday morning Told we should have booked directly to get a free breakfast so would charge us 12 each We went down the road to a cheaper cafe , Bar good and not too pricey Decoration beautiful art nouveau style 
287169,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Not being the fittest person on the planet Stairs caused a little discomfort as I had heart and hip surgery but slowly I managed but had more difficulty in the underground than the hotel that s for sure Otherwise no problems at all , The closeness of all the museums and transport links to the west and east of London Very helpful people in local area shops if you get a bit lost Staff more than helpful all round not being the fittest person on the planet after heart and hip operation
287170,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We booked a deluxe twin room it was very small The air con leaked we did complain and they moved us into a bigger deluxe room with no problem , Good breakfast comfortable resturant
287171,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I was very disappointed with this hotel I booked 2 nights prepaid with booking com The first night the wifi didn t work in my room and I couldn t do any of my work When I said it to the staff at reception she nearly laughed at me and told me every room has wifi The next day I told the receptionist again and I was moved to a room with no air con when I said it to reception they moved me again to a room that was extremely noisy and had a green light on the ceiling it looked like a smoke alarm but wasn t I honestly had the worst night sleep Another thing I noticed in the two nights I stayed in the Kingsley they only had one person on reception at all times ,No Positive
287172,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, We booked The Kingsley as a last minute weekend away but we were extremely pleased with the hotel and it s facilities We stayed in a deluxe double which was very spacious with a large bathroom We didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on the food but the hotel is in a perfect location right in the heart of Holborn so very handy for the tube and local restaurants 
287173,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Some of the staff were great and others were just OK , The hotel was beautiful and the location was great We love being near the British Museum and Covent Gardens and the hotel sits right in between Just perfect 
287174,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Very disappointed that on a Saturday night the bar downstairs was closed well before midnight and in the morning you couldn t get a coffee there as it wasn t staffed You could only get a coffee by having to go in the restaurant which we didn t want to do as it was very busy and we weren t having the breakfast , Comfortable beds thick blackout curtains and I asked for a quiet room and it was very quiet Clean and everything worked 
287175,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, One of the lifts was out of order There air conditioning in my room was not working so I had a fan and the window open Spent the night listening to the buses go past I was upgraded to a junior suite so had 2 televisions but there was no remote Rang down twice to get one but nobody picked up Welcome to London 350 for tired understaffed property ,No Positive
287176,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, View wasn t great but didn t spent much time looking out of it so wasn t a big deal , Staff were friendly Location was good Hotel in all was very good Highly recommend it 
287177,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There was a mouse in my room and when I notified the staff I was shown to another room I was offered a free breakfast but as you can appreciate I did not want to eat in the hotel I did not enjoy my stay here at all ,No Positive
287178,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bedrooms a bit on the small side but had everything you needed Room view was a brick wall but no problem as only in the room to sleep , Breakfast excellent and staff very friendly Location brilliant 
287179,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Small room Grossly overpriced Receptionists could have been more welcoming, Shower was good Convenient for the Aldwych Novello Theatres Lots of eating places nearby
287180,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, A bit older, Customer service at Thisle Holborn was fantastic they went above and beyond to assist us The food was delicious as well The location of the hotel was perfect for us 
287181,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Air conditioner leaked quite a bit but was obviously a regular thing as when they had done the turn down service a towel had been placed on the floor rather than the glasses we had been using Kept the room lovely and cool though The shower did not drain very well and I was worried at one point it might overflow , The location was good The reception staff were lovely and friendly and check in was easy even though we had arrived a little early The room was a great size junior suite and even though our booking hadn t advised the hotel it was 1 adult and 2 children they were told it was 2 adults this caused no problem and they were happy to make up the sofa bed at our convenience and apologised because it hadn t been done already Plenty of water left in room and the little bar fridge was great too Big bath and shower in the bathroom Overall quite impressed 
287182,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Not much really These central London hotels always charge around 12 for breakfast which is great if you want to sit for 30 minutes and scoff down fruit and a cooked platter But mostly I just want a coffee and a croissant So I buy outside , The hotel was excellent although I did not sample the breakfast 
287183,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Full English Breakfast was superb It s a walkable distance from all major attractions Big Ben London Eye Buckingham Palace St Paul s Cathedral etc No complaints at all 
287184,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The breakfast was 12 apiece and not worth the price at all The food wasn t good , The room and bathroom were updated and clean The staff was helpful and even helped get a taxi in the rain 
287185,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, A very restful night nice and quiet in a comfy bed Great location for theatre and the British Museum I arrived mid morning and aksed if my bag could be stored however there was no need as my room was ready early which was a lovely surprise 
287186,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I had a kingsize room but it was still quite basic No hair conditioner provided instant coffee only no minibar only tiny water glasses The bathroom was cold and no heated towel rail or it didn t work The reception staff were slow to check in out seemed more interested in chatting in the back office It s also hard for taxis to stop at the front of the hotel and there is no doorman to help This was my second stay I don t think I will use again it wasn t cheap and you can get more luxury for the same price in a boutique hotel or apartment , The rooms at the back of the hotel are quiet Nice reception area and lifts are not too busy Bed was comfortable and the room was clean 
287187,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, No trouser press I think Drains smell in bathroom overnight Couldn t find where to turn off bathroom radiator , Upgrade Bedroom spacious Window in bathroom see below 
287188,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, It may have been noisy but I was on the 4th floor away from the main road View is not great from the window but that was not a problem for me as I preferred a good nights sleep , Good location near to Holborn station where my course was being held Able to walk to Haymarket in 20 minutes to see a show Some people still around late in the evening so didn t feel unsafe walking back to the hotel along the main streets Good transport links and lots of places to buy food or eat in Free coffee and tea in the room Didn t use Wifi Wasn t going to have breakfast but glad that I changed my mind The choice is not huge but what you get is great quality which is most important Only stayed one night but could have stayed longer 
287189,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, When we got to our room the air con wasn t working so we were moved to another room The room we were given the air con worked but there was a very bad smell of vomit in the hall leading to our room which we reported to reception and although they said it had been dealt with we could still smell it Also we were disappointed that breakfast wasn t in the price we paid , It was a nice comfortable room and a great location for us 
287190,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful Room was spacious and clean Breakfast was very good The Hotel is an easy 15 minute walk from Regent Street and Oxford Street and there is a secure underground car park less then 100 yards away 
287191,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Not applicable, Feel very safe here when travelling alone Staff welcoming Hotel very clean and comfortable Central location is well suited to our business needs Breakfast is healthy filling and delicious 
287192,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Air conditioning issue but to be fair this couldn t be helped , Staff on arrival were excellent and we had a treat due to a room upgrade to a mini suite Sadly the air conditioning failed that evening and this was a particular problem due to it being the weekend of good weather The location of the hotel is superb with easy access to tube stations and areas such as Covent Garden West End and Oxford Street Great pubs bars and cafes all very close including China town 
287193,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing, Beautiful Entrance welcoming Staff really friendly Rooms had air con which was great and I rhe bed was so comfortable Beautiful spacious shower Just a 10 minute walk from Oxford street Very central 
287194,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Very disappointed with the failure of the air conditioning in our room This was rather essential because we happened to stay when we had a mini heatwave at the end of May Mentioned to reception who said they were aware and working on the problem As all the public rooms were delightfully cool and comfortable the contrast was very noticeable Fixing this would be a major influence, The main reason for the choice of the hotel was that it is 5 mins walk from our son s flat enabling us to easily help him Beds were comfortable Breakfast good Evening menu adequate for our needs
287195,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The bed was like a concrete slab The bed sheet didn t actually fit the mattress The air con didn t function properly The lamps didn t work alone The peep hole on the door had tissue poking out to hide the fact it was broken When we arrived back from our evening out there were substantial numbers of people sitting it the doorway stairs no staff near the door when we were let in no words from the staff at all just blank looks Booking com advertise it with parking not hotel parking It s a ncp car park near by, William the guy on reception was lovely
287196,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The hotel is in Central London so no view from the window and very very busy as soon as you stepped outside , Very pleasant hotel Clean comfortable friendly staff great breakfast Pleasantly surprised as it was very quiet in our room 
287197,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The room booked was described as a DELUXE ROOM In fact the room was very small and the air conditioning did NOT work As the weather was very hot when we were there very lucky weather wise the problem with the A C was a BIG problem and made for a very uncomfortable night with little sleep We were moved the next day TWICE and were in the end given an Executive room and a breakfast All stressful whilst only there for TWO nights Whilst the hotel manager was very helpful in trying to rectify our concerns re the A C I feel that these rooms should NOT be classed as DELUXE as on being asked to see a STANDARD room we were informed that the hotel does NOT have standard rooms Surely for a room to be classed as DELUXE there must be a BASIC STANDARD room for the client to gauge whether the cost of a DELUXE room is a better option We have only given the very low rating on facilities because of the misrepresentation that we feel is being given regarding the label of DELUXE , Location Very obliging daytime manager who was very helpful when we had cause to complain 
287198,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Perfectly placed for theatres and restaurants Staff on reception very friendly and helpful We were upgraded the room was lovely with very comfortable bed Will stay there again 
287199,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Food not up to expectations and not all delivered to room, Actually several things were very poor and I complained to hotel direct All to do with the room service food and payment
287200,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There was mould in the corner of the shower and no fridge or microwave Spotty service at lobby level hard to find the concierge staff friendly but didn t seem to be enjoying their work Not a full service bar , The property is close to Covent Garden and the West End Generally clean and quiet 
287201,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, A bit awkward to get to the front door from the footpath I had to hoist a heavy suitcase up a short flight of steps Would be handy if there was a ramp along one side to wheel your suitcase up Would also allow wheelchair access Laundry facilities turned out to be a send out service with a 24 hour turnaround OK but rather expensive However there are dry cleaning laundry outlets available on the street in the neighbourhood which are much cheaper , Tea and coffee making facilities appear to be fast becoming a thing of the past The Kingsley still has them They were good e g had decaffeinated coffee and they were replenished each day The breakfast buffet was good with a wide variety of selections and a well maintained nicely presented hot buffet The coffee was excellent Staff were very helpful with minding of luggage and providing information e g good places to eat in the vicinity
287202,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, MOULD ON BATHROOM WALLS BATH ENAMEL DAMAGED GROUT MISSING ON BATHROOM FLOOR OULD SEE BARE CONCRETES SERVICE IN BAR POOR PORTION OF FISH POOR ON SUNDAY BETTER ON TUESDAY, CONCIERGE RECEPTION SERVICE EXCELLENT
287203,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Tight and cramped room , Clean quiet with great WiFi The bathroom was spacious and well appointed Room is small and cramped compared with the bathroom Barely room for people and their luggage Air conditioning works well Bed is very comfortable Very well located 
287204,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The hotel is not readily accessible by wheelchair but the staff made sure that access was available at all times This was through the tradesman entrance not the most salubrious ways to enter the hotel but needs must The staff made sure that I was comfortable thoughout the process , The staff were very friendly and professional The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice available The room was very comfortable and had plenty of extras 
287205,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The advertised laundry facilities turned out to be an arrangement with an external commercial laundry This would have been OK but the charge was very high I found a dry cleaning laundry outlet on the street which provided the same turn around and I was able to have a small load of washing done for what one or two items would have cost at the hotel, Staff were helpful with information about restaurants and travel times by taxi to various destinations The arrangements for minding luggage were greatly appreciated Tea and coffee making facilities in room were good including decaffeinated as well as regular coffee and were replenished daily
287206,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We were upgraded to the 6th top floor however it was extremely noisy The rooms adjacent seem to be used for storage by the cleaning staff who were opening closing doors from very early in the morning resulting in a not so nice lie in , Good breakfast very good location staff very professional erring on the side of friendly 
287207,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bathroom was very cold as the temperature is centrally controlled so you can t turn it up , Location was great as it s situated in the Bloomsbury neighbourhood 
287208,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The room was described as a deluxe twin room I would describe it actually as a standard room as I wasn t sure what was actually deluxe about it The room was clean and quiet however it was very small and there was no bottled water that you usually get supplied free with a room as stanadard in other hotels , The location and the cleanliness The concierge was very friendly and helpful 
287209,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The bedrooms considering the extra for de luxe were disappointing especially the small size of the twin with little space around the beds and a few inches between the beds Our daughter and granddaughter from Australia will not take home a good impression of London s standards , Public and dining areas were pleasant and the breakfast for an extra payment was very tasty 
287210,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I stayed in room 516 and whilst this is a lovely room they forget to tell you when booking in that you are unlikely to get a good nights sleep Right outside the window by the bed is a noise that sounds very similar to a helicopter hovering outside your room all night I rang the duty manager after 11pm when I realised this noise wasn t going to stop I complained this morning on checking out and was told as soon as the general manager Natasha Ludlow came on duty that they would get her to ring me I returned to the North of England and rang the hotel again at 15 20pm as I had not had a call I was once more promised a call as soon as Natasha came out of her meeting It is now 19 35pm and it must be a long meeting as I am still awaiting my call I do not expect to pay in excess of 250 for a room I cannot sleep in no matter how nice it is , The venue was well located by the theatres
287211,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Because we went through booking com the breakfast was not included in the room price, Friendly helpful staff excellent location for the theatres Where upgraded free of charge My wife received a box of chocolates for her birthday when we arrived 
287212,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Breakfast was buffet style including tea and coffe from a machine, Upgrade to junior suite on top floor which was spacious and comfortable Very helpful staff committed to providing good service
287213,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Asked for a quiet room Booking com email to hotel and at the desk Given room on 2nd floor overlooking a night bus stop on a main road very noisy Left phone charger behind Still unresolved , Rooms are a good size for a central London hotel 
287214,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, No times shown anywhere for restaurant or Breakfast When we asked at reception we were told we didn t have to book when we tried to go in restaurant at 5 45 it was shut ,No Positive
287215,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Breakfast not included and was expensive but there are numerous cafes nearby There are no financial channels on TV , Rooms are spacious and well laid out Showers have good pressure Rooms are very quiet Tube stops are nearby and buses are at door 
287216,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There weren t any foreing chanell tv and the wifi conection was very low , The situation is excellent The bed was very comfortable and the room very clean
287217,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Our room in particular had NO views whatsoever from three separate windows This wasn t too big a problem though because it s a hotel and we were only really there in the evening All of the windows pointed in towards the building into the vents and piping etc they also hummed a fair bit but wasn t too noticeable at night so this wasn t a problem It was a VERY nice hotel and was a real treat however it was also very expensive and in hindsight it probably would have been more sensible to stay at somewhere cheaper as we were only using it as a place to rest our heads , Very nice accommodation the staff were very friendly and helpful Location of course was perfect being right in the heart of London it was easy to walk everywhere and see the city The room itself was lovely The bed was big and comfy the bathroom had really nice facilities There was a large seating area and dining table which would have been perfect for guests 
287218,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The air conditioning was very noisy and the window made a noise which kept us a wake about from that everything was good, Great hotel and the staff very friendly
287219,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bathroom shower could have better Breakfast good but not very hot Also unfortunately we had a little mouse that ran across the breakfast room Did put us off our breakfast a little , Position of hotel to theatres etc was a plus Room clean and comfortable 
287220,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, No coffee or milk in room Curtains not fit for purpose Toilet wouldn t flush No shower gel, The deluxe bedroom was a poor description Tiny room with windows on a sloped ceiling meaning the light came through from 5am Called housekeeping and reception at 9pm arrival as no milk nor coffee in the room No answer Toilet wouldn t flush clean Informed reception who were informing management 
287221,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Room was quite stuffy and aircon didn t work A mini bar fridge in the room would be good to keep drinks cold , Very central Helpful and pleasant staff
287222,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, I was upgraded to a junior suite Which provided great space in which to work Location is also good Near to the City and Covent Gardens Room was very clean 
287223,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Dust on glass shelves no fridge in the room no water provided duvet cover torn Not up to the award received by trip adviser , A nice classic building overall well organized in central London 
287224,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There were no little luxuries bathroom fittings very basic and there were no slippers or robes no mini bar and worst of all NO COMPLIMENTARY WATER which I would expect in a 4 star, Cleanliness and bathroom appeared to have been recently refurbished
287225,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Staff were a bit robotic Hotel is a bit nondescript Funny layout , Nice bathroom Great location Didn t have breakfast Had a twin room for one person at no extra cost 
287226,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, An overnight stay for a theatre trip Greeted by exceptionally friendly staff who were extremely helpful from calling taxis to providing ice buckets glasses nothing was too much trouble Thank you an enjoyable stay 
287227,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The lady at reception was very rude to the new young man working at reception it made him feel very uncomfortable and was rude with us right there , Our room was upgraded to a suit and it was epic
287228,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, It hard to find the hotel in the bignning There is no store near by the hotel I needed to get the spring water in the evening , Nice and quiet area but easy to access to the publuc transportation 
287229,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Great location for shopping and theatres Very nice hotel staff were very polite and helpful and we loved our room Bed was very comfortable Will definitely use The Kingsley again already planning another trip 
287230,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I was told the hotel has a business relationship with a local gym so that guests can use it on a day pass basis with discount However when I went to the gym they said they had never had such a relationship and this was confirmed by a call from the gym manager the following day to the hotel This was a shame since such a facility would be a massive bonus when staying in London for an intense week It was also a bit embarrassing to turn up at the gym and then to be turned away , Comfortable room and bed Lovely staff most helpful and friendly Breakfast nice quality
287231,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Would have been nice to have ben able to have a coffee in the bar in the morning , The location was ideal it was quite too The Staff extremely professional and helpful and the beds were very comfortable
287232,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Staff could be a little on the over efficient side we would have preferred the option to book breakfast at check in rather than having to go through a you know your breakfast isn t included exchange where cost wasn t clear , Absolutely nothing to complain about room was spacious clean and well equipped Hotel was not too big or small and the location is perfect a stones throw from everything from the British museum to Covent Garden Facilities were as you d expect for a 4 Breakfast was good hotel was as quiet as you d expect when sited on a major road with lots of building works around Enjoyed the option of air con OR opening the window very unusual to find both Liked having a fridge in the room 
287233,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, It was convoluted to work out how to switch on the radiator in the bathroom The bathroom was cold until I d figured that out, Bed comfortable pillows soft Bath and shower good with lots of hot water
287234,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I was disappointed to be charged a service charge for drinks ordered from the hotel bar while getting ready for the theatre , Beautiful building great location and helpful staff We were visiting the Palace Theatre which was only a short walk away We also visited the Harry Potter World at Warner Brothers Studio which was easy to travel to there were good restaurants and 2 tube stations nearby 
287235,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, As usual in London faaaaaar too expensive The hotel is good and the price for London ok but the prices in London per se are simply rediculous , Great welcome desk comfortable room good wifi Certainly worth a night or two 
287236,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The only slight issue we had was not getting cold water from the bathroom tap for teeth brushing , The staff were all very helpful and you couldn t ask for a better location so close to all the main attractions in London
287237,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The receptions staff could be more skilled on their job They did not know how to handle my e voucher from the travel Agency So they charged my card anyway ,No Positive
287238,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Didn t get any sleep because of the noise from the air conditioning plant in the lightwell outside my room I had earplugs in and didn t make any difference to the noise Had a very important client meeting the next morning so didn t appreciate not getting any sleep , Location

287242,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, The front desk staff concierge and housekeeping staff were all lovely The bed was super comfortable It was a welcome surprise to find Cadbury hot chocolate in the coffee tea mix in the room 
287243,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, There was a constant noise coming from the Air Con unit and the cleaners woke us up in the morning Also the shower wasn t very powerful so found it hard to wash our hair , The bed was comfortable the staff was pleasant The Hotel was clean 
287244,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The swinging shower screen would not stay inside the bath this has obviously been an ongoing problem as the tile at the side of the bath was loose where water has been dripping Minor complaint really as everything else was good , The hotel was clean modern staff were friendly room was a decent size and had all the additions you would expect Location was excellent for Covent Garden 
287245,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Housekeeping was sort of random and never fully got the idea that we wanted washcloths for the bath even though we stayed almost two weeks , Location is wonderful some of the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to help 
287246,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Breakfast had to ask for cutlery mugs plates etc , Room very large and comfortable Liked having a small fridge in the room D cor throughout hotel very good

287249,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Food quality in the restaurant was not great Breakfast was also late cold and not what we ordered , Great location Everything about the hotel was clean and comfortable The staff were friendly too 
287250,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Room has no view at all and its not double glazing which can be rather cold unless the heater is on, Quiet but convenient location within 5 10 minutes walk from Holborn and Tottenham Court Road Station British Museum and Covent Garden are all within walking distance Helpful staff too Room is of good size and clean 
287251,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Fluff around the side on three floor of wardrobe, The reception staff remarkably helpful and went out if their way to oblige Concierge took my case across the road for taxi Didn t even ask him
287252,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Temperature of shower was difficult to adjust but was very hot so ok, The food and room service were excellent Staff were friendly and very accommodating Very clean and the room was spacious Plenty of clothes hanging space and light in wardrobe Nice quiet hotel Comfortable bed Great location and I would definitely stay here again 
287253,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing to dislike, The room was so quiet especially as on a busy road the beds very comfy very clean coffee and tea lovely touch plenty of space for a one night stay staff very courteous able to leave luggage after check out a bonus
287254,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bath and shower were not easy to manage Bath needs to have integrated grab handles and non slippy base , Staff very efficient and friendly Room was attractive good television Good room service 
287255,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, in bedroom 225 noise can be heard at night coming from from what i believe is water system in roof of recess in bedroom not sure if other bedrooms have same problem , when complained about noise in bedroom staff were very helpfull in trying to solve problem waiter in bar polite although when ordering steak waiter forgot to ask how we would like steak cooked same when ordering desert forgot to ask if we would like ice cream or custard with desert only small things but they can make a difference 
287256,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Paid a lot of money expecting price to include breakfast only to be told from staff it didn t Staff I think could have negotiated on the price we then had to pay for breakfast but they wouldn t Considering hotel was only half full it wouldn t have hurt them to have offered it at half price We were supposed to be in one of the best rooms but view from window was a brick wall and there was a constant droning noise all night from somewhere outside window, Location
287257,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The cooked buffet breakfast was just a little too cold I don t think the warming stands do an efficient job The selection was fantastic though , Staff were very accommodating when they learnt I couldn t use a lift and moved me down to a lower floor Also there was an issue with the booking and payment but the Manager was absolutely fantastic in sorting it out straight away with no fuss Very impressed Thank you
287258,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing really major Just didn t get much acknowledgement from staff when you walked in etc , Location excellent for what we needed All in walking distance Room very comfortable and nice to have a bath as well as a shower which you don t often get in a standard London room 
287259,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing , Super quick check in closeness to theatres and the modern decor We were able to leave our suitcases in a locked facility in the hotel while we were out in the day after check out 
287260,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The bed did not seem long enough I am under 6 foot but my feet were half off the bed Also the heating air conditioning seemed quite noisy , Hotel was very clean and the location was ideal for the Shaftesbury theatre which was the reason for booking this hotel
287261,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bed was a little bit firm but would be perfect for some people The room was also quite small but reasonable value for money in London , The guy at reception was really nice and welcoming the room was really keen we only stayed for 1 night but they tidied the room whilst we were out 
287262,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Not enough tea sugar and milk for my tea belly of a partner but I m sure if we had asked for more it would have been provided free of charge If being really picky there was a fair bit of dust in the room and a few marks on the wall that needed painting but these minor details did not spoil our lovely break, Perfect location to the theatre that we had booked Bed and pillows were estremly comfy Had tea and coffee making facilities and the shortbread was a nice touch Double glazing cos near to a road in the city that we re not used to didn t hear the traffic at all Central heating that we could control to our liking Breakfast was lovely and fresh in a lovely atmosphere and lots of choice Staff were happy and helpful We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Thistle Holborn 
287263,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Professional staff but cold and matter of fact Poor breakfast facilities, Great location Comfortable rooms and facilities Ideal to walk to several locations in London 
287264,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The emarrasment at breakfast when was humiliated in front of dining customers by your staff who insisted that it had not been paid for when it clearly was and could have been rectified if your booking system was correctly inputted on booking at this hotel on our arrival we advised you that breakfast had been paid and then had to endure the fiasco upon our arrival for breakfast Not impressed , Nice room
287265,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Room a little small , Great location within walking distance of many sights Excellent breakfast and very comfortable beds The staff were very helpful especially arranging airport transfer 
287266,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We really didn t like a very disturbing noise coming from the ventilation panel in the ceiling which was on and off all night although we didn t use the aircon , The location of the hotel is excellent Good breakfasts and will miss the coffee which was great 
287267,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Poor value for money Last time we stayed breakfast was included in the price and rooms were great but the room we got this time 221 has never been a deluxe room The room was very small even though I had asked for a twin room the zip bed although unzipped had to still be pushed together The room was freezing due mainly to drafty windows My bedside lamp was flashing and making buzzing noises which was scary as it was wired into bed head and even after reporting it it wasn t fixed The bathroom was cold the towel rail was so close to the door that if you had towels on it the door wouldn t close and even though the room was cold the towel rail was red hot and this worried me as I am diabetic and was scared of catching my arm on it on the way to the loo in the night The furniture was in poor state too The staff were unhelpful and the concierge left me and my daughter to struggle with our bags when leaving definitely not worth the money, Location stayed here before with family and it s walking distance to British Museum and Covent Garden West end also close
287268,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Not beng told that heating and air con in allocated room were not working hotel was hardly busy so why give us that room , Comfortable bed as we were upgraded but only because the room we were allocated had no heating 
287269,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The room was small despite being a deluxe double and felt a little dingy , The location was perfect close to Oxford Street etc The hotel was clean and the bed was comfortable Provision of iron and board was appreciated Excellent bathroom shower 
287270,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, This is the only hotel I will stay at in London Position is perfect right in the centre of everything The hotel is lovely comfortable welcoming clean staff friendly Can t rate it highly enough
287271,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Dust on top of curtains and skirting Would have been better value if continental breakfast had been included, Beds comfortable Plenty of hot water 2 comfy chairs Good position for hair dryer and mirror 
287272,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, No card reader in the bar so if people paid via card they had to go to reception , Everything was in the room you needed Reception staff were pleasant Hotel was clean with low noise 
287273,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We were given the disabled room therefore no bath basin very low level and mirror low level ta accommodate wheelchair user Booked 3 months in advance so why was we given this unacceptable room ,No Positive
287274,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing, From the moment we arrived we received complimentary drinks and mince pies we arrived two hours before check in time but were shown straight to our room This made it much better for us as we were going to a matinee performance of the Bodygaurd The rooms was warm and cosy and clean couldn t ask for more Staff could not have been more helpful full marks 
287275,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, No faults during three days , The perfect location 2 mins from Brit Museum short walk to west end quiet Excellent king size bed and very convenient bathroom Good local restaurants and cafes 
287276,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and have never had a hotel with staff so disinterested in the customer We did not once have a smiling welcoming staff member from start to finish no idea about location of theatre even though it was marketed as one and you felt like you were a nusisence if you asked for information The hotel is lovely but they do need to invest in training as the staff lack basic customer service skills , Room spacious and clean
287277,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, A bit expensive for the room, This hotel is OK but you really pay for the location The staff are pleasant and I had a very enjoyable stay However here are a few tips You can get a good local Full English early morning breakfast for half the price by just going around the corner Go out of the hotel turn right then immediately at the next street Museum St turn right and straight away cross the road There is a little Deli called Giovanni s and they have a great English breakfast The hotel bar is very nice but a bit lonely expensive and quiet If you are on your own a better bet is to go to the local English pub just around the corner from the hotel also in Museum St called the Plough It is a 3 minute walk and a 5 minute stagger back with quite a few small artesian shops on the way 
287278,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Poor value for price paid for room Room size 8 x 8 double room Very small Breakfast not included Price Paid 225 45 Restaurant unavailable as Xmas party booked in resulting in us eating in the bar which was unsuitable Breakfast looked very nice but was COLD , Location
287279,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The room service food was awful Both in the evening and breakfast Wrong food brought in the evening and morning cold and tasteless Tip eat elsewhere Remote control not working no one answering the phone for room service Whilst the staff were friendly and helpful the list of errors was terrible , Location was great as I had a meeting at this hotel Theatre district is within a 10 minute walk With tube station within 5 mins 
287280,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We were woken at 2 45am by a false fire alarm on the first night and were awake for over an hour Also had another false fire alarm on our second night 8am and still asleep Not acceptable when paying high rates We overslept and lost 2 hours from our time in London on the first day , The restaurant
287281,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Poor cleaning of room did not empty teapot or wash drinking glass Cards would not open door on second night Trip to reception no apology though sorted Chaos at breakfast on Sunday very little food left no glasses bread yoghurt cold meats milk etc, Excellent location
287282,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Booked a twin which turned out to have no heating Upgraded to a suite but only a double bed They suggested one of us could sleep on the sofa ,No Positive
287283,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Thought it was a bit pricey but that s just London I guess , Staff were really friendly We were able to check in early Bed was so comfortable such a good nights sleep 
287284,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Breakfast buffet not a problem but going outside breakfast room and queuing for a coffee was a bit of a pain, It was my Husband and I anniversary they left a hand written card and a box of chocolates on our dressing table what a lovely gesture
287285,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Very drafty in room found that the sash window was open at the top Managed to close it eventually Room service could have been better ordered 3 sandwiches and got 5 kept 2 extra but little or no butter and no chips mix up over gluten free Breakfast was ok good selection had better and had a lot worse, Room was comfortable 3 chairs plus table Bed very comfortable bathroom shower excellent Main purpose of visit was to visit our daughter and this was very close by 
287286,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I was a little disapointed in the the rooms Expected more based on the pictures I have seen before booking The room was a little scruffy a lot of paint marks and loose ends in both the bedroom and bathroom chair was stained , No noise filter into the room from outside eventhough it was very noisy outside The hotel is right in front of the british museum in the paralel street The personel is absolutely very kind and helpful and really wanted to make it a positive experience for us especially after I was disapointed about the room
287287,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Morning staff was not very welcoming but the evening receptionist was lovely , THE BED WAS VERY COMFORTABLE Room very clean Coffee Tea TV NEAR ALL ATTRACTIONS
287288,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Thought the room wouldn t be good because of the need to up stairs then back down again but it was very quiet with no traffic sound, Reception staff good shower and lovely towels as well as efficient check in and out
287289,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Booked a delux double room which looked larger than it was in the photo , Bed was extremely comfortable Hotel was very clean and staff friendly and helpful 
287290,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The heater did not work but mgmt offered extra blankets etc and it was worked out We found the shower controls were confusing and the shower was directly over our heads vs being at an angle as I Mrs did not want to get my hair wet everyday , Breakfast was really good We loved the fact that it was a buffet and we could pick and choose The hotel loaned us an adapter as ours didn t work 
287291,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, the room was very cold and the air con only worked on cold Although the staff where very good and friendly it would help if their English was a little better on reception , The rooms where very clean and the bed was very comfortable The TV was of best quality good coffee facilities in the room 
287292,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, The room are well designed and equipped and large enough that Mom and I were not stepping over each other Beds are comfortable Location is incredibly convenient close to two tube stations one block from British Museum 
287293,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, a buzzing outside of the room when the air conditioning came on Once very early in the morning 150ml schweppes lemonade was 2 53 , King size bed was extremely comfortable 
287294,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Always useful to have a robe and slippers in the room for comfort and more toiletries, The room and bathroom were a a good size Bathroom was clean and modern Bed was comfy I had room service breakfast which was nice 
287295,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Booked a deluxe room but was unimpressed as it was more like a standard room as hardly any draws for clothes etc also kettle etc on dressing table leaving not enough room for our bits , Breakfast and service was good
287296,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Room very small Had requested prior to arrival that extra sheets be placed under the duvets Not there on arrival Informed reception who promised they would be put on beds whilst we were out but still not there when we returned Asked at reception again and then had TWO different people bring sheets Then had to make up the beds ourselves Better communication between department would have prevented this inconvenience Also a ridiculous arrangement for buying breakfast which incidentally we d experience on two previous visits On first morning were told we had to purchase vouchers for 12 each at reception were told by restaurant staff that if we paid in the restaurant the price would be 13 Next morning we were told they had no more vouchers and had changed the system so that we had to sign for breakfast in the restaurant which we duly did the cost 12 not 13 Most confusing Hopefully they have changed the system so that you simply sign for breakfast Of course what would be even better would be to include breakfast in the room rate it is quite expensive , Excellent location comfy beds mostly charming staff 
287297,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Considering the price we paid for a deluxe twin we were give a tiny dingy depressing room , The room service came quickly The staff were friendly it s in a great location We stayed for work 
287298,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The service charge at the bar was ridiculous as all he did was pour 2 drinks and hand them to us The bar did not stock Bacardi , Good location bright interior 
287299,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Motorbikes revving up in street at night on two nights Guests slamming doors Neither really fault of hotel For most things location is great but Bus lane outside means taxis or private cars can not pick you up directly by front door , Staff helpful Very comfy bed Attractive building and calm elegant decor Very clean apart from windows which spoiled view of lovely church roof top next door Very close to places of interest and public transport 
287300,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, the hotel lifts weren t always working and negotiating 5 storeys of stairs with bad knees wasn t fun Having showers over baths isn t comfortable when climbing over bath hobs We would prefer a walk in shower recess to a bath than having to climb into a tiny slippery bath with a swing shower door which restricted movement even more , The location of the hotel for the things we wanted to do in London was excellent We were able to walk to venues and the buses outside and underground within walking distance were relatively easy to navigate 
287301,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, What we got was not as good as expected Smaller room than you promised and we had to ask to change rooms to get a bath Harsh pillows , Great for theatres and pubs 
287302,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, It was rather expensive , Very nice hotel very helpful staff very good central location between Holborn Tottenham Court Road and very convenient for lots of things including the British Museum
287303,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Staff cold and uncaring No bottled water provided although very hot weather No umbrellas to borrow Herbal teas not replaced when used One of the lifts not working for most of stay , Very quiet although central Very clean Comfy bed Powerful and large shower Plenty power points Close to three tube stations 
287304,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful We went for my daughter 18th birthday and they put a card and chocolates in the room for her Close to all attractions 
287305,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, Michael at check out was a legend Location was great rooms very clean Being able to catch the Tube from Heathrow straight to Holborn station without getting off was a bonus too 
287306,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We were not that bothered that our deluxe room with extra space could hardly have had any less but had noticed that one of the two hotel lifts was out of order on our arrival We had lots of luggage but despite this were allocated a room on the 5th floor and located through numerous corridors with double doors to open and a very lengthy walk from and to the remaining lift We were offered no help The second lift then also failed that afternoon but the hotel assured us an engineer was on the way and this would be repaired that night though as a precaution We were promised though only after we asked for this help with our luggage if the lifts were still not working in time for our early morning departure our taxi having been booked by the hotel Both were still out of order the next morning but after no help arrived in time for the taxi we eventually took our own cases and bags down 5 floors where we were greeted by a smiling receptionist asking if we had enjoyed our stay , Central location 
287307,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Quite expensive , Really helpful polite staff Good quality d cor Air conditioning great Excellent location 10 min walk from London Euston we came from Manchester 5 mins from Convent garden 
287308,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Sadly the elevators were broken and we were on the 6th floor It surprised us that they remained broken for our 1 night 2 day stay , Staff extra courteous We were allowed an early check in and a late check out Rooms nice Linens great Clean quiet and super location 
287309,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing to fault them on , Excellent location just off New Oxford Srteet Great walking distance from all major shops etc Love the staff Clean rooms and bathrooms fast housekeeping staff 
287310,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, I wanted to be close to the British Museum with good access to the Underground and and this hotel was perfect As a bonus the hotel is very easy to get to from Heathrow using the Piccadilly line on the Underground It takes a little longer than the Heathrow Express but it is perfect if you do not want to change lines I also really enjoyed the general area of the hotel I was close enough to walk to things of interest in the cool Covent Garden area but away from the really large crowds 
287311,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Would have liked breakfast to be included in the price Thought it was slightly overpriced for the time we spent in the hotel , very comfortable room Large bathroom Close to two tube stations within easy walk to covent garden 
287312,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I have been to this hotel for many years and during the last two visits I have not been impressed with the menu in the restaurant which is the same as the room service menu quite limited Not all of the items were available on the menu and on both occasions there was no Merlot available visits a few weeks apart Was given a Knickerbocker glory which I had waited half an hour for and it was just cream out of a can and a tiny bit of fruit and ice cream in the bottom I suppose I am comparing it with how it was a few years ago where the food was better and different from the room service menu, Beds are very comfortable Concierge very helpful
287313,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The room was quite small for an executive twin The drinks behind the bar are quite expensive and the air conditioning is quite loud , When we were allocated our room it didn t have a bath which my elderly Mum wanted so I went to reception to ask if we could change rooms and it was done straight away lovely friendly staff on reception
287314,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I loved everything I don t have anything negative to say xx, The staff were very helpful and friendly the beds were super comfy and room was very clean loved this hotel had a fabulous stay will DEFINITLY be back xx also nice touch my birthday card chocolates in room on arrival 
287315,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The Hotel room was VERY small you could literally open the door and fall straight in to bed no view unless you like bricks I thought it was expensive for what it was no breakfast or mini bar , it was clean and tidy and a great shower the staff were friendly and welcoming
287316,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing we found everything to our satisfaction , Helpful staff who informed us we had an upgrade from deluxe double to an executive suite and when I informed them it was my wife s birthday they produced a box of chocolates for her 
287317,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, great hotel in a fantastic location Irene on front desk was lovely and gave us the good news that we had been upgraded The hotel had a nice feeling of calm about it 
287318,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The hotel bar was tricky on the evening we visited I think that it was a combination of everyone descending upon the bar at once their only being two staff available a breakage happening the card machine not working at the bar and one customer who decided to be very difficult she was just being difficult and from what I could see had little cause to complain This in no way spoiled our stay it was just unfortunate , Check in was a breeze Reception noticed we had a small child with us we booked a larger room because of this and arranged for another bed in our room without us having to ask The room was immaculate and the bed very comfortable The concierge was also very helpful looking after our luggage after we checked out 100 I would stay here again Although the hotel is in a location that I would not normally have considered I found it to be only a very short walk to Covent Garden Soho and Oxford Street Bond Street I will certainly be visiting again Give it a go you ll not be disappointed 
287319,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Long stairs to get to our room on the mezzanine Although staff was very polite and friendly the front desk forgot to give us a wakeup call at the pre arranged 4 45 AM time for us to get to the airport , The location close to the British Museum 
287320,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Windows in the room were so dirty that we couldn t take a photo of the gorgeous buildings nearby or the view of the neighborhood , Staff was so kind helpful and ready to accommodate our every need Excellent location for the British Museum British Library Dickens Museum and many theaters restaurants and shops It is in a very beautiful neighborhood for walking and sightseeing 
287321,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The hold deposit in my credit card was for twice the ammount of my stay this was 3 weeks ago and they havent released the deposit , Rooms on the street side are noisy 
287322,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, no refrigerator you need to walk for about 10 15 min to reach the centre of Oxford street we stayed for 7 nights and in two of those the cleaning was not satisfactory leaving the cleaning towel on the bathroom floor for example, Julia was really helpful friendly staff the bus station in front of the hotel between two underground stations Tottenham court and Holborn 
287323,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Bar staff a little slow kept disappearing from the area and seemed to struggle to understand English , Helpfulness of check in facilities room bar 
287324,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, In the morning I woken by a constant banging like a door slamming In the end I had to get out of bed as it was that annoying , Staff location very clean 
287325,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Later check out would have helped Also a small fridge often ice is needed for headaches or physio treatment or food A different price for a basic breakfast would be useful the full buffet was good but not not needed early in the day , Location was great a decent sized room and bathroom very clean and excellent staff Thanks to the concierge on duty around midday on June 28 for all his help The nearby Natural Health clinic at 42 Bloomsbury Way was great for acupuncture and massage 
287326,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, We had a room upgrade but felt like room was cramped picture of original room we had booked looked bigger but guess that s because of other furniture in the room , Great location bed was comfy staff were friendly
287327,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, When ordering room service they refused to add some pepperoni or chicken to my pizza arrogantly stating the menu is the menu It was 3am maybe he was tired , Excellent value for money Great location Car park around the corner 30 for 24 hours Nice rooms Comfy bed Would definitely stay here again 
287328,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, none, If i could give this hotel more than 10 points in my review i would I loved everything about my stay from A to Z especially the helpful staff they definitely make you feel like you are home in the hotel the location was very strategic only 4 minutes walk from Holborne metro station and a bus stop right in front of the hotel the hotel was maintained very well and the rooms were very clean sizes of the hotel rooms was bigger than most hotels in London for a very affordable price i highly recommend this hotel
287329,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Reception staff Bathrobes advertised and not delivered Room advertised as luxury and downgraded by staff as standard No fridge Or water in room , Cleanliness of room 
287330,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, The location cannot be beat Central to everything we wanted to do in London great for both access to multiple Underground stations and for simply walking to many many wonderful areas of interest The hotel itself is safe clean well appointed and staff by helpful friendly people 
287331,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Dinner being made to wait over an hour for main course and the dessert was off Lack of staff in lounge and bar and constantly having to go to the desk to request a drink cup of tea etc , Breakfast was very good

287333,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, I booked and paid for a deluxe twin not sure that s what I got Room was very cramped and quite claustrophobic there was only one chair for a twin room Not sure why you think it is ok to push two twin beds together twin beds should be separated View of a dirty roof with a skylight which seemed about 6 foot away from our window The bathroom window was painted shut and appeared to have quite a lot of bird poo running down it It sounded as if water was running in the middle of the night but realised it was the air con No bedside drawers and the only other two drawers in the room had a hairdryer in it and bible and phone book When I opened the last door leading to our room from the corridoor a blast of heat hit you are these rooms above the kitchen Definitely feel as if I ve been ripped off Bar staff seem to like playing hide and seek , Very convenient for bars restaurants theatres and museums Bed and pillows were comfortable Reception and Concierge staff were helpful and friendly 
287334,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Nothing really , We were lucky enough to have our room ready when we arrived early in the morning We were treated like King and Queen by the staff through our stay The room was big nice super comfy the bathroom is large clean very bright which is always welcome Loved everything about my stay and will return

287342,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, For the price we paid for the room we expect the cleanliness to be better There were a pile of disgusting disposable contact lenses scattered on and around the bedside table from a previous guest The bathrooms were in need of repair i e grout missing floor tiles loose or cracked And it would be nice if there was mouthwash and hand cream included , The beds were very comfortable It was nice and quiet The location was very good 
287343,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, The internet was appalling was not able to connect once during my stay which was very frustrating the breakfast could have been included with the price you pay for the hotel , Welcoming and helpful staff great location great restaurants near by and 10 minutes walk from the lyceum building which our main purpose for visiting and rooms was very comfortable and clean with a great bath tub 
287344,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Noisy at night but then it is central London so expected, Comfy bed nice shower Lovely stay in London we spent all our time out so just slept at the hotel 1 night Much better value than competitors near by Saved over 200 Will recommend to friends 
287345,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley, Very basic amenities the iron didn t work and complaint was greeted with some scepticism by concierge Other hotels in central London offer better service and standards for better price in my experience Arriving to be quoted 50 for breakfast was off putting when it only costs 15 to have breakfast at Harrods , Comfortable room which wasn t noisy 
287346,Thistle Holborn The Kingsley,No Negative, The hotel has a nice old English feel with a modern twist Beds are super comfy and rooms styled beautifully Location is key as the hotel is in mid Holborn within walking distance of Oxford Street Covent Garden and museums Also close to the Holborn underground station with Piccadilly and Central line ready to take you anywhere in minutes The street is more on the quiet side so peace and quiet is quaranteed Staff is very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very wholesome and yummy Lounge bars Singapore Slings were delightful All in all my first choice whenever I m in London THUMBS UP
