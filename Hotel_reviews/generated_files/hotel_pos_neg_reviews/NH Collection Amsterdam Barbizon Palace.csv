419726,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We had air condition problem in the night before last drops came down from the ceiling We told the staff in the morning and they immediately suggested to change the room We liked the room and thought it will be fixed so we did not want to change room We came back in the evening thinking it was solved but during the night it went wild and in the morning of the last day we had water coming down from the ceiling and a square from the ceiling partly fell and blocked the main door The staff apologized , We stayed in a double superior room for 11 nights Wonderful breakfast Big and comfortable room Very comfortable bed Nice big bathroom Street view which we liked Good closet with shelves and hanging for clothes Very quiet at night even thought there is a restaurant and a pub near by Very friendly staff Very close to central station which was very useful for us Good choices on T V

419731,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The fact that our room was so noisy like trying to sleep in a nightclub and we had to move hotels Having paid 286 for the room this was awful Can t believe they let this room at that price Or any price actually , Decor was nice
419732,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Our car was too big for the underground parking so the hotel kindly arranged for off site parking at a cost of 45 Euro a day , Friendly helpful staff location was great The Vermeer restaurant was superb 
419733,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Expensive breakfast we eated outside, Location near central station connect you to all city destinations most are within a walking distance Room was clean and comfortable
419734,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Shower area should have been fully enclosed to prevent water spilling out , Comfortable room with full amenities 3 minutes walking distance from train station if you are arriving by train from airport it via intercity trains from other Europe countries Helpful and friendly staffs 
419735,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room that was given the first night was like a bunker with no possibility of opening a window which had a view to an interior corridor We changed room and things got better It was bad to see that the spa was not in service due to renovations , The Hotel is well located nice atmosphere in general good service 
419736,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, AC could have been a little bit cooler , This hotel is conveniently located directly opposite the Amsterdam Central station and within quick walking distance of the Red Light District Many reputable pubs restaurants etc within 5 10 minute walk Room was large bed very comfortable No Complaints 
419737,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, When we checked in the front desk lady ask us to wait a few moments for the clean up of our room then it turned out to last over 25 minutes More over the lady didn t inform us when the room was actually ready Room rate doesn t match hotel guest room facilities Found a long blonde hair when having yogurt during breakfast the supervisor though verbally apologize for that but immediately jump to the conclusion it s one of guest hair , Wonderful location breakfast with lots of assortment
419738,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The parking is a bit problematic there is not enough space outside the hotel to wait while they take your car and there is no one outside to guide you we waited 30 min for someone to tell us what to do properly and had to keep driving around in the small streets of the city center Someone organizing cars outside would help , Super helpful staff very nice rooms and great location 
419739,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The hotel is really close to the Dam Square and Central Station it takes only 15 minutes by train to get from the Airport to the Central Station and 5 7 minutes walking from the station to the hotel The rooms are clean and well organised but the value for money is a over rated It is highly recommended for a short stay to explore the beautiful city of Amsterdam
419740,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The location is great the bed was so comfortable and the breakfast is yummy especially the scrambled eggs The michelin star restaurant inside the hotel is also yummy 
419741,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The back street beside the hotel is very noisy specially during weekends which makes it difficult to sleep at night I understand that this is not the fault of the hotel but I would recommend to have an inside room internal not on the street side if you want to stay at this property and sleep well, Great location with very friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast
419742,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Housekeeping, Location I advice all people going to Amsterdam to use the discount code from booking com when they want to go by the toure to any place it is useful i gait a ticket with 48 eur is said of 65 eur
419743,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Overrated old facility with paper thin walls and ceilings that made getting to sleep on some nights difficult due to noisy neighbors Also the lifts are old and dodgy with makeshift panels and control buttons Should definitely not be rated 5star , Location
419744,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Breakfast Very bland and very expensive My recommendation is to walk a few meters and enjoy a much better breakfast for much less money at one of the many local cafes some of which have real character , This hotel is located about 200 meters from the Central station and is just meters from the canals and red light district The area is packed with good restaurants and bars We are regular visitors to Amsterdam and our first preference of hotel is the Barbizon Palace The hotel is welcoming clean efficient check in and well located for the tourist It is perhaps a little too expensive at times of the year

419748,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Turkish bath was still under construction This was extremely annoying because I booked my stay so that I can use this facility to relax after a long day I wanted to complain to reception but decide that there wasn t much point I travel to Amsterdam regularly and normally check into the DoubleTree so it would be nice if Barbizon Palace could redeem itself by compensating me in some way to entice me to stay the next time I visit the city , Bed was comfy and room decor was nice 
419749,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The room was fantastic high vaulted ceiling and in keeping with the city architecture Great little cafe opposite the hotel did a great breakfast for 36 for the 4 of us

419754,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, the Cleanliness issue has a big question mark the 5 stars Hotels needs to invest more on the cleanliness issue in one day they didn t clean our room at all we asked them on the middle of the day and we left the room then we return back by night and nothing happened i requested an upgrade over the phone before i arrive but this is not happen and the employee who talked to me over the phione forget to add it to the booking it self the fromt office employee said that to me , The Location is outstanding 
419755,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, It would have been easier for us if our room was all one level , Breakfast was excellent Staff friendly and very helpful Very comfortable bed So nice to have water available in the lobby Loved the flower arrangements in the lobby 
419756,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, In the room there are seven stairs from the washroom and entrance to reach beds and table and the colour of the stairs and floor are the same so for the last step one will lose the height so we fell down both we at our 50s and there was a lots of noise because of refrigerator and fans ,No Positive

419760,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Our room was extremely noisy located along the canal side of the hotel from the nearby bar area The front desk lady when we checked in was not very friendly or helpful , We were upgraded to a canal view room The room size and bathroom is nice The shower is large and the hairdryer was one of the best I have had in a hotel in awhile The location is super close to the train station and very central for exploring the city 
419761,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Bar restaurant menu didn t match food we were served Service was unbelievably slow maybe because there wax also a Michelin star restaurant on site Also room was very noisy on occasions due to nightlife in adjoining street , Excellent location helpful staff very clean
419762,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The elevators are quite in need of refurbishment The free WIFI is very slow and sometimes unreachable , The breakfast is really good with lots of selections Coffee is standard machines

419764,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, More than usual amount of hangers but I would like more wardrobe space Well stocked tea tray but a little too small and not a good idea when pouring hot water the whole thing would be better moved to the dresser surface under the tv Be aware not all plugs are three pin so you may need an adaptor You are on the edge of the red light district not really a problem just take the mains street you may not want the smell of hash pervading the air when you walk When you come out of the station turn left and you will come to a zebra crossing if you go straight ahead this much more complex to cross the roads tramlines cycle tracks , We had difficulties booking due to credit card issues the hotel sorted things out the hotel made us guest of the day on arrival so we had a room upgrade to a slightly bigger size and free breakfast voucher so that was a good start A bright and breezy guest relations manager seemed genuinely keen to make useful welcome and took us personally the to the room Some evening s brought around a cookie or chocolate etc A heated towel rail that actually works The shower looks a bit dark but there is a separate light switch just inside the door and once you find that its bright enough Wifi provided Very helpful friendly staff We also ate at their sister hotel the Krasnapolsky White Room Michelin star restaurant and that further reinforced our favourable opinion of this hotel chain Excellent choice and quality at breakfast Very accommodating on check out to leaving luggage to be collected later etc 
419765,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Although the bed was very comfortable we didn t find the pillows very comfortable which is a shame because everything else was extremely good , Excellent location Very friendly and helpful staff Bright and airy room with a huge bed The bathroom and shower was spacious with the addition of robes and slippers The room was very clean 
419766,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Room price was high as our currency TL other than that we have not encountered anything upsetting , The hotel s location was great The staff was very polite and helpful To many touristic locations it was only a walking distance We used the public transport only for visiting the museum district where Rijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum are located The room was very neat and modern the bathroom was clean the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was great with many options If the price is ok for you it s a great place to stay when you re in Amsterdam

419771,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, At a discounted price of 250 Euro I didn t expect a great view What I did expect however is towels that didn t feel like sand paper and bed linens that don t feel like the disposable paper covers on the pillow from my flight Also we had an un requested rolling bed in our room that was good for little more than banging my shins on , Beautiful rooms and common areas Bar staff were very nice and accommodating 
419772,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Breakfast A disappointing experience that is overpriced tasteless dry cold and serviced by staff who would rather still be in bed I cannot find anything nice to say about the most important meal of the day , If you are visiting Bath then this hotel is great as it is in the centre of the City easy to access by car with parking just under the hotel 
419773,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I was staying for two days at the second day they cancelled my room card without any notice due to not getting the guarantee I already gave the full price in advance They gave me a card which they claimed that is working but didnt work when i go to room i went down and up for 4 times Never had such a thing in a five star hotel Not suggested,No Positive

419787,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Everything was great except this guy from the vermeer restaurant who was in the lobby offering a glass of champagne for valentine But when you finish the glass you discover that you will be charged for it , It was great value for money for the 2 nights i have stayed during valentine as the rate are higher later on like all amesterdam hotels The location is super great a smart point to start your journey I recommend the uperfloor as you will see the tailes if you have not booked your room with view it is not a big deal as you will see the view from the elevator since his walls are from glass 
419788,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The hotel was a 3 minute walk from the station you can see it as you come out of the front of the station and you can walk pretty much everywhere in the centre The boats stop really close by so we got one home The pillows were really comfy It s not a cosy boutique but it was brilliant for a weekend away Tip House of Bols was a really fun way to spend an hour or so

419791,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Was a little shocked to find out my booking cost over 100 more than the price quoted on arrival due to city tax which I knew nothing about maybe my fault for not realising but that s a bit of a jump in price and I never paid it last time I was in Amsterdam First room had balcony door wide open and the room was freezing and we couldn t close the door so they changed us room was disappointed there was no baths in the rooms even though online it says bath showers and I sent a request to the hotel to have a room with a bath so I feel I should of got a reply stating they don t have baths so I didn t have to deal with disappointment on arrival they only have baths in the suite rooms apparently Ordered breakfast to the room and it was the completely wrong breakfast and freezing I know mistakes happen but it s a little annoying when your starving and a vegetarian and got a plate of cold sausages and bacon that wasn t ordered , Even though we had a few disasters the staff are lovely and helpful and the hotel is very pretty even though the hall ways could do with a little revamping but that s just me being picky Rooms are a good size and decorated nicely the bed was huge and very comfy The location is spot on really close to everything 
419792,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Staff at check in process was not exact We were 3 people already book for 2 room one under my name one with my boss name and the she doesn t check all the details we just got one I ask we were already book for 2 room from booking com its is ok if we canceled one do we still got free charge She say OK no charge and we got one with extra bed we Love NH but NH Krasnapolsky is better , close from everywhere 
419793,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was very cold when we arrived It took us 3 times to get the staff to fix it They referred to economy purposes The heating in the room only works when the a c is on It takes 40 minutes to get the temperature to a reasonable level and when you live the room it cools down very quickly Only at the end of our stay it was warm inside Wi fi in the room was also extremeIy unstable We asked it too be fixed they checked the room and restarted the modem but it didn t help I stayed many times at NH hotels including this one and it was my first negative experience Overall I cannot recommend the hotel for business travellers as you might need to spend too much on sorting out technical stuff there , The location of the hotel is great Breakfast is very good

419795,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, A lot of external noise from outside sometimes until 5am I Was told this room was an upgrade and agreed to pay a extra 40 euro on arrival for the upgrade However considering the room was adjacent to bars I was a bit dissatisfied with paying extra Still didn t spoil what was a great weekend , Great location and early check in was great As for Amsterdam what a place great food friendly staff and incredible scenery with the added bonus of snow My wife and I can t wait to return amsterdamlifers

419798,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Ventilation in room 250 was very noisy Breakfast was good but the waiters with plates and glasses were very slow in keeping up with the demand Checked my bill and was charged 23 02 for something that I didn t order or buy so check your bill Over all nice hotel , Breakfast was very good
419799,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The bed is not comfortable at all and at 12 pm the church bell rings everyday for 5 minutes and you can t sleep, I like the location and the service

419803,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing Idid not even talk a taxi All the nice places very near , All was amazing comfy bed excellent staff 4 sure i will come back again thank you to all the staff I love amesterdam becoz of u all
419804,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The price of breakfast is a bit expensive, Staff at Concierge were very helpful and suggested a great dining place for me and my guests Also every question asked was answered in a informative and professional way Front desk staff response early check in request which was surprising and great 
419805,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We ordered a tea coffee via room service and it took over an hour to arrive and The health beauty spa was not yet open due to refurbishment , Our room was cleaned despite us waking up really late Wasn t expecting it to be cleaned so late 
419806,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Hotel is good but the price reflects an establishment of a higher standard The advertised Tapas for 2 at the Hotel bar didn t exist yet left on , Location could not be better train into Central station from airport walk 300yds and your in the Hotel 
419807,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The toilet was dripping 24 hours a day for the whole entire werekend Was the most annoying thing you could imagine, The location Perfect for access into Central Amsterdam Lots of bars and restaurants 
419808,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Unfortunately we had a room right next to a busy street and the noise from the street was really bad all through the night , The room was quirky and large great location close to the train station 
419809,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, This is my favorite for overnight stay after landing in Netherlands for business Just across the street from the train station good facilities excellent staff great location 
419810,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We we re on the first floor and on the Saturday night it was so loud as there are bars and clubs just outside so it was hard to sleep on that night but the other nights were fine , The location is perfect it s near everything The staff very friendly too 
419811,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The location is great The rooms have very nice modern new furniture The staff are awesome Actually i liked everything and will go back on my next visit 
419812,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, When we arrived we were charged city tax no mention of this in the booking also charged a 100 Euro deposit Which wasn t mentioned , The room was a basic room yet still fantastic 
419813,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, We were upgraded to a better room as we were travelling for a special birthday the new room was amazing The staff couldn t have been nicer and more accommodating The location was brilliant for getting around the city Would definitely stay here again 
419814,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, It s a 5 star hotel but didn t quite feel like it I m sure there were fancier rooms than ours which was standard but what we needed It was just very expensive I guess you have to think of it as more for paying for location , The proximity to the train station was great Felt very safe in the area Easy walk to Dam Square restaurants shopping and canal tours About a half hour walk to the museums 
419815,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We booked a superior room with view The room was small and comfortable but the view which cost extra was non existent The window was completely misted up and the view was the slated roof of a church Definitely not worth the extra cost We also had a long wait to check in , Excellent location and first class breakfast 
419816,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was far too hot and the duvet on the bed was not appropriate in such a hot room There was no temperature adjustment available , Very good location nice and very efficient staff 
419817,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I think the price of breakfast was really expensive So much that we dined elsewhere Everything else was perfect, Location was excellent Concierge was really helpful and very pleasant Room was really comfortable and clean
419818,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Rooms were sometimes cleaned a little late in the afternoon , staff were very friendly always helpful and approachable We very much enjoyed the gluwein and hot chocolate in the afternoons 
419819,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The fact that when i cancelled my booking for the last night as i haf to be in copenhagen they wouldnt tefund me, Everything was of top quality i ws dissapointed when i couldnt cancel my last night as i had to be in copenhagen and i was charged 
419820,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The cleaning staff didn t want too help with any questions And the room was well over priced Would have to lower price for me too come back in future, Very clean great location 
419821,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Misleading photos of Premier room types Do not book this room type and expect to get what is pictured here on booking com There is only one room that looks like that I was told Slamming doors thumps thuds and booms from within the hotel is quite disturbing and happens constantly at any hour of the day or night Some rooms have soundproofed windows and some do not I asked for a quiet room and was given a room without any soundproofing that was directly facing an Irish Pub Yes it was disturbing and quite insulting Beware of this hotel if indeed you must stay here Otherwise find something else there are plenty of other options This hotel is just not worth the high price for any type of discerning person and seems to be for budget type tourists and younger backpacker types Stay away from room 261, Daniel the concierge is good man working with a very poorly run property He tried to help but was unable to due to an unavailability of quiet Premier rooms 
419822,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The rooms weren t very clean There were huge cracks in the ceiling The surroundings were quite noisy but the mini fridge was even noisier During checkout we had to wait quite long Facilities were closed down The elevator was missing some buttons the carpets were worn It felt more like a 3 star hotel than a 5 star hotel Very expensive for what you get in return , Rooms are nice but small Since there wasn t a room available with a bath we got an upgrade to a room with a view and we could choose front side or back Mini bar was very varied even though we didn t use any Bathroom was nice The venue where we had the party the church was really nice to see 
419823,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Restaurant service was very slow Surprising since there weren t many customers , The room was spacious and the bath amenities were wonderful The bell staff were cheerful and very helpful 
419824,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The beds are very hard I booked a superior double I got a first floor room overlooking the side street full of bars which was really noisy until 4am I got this after being moved from a third floor inner room which was twin instead of double I m glad I only had 2 nights stay here I booked a canal cruise in the hotel paid 21 50 pp I expected a quality boat cruise to match the 5 hotel instead we were on one of the smallest boats on the canal the company office 2 mins from the hotel offers the same cruise for 13pp that just added insult to injury , Staff were mostly friendly and helpful breakfast was a good buffet the location is great for touring around the city 
419825,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Cleaning was not careful the area of coffee and tea making was dirty every day , Great location just in the heart of Amsterdam modern comfortable room 
419826,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing , Excellent hotel clean modern and friendly staff Easy check in no problems Location excellent opposite amsterdam central station and within walking distance of the dam square Brilliant hotel
419827,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Internet is very good but not in all rooms it works as it should be Check out before with the receptionist if you need it although there are of course much better things to do in Amsterdam than working , Perfect spot excelent services from the receptionist to concierge over the bar room service and cleaning staff nothing to complain about I have been in many hotels in Amsterdam but this one is with distance the best place to go to Very good value for your money My favored hotel in Amsterdam 
419828,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Bar staff very slow to bring drinks and waited approximately an hour for a snack which we had to cancel as we had to leave before it arrived , Good room very quiet which was great as we had been up for more than 2 days

419830,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The first night I stayed at a room with windows to the interior lobby of the hotel But I asked to change and staff was really prompt finding a new room , Great location Modern rooms really well decorated 
419831,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I booked on the internet and when arrived around 13 00 the room was not ready as I requested for double bed so I waited till 15 00 and I was surprised that I was given room in the underground where you take stairs to reach the toilet inside the room it was actually funny I have never seen it before Again I asked for another room and I was given twin bed which was against my request however I accepted because I was tired The second day we went out and when we came back we expected the room to be clean nothing was clean even the cups were still dirty I spoke to the reception and all what they say is sorry sir I dialed the duty manager to tell him about my concerns but he wasn t helpful at all so I figured out that this hotel is low class hotel which they don t really look after their guests I left very disappointed , The whole thing was disappointing actually comparing to the 5 stars hotels
419832,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The bedroom was tight and very small They explain that it because the Hotel has been built on old family residence , To be near to the main train station
419833,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Some bits of hotel feel dated but our room 2nd floor was newly refurbished and very very nice Wooden floors a definite plus for allergy sufferers slippers included 
419834,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, The hotel has a nice style and amazing scent when you enter the staff is very kind and helpful The room was spacious enough and the bed was really comfortable There was a flat iron in the wardrobe that I was happy about Coffee machine helped me to have a smooth and good start in the morning Very central location I loved to stay here 
419835,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I did not see anyone can make services to you in lobby like coffee or tea it should be go to the bar but I think the management of hotel they can do this facility in lobby, Good location and comfortable rooms and very coordinate staff
419836,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing all perfect, Such a lovely hotel excellent location spotlessly clean friendly staff nothing was to much trouble will definitely stay in this hotel again loved everything about this hotel
419837,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The breakfast was not WOW for the money and if you call for information regarding in room dining try to avoid rush hours I have called to ask what was included in one the breakfast options and the lady told me that she did not know and to call later if I have questions about the menu since she was receiving a lot of more calls to order from other passengers not polite at all resulting in me going to the known starbucks option at the train station A bit noisy even at the upper floor , The room was nice the view 
419838,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, There no CNN Chanel as per NH standard That surprised me CNN is the most watched Chanel on Mother Earth Every hotel has it on planet earth , Good people good location good breakfast
419839,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Elevators are quite old but I was told they are in the process of renovating Gym Equipment rather limited but ok for a hotel , I love that the rooms are bright with a modern design while still being cosy Great to have a hotel that refrains from putting carpets in the rooms so its spotless clean It was superb to have a little working station table in the room to work The location is top notch right next to the train station I travel a lot for work and seen many hotels so im happy to say Id stay here again 
419840,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The interance of the room was very small and there was a stairs you have to go to the room and I was traveling with my baby it was very difficult to get to the room with the trolley,No Positive
419841,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Pillows The pillows in the room could have been a higher quality, Staff were excellent Special mention to Stan who was not only friendly but very helpful with suggested trips directions advice etc 
419842,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The restaurant is mostly fully booked given its high status and the bar alternative is not really an alternative I would not recommend for longer stays in Amsterdam given location at a loud and rather chaotic corner of the Amsterdam infrastructure There are more charming welcomes than what you step into when going out the front door, Excellent breakfast at this NH hotel near Amsterdam main station Hotel is modern even if situated in an old building Rooms comfortable bathroom clean and staff overall fairly efficient and helpful Recommended for shorter stays where quick access in and out is priority Unfortunately the on site restaurant was fully booked so cant comment here 
419843,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, None overall happy with the service and property, The property was located in Central Amsterdam Convenient and first class The staff members were helpful Marco from the front office in particular was a great help 
419844,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Breakfast should have been included for that price and my room had a tiny window, Rooms were lovely newly refurbished clean and tasteful Good quality WIFI as I d expect 
419845,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We took 3 equal rooms but any of them were equal one too small the other bigger and one of them it was really noisy at night so it was difficult to sleep We asked for something nicy in my mum s room because it was her birthday and they just left a piece of chocolate in her room , It s perfect location 5 min walking from Amsterdam Central station Nice to check out at 3PM
419846,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Very expensive , Very clean and comfortable The location is great you don t need to use public transport to do shopping and visit main attractions 
419847,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Checkin process the hotel staff told that my booking had to checkin before 4 pm Which we didn t see that condition earlier So they cancelled our room and we have to wait for 1 30 Hrs to get the answer to access to room or not , Good location from the train station
419848,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, In NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace we can find the best Concierge on Earth Many thanks Daniel for all your attencion and professionalism 
419849,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Check in was very bad I checked in at 230pm and was told my room was not ready and need 30mins went out for a stroll and returned 60mins later and room was still not ready and has to wait for another long 45mins with the good check in desk staff chasing but the process took just too long Noticed there was no TV remote control in my room and had to call three times and waited for 2 hours before someone came to my room to give me a remote control And that was after I had mentioned my fourth call I will want to speak to the manager in charge if there is still no response from them, Location of the hotel which is very near the main train station One big bed was very firm and large Large and good quality HDTV in room with many channels 
419850,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Beds were creaky and quite uncomfortable I did not appreciate housekeeping knocking on my door at 9am on the morning of check out despite the fact I had the do not disturb sign up Long queues to check in and and check out and I noticed during our stay that there was often a queue at reception , Location next to Central Station Rooms are well decorated and look great 
419851,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Mini bar prices overrated , Very clean Amazing bed Nice bath with shower Excellent position near Centraal Station shopping area and of course Red Light District 
419852,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Just about everything A typical big hotel who don t really care for short term guests We have visited A dam many times Some places good some not This time NOT , The room floor 4 was in the loft They pretended it was upgrade Very poor Bed was not Twin as promised Not possible to change when requested The heating in this loft did not work 
419853,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Neat Clean Hotel near to central station just walking distance Break wast was amassing Staff very professional courtous Rooms were super clean Soft pillows exellant bed Near to all tourist places in Amsterdam Central station is just acros the canal so very easy to move anywhere No need of tram or taxi 
419854,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Woke up in the middle of the night and the whole room smelled like the sewer Something very wrong going on with the shower drain that spewed that bad odour Not nice, Good location 
419855,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Sometimes reception is very crowded so plan your checking out in advance We had 1st floor canal view room in the evening we had to keep draperies closed as facade lightning was directed right to the window But generally it was not disturbing , Rooms are very quiet and clean minibar choice is good room service works perfect Hotel is situated close to central station and historical part of city so you wouldn t need taxi to get to museums or airport 
419856,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Fantastic location in the old part of town and across the canal from the train station so easy to get anywhere you want Large modern and comfortable room 
419857,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Most of the staff was friendly but there was one that seemed bothered to help us once That is the only complaint , The bed and room were VERY comfortable 
419858,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was too warm and setting the thermostat to the lowest temp didn t help , The shower and bathroom amenities were incredible The location was perfect for a 24 hour layover in Amsterdam 3 minute walk to Central train station 15 minutes train ride to Schiphol The bed was comfortable and room was quiet despite being in the busiest part of Amsterdam 
419859,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I would have rated 1 5 but not available on here This is based on a 225 per night room charge The level of service expected and quality of all facilities is concomitant with the charges levied Reception staff Poor customer service Leaving customers waiting to be served Marco was particularly ignorant Ignoring me part way through checkin to take a phone call Again at checkout 4 customers waiting 2serving Then one walks off after completing a customer Another girl turns up No acknowledgement of waiting guests Then messes around 4 staff around reception counter Only one serving All of this can be verified on the hotels cctv Disgusting view from the room of a smelly dirty and dank light well Poor wifi reception Had to ask for this to be rectified Room excessively hot When key left in room to run ac interfering maid removed it and took it away Meant we had to go through security process to get another room key Safe not secured to structure of room so anyone, The location was great But so is the ibis and its 20 times better value for money Try the Ink hotel or the Pulitzer as they re the same price and far superior
419860,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The size of our superior room is on the minus side , Reception staff were very helpful and the concierge service was excellent Room was comfortable location perfect I will stay in this hotel next time I visit Amsterdam We loved lazy sunday option as our departure was late in the evening 
419861,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Tea coffee not replenished Noise from road early morning glass recycling deliveries Not being able to find any bar staff , Very comfy beds Lovely clean rooms Good shower towels robes Nice toiletries
419862,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Bed was too small, The bed was lovely and I m fussy the pillows were soft so important and I had a really good nights sleep If anything the bed was too small very small infact 
419863,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Parking was very expensive however I was aware going in The low ratings above relate to getting stuck in a pretty undesirable interior room The hotel in general had beautiful facilities Fortunately we spent little time in our room other than sleeping so we did not make a big stink about it , Location was key Got excellent dining recommendations from staff The Seafood Bar Albert and Niels were exceptionally helpful friendly and informative We had an excellent bottle of wine left and gave it to them to enjoy as we were headed to the airport Good behavior deserves acknowlagement Just minutes walk to the hopping night life numerous restaurants and to transport anywhere else 
419864,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Just wish we had more time to explore this very unique city , Very clean and comfortable in a great location The staff were always cheerful and extremely helpful Loved watching the small boats steam past our window Very cool 
419865,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, It s says 5 stars but it s probably 3 but couldn t care less they run a good show , Everything was what you want Happy and helpful staff all whilst really busy quick check in Breakfast was the best I ve had heaps of gluten free and allergy options Rooms clean and comfy view of the Dam large rooms and bathrooms Every single staff member would greet you wherever you were Concierge Edwin was fantastic same with Didiem who was helping the 40 people checking out Good stuff 
419866,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room and bed sheets were not cleaned properly Stains on the duvet and pillows and all the dust pushed under the bed instead of properly vaccuming IRD night menu ridiculous Impossible to get bread toasted or a simple bowl of french fries basic and simple requests that would be expected of a 5 property , The location was perfect The staff was very professional and friendly 
419867,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We chose not to have breakfast as felt it was very expensive , Located very close to railway station and very central for food bars and some attractions 
419868,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Nice rooms good location the prices were way too high for the weekend we were there though 200 per night for a standard double without breakfast included 
419869,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, They didnt pick up my breakfast order so i had it 2 hours later, The room was quiet nice my check in supposed to be at 15 00 but i asked to do it when i arrived at the hotel and they did it without problem same story fo the check out

419871,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Not much to dislike Must be in the process of refurbishment as room lobby excellent modern but halls lifts are very tired dated No milk frother with Nespresso machine but still good for black coffee , Ideally located clean comfortable Friendly helpful staff Lots of hanging shelf space Large refurbished well appointed room USB charging point on desk both sides of bed Good sized separate modern bathroom Our reserved Double room was not ready when we arrived at 10am but we were offered a Twin instead that was ready We gladly accepted as we were not expecting such an early checkin 
419872,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I paid USD 280 00 for a room for one night When I made reservation I requested a room overlooking Central Station and this request was acknowledged by Management Two days before my arrival I emailed hotel reminding them of my room request and was advised that such a room would cost USD 40 00 additonal Upon checking in the clerk Jett said I could have Room with View of Central Station but that room was not ready I came back to hotel 5 hours later and was disappointed to have a room with Alley view No value at this hotel , Great Location 
419873,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I have stayed at the Barbazon many times still love it and will return Tho this time pictures of a premium room shows a large room with beamed ceilings Large windows The room was small white with nothing Special I was given a partial refund but was totally disappointed Still love the Barbazon , Great location Best concierge in Amsterdam 
419874,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was not clean there were insects and spiders They gave us noisy room with heater noise all day The next day we asked to change our room and they said we have to pay 20 because they don t have rooms so we forced them then they changed our room Also other room was not clean with spiders Wifi is weak and poor House clean poor don t clean well Room service poor they don t have fruits Unfortunately I didn t take any picture for the spider, The location of the hotel is perfect
419875,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We arrived early at the hotel and were told our room was not ready Since we had traveled from overseas we were anxious to check in We were offered an upgrade which we took and ended up in the basement which was like a dungeon No thanks to the Barbizon next time ,No Positive
419876,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Noise levels were ridiculous We had to keep checking the windows were closed as it felt like people were partying in our room until 3 4am weekend and weekday nights Spoke to staff who said next time we should ask for an inside room as it won t be as loud You then have the noise of every bin man and road sweeper from 6am onwards so don t expect much sleep if staying in this hotel Fine if you re planning on staying out partying until 4am and won t get woken up in the morning , Excellent location and lovely modern room free wi fi Decent hairdryer for the ladies and nice light bathroom with powerful shower Concierge appeared to be available 24 7 very polite and helpful Didn t include breakfast due to price so can t comment on food

419880,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Noise by guests in the middle of the night building works in the early hours of the morning and when addressed with hotel staff not really any resolution , Room was beautiful and bed was comfy 
419881,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was small but it was well appointed with a large desk The hotel is pricey but probably not much more than any hotel in Amsterdam , Very close to the Amsterdam rail station and Dam Square Staff was outstanding I made two separate requests to print our airline boarding passes for two different flights and each time the passes were printed out and waiting for me when I returned to the concierge desk The receptionists are wonderful The bathroom was large with a large shower and vanity The bed was very comfortable

419886,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Staff were quite unfriendly the night porter on Saturday night was unpleasant and aggressive the room wasn t fully serviced until we asked for it to be and the pillows were really poor overall not what you would expect for almost 200 per night , Location was central and room size was good 
419887,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I had booked my room online for a superior double room a good few weeks ago for a birthday present for my boyfriend When we arrived from our delayed flight the staff had to tell us that our room was gone tat use had over booked and all they had was two single rooms we had to be put up in one of your other hotels which was a bit disappointing as I had heard so much good things about ur hotel n was the reason why I booked there but staff wer very helpful and done what they could and checked us back in again the next night , The rooms were spotless Very spacious staff were helpful would go back again definitely
419888,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Too noisy room you can t sleep till 4 00 am Very very dirty room there was an used sock on the corner of the room There was more than 5 spiders in the room one was very scary The room was like a tent in the middle of nature The room was too cold the air conditioning can t heat the room Too expensive for such a room and hotel, Location that is the only advantage
419889,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The room was noisy at night being over an alleyway into the old town The reception staff were unhelpful when we asked for a double room with a bath saying that only twin bedded rooms had them Items in the rooms were not replenished and had to be asked for , The bed was comfy crisp linens and fluffy towels and the room facilities were as expected in a five star hotel The decor throughout was tasteful the concierge service was very knowledgable Great location for transport links

419943,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, For the price I had expected more space The room was very small and the single bed just fit in the space available No luggage rack to put the luggage on off the ground The bathroom and entry was four steps down from the rest of the room which for an older person at night was an extra hurdle to navigate , The location was the best asset I also liked the modern and very clean bathroom and the amenities in the room

419964,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The price you pay for a breakfast at 29 90 Euros is too expensive particularly since there seems to be no difference whether you have a continental or full breakfast ,No Positive
419965,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Rooms were roomy and very comfortable with a great bed and tea coffee facilities Bathroom was excellent Location couldn t have been better right in the midst of things in the main centre of Amsterdam with historical sites right nearby

419967,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Rather expensive for the uninspiring room that I was booked into I thought I was paying extra for a stunning room only to find I was allocated one inside facing with a single bed I don t enjoy when the staff take it upon themselves to block a large deposit on your card just in case you use their overpriced mini bar , Location was great and the facilities were spotless
419968,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We were put in a apartment instead off a room at the hotel as we were early We did not mind waiting but were told that this is what they had available We had to climb 4 flights off stairs as there was no lift The apartment was not even in the hotel it was round the corner No offer off taking our luggage up,No Positive
419969,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The housekeeping is slow and substandard I left the room at 9am but the room had not been serviced when I returned at 3 30pm broken glasses and dusts were left unattended at the floor under the wardrobe doors The front desk staff do not show good communication among the teams This has lead to frustration of handling the billing issue , The location is central and convenient
419970,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, This is not a five star hotel Rather a normal four star hotel The lobby and elevators are old Aeroflot DDR style There is nothing special about this hotel that warrants the fifth star , Close to the railway station clean quiet room Friendly personnel 
419971,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I chose the hotel to be close the station for our transfer to the airport but the station area is crowded and rather grotty , This was the best hotel we have stayed in our month of travelling in Europe It was renovated in May 2016 and the rooms and the bathrooms were very modern and glamorous The breakfast was superb and the staff were very helpful Special mention should be given to the cleaner of our room 205 who chased me down the street with my reading glasses I had left under the bed 
419972,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I had to wake up early in the morning one of the staff who came to my room to bring some water was informed to give me a wake up call Fortunately I did not rely on them otherwise I could have missed my train and subsequently my flight to Rome I informed them at reception but nobody could reply to me I am confident that the guy who just took service at night did his job as he promised to do so immediately I made a request for an early check in nobody from the hotel replied to me , Everything was just perfect except that the staff is not reliable 
419973,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Unfriendly staff cleaning very poor at the rooms Nobody help with you luggage The check out is 12h and they start to knock you door at 10h , Location
419974,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I paid 400 for 2 nights room only and they forgot to clean the room I was disgusted The hotel was nice but not that special Definitely not value for money, The reception staff were very friendly and the shower was lovely 
419975,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Expensive parking no help on getting luggage in from car porter at reception just ignored you and just looked down and would not make eye contact Bedroom was not cleaned properly dirty cups left for more than two days also soap not changed and just put back in its carbord box wet so it stuck to it and could not be used, Central location
419976,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We had the room at the first floor and just next to a busy street it was almost impossible to sleep room number 127 due to noise coming from the street you can actually hear the people talk This room should not be sold to anyone and when we wanted to change the room they could not because the hotel was full But they were all aware of the problem with the room Just poor decision from management to sell that room despite the expected bad experience from guests , Location of the hotel helpful staff
419977,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Slight confusion checking in and out time Room service was slow sometimes and we got our rooms 2 5 hours late but were told to pay when we were wanted a late check out after explaining that we got the room late and a few more words we finally got the 2 hours extension without a cost, the hotel took into account all our needs especially when we had a sick child traveling along the chef came out to enquire how he could cook the food it was very kind of them to move our friends into a hotel apartments so that they could cook for the child over all they went the extra mile and we thank you for it It was my 4th stay at The Barbizon Palace and you guys didn t disappoint as usual
419978,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Not a grumble but the bar lobby wasn t cosy and i wanted a late night snack but it was sort of grown up food couldn t get a toasted sandwich not a deal breaker but , Bed was super comfy and location is amazing

419983,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Just oposite the Central Station a great newly refurbished hotel We asked for a quiet room with a view and we had one facing the canal and the Central station Overall a great stay 
419984,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Receptionist she sent us to a couple of apartments even knowing that we have a baby Access was very difficult for us and the rooms were so noisy We asked to be relocated to the main building and she assigned another room with stairs being difficult for the baby and one that was busy When we asked for another one this last one had also stairs even more it has two floors in one it has the bed and the bathroom in the other When we moved from the apartment almost by ourselves because the personel was very busy we forgot few things that never returned to us even though we claimed for them in two occasions , Location Concierge Breakfast

419987,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Price of breakfast Rooms very clean and smart but lacked character Too expensive for a base whilst visiting Amsterdam for sightseeing Water heating went off whilst we were there so we did not have a hot shower at night before going out We were not offered a reduction in the rate for this night although we questioned the rate, Large bed good view
419988,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing, The location was perfect just outside the train station They were willing to store our luggage while we biked for 5 days The rooms were very comfortable and had great amenities I would stay there again

419992,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, My room was on two levels with stairs could be a prob if you had mobility issues could possibly be noisy as window looked down on the street was ok So no biggie, Located almost opposite the main station Clean tidy Loved the shower
419993,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The breakfast is very expencive 29 Euro each so we decided to eat outside the hotel There is a nice little cafe just across the little street , We got a very nice superior doubleroom with view to the canal Coffemachine in the room Quiet and nice Perfect location in the beginning of the red light district Just across the big main street is the Amsterdam Centralstation 
419994,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, For the price of the hotel its scandalous that the room 261 wifi was so poor that it was useless Even the kind offer of a free upgrade was also useless as that didn t do much either If you re expecting business clientele this is not acceptable Would be a good idea to keep some recharging leads for silly guests who forget theirs Don t have the rooms with canal view if noise from pubs and parties will annoy you at night , We were able to book at short notice when our flight home was cancelled Efficient friendly and well trained staff Bed comfortable and room lovely and bathroom very new and smart Canal view 
419995,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The previous reviews stated smoking rooms and I requested for one but I only found out when I got there that there weren t any throughout the hotel Also wifi service in my room was quite weak I feel the Bank Hotel was better , The hotel looked nice and is central The rooms are also nicely designed
419996,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing all were over expectation, The front desk Marija and her supervisor upgraded us from double room to suit so we could all fit comfortably Daniel at the concierge was full of information our children loved him location was a Jackpot couldnt get any better definitely would visit again Our warm wishes to all the team
419997,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, 1 WiFi was bery slow 2 Hotel Is very close to restaurants and the canal with loud noise and merry making that continued till late at night 3 Chambermaid failed to replenish instant video 4 Chambermaid simply placed new towels on the floor of shower cubicle instead of a cleaner place , Location of hotel which Is close to Amsterdam Central Railway Station
419998,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, A little noise from the bar Molley Malones across the canal but there was an Irish world cup game on so it was understandable that the crowd would be a little charged up , Location was 1 as were the staff 
419999,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Noise from streets was easily heard in the room Had a broken light stuck on in the room Called and after 30 mins 1 engineer looked at it had and had no idea how to mix it Another engineer was called and he just flipped the light around in the fixture to keep the room dark Front desk never offered another room or even followed up with the issue , Location was great to central station and getting around Amsterdam 
420000,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The breakfast was insanely expensive I thought it was included when I booked and the windows don t keep any of the sound from the streets out My window faced an Irish pub so it was pretty noisy most of the night , The room was beautiful and the bed was very comfy 
420001,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, reception staff is quite nice but a little bit overloaded with work one of them was so busy that he took the decision just to be rude and to ignore clients not a good point for such a great hotel, the location is great the interior design is contemporary and upscale
420002,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Lifts were still old, I ve stayed in this hotel a few times from grand hotel 20 years ago it was a bit tired a few years back The modern refurbishment has worked wonders and with its ideal location across from central station the hotel is now one of the better 5 in the city for the money I d recommend a second look if you ve stayed before 
420003,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Overpriced Maybe not for Amsterdam all prices are very high there but I ve stayed in boutique hotels of same category costing half as much , A nice boutique hotel Spacious room and bathroom Large LED TV and USB wall chargers Ideal location just 5 min walk from Amsterdam s Central Train Station and even closer to the metro 
420004,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, We booked the hotel for our 20th Wedding anniversary hoping for a quiet weekend away We were woken on the first morning by a wakeup call that wasn t booked and every other morning by room service The room was in the basement along a dark corridor and was directly opposite a noisy bar , The hotel was in walking distance of the centre 
420005,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Had to wait for late afternoon because our room was not available and then it was still incorrectly assigned as a double when a twin was booked Another twin was then made available No supper available in the hotel on a Sunday evening except room service , The location is fantastic Valet parking on site Fabulous breakfast
420006,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, I had booked us requesting a bath but unfortunately did not get one, I loved the bed how clean and spacious the room was the bathroom was also clean and great However it was ideal for a comfortable clean very nice hotel to stay in Staff were friendly and tried to help when possible 
420007,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, If only the rates could be marked down by say 15 more or so I would definitely rate this hotel 9 5 , Everything was just nice and as we had hoped for Towel warmer rack in the toilet was a plus especially when it s kind of cold outside 
420008,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The staff was a bit slow we had to ask three times for an extra duvet , This hotel is excellently located just opposite the main station Well re furbished elevator shows how it looked before Comfortable rooms
420009,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, They don t show on the pictures all the different kind of room you can have with the same title ex Premium with view wasn t the one expected for me , The comfort Nice renovation The situation 
420010,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace,No Negative, Excellent location opposite central station and departure of some organized tours amazing breakfast very friendly staff especially Alfred from the restaurant great shower comfortable beds clean room 
420011,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, everything was cheap the light fell off the wall like 3 times and the drain in the shower was like a 3 piece thing that was never put together in our room, modern bathrooms and furnishings
420012,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing comes to mind, Staff were a true credit to the hotel Bed was huge and comfortable View of sunset from our room was fabulous Would recommend this hotel
420013,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Breakfast We ordered two full breakfasts in our room we were advised the breakfast is better downstairs as its a wider selection and a Buffett but we wanted it in our room Breakfast was not worth the money we paid for it Very pricey very bland and not much to eat , Location is perfect The rooms are lovely and a big improvement after the refurb Great view of the city in our city view room It s value for money and you get more than what you pay for unlike most places 
420014,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The hotel is understaffed in a general way Lobbybar provides no service In checking was adequate not very hospitable , The bathroom was of a high standard and spacious WiFi worked consistently 
420015,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Nothing major the housekeeping staff need to knock on the door and wait rather than jumping in the room straight away after knocking on door , Brilliant hotel very clean neat classic yet modern at the same time staff at the reception are very friendly and helpful Very pleasent stay Location is great walking distance from central station 
420016,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Font desk manager is the worst and most rude person I ever met She kept me waiting for hours before giving me a room and the room was not what I asked for She even offered to kick me out of the hotel , Location of hotel is very strategic Hotel Duty Manager although took quite some time yet solved the room issue and the rudeness of the front desk manager
420017,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The breakfast is completely over priced in fact extortionate which is an optional add on thankfully Think what you would pay for two and that is the price per person here , Fantastic location a stones throw from Centraal station Really great room very comfortable 
420018,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Room wasn t cleaned on our second day Member of cleaning staff arrived at 18 45 which wasn t convenient as we needed the room to change before going out for the evening , Excellent location if arriving from the ferry or by train and just a short walk to all Centrum tourist spots 
420019,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Upon arrival a trainee handle our checking very poorly whilst the manager sat in the back although i do not blame the trainee for her mistakes the manager could have been more forth coming to deal with the problem at hand When the manager finally did decide to show their face it only 2 mins to sort the problem out hopefully next time check in wont take 30mins, Location of the hotel was excellent a stone throw away from the station and right in the heart of Amsterdam Central made life really pleasant for wondering around and popping back into our room for a lil nap
420020,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Hotel wifi could have been better Only free for an hour unless you upgrade to better package , Location was perfect for local attractions and transport links 5 minutes walk from Amsterdam central 10 minutes walk to Dam square 
420021,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, more staff at check in checkout there was a queue of 6 other guests waiting when we checked in through the concierge we organised a shuttle bus to take us to the airport We were at reception well before departure time but the bus took off without us so we took a taxi the excuse from the hotel was that they do not manage the bus service we wanted to eat in the hotel restaurant but it was booked for a private function there were no other alternatives apart from room service we did not want to go out , great location close to Central Station fantastic room all very new and modern Great comfortable bed room service was good 
420022,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Pillow and mattress is not 5 star even is new , Location is really good right in the action area and 5 mins walk from station but really quiet when window close 
420023,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, everything was good, very comfy rooms very clean very friendly staff who could not do enough to ensure we enjoyed our stay May return with my wife for a short break 
420024,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, The corridors at night look a bit like the Shining and either the air con or the minibar were noisy not sure which , The Hotel Rooms are large and comfortable really good breakfast Ask for Eggs Benedict with Ham if you like them Bed is conformable and bathroom is clean and new Right in the city center a walk away from the central station and the bars restaurants etc Staff are friendly and very helpful 
420025,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Elevator area on the ground floor and elevator interiors showed some signs of wear and tear but this did not impact on functionality Price wise and if you are staying for many days in Amsterdam this is not the place where one gets value for money Tad expensive , Staff at the front desk helpful and very informative Room clean and comfortable Everything looked new and well looked after within the room Really had a great overnight stay Location wise this is smack in the city center next to the central station and within walking distance from many attractions 
420026,NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon Palace, Shower style Hard to get in and out of bath, Location due to inward journey Very nice breakfast Comfortable beds
