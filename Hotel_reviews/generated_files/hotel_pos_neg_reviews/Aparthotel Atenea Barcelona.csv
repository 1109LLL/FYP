349451,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Kitchenette but not even coffee provided Room photos are misleading you have to have the cable for the kettle over the hob Shower was diabolical water around the edge only Half the lights didn t work, Location was close to where my son was living and good for transport links
349452,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, From the airport the buses are not very cheap and we had to switch bus one time We also choose the cheaper bus and it would stop everywhere Tip If you want to save money buy the ticket T 10 at the airport and go with the slow normal bus At the hotel there was some of the personell we had some language issues with and the room could have been a little bit cleaner there was some dried sauce stain at the dinging table on the wall among other things , The hotel apartment was a big quite lofty space with a table that we could eat and sit at a good air condition with changeable temperature It had a little cooking space just when we got inside with a door to the rest of the space There we found not all that we needed but most of the missing things we could ask for in the reception or the hotel restaurant The hotel was overall fresh relatively clean friendly and not to far away from the city metro The hotel was also close to numerous food stores and restaurants and also just behind a shoppingcenter with a supermarket inside 
349453,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, When we arrived we found some hair into the bathroom and we only had supplies for 2 persons while we were 3 , The room was big enough for three persons and the beds very comfortable The location is perfectly situated near the metro stop and the line of the metro goes everywhere you d like to go in BCN Very useful 
349454,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, I would have wished that in the evening the restaurant opened for dinner earlier That is before 8 00 pm I would have wished if the coffee for breakfast was not made by us at the machine but purposely by staff at the restaurant The coffee from the machine used by the residents at the restaurant is inferior , Staff at the restaurant and break fast were very friendly and professional Food at the restaurant was very good and impeccable The breakfast is varied and has a reasonable selection 
349455,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, very little kitchen equipment 2 forks 1 cup no toaster no bread knife 1 steak knife 2 glasses no tray 1 soup spoon 1 teaspoon 1 dessert spoon , bathoom good beds confortable 
349456,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, What we didn t like was the bed it has wheels so it was moving also mattress wasn t very good and I was jumping everytime my partner moved The room view wasn t nice some big hole but it didn t bother us as we used the room for sleeping mainly , Very well located hotel just 2 minutes from metro station which takes you to the city center Few supermarkets close to the hotel so you can cook or prepare some snacks as there is a small kitchen in the room There was also street market with fresh fruit vegetable bread etc few minutes from hotel Room was spacious and quiet Breakfast was excellent great and wide choice It is also possible to have a breakfast in one of the cafe s next to hotel and dinner in local restaurants which are cheaper comparing to those in the city center 
349457,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, We requested a double bed but got singles The tv was very small and only had about 3 working Spanish channels any English speaking channels would not work The shower was a bit grubby looking and the overall cleanliness of the room wasn t great The photos on the website make it look rather better than it is , Good safe area and close to metro station Air con in the room was good and the cleaners were helpful and friendly 
349458,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Overall the hotel is just a little dated and could use some updates , Helpful and friendly staff Easy access to the metro Good restaurants in the area 
349459,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The room was big enough as well as the bathroom location very good nice staff but the bed was not confortable very hard bed pillows in the floor was a open whole when you locked up in the shower the was mold on the wall tiles and on tv only a few programmes ,No Positive
349460,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The elevator was small but not a big problem, Staff are welcoming and super helpful Located in a safe and family friendly neighborhood is easily accessible to metro and Camp Nou Great food in the hotel as well as in surrounding restaurants 
349461,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Cleaning is not their strong point wifi has disconnection issues rooms not soundproofed majority of personnel not speaking English, Breakfast location very close to metro stations spacious rooms
349462,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The Hotel does not have rooms what can be connected in case bigger family with 3 4 kids are traveling , The Hotel location is great when one of the purpose of the visit is to see Barca stadium game Camp Nou is about 800m Around the Hotel there are great restorants Les Corts Metro stations is 3 min walking distnace Also the Diagonal main road is nearby to the Hotel On that area there are some shopping malls and good public transport There are two small playground also close to the Hotel which can be good for kids Hotel provide good breakfast 
349463,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, on the original booking they advertised that as it was a luxury suite we would be provided with bathrobes slippers Unfortunately these were not provided despite having mentioned it to the staff who said they would attend to it We also mentioned it to the reception on checkout we did get an apology but as we were charged for the luxury suite I felt that they could have offered a discount , the accommodation was perfect very spacious and excellent value for money we stayed only for two nights and had dinner there on the last night
349464,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The room could use some renovations It was clean but there was rust in the bathroom and you could see that everything was a bit old , The personnel was very helpful and speaking great in English 
349465,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, The location was good for us since we were going to the Camp Nou for a football game otherwise you have to take a taxi or metro into the city The room was big enough for two adults and one 12 year old 
349466,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Bed double was on wheels and kept moving when sitting up in bed and leaning on head board TV one English Channel and slow intermittent wifi which meant after long days sight seeing it was a shame the children couldn t watch and relax , Location great for Camp Nou especially before and after game Area felt safe and more local than touristy Metro close and easy line for all major attractions Staff very helpful especially late one night when son was ill 
349467,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, I wish I had stay longer We were just there for one night and Barcelona is a beautiful city and deserves more time to be explored , For European hotel standards room was very spacious and comfortable The hotel is within walking distance to the Stadium The staff was very helpful pointing out restaurants and places of interest Public transportation is very easy to spot 
349468,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Breakfast could of been better for the price Not very quick on the replenishment hence the reason we only ate there once , We loved how close the hotel was to the metro Very easy a great little bakery down the road too Bonus 
349469,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Only being really fussy as can t really say much I dust like but a grill in the kitchen would ve been good but as I said above only if I m having to look for negatives I would say this , Clean hotel Friendly staff Excellent location Food is restaurant lovely too Enjoyed our stay at this hotel 
349470,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Hotel rooms needs maintenance painting and furnishings maily First room we stayed on third floor had Avery old mattress and pillows were hard as a rock We asked to be moved so we got a room on sixth floor which was much better Internet doesn t always work , Staff are their best asset
349471,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, A couple of the fixtures and fittings were loose for example the towel rail the toilet roll holder and one of the shelves in the wardrobe Also we didn t have a microwave although the room was advertised as having one The reception staff dealt with all of the above by moving us to another room , The location is great as it is close to Les Corts where you can catch a metro or a bus to anywhere in the city or beach for 1 Euro No need to pay higher prices to stay in the city centre We didn t use the restaurant so cannot comment on that The rooms are big and bright with big windows and good views There are free daily newspapers in the lobby every morning for guests to read 
349472,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Although most of the rooms have a kitchen they didn t have a kettle for tea coffee Whilst coffee was available in the reception area of the hotel just a pity facility not in the rooms, Great location for the Nou Camp with plenty of good bars and cafes nearby The centre of Barcelona only a short trip on the metro where the nearest metro station is only 100 metres from the hotel Very good hotel and a good base for a short break to a wonderful city
349473,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Bed was too hard free wifi but difficult to connect and no nice eateries nearby I booked due to proximity to Nou camp only big mistake, Handy 10 minute walk to Nou Camp
349474,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, It really lacks plants and greenery outside there is only raw concrete without ornamentation a fresco would be welcome at minima The noise from the outside could be reduced considerably with double glazing Bedding is not advisable if you already have problems with back pain , Very professional services Far from the center but close to the metro Rooms very comfortable but noise from outside This is generally fairly satisfactory and the hotelier seems to care about his guests 
349475,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The only thing was you could hear the toilet flushing next door and above us but that was not a big problem , It was spotless the bedding and towels were changed every day and the staff very friendly and helpful 
349476,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Overall it was quite clean but the bedside table was quite dusty The wifi was slow in my room But other colleagues in other rooms say it was ok , Very good location easy to reach from the airport with the metro Convenient for where I had to go for work Just behind the Cortes Ingles for some last minute shopping 
349477,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Everything, The hotel as has not security We were having breakfast and three men walked in and took my bag and no one saw it The persons who did it know when security is on and off
349478,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Only criticism is kitchen staff were not overly happy about doing room service food even though it was within the times stated , Great location friendly and helpful staff on reception 
349479,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The walls are not soundproof During the night noise from other apartment can be heard , Well equipped and large apartments with hotel services Excellent 
349480,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The room was big but otherwise didn t have much else going for it Billed as a family room it lacked sufficient closet and drawer space , Decent location in a nice neighbourhood a short metro ride or long walk from centre Nice staff Big room with a well stocked kitchenette 
349481,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Not something that i remember and need to write it down, Staff were very nice and help in any question Breakfast is great Very close to Camp nou and Metro station Los santos Best value for money 
349482,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Hair dryer useless so best to bring your own Plumbing noise from the surrounding rooms quite bad When I booked our room I did ask for a double bed Disappointed we were only given two singles pushed together with single bed linen and a large gap between beds Tried to get a soft drink just after 11pm from restaurant only to be abruptly told by waitress we re closed Reception staff very helpful though , Kitchen area Free toiletries sweets and bottled water Location to metro and camp nou 
349483,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, We specifically asked for a double bed that turned out to be two beds connected they were rather large though No shower phone makes bathing a baby difficult , The hotel is just a step away from all the major shopping centers of the Diagonal very close to a could of parks for nice walks and surrounded by restaurants The room was rather spacious with a small kitchen that we did not use 
349484,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Wifi didnt work in the apartment even though they changed us the passwords twice but never managed to have it working , Apartment was very large and confortable Excellent location near Camp Nou and subway Bars and restaurants around supermarket parking petrol station and El Corte Ingles 
349485,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The bedroom s bed is too hard We couldn t have a good sleep during our stay I could feel the spring mattress on my back I do sugest the hotel s management to upgrade their mattresses Also the breakfast their coffee is awful their coffee machine seems to have been broken for a while the water is never hot not a bit there aren t natural juices as they advertise it but a lot of alcoholic beverages available for breakfast that s why we only ate there once , The Property has a good location closed to amenities and of course the Barza s stadium 
349486,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Great having a kitchen Massive Super market just across the road Good to have a door seperating the main bed and sofa bed Really close to camp Nou which is why we were there 2 mins from the metro Good wifi Really clean Bit expensive but worth it for convenience Lots of places to eat out close by
349487,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Needed a sun roof in the car to be able to get out of the car in the very narrow spaces , Spacious room Good range of toiletries in the bathroom Very friendly helpful staff 
349488,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, we requested a double bed but it was just two single beds put together not even with a double bed sheet covered we could easily fall into the gap, location kitchen We only found two really good shopping malls nearby on our last day pity we didn t have enough time to explore Recommend the L illa Mall
349489,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Noisy rooms you live with your neighbors especially on kitchen side for smells and bathroom side for noise Lift very slow don t be in hurry, Location very close to metro L3 and Diagonal for taxis Tips for breakfast go to Placia de Concordia 4 min walk quiet and nice typical local square Staff at your service Building and room from years 2000 good shape Rooms pretty large and convenient Large and comfortable beds for a family room
349490,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The rumbling every time the metro passes when i was assigned a room on level 2 Room is too clinical Some warm colours would have made it cosier , Good water pressure for the shower Kitchenette a bonus Rooms are spacious even though very basic and spartan 
349491,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, told there were limited double beds in hotel when asked reception to change Despite requesting double bed was stuck with two singles we pushed together Was comfortable just annoying not together , High powered shower and great location
349492,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Paid for a superior room and was given a standard no explanation or discount Only realised when I checked once back home , Hotel was clean and staff attentive Tube ride away from centre 
349493,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Wish the ambience of the room was a little cosier could have provided a comforter for the bed Rooms on Level 1 could feel the vibrations of the passing trains in the underground metro , I love the excellent water pressure of the shower The kitchenette was a useful service as well Staff are friendly and polite Room is very clean I feel it s relatively good value for money for a basic hotel 
349494,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, room was smaller than expected for a family of four with 2 teenage boys, Great reception staff clean and tidy apartment although very small for a family with 2 teenagers Close to metro and shopping facilities
349495,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The size of the room was quite small compared with the picture of the website, The Neighborhood was good great shoppingmall right next to the apartment
349496,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, there was supposed to be sattelite tv but there were few english channels so not possible to see the tennis at wimbledon, location was excellent helpful staff
349497,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, That the kitchenette wasn t fully equipped from the start and that if you were not in the room the fridge switched off, Comfortable Good choice at breakfast
349498,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Location was great very close to the metro Staff were friendly and told us that there was a mini bar in our room which was stocked with drinks for our arrival which was a very nice bonus The bed was really comfy and all the facilities were excellent We loved our stay and would definitely return 
349499,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, The apartment is large with a separate kitchen Well appointed and convenient The location was perfect for my requirements and although it is not downtown the area is very nice and public transport to the Centre is very close by Very pleased indeed 
349500,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, On booking we asked for a double room but got a twin I checked at reception and only the family rooms have double beds We were dissappointed with the breakfast on the first morning but found plenty of local cafes on subsequent days who provided much better value, A clean and comfortable room in Barcelona town Shower over bath worked fine air con good but can t leave it on if you re not in the room Although the location isn t central it s easy and quick to get around by Metro bus or tram Book your metro pass and activities online before you travel This way you avoid queues and get some good discounts Recommend an evening at Montjuic fountains which is only a few metro stops away and a day time visit to the Castell Montjuic and cable car for the fab views 
349501,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, They didn t have pool or gym You had to request iron and kitchen equipment , The location was perfect Taxi stand right beside and do was the metro Also had a great restaurant bar with delicious food at great price just across think it was call barca 
349502,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The paint work on some of the walls in my room had some wear and tear marks on it but that wasn t an issue The wifi signal wasn t always very strong , The kitchen was very well equipped and the apartment was spacious The location was excellent The staff were very friendly and helpful 
349503,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Rooms need an upgrade , The hotel is located in a great location close to camp Nou and a block away is the metro station which will take you anywhere to Barcelona in minutes even to the airport with that being said the staff is great and the rooms are clean but it will definitely need some major upgrades since for the most part everything looks old 
349504,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Room is presented on Booking com as having 35 m in reality the room had max 25 m and the kitchen is way smaller than shown in the pictures The room is very noisy each time the toilet is flushed in the room or in the rooms nearby a huge noise is made which is very uncomfortable and disturbing especially in the middle of the night Wi fi signal is extremely poor and most of the time it doesn t work at all , Nice hotel situated in a quiet area with many places to eat shops and supermarket Easy access to the metro station Very nice and helpful staff 
349505,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, A microwave and kettle in the kitchenette would have been nice The parking rate was steep at 19 euros a day, Although not anywhere near the center the metro station is a 2 minute walk away which has a direct line to La Rambla and the Waterfront The self catering apartment was quite comfortable the Air conditioning worked beautifully wifi was good Lots of restaurants in the area including the Harley Davidson 99 Moto Bar which is literally next door 
349506,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Sometimes if you re needing help at unsociable hours you would wait ages at the desk and when we first came into our room none of our electrics were not working but the gentleman at the desk sorting it out right away , Clean easy access to city centre staff very helpful when we first checked in all amenities you needed were there even had toiletries provided 
349507,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Regret that I didnt use the restaurant earlier, Great location for Nou Camp and very close to public transport links Nice quiet area great staff and very clean Sweets and crayons in rooms for the kids were a lovely touch Staff couldn t have been nicer Really enjoyed my stay 
349508,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Staff very helpful and friendly Location perfect for our trip for the Barcelona football match 10 minutes walk from hotel Lovely area with plenty of cafes and restaurants close by 
349509,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The reception staff on arrival was very abrupt and a little rude as in made us feel like we should not be there And the night reception couldn t speak English at first and made it difficult to get some water but when we paid him he was fluent in English , The room was very clean and well equipped except no kettle 
349510,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Breakfast was fine but be good to have a cheaper option if you just want something lighter A toaster in the room would have solved that Not a major issue , Nice clean room the little kitchenette was very handy fridge microwave hob and sink Staff were really helpful Location was great for us less than a mile to the Camp Nou Several places to eat and drink within walking distance or a short ride on the excellent and cheap metro to the old town I ll definitely be looking to book this when I visit next 
349511,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Was told this hotel was close to nou camp stadium when in reality it wasn t that close, The staff were friendly Ordered 2 burgers had to send them back as they were still raw in the middle Once we got new burgers they were nice
349512,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, I had terrible neighbors that were active the whole night you can imagine what they were doing Well perhaps the hotel could have done something to warn these people as it was impossible to avoid them , The staff is good the location is great 
349513,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, at weekend Harvey Davidson pub was open and so noisy that you could not sleep i think its open till 3 am at weekends bikers have a meeting every weekend down there very friendly but noisy my child could not sleep for the most of a night , Staff was very friendly and helpful location near metro and Camp Nou 10 min walk from the hotel we went to see a match and it was very handy 
349514,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Very efficient staff We had quite a large group but check in was efficient and staff very helpful Rooms were well equipped and spacious Good that there is free WiFi Good location with some some good bars and cafes very close by Les Corts metro stop is within 5 mins walk Nou Camp is only 15 mins walk
349515,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, The location to the tram station which can bring you anywhere in Barcelona plus how near it is to camp nou as I was there with my son to see Barcelona play 
349516,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, They came to clean the room but didn t do the dishes , We stayed for 2 nights in the old part of the hotel and it was ok but for the other 2 nights they gave us a new room and it was bigger and newer 
349517,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Was a little noisey from the bikes next door when leaving the restaurant at night but wouldn t stop me booking again It was our 2nd time at the hotel this time , Close to camp nou
349518,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, sofa bed very hard if you have chlindrens you will not eat well at the hotel restaurant Not so fast check in more than half an hour to wait but it was the first day of the year so , good location clean room healpful staff good breakfast
349519,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Cleaning I expected the floor to be cleaned daily which didn t happen since we have a small kid and she liked to play on the floor , Spacious rooms and very friendly staff Location is also good even far from center due to good transport connections and distance to airport 
349520,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The only problem was that our bathroom door would not latch but we were given a different room when we told the staff about the problem , The staff was very helpful and kind There is a metro stop close by There is also a bank across the street There was a small market around the corner as well as lots of shopping malls department stores 
349521,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The room wasn t very clean There were hair in the bathroom when we arrived The next day after the room was cleaned the hair were still there It seemed as if they were moped around the floor The kitchen wasn t cleaned after we used it and dirty dishes were left in the sink with no provision of dish soap and sponge for us to wash the dishes , Spacious and good location for our needs 
349522,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The only problem I had was that I had travelled with a child and our room overlooked the bar next door which had attracted a lot of motorcyclists which were being started up very late at night which obviously isn t the hotels fault but a room on the other side would have been perfect , The room was very modern and tidy they had left us a couple of bottles of water and some nuts and sweets which went down very well with my son Breakfast wasn t the cheapest but was very tasty and the time of year meant there wasn t really anywhere close instead to eat Staff were very helpful in calling me cabs also And ever so friendly 
349523,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Spacious pleasant apartment with free wifi Reasonable distance to nearest Metro but also close to shopping center and department store I would use this accommodation again 
349524,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The wifi wasn t working and the staff member at the reception desk was not willing to help rectify this There is a sign in the lift that says reception is at 0 but no 0 button is in the lift The beds were uncomfortable and low and there was rust in the bath and above on the ceilings Finally the 1st time I rang down about the safe the staff member hung up I found staff did not want to speak English or make an effort with foreign travellers which seems unusual for a popular city destination Comes across rude and unpleasant , The location was beside a metro stop
349525,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, A yard nearby for weekend parties loud a little bit Busy slow elevator, Super perfect location Shopping el corte ingles one minute walk Very nice mountains view ask for street view 
349526,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, When we booked the room we asked for a double bed and when we arrived we were told that all the rooms had twin beds Only more expensive rooms had double beds If that had been more clear from the beginning we probably wouldn t have booked that room or that hotel it was a misunderstanding on the website we shouldn t have been offered the choice between double and twin if they only had twin The rooms are not incredibly modern but they are clean and functional , The location was excellent only 3 min away from 2 subway stations and 10 15 min away by foot from Camp Nou which is perfect if you plan to go to a football game in the evening The room was clean and was efficiently organized you could separate the living room from the bedroom via a mobile wall this is useful if your partner sleeps late in the morning and you want to get out of bed without waking him up The personnel was very friendly and helpful they were very fast in helping us whenever we had a request 
349527,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, the room was excellent more like a mini apartment with sitting area and kitchen corner very big well furnished and clean despite being a single room it had a large bed The location is perfect for the university but also well connected to the city centre by metro Very good value for money 
349528,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, The couch was downright nasty with all kinds stains on it I didn t even sit on it Some of the other furniture looked like it s out of garage sale very worn out I think that is unacceptable for a 4 star hotel , Great location and the fact that it has a fully equipped kitchen Also it s pretty neat that living space and bedroom is separated by a sliding wall 
349529,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Wi if Weak signal The restaurant below the level where workers don t care about guests one was busy with follow up to basketball and defer all applications until the end of the game Fantastic location only to visit the Camp Nou and there are only a few places nearby the magnificent, Good staff very helpful great care over hygiene Great comfort
349530,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Great hotel located near the Camp Nou next to the metro Les Corts With line L3 you can get in close to all major points and tourist attractions Good tapas next door A great place if you plan to visit Barcelona Friendly service and hearty breakfasts 
349531,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Bathroom needs updating very old The hotel needs some updating but i guess they dont do it because the hotel is always full , Location close to subway big room 
349532,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Nothing great about this hotel I had requested a full size bed instead of two single ones and this was not given Wifi connection breaks at times Expected little more from the staff , Location 3mins walk from metro station breakfast
349533,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona, Could be a little more spacious if with older kids but is perfectly sufficient with young kids under 10s , Great for families Quiet location with in house or a few local restaurants and bars Cleverly designed apartments Good breakfast buffet Very close to L3 metro stop and also the Diagonal stop on the blue line tourist bus 
349534,Aparthotel Atenea Barcelona,No Negative, Exccelent hotel with great location Very close to Camp Nou and close to the bus and metro station El Corts so you can very easy reach all the tourist attractions in Barcelona The hotel i very clean and safe The staff is very kind friendly and helpful The hotel is near only a few steps to El Corte Ingles shopping mall with big supermarket where you can buy everything you need I am recommendig this hotel to everyone and I will return there for sure
