37858,Waldorf Madeleine, Worst ever Waldorf Facing Main Street very noisy all the time First night we had a double bed on the second floor noises by the cars can be heard everywhere Bathroom is a mass The spray is the most fantastic one I have ever seen it can make the whole bathroom wet And without another one to take shower together u cannot successfully finish washing your hair Isn t it romantic The next day they agreed to change us to another room and the mirror on the wall of the bathroom nearly fell down Thriller movies Plenty of 4 stars hotels around much more cozy than this , Nothing 
37859,Waldorf Madeleine, The breakfast choice was very limited and horrendously overpriced , The location was great and check in staff were very friendly Nice view of the Eiffel Tower from my room
37860,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Very spacious room by Paris standards and beautifully appointed Reception staff were extremely helpful and the Hotel is located in a lovely area with great shops and restaurants Easy walk to the Museums and shops 
37861,Waldorf Madeleine, The pillows were not comfortable Lobby and breakfast room were too small , We loved the location the staff were extra friendly and helpful The cleanliness of the room 
37862,Waldorf Madeleine, The hotel has an old world charm which I love however it does look slightly run down I think just a bit of more effort towards maintenance can fix that This is not so much a complaint than a suggestion , It was a superb location a very important factor for all my selections during my extensive travels Although my partner preferred to use the car but left to myself I walked to all the places I wanted to visit Eiffel Tower the Louvre the Jewish Quarter the Champs lys es Pont Neuf and the Notre Dame Cathedral I am 67 and if I can walk it everyone else can Being a photographer for me you can t beat walking if it is possible I am a photographer and location really matters to me 
37863,Waldorf Madeleine, Felt more like a motel than a hotel A single check in person Not a welcoming lobby No restaurant or room service no conditioner or lotion in the bathroom Felt a bit cramped , Location was good The room was clean and comfortable
37864,Waldorf Madeleine, It would be better if there are more kinds of food for breakfast , Best location for sightseeing and shopping The staff are very friendly and they help me a lot such as storing luggage after we checked out and answering questions about metro thickets 
37865,Waldorf Madeleine, I don t think anything could have been any better, Bed perfect view spectacular staff amazing helped me with everything location of hotel brilliant close to do much can t talk more highly of this place
37866,Waldorf Madeleine, Unfortunately I found tiny bed bugs ants in the room and was appalled The toilet was absolutely tiny I m 1m88cm and could barely fit On booking com it states the hotel provide services for ironing and dry cleaning but when I inquired they simply handed me an iron and told me to do it myself , The location was great 
37867,Waldorf Madeleine, This hotel room is billed as a 600 a night accommodation and it did not meet that level of standard We paid half that amount through Bookings com so for what we paid the room was OK But we had better value at another Paris hotel The room was small but our biggest concern was the shower The tiles on the boarding the rubberized shower portion are very slippery, The property was well located in that it was minutes by subway to all major sites and it was close to the Metro The maid service was very good and the desk taff were extremely kind and accommodating 
37868,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure Friendly personnel extra nice The whole service The personnel was perfect and the room very comfortable 
37869,Waldorf Madeleine, There is no adjoining rooms what my family prefers but it s not something that heavily influenced our overall stay at this hotel as they ve tried to offer the closest rooms to accommodate our needs , The room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure Also there was an USB outlet as well as 110 V outlet what was a nice bonus The mini bar had quite nice selection of drinks and snacks and the cost was less than in most of the restaurants Also needs to be mentioned that we had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower 
37870,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, I love French hotels there is always something funny or strange and there is always an element that challenges my improvisation skills The Waldorf Madeleine did not disappoint in that way Wanting to take a shower I accidently converted the bathroom in a pool as the design of the showerhead and how it was mounted could not lead to any other results This time my improvisation skills did not provide a solution I was baffled by this piece of French ingenuity on shower design The other challenge a window that did not close was solved by using the hotel directory in a new and different way My hunger for improvisation was satisfied Furthermore the hotel is on a great location the bed was very nice and good and the airco is powerful so on hot days you ll still be able to recreate the inside of a fridge should you like 
37871,Waldorf Madeleine, More central location would have been nice for the spot shopping I had planned Have been a great customer to UBER thanks to that , Great breakfast however you want to get there really are the room is tiny and tables are pretty close to each other Staff at breakfast was wonderful something rare in France 
37872,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast room very cramped No outlets by the beds Plug didn t fit because of round outlets , Friendly personnel extra nice Big room on seventh floor with view of Eiffel Tower Close to transportation and museums 
37873,Waldorf Madeleine, room too small bed too small for 2 person 1 30m breakfast room very small and uncomfortable, the situation is good and the have free umbrellas for rainny days
37874,Waldorf Madeleine, Room was a bit too warm but I understand they were trying to go from heating to cooling as in April it s still cold in the morning but warm in the Afternoon , Location very good Staff very friendly 
37875,Waldorf Madeleine, Nothing wrong with the hotel It s just that there s no supermarkets or restaurant which opens after 8pm on that area , The hotel location is really good it s located 10 mins from the main roads Alina the receptionist was really nice to us Also all the other employees The hotel rooms are really clean and decent Elevator is fast and good to use too There s an Italian restaurant on the back of the hotel They serves amazing Italian food The hotel is located near St Agustin metro and madeleine metro station So it s easy to reach I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris 
37876,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Good location within walking distance of main shopping street Rooms are clean with Juliette balcony lots of natural light Mark at front reception was extremely friendly charismatic and helpful with tips and advice 
37877,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Staff were friendly and helpful They recommended a couple of local restaurants and tourist route highlights Nice hotel Great central location close to public transport Would definitely stay here again 
37878,Waldorf Madeleine, The buffet breakfast was lovely but I think that they could do with a bigger dining area if they can find some space as it was very cramped , The room was awesome but Marc was the best Concierge you could ever ask for He went the extra mile and mailed some post cards for us 
37879,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Location of the hotel is perfect In vicinity to main city landmarks close to metro and big shops The personnel is very friendly and happy to help WiFi is available and connection is stable We enjoyed our stay very much 
37880,Waldorf Madeleine, Misrepresentation on Booking website on US ekectrical outlet for premium room price , Paid for premium room to include a US electrical outlet Although the outlet is a US plug configuration it is 220 volts whuch us if no good for hand appliances ao without the European converter for yheir outlet configuration you cannot charge your cell phone laptop etc 
37881,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The Hotel has an understated entrance but once you walk through the doors you know you booked the right hotel The Concierge staff is great we were treated by Marc in a staff of stars he was the superstar They can direct you to all the sights by highlighting a tourist map for you The hallways to get to the rooms are maze like but quintessentially European city The rooms are great nice modern bathroom big waredrobe comfortable bed we had a front facing room and had a balcony over the street magnifique Didn t have breakfast at hotel but peeked in during service it looked delightful 
37882,Waldorf Madeleine, Room was very small and there was little space to place things like bags books wifi access is free but very weak , great location and friendly staff 
37883,Waldorf Madeleine, The rooms were slightly too small but everything else was great , The hotel was a short walk away from the main part of Paris the staff were happy to help us out and show us where to go
37884,Waldorf Madeleine, slightly dated but certainly not anything that would stop me from staying again Especially for the money , Great location and value A very nice staff 
37885,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast room was way too small especially when full , Breakfast was good croissants yummy and enough choice Room was comfortable bedding and pillows good walk in shower was fantastic 
37886,Waldorf Madeleine, No Shower curtain so floor flooded had to use all towels up due to powerful shower Disappointing breakfast area very cramped , Great location for sightseeing Eiffel tower champ elys es notre dame 
37887,Waldorf Madeleine, It would be nit picking to criticise anything , From the moment that we arrived we were made to feel at home Welcomed by Marco who was always courteous and helpful The room was spacious by usual Paris standards and the bed was very comfortable Location near La Madeleine was perfect We will definitely stay here again and would recommend the Waldorf Madeleine to anyone 
37888,Waldorf Madeleine, Cocktail lounge is too small the room s safe was too complex to use or it did not work , Comfortable bed good room layout and good selection of in room coffees 
37889,Waldorf Madeleine, My room on the 4th floor was noisy because of the trafic on the Boulevard Internet was not enough to download e mail, Location close to la Madeleine Nice Bed
37890,Waldorf Madeleine, The street itself is a little noisy but I guess that s what you should expect in the middle of Paris , The rooms are very generous in size and fit out the bathroom in particular was lovely great lighting Marc our concierge was wonderful and a credit to the hotel 
37891,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast room is tiny and very cramped in area where food is provided , Location great for visiting less easy to eat locally at night Lovely big room for the centre of a capital city in Europe
37892,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Really friendly and helpful staff excellent location comfy beds and good shower Concierge Marc a real character very helpful friendly and informative
37893,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast room It was very small and uncomfortable Breakfast room has only 16 seats and the hotel was fully booked , Positon very clean and very nice personel 
37894,Waldorf Madeleine, Wifi worked slowly and the TV didn t work well or change languages as stated , Great location with a pleasant and helpful staff They readily assisted us with recommendations for transportation sightseeing and dining Breakfast was very good and well worth purchasing as an additional charge We would stay again 
37895,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Again everything had been fantastic From welcome to the good bye Friendly staff nice and clean room good breakfast The location cannot be better
37896,Waldorf Madeleine, What a difference since my previous stay in the Summer My room was like a shoebox The wardrobe was taken up by the hotel s bathrobe which when I transferred it to the bathroom meant I had to go into it sideways Room was so small when you used the loo you knocked the loo roll off its holder Most of the mini bar was placed on the bedside cabinet I had to place my small case on the desk chair and left a lot in it as I couldn t find a drawer Immediately complained but told nothing could be done that day as the hotel was full I was told I could move on the following day which I declined due to time constraints In fact I was so upset by everything I booked an early flight home the same day which cost me over a 100 They still charged me for the second night which I didn t think was the best public relations move as I certainly would not use this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone else A big thank you to the Hotel Manager who was too busy with a meeting at the other end of the Reception to speak to me personally , Not a lot 
37897,Waldorf Madeleine, staff were amazing I arrvied early and they took bags to room and booked me in so when I returned late after conference there was nothing I had to do,No Positive
37898,Waldorf Madeleine, The hairdryer , The room was very clean and hotel was conveniently located The management honoured their commitment to us as they confirmed the availability of a room by 830am upon our arrival Since it was not available they had upgraded us instead The manager was super hospitable She gave me a cup of tea while waiting in the lobby after checking out I still remembered that evening was a rainy cold Friday evening in Paris 
37899,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast area on the small side Busy yet helpful reception sometimes only one person dealing led to confusion, Bijou hotel Super comfy bed room with balcony and robe and slippers supplied Located by upmarket shopping district with nice brasseries nearby Madeleine Near the beautiful Madeleine church
37900,Waldorf Madeleine, I didn t like the tight room big noise from the neighbor room very tight breakfast space which in case of 10 person it s impossible to enter , I liked the location staff cost and cleanness breakfast menu 
37901,Waldorf Madeleine, Very little whilst breakfast was good the breakfast room could get a little tight at busy times , Location was perfect just 5mins from metro Staff were really pleasant and were more than happy to allow a later checkout as we had a late flight 
37902,Waldorf Madeleine, I had asked for a quiet room and got a 1st floor room on Boulevard Malsherbes had asked for a double bed and got twin beds The staff at the reception did not care to adress my request Although the room had been revamped there was an unpleasant smell from the bathroom, room was large I had been there 3 times previously
37903,Waldorf Madeleine, We were a little confused by the lack of a shower curtain but it seems a bit churlish to mention it the bathroom was otherwise perfect , Softest mattress we met on our vacation in Europe We slept well The hotel location was great for us just a few blocks from the Seine We walked to both the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre Museum The Front Desk helped us check in and out smoothly overcoming our lack of French by speaking English and got us painlessly on our way home by arranging the Taxi to the airport 
37904,Waldorf Madeleine, The big ancient coffee maker was useless Should be replaced by a kettle Room a bit airless Needed to open the window out onto the street which was noisy , A very conveniently located hotel Staff were really friendly and helpful Breakfast was fine Good bed and good shower Also had a place to leave luggage 
37905,Waldorf Madeleine, Nothing Honestly was perfect Happy with the price location staff room everything great , MARC On reception Fantastic man great help made us feel very welcome 
37906,Waldorf Madeleine, Rather small wardrobe for two guests for 3 nights And extremely small breakfast area for the hotel , Great location near the Opera Madelaine and Place Vendome Friendly staff and clean premises 
37907,Waldorf Madeleine, Rooms are bit small I don t believe the breakfast was value for money at Euro 22 per person , The location was great Rooms and bathrooms recently renovated and looked great and clean The coffee in the room was of a very good quality 
37908,Waldorf Madeleine, air conditioning not working switched off by management This did not helP me I do not recall if the hotel description said that the aircon would be switched off at end of September , location and friendly staff
37909,Waldorf Madeleine, Everything was great maybe just salon where breakfast is served could be bigger On the weekend mornings it was quite full , Hotel is really nice value for money we had big superior room which is not standard in Paris even if you book superior room you normally got tiny something room was clean and really nice Breakfast is Parisian classique pastries eggs Concierge is really nice guy unfortunately I don t remember his name he told us he s concierge and the clown thank you 
37910,Waldorf Madeleine, Maybe a bit more choice for breakfast although all essentials were there , Excellent location corner spacious and modern room one of their prestige ones excellent views very helpful staff
37911,Waldorf Madeleine, The first night they put me in a room right on the street I couldn t sleep with all the noise I ve asked to change room second night It was much better , It was nicely decorated 
37912,Waldorf Madeleine, The room was a little small The bathroom somewhat poorly designed and uncomfortable Funky toilet seat which wasn t comfortable or at the right height The shower had no curtain or door so typical of French showers you get water all over the place Somewhat annoying for a property at this level, The bed was very comfy and the amenities mostly very nice
37913,Waldorf Madeleine, The room service was 1hr and 30 mins late and wasn t up to standard and my order was missing chips which I ordered and felt the food was not worth the money me and my girlfriend paid , How close to the major landmarks the hotel was
37914,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Great location all the major things to do and see are a short walk away staff were great especially Marc very helpful and full on good advice Look forward to returning
37915,Waldorf Madeleine, Room very little Breakfast not included in a rate for a 4 start hotel very high Noisy room Shower in bath tube without courtain or glass to protect from water spreading Breakfast room even more little that the room Lobby in a corridor Cannot be a 4 star hotel Definitely does not worth the price , Location
37916,Waldorf Madeleine, The staff wasn t very helpful First when we checked in they didn t tell us about breakfast so we assumed there was no breakfast It was only in the morning while I was going out around 9 30 that I noticed the breakfast room Second we had asked for a late check in exception because we had to get ready for a wedding but when we came back to our room after noon to start getting ready our card didn t work and we had to explain to the receptionist that we had a late check in Besides the cleaning lady came an knocked at our door again at 1 30pm even after we confirmed the late check in with the reception We d hope that for such a hotel it would be better handled and less stressful for clients , The location of the hotel
37917,Waldorf Madeleine, the breakfast itself was fine but the breakfast salon was very cramped and di no make for a very pleasant place to enjoy breakfast, friendly and efficient staff excellent location and comfortable rooms
37918,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The hotel was everything we would expect from a hotel in Paris located in a lovely part of the city we will stay there again next time we visit Paris
37919,Waldorf Madeleine, Rooms were not completely soundproof and you could still hear the noises from the street , The staff was great and Marc the Concierge was aces He went out of his way Amazing 
37920,Waldorf Madeleine, Having to come home , This was my second stay in this hotel The location is excellent and everything we wanted to see and do was within walking distance with the exception of our visit to Versailles The hotel had been updated since my last stay The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Nothing was too much trouble Our rooms were extremely comfortable and a good size Breakfast was fantastic I cannot fault anything We used BT Transfer to pick us up at the Airport Drive us to Versailles Return us to the airport Their service was superb Our driver Brian was always punctual courteous and extremely kind Anyone wanting to use this kind of service couldn t find a better one A We had a wonderful time in Paris and cannot wait to go again 
37921,Waldorf Madeleine, Although internet and wifi are available in reception area the wifi reception in the room is poor and drops out frequently This is our only complaint we needed to use our computer for business and connection kept dropping out , Hotel is small well located and quiet Many eating places around room clean and bed very comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Would stay again 
37922,Waldorf Madeleine, No tv remote reported immediately as I didn t want them to think I had taken it Was assured it would be found It was not Luckily tv was not a priority just disappointing that they did not bother Bathroom layout is not comfortable Shower head not practical , Good location
37923,Waldorf Madeleine, The issuance of a printed ticket with user ID and password for each wifi device is antiquated There should be a simple and fast wifi access for all period , Very convenient location friendly staff
37924,Waldorf Madeleine, Nothing really, central location friendly knowledgeable staff many restaurants close by metro not far away walking distance to a lot of sightseeing 
37925,Waldorf Madeleine, no bar area so arrange to do your socialising away from the hotel However this isn t the point of the Hotel which is a fantastic base in a great area Prices were higher than usual due to 000 s of Wales football fans in town for the Euro 2016 , staff were fantastic beds gloriously comfortable everything worked very well 
37926,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, Th name Waldorf is miss leading It has nothing to do with the Walforf hotel chain The breakfast is good and location very convenient but many details are missing won t come back 
37927,Waldorf Madeleine, 1 Internet connection is terrible 2 My girl friend forgot her sunglasses in the room We realized after 30 minutes we checked out We called the hotel but they couldn t find it in the room Which was weird Because we were pretty sure that it was in the room It is difficult to understand , Staff is friendly Location is good 
37928,Waldorf Madeleine, wifi system is odd although works well you have to get a coupon for each device but at least it is free and fast, Although the room is small but everything works well and the staff is super friendly in pointing us to restaurants and area of interest 
37929,Waldorf Madeleine, Very unstable wifi connection So troublesome to reconnect everytime we returned to the Hotel Took very long time to connect to the wifi Some dead flies insects on blanket wall of toilet and bath towel Sadly we stayed right next to the housekeeper storeroom so it was quite noisy early from 8am every morning , Comfortable bed 
37930,Waldorf Madeleine, The shower sprayed out horizontally or even upwards Weird and not pleasant but it was the only drawback of my stay at this hotel , Lovely big room clean great location really good lighting in the bathroom
37931,Waldorf Madeleine, The twin beds stuck together one lower than the other left a lot to be desired Also the name Waldorf was a bit misleading as it was believed to be associated with the real Waldorf or Hilton properties, The location was excellent for sightseeing eating or just strolling the avenues
37932,Waldorf Madeleine, Your quality and customer service department needs are not performing their job I did book my room with a refundable rate on booking com and than i found a promotional rate of 10 less on your site I sent an email one week before my booking date to your hotel to book on this promotional offer and told them that i have already a booking but did not receive any response I am sorry to inform you that the handling of my request was markedly disappointing and of course did not meet the client satisfaction i believe you are seeking i do not believe that you could accept the performance of your staff nor the unrespectable behaviour towards a client of Waldorph,No Positive
37933,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast is expensive for the variety of food they serve the room where it is served is very very small But you can have your breakfast outside the hotel a number of good cafes around , The best welcome and introduction I ve ever seen If you re met at the reception by Marc you will get sincere welcome and great introduction to the hotel and Paris with passion and humor He made our day Room was not too spacious all necessary things present including coffee machine Great location close to Boulevard Haussmann shops and Louvre In overall good hotel for the price we paid 
37934,Waldorf Madeleine, The breakfast room was completey inadequate for a hotel of this size It could seat only c 16 people at a squeeze and was entered through a narrow corridor where the buffet was laid out , The bedroom was fine of ample size and quiet despite facing a busy road The bathroom was OK with a nice selection of toiletries The staff were friendly and efficient 
37935,Waldorf Madeleine, Location wasn t great if you were there for tourist reasons but if it s where you want to be it s a great little hotel , Bed was very comfortable Great shower decent coffee machine
37936,Waldorf Madeleine, Some of staff are really not helpful Noisy hotel Bathroom is horrible Smaller rooms than the pictures on the page , Location is not great but acceptable 
37937,Waldorf Madeleine, Poor breakfast in French style coffee eggs croissant ham and cheese , Great location very funny service personal you can leave your luggage after checking out there booking via booking com let us place in this hotel in lux room only for 120 euro standard price is around 550 euro 
37938,Waldorf Madeleine, The hotel is a bit old and the shower didn t worked properly The price for the breakfast is just outrageous , Staff was extremely friendly The bed was good and comfortable 
37939,Waldorf Madeleine, brighter lights on corridor each floor, I love the location It s very close to every where Easy to find restaurants and near supermarket The staff Marc was very helpful and nice We ll be back and refer to friends about this hotel
37940,Waldorf Madeleine, It is a bit of a tourist neighborhood and some of the local restaurants are a bit tourist oriented so you will pay higher prices Still a great location , The staff was very friendly The day manager spoke English very well The location is fantastic Close to restaurants and tourist areas 
37941,Waldorf Madeleine, We left our child s favorite book on our first stay in the hotel room and asked about it 4 days after on our second visit but no book was to be found We were a little sad about that , The location was as advertised It s about 15 min from the big train station The staff at the front desk were excellent Enjoyed metting Marco and Fanny Both spoke excellent English The bed was comfy Room was clean 
37942,Waldorf Madeleine, if you don t like it u must be real hard to please, location 10 staff helpfulness 10 rooms 10 and very French clean and comfortable modern close to railways station and everything in paris
37943,Waldorf Madeleine, Small room not sure it was even 15m2 as advertised Breakfast expensive for what you get , Great view of the Eiffel tower from the bedroom on the 7th floor and good location to access Paris 
37944,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The reception was great I m sorry to forget the name but the guy with the military past was amazing I will go to this hotel whenever I ll visit Paris personally mostly because of him 
37945,Waldorf Madeleine, The shower was an over head in the bath more suitable for hair washing but the bathroom had everything we required for our stay, Bedroom was very clean and just the right size The bed was very comfortable and a good size and we had a good size wardrobe and safe Location was perfect and within walking distance to most places
37946,Waldorf Madeleine, Perhaps the hotel has just been renovated so the bathroom still carries a little bit of renovation smell , Fantastic location Concierge staffs especially Marc were really helpful and friendly 
37947,Waldorf Madeleine, The size of the room , The facilities were very good bathroom very well lit and appointed the staff were also very helpful and friendly location was excellent 
37948,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast a little bit expensive for what it offers Anyway everything was good, Lovely room in one of the most beautiful area in Paris Very convenient price Concierge Marc was amazing advising us about restaurants All the staff is very kind and friendly We ll be back for sure I loved the accommodation and the city of course 
37949,Waldorf Madeleine, The only issue is that walls are not well sound proofed and therefore you could hear noise and conversations from other rooms more than in any other hotel I have stayed at , Location is the key on this hotel Two blocks from La Madeleine in the center of Paris Everything you must see is walking distance Rooms are good bathrooms recently renovated
37950,Waldorf Madeleine, Breakfast appeared expensive at 22 per head so ate at local cafes No real bar area just a small lounge off reception , Comfy bed rooms nicely appointed Staff very helpful Location great for access to all parts of the city 
37951,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, My room was upgraded thank you super comfortable bed nice staff spacious room with very good working space Location is great soundisolation is great
37952,Waldorf Madeleine, It s more tired than the photos would have you believe The walls are so thin you can hear normal conversations in the room next door The cleaning chamber maid staff stood for ages in the corridor jabbering away when we were trying to sleep There was a phone in the corridor that kept on ringing presumably trying to track down a cleaner We won t stay there again , Staff were pretty friendly Location was pretty good 
37953,Waldorf Madeleine, I found hair on the linen there was no hot water and when the technician came to fix it he walked into the bathroom with dirty shoes and after I complained no one came to clean up the mess, The receptionist was really helpfull
37954,Waldorf Madeleine, Nothing , On arrival I got a free upgrade to privilege double room on the last floor with Eiffel Tower view Mattress was comfortable Room was spacious and bathroom was clean Staff was very helpful and smiled all time and helped us getting around with Metro and selection of good restaurants Location is superb Close to Champs Elysee 
37955,Waldorf Madeleine, I was chocked to see that the receptionist noted down my full credit card number and expiry date on my check in form This is not only an noncompliance to most CC companies security measures but also very risky as people with access to this information can do fraudulent transactions on my credit card To omit this risk most other hotels use the possibility to block an amount on your card which is much saver for the hotel and the hotel guest , It s a nice clean Hotel and very convenient located in the central district Even so we never went for breakfast in the hotel as we were invited outside it smelled and looked delicious 
37956,Waldorf Madeleine, As above , The staff are Super friendly and helpful Thanks No Aircond Very hot If open window as it parallel with main road the traffic noise very loud I didn t sleep almost whole night Old hotel with old wooden furniture Not my type I won t go back again and will not recommend to others One thing I really appreciate the staff at front desk really nice and made really feel welcome and happy Thanks again 
37957,Waldorf Madeleine, The rooms are small and the breakfast is too expensive There are no commodities gym pool bar etc , The location is excelent and the employees are nice and polite
37958,Waldorf Madeleine, Room was very very small and in need of work Bad soundproofing heard lots of noise Breakfast was expensive and not included Bathroom seemed to have fitted recently but was already very degraded I would only stay there again with a rate like the one I got now , Amazing location Bed was very comfortable and the view of the Eiffel tower was the icing on the cake The staff was very attentive and friendly 
37959,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The location is perfect for shopping It is near Printemps LaFayette and St Honare areas The metro is also nearby Staff was also very friendly ad helpful Room and bathroom were not the biggest and pretty basic 
37960,Waldorf Madeleine,No Negative, The staff In particular the concierge Marc was an absolutely amazing guy who was very helpful and friendly I would stay here again because of him Top fella 
37961,Waldorf Madeleine, NOTHING at all, Everything was wonderful especially the reception staff I was in the same hotel in 2013 and it was wonderful but I m seeing now is the finest because the furniture and decor and the bathroom everything was new and even the elevator seemed to me a broader I have to thank ALL the crew reception for the proper dealings and cooperation with me during my ten days stay I would like to say that I intend to residence time and again for this hotel distinctive and near everything to its location in the heart of the French capital Paris
37962,Waldorf Madeleine, The minute you walk in you see a dreadful counter and an even worse lobby area I thought they were having a sale on chairs A sea of chairs Very odd The young lady at the desk was very nice Never really saw anyone else But the rooms get cleaned daily , My friend and I loved the location Walking distance to so many things The hotel is nestled between other apartment buildings on a major tree lined street But our room though facing said street was very quiet Clean rooms Nice decor and actually good size
