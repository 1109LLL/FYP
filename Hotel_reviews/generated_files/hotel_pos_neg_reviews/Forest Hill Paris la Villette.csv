129479,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, 2 bed room very small Bed had problem and it took 2 requests to get it fixed , the location is good The nearby park is nice and shopping center useful Good access to Metro and bus went directly but fairly slow to the Stade de France
129480,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, no free breakfast checking in was a hassle We needed to wait more than 2 hours before our room was ready you continually have to sign in for wifi each time you come back to the hotel not far from the hotel is a neighbourhood which does not look safe quite far from the city centre but doable the atm is not near You have to walk approximately 10 minutes to find one, The rooms are clean and totally doable across the street are a few restaurants and also a small supermarket close to the metrostation on the 4th floor there is a place where you can iron your clothes youself wifi is good
129481,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Room was very very small Definitely not for three persons and not on par with American standards given the price service is not that quick one evening I asked for an extra blanket and I got it the day after , Nothing I really liked
129482,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No sink in toilet have to walk round to separate bathroom No safety deposit box in room as standard have to ask Had to give deposit upon arrival and don t know when it will be returned Lampshade cracked on arrival so hope this will not be deducted from deposit, Location very close to metro Clean hotel quiet at night however cleaners woke me up in morning cleaning next doors rooms

129484,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No coffee in the room parking costs 25 Euro per day and it is not hotel owned , The room was perfect clean big for Paris standard 20 meters from metro station 
129485,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Long wait for the lift in the morning The odd procedure of needing a voucher for breakfast The exceptionally greasy crisps in the bar The price fluctuates a lot and can at times be too high for what the hotel offers, The room and bar are good The hotel location is good for my work
129486,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The location wasn t the best There is a lot of restaurant across the street which is a plus but it was a bit sketchy if we walked just three minutes past the hotel , The hotel itself was very good Very clean spacious we had a family room three bed two rooms staff was excellent Taxi is very expensive to get to the hotel they won t let you use the meter it is a standard price About 57 I believe We had breakfast included the food was very good Simple but tasty and fresh Wifi was very good It did disconnect over night which I didn t mind because when it was connected it worked great 
129487,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, This hotel was terrible Avoid them This was the only place we regret staying at out of all the places we stayed on our 2 week trip They were unpleasant and overcharged us despite assuring us that we would be charged the advertised rate for the night we stayed and assuring us that a pre confirmed adjustment to staying 1 night was fine The hotel is poor quality and they are dishonest and unpleasant Avoid this hotel ,No Positive
129488,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I was prior to travelling to paris that I could cash on arrival however on getting there I was then told they would only accept card payment which was against what I had previously been told they also asked for 100 euro deposit which I had not previously ben told, staff were friendly and helpfull
129489,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, There is no safebox in the room There is no hot water in shower only a little warm , Comfortable clean room Friendly and fast room service Good location
129490,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Very long wait in the morning for the lift Busy time with many of the lifts too full A real let down when 10 minutes wait for the lift and no nearby stairs The voucher system for breakfast is also unnecessary , Very good balance of value and quality Good room bar staff and location 
129491,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Breakfast was weak non attractive 2 types of cheese and 2 types of ham blend of cut fresh fruit and yogurt types bread and pastry packaged cereals for yogurt There was no toaster for the bread There was no fresh vegetables tomato cucumber pepper ,No Positive
129492,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The breakfast was not good especially the coffee , The gentlemen at the front desk are very friendly unfortunately I forgot their names They were very helpful and caring I really appreciated very much their help and care The location is very close to metro station The room is clean and comfortable 
129493,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Room could have been bigger well appointed hotel, Good newish fixtures and fittings Whole place clean in good working order providing good environment Staff helpful 
129494,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Smelly room and wet sticky coffee spillage on the carpet Long check in not great check in staff although they have been great in the past Really uncomfortable mattress Loud inside and outside the room , In the past I have had much better service and and rooms 
129495,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I booked this hotel for one night for 18th 19th Feb for 78 Euros I paid full amount at the time of booking online Although I paid full amount I was charged 100 Euros as advance on my same card on the date of check in I have receipt of this advance payment with me I was told that at the time of check out this transaction would be revered and 100 Euros would be credit back to my card Now till now I have not got my 100 Euros back Moreover Staff was not at all friendly I don t know if got this treatment because I am Indian Often we get such treatment There body language was not so good My room key did not work and I had to keeping coming from 8th floor to ground floor quite often to change it I was very tiered of travel and not so good service No water offered even for water you have to pay 2 Euros Apart from 100 Euros for which I am still waiting for refund they charged me service tax of 2 40 Euros So Indians and if you cannot act like you are super rich please do not go there , Near to metro station
129496,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The comfort of the room The double room is too small No space for a big luggage We could fit in only one or two cabin sized luggage No double bed available The hotel just put two twin beds together to make one big bed , Good location next to a metro and restaurants 
129497,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I don t know why people complain about the location If its to far from Eiffel tower for you then don t book here If you book here and complain about it being too far then you are just plain stupid Fact , The staff is friendly The rooms are clean even tho they are quite small I have stayed here many times because the hotel offers me good value for money It is just one hour to the airport by Bus 152 and Train RER B 
129498,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The staff were very unhelpful Tried asking where to park and was told that there was only one carpark that cost 20 euros for the whole time This information was not accurate , The room was very clean very spacious and beautiful Very good value for money 
129499,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, room was very small for 2 persons with only weekend luggage, right next to metro 10mins into city and car park would never drive in Paris with our brand new car besides all the rusty compact cars newly renovated rooms facilities like gym and sauna and just for below 60Eur per night after xmas for a double room original price table in the hotel says 250Eur and the room was good but far not worth 250Eur 
129500,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The hotel told me that my card was declined for security deposit I kept having them re swipe I checked my statement and had been charged five 100 deposits that they said were declined When I went to the front desk to explain I overheard someone having an identical situation It took some time about two weeks for the charges to be removed which was an inconvenience on vacation , Price was more than reasonable for the area Location was not near to sites but the metro was directly next to hotel and was extremely easy to use The bathroom was modern and the housekeeping ladies were superb 
129501,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, double bed was just 2 single beds combined Uncomfortable room is small noisy staff was unprofessional asked irrelevant questions about nationality during check in picked up calls in the middle of check out , clean bathroom close to metro station
129502,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I didn t know that a guarantee of 100 needed to be payed I don t have a credit card so my sister made the booking for me But you need to show the card at the check in to get acces to the room This caused some stress It took some time to sort it out but luckily this issue was solved by the friendly staff , location nice clean room many restaurants nearby metro next to hotel very easy connection to Gare du Nord
129503,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, First of all we were charged twice for our room booked once while booking second while check in plus you pay 100EUR deposit when asked at reception the agent said we will refund your amount which never came through Secondly extremely tiny rooms no appropriate place to even keep our luggage for two in a standard room So ONLY FANCY PICTURES DON T BUY IT GUYS The overall staff of the hotel was rude and dumb Especially if you are an International you are screwed because nobody cares to even speak English I know its France but how uneducated and unfriendly Third and most common necessity is Morning Coffee No cafeteria in the hotel to have coffee which is a basic thing found even in the worst rated hotel Note you are forced to pay for breakfast to have coffee or either order for room service Well talking about it the room service was even more pathetic waited for the coffee like 1 hour and never came The staff especially at Reception is highly unpleasant and arrogant Overall stay at the hotel for a first visit to Paris was highly discomforting and dissatisfying Our perception of Paris Hotels was way different Never recommending nor booking this hotel in future Negative rating ,No Positive
129504,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The original room we had the duvet had something on it unknown but as soon as we told reception they actually change our room completely Really quickly, The staff some were really friendly and helpful the location is great right next to the museum and the grande hall la villette and the access to their gym room is amazing bathrooms were also very nice 
129505,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Poor breakfast for 15 euro Not so much comfortable beds Small rooms No coffee machine or kettle in the room , Location is very close to metro station Staff is very friendly and helpful 
129506,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, There is no parking included in the hotel price in such a difficult area for parking places , The kindness of the welcome team Hotel location was excellent for us near the La Vilette Park
129507,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Rooms are a bit small Rooms looking onto the main road are very noisy if you wish to keep the window open and not use the air conditioning , Very good and helpful service at desk Very good quality for money especially if you are two in a double room 
129508,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, everything personnel not qualified old rooms not enough space to put one baggage in a double room no respect of the contract i ordered one double bed and they give me one bed tv broken minibar open , proximity with la vilette
129509,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The room a bit noisy perhaps the windows were not double glazed glass You could hear everything from outside , Nice staff nice rooms very good position near the metro station and buses It seems to be new furnished the bathroom very new and clean Fridges in the room all well equipped 
129510,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Staff were not very friendly and would talk without any empathy when I asked them why I was given a room with 2 single beds when I requested for a double bed The beds kept on moving as they had sort of wheels underneath The room were much smaller than on the photos it did not feel like a 4 star hotel at all However it was clean , Perfect location if in need of public transport as Metro just opposite the hotel 
129511,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, This hotel isn t 4 stars by my own assessment I had placed a special request for which I received confirmation on prior to arrival but to my dismay it wasn t arranged I also asked for breakfast to be added to my room charge which was also not arranged For 2 nights we decided to stay but if any longer stay we would have moved hotels Very far from main Paris tourist attractions neighborhood is also not great , Proximity to metro and bus lines 
129512,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The stay was best by not being in the hotel After spending 120 per night I expected a great deal more The hotel is not all all value for money The room was small There is absolutely no way to shower without making the bathroom totally wet There is no views from our room The staff at reception was very unhelpful For example we discovered at the end of our stay that we could have taken a river taxi from across the road Staff failed to mention that when asked how to get into town Just down right unhelpful Which was a shame as the rest of Paris helped us to enjoy our stay Even staff from office units tried to assist as we walk about enjoying the city I would just never stay at the hotel again Very very poor The asking is also a major issue Advertised as having parking in the UK does not mean that you then pay for the parking This should be made clear at the point of booking , Nothing really The room was very small and compact for the price The staff were very unhelpful and failed to assist when asked questions i e the parking Staff and the hotel failed to make it clear that parking was to e paid for separately in a car park that does not belong to the hotel This is crucial information as it increases the cost of stay especially if you drive in and out without being made aware Staff also confirmed that the location was not the best at night so that cause some degree of discomfort 
129513,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, As common in Europe the room was claustrophobically small We requested one bed but received two on wheels and spent a week rolling around the 2 feet of free space available Staff could have a better service ethic hotels hospitality belonging to the service industry last I knew Sometimes the noise from the park between the hotel and the Science Technology site was annoying at night , The rooms are extremely clean and meticulously serviced daily The bathroom affords a sense of luxury to offset the small bedroom area The location is good away from the tourist trap of The Champs Elysees but a 30 second walk from metro access directly to the Louvre and other important attractions There is a good range of prices and values available there according to your tastes and economic condition 
129514,Forest Hill Paris la Villette,No Negative, The location is excellent it is on the same block as the subway station less than 100 meters The only catch is that the subway station is far from downtown 
129515,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The size of the room and the selection in the Mini Bar There was an authorisation taken off my card for 100 euros which is normal for most hotels and i duly settled my bill on departure from this authorisation however to date the balance has not been returned to my card , Excellent location close to Metro 7 that takes you right into the heart of Paris Clean hotel at a very competitive price 
129516,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No vegetables on breakfast not enough place to store our clothes in the room , Great location close to the public transport 50 meters from the metro station and 15 minutes to the centre Opera Kindly staff 
129517,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The reservation hasn t been done when we arrived and they said that the just saw it now The room was not as expected In the pictures it s look better Very little space The bed was uncomfortable It was a twin bed for a couple it s not so nice The cleaning hasn t been done when we been back to hotel and never well done the next day When we call at the reception for that matter they said they can t do anything will have to wait tomorrow to talk with the housekeeper The door room like they don t have any maintenance till 10years , The bes
129518,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Nothing we didn t like but it would be more helpful to have some instructions for the sofa bed, Staff at reception was really helpful and so nice to us They upgraded us to a bigger room without charge when they realised the room we booked was too small for our family Thank you 
129519,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Some staff members were not very friendly although some were very nice We had to argue for late genius checkout even though we got it confirmed via email prior to coming over It is a bit far from the main sights on the metro about 10 12 stops but that s understandable given the price Overall it was a pleasant stay and we d come back , Very good value for money Room big enough and clean firm beds and nice shower good quality cot bed for our 1 year old We had lunch in the hotel restaurant and it was one of the better meals we got in Paris Right at the metro with shops around 
129520,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The room isn t huge but that s to be expected , Wifi was decently fast nice staff good value for the money It s close to a metro station so getting places is no problem The tv actually had a few channels that were in English all news stuff which was good Good shower 
129521,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, BAD air condition to be more precise it is not an air condition it a JOKE we stayed in one bedroom apartment the thing that they called air condition is ONLY in the sitting area Do you imagine a bedroom with out an air condition Homeless around the hotel dirty carpet and small rooms, Good location and proximity to science museum shops restaurants public transportation and Park ed la villette
129522,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Food in restaurant mediocre breakfast expensive Staff inexperienced They are holding back money on my card I don t know why , Good position Modern 
129523,Forest Hill Paris la Villette,No Negative, Great double bed The room is a bit small but it isn t a deal breaker The towel are changed on a daily basis The body care products are restocked every day don t wory if you use one in a go Decent amount of space for clothes Power outlest for electronic devices are build in into the desk there are also usb sockets that was a surprise 
129524,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Very sullen staff both at reception on arrival and departure and on phone Answered with a curt Oui not even hello No smiles from anyone In the room not much space noisy air conditioning no bath tub and basic amenities eg no soap in shower despite online description of top quality hotel The balcony was just a dirty piece of concrete I left room service breakfast request outside my door in good time but they forgot to collect it so no breakfast arrived No apology offered Atmosphere depressing , Nothing much just that the bed was OK and the room quiet 
129525,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Did not get the type of bed that I asked for No explanation for that as well Staff were confused during billing while checking out Over priced Breakfast Very small rooms , Location just above the Metro Cleanliness 
129526,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Can t really fault it , We loved the fact that hotel was located right next to the Science museum We took our kids there before our tour of Paris Museum is full of interesting and interactive things for kids to do Good choice of places to eat just across the street from the hotel and McDonalds right next to it for morning coffee run serving good quality coffee Hotel restaurant was also very good we had our dinner there on our second night We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality hotel at a decent price 
129527,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Nothing everything was great , The room was fantastic very spacious and had a mini bar along with free WiFi The hotel is situated only a 2 minute walk from the metro which will bring you into the Champs Elysees in about 25 mins There is a couple of nice restaurants across the street which are affordable and have good food If the weather is nice you should you take a stroll towards Stalingrad or grab the metro if you re not feeling the walk and have a drink in La Rotund All in all a great hotel which made our stay in Paris all the more enjoyable 
129528,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Nothing much as was a little thing and they fixed it It was TV channels needed to be fixed by technician that s all so not a big issue If also was explained about the shuttle on arrival would be perfect for me to use it than knowing it at a later stage though Lv everything there , Bathroom breakfast lunch or their dinner like the menu as food was yum yum they were very helpful friendly staff all of them as a whole 
129529,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Wifi code for my room did not work staff unhelpful It must be because your tablet is English Code included room number I eventually connected using a different number glitch in the system Room key stopped working twice in four days Ordering room service required some persistence as staff dealt with not understanding my accent by hanging up Breakfast 15 euros a night which was a bit steep but turned out not to matter as the doorman insisted that I get a ticket to enter the dining room which wasn t mentioned on check in just Breakfast is on the 1st floor but wouldn t tell me where to purchase this so I went to a local cafe where no doubt I got a better deal anyway On the whole a rather frustrating stay , Room perfectly nice price reasonable wifi good once connected 
129530,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, we went with a booking of the room and the dinner included But when we went to the restaurant they told us that there was a limit of 20 a person Not really a problem and we understand the limit just so you know there is a limit to your meal , the hotel is wonderful the staff was really kind and the rooms are great We were a group of three people and the third person had basically a room of their own because there was a door between the main bedroom and his room the subway and bus are 60 seconds walking distance really the line 7 takes you to the louvre in 20 minutes the street in front of it has a lots of restaurants and a mini market the restaurant hotel is really nice and the environment is great 
129531,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, WiFi signal was poor in the room but one may consider it as advantage allowing to concentrate on partner , Clean room friendly staff comfortable bed very good location really close to metro 
129532,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No tea or coffee facilities in the rooms ordered a double bed but got 2 singles pushed together and they moved around, Great selection at breakfast super location
129533,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The hotel bar staff did not speak English very well and the choice of beverages was too limited for a four star location , Great value for money excellent location
129534,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, heating air con was a bit off have breakfast early if you want bread coffee without waiting , comfy bed clean and good bathroom silent although it s above the street Good breakfast variety although it s still lacking organisation
129535,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Staff woke us up 3 times wanting to clean the room first time was at 8am on a Sunday Bed sheets strongly smelt bleach and bed was too hard not comfortable , The localisation right next to the metro tram the Parc de la Villte Zenith etc 
129536,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No car parking space provided for customers Paid parking should be paid and or redeemed by the hotel for customers , surrounding area does not have or give the safe appearance for visitor
129537,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I can t complain , The location was ideal It was so easy to get around There are great restaurants all around the hotel Room was clean and very nice Staff were super friendly and helpful 
129538,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Bed was a bit unformfortable although metro was close hotel is quite far from most main attractions, Close to metro clean friendly and helpful staff very clean rooms
129539,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, With mini bar they could have provided the facility to make a cup of tea As I drink tea or coffee only there was no facility apart from you get up and go to restaurant , Staff really friendly and accommodating
129540,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Though he helped the person at the reception did not smile one bit But I guess he was tired , Everything was just great we had planned to go to la cit des sciences the following morning and the location was great the room was very clean and comfortable great value for money 
129541,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, It s a bit far from the center and the touristic sites but it s easy to get around with the metro in Paris , The room was nice and comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located near a metro station 
129542,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, 1 I have to wait until 3 30 to ckeck in 2 They wet my luggage when i was waithing for the room 3 I paid the room 2 months ahead and they want 100 cash guarantee and if you don t want to give them the money they will not give you a room It s a polity that it wasnt told on booking , Near the metro station Near the sience museum
129543,Forest Hill Paris la Villette,No Negative, There was work going on in the restaurant during our stay and our room was very noisy We asked to be moved and was upgraded straight away no problem and given complimentary breakfast throughout stay Staff were very pleasant and helpful
129544,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Breakfast room was a bit crammed and barely staffed but that s really a minor detail, Nice place great location for the villette area clean and comfy quiet Excellent value for money 
129545,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I had problems checking in I already payed with a different credit card than mine and they wanted to see it at the checkin This card I did not have on me My husbands credit card Only because I could reach my husband in the UK on the phone they let me stay , The staff was friendly and the bed and bathroom comfortable spacious and very clean 
129546,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, My room was small but more or less adequate , Front desk staff were helpful polite and efficient Hotel was clean and well located to basic restaurants and Metro 
129547,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Two single beds were added together in place of one double bed thus very uncomfortable to sleep No electrical kettle to make tea coffee in the room , Cleanliness staff location
129548,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, No kettle in the room No glasses It was cold n we couldn t even make a coffee in the room Even upon asking them they said it s not available, The room was nice comfortable enough Good location
129549,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, 1 Room is very very tiny I would say even claustrophobic Separate beds are narrow Only 2 tiny rack to store personal things and no place store normal size travelling bag 2 There was a refurbishing in some rooms so beds and carpets were placed in the corridors so for the first day we had to step over in order to get into room 3 Wi Fi supports only 3 handhelds so basically we were 2 professionals each of us had 1 smartphone and 1 laptop but we could use only 3 connections while we need 4 When Wi Fi disconnected for example in elevator than to use it again we had to put login and password and password was really hard to remember 4 Selection of food during breakfast wasn t great eggs yogurt sausages omelette bread orange juice tea coffee and 2 types of cereals and that s all , 1 Hotel is just 5 minutes from Paris event centre So it s very convenient if you have an event there 2 Hotel is just 2 min walk from Porte de la Villette metro station so it s easy to use a metro for going around Paris 3 Reception stuff is very helpful on providing feedback on inquiries 
129550,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, The reception staff were abrupt unsmiling and unhelpful You were just waiting for the young lady to say computer says NO The breakfast buffet was very ordinary which is unsurprising as it is not the French way to have a cooked breakfast You are far better off just grabbing a croissant at a local boulangerie , The location was right next to a metro station which was great The concierge staff were amazing charming French gentlemen who went to great lengths to assist and did so with good humour and generosity They were a joy to talk to and where able to help with the simple requests that seemed to be beyond the will of the reception staff to assist with 
129551,Forest Hill Paris la Villette,No Negative, I recommend this hotel I saw 4 star hotels that did not look as good as Forest Hill The rooms are like those on site very clean and tidy When I saw the hotel location on the map I thought it was quite Far from the center but in fact you can easily reach the city center by metro which is in front of the hotel Malicious comments have nothing to do with reality Thanks Forest Hill 
129552,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, A bit noisy as the hotel is on an avenue but you are in Paris and to be honest the windows glass are efficient enough to get some good rest from the city , hotel is very close from the concert hall Zenith 10 minutes walk also from the subway 1 min walk very good mattress Very clean room bathroom The staff is also helpful and kind 
129553,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Staff didn t spoked in english well so communication was difficult Staff was not helpful , Location was good Metro subway station was near Room rate was good Room size was good but can be better 
129554,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, don t like using an elevator but stairs not appealing to use, parking really close to the hotel nice area around the hotel ideal hotel when you want to attend a concert in the Zenith or La Trabendo
129555,Forest Hill Paris la Villette,No Negative, The hotel has a metro stop right outside the front doors perfect for sightseeing Our room was recently refurbished smell of paint still fresh perfect 
129556,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, We had problems with Wifi the last day of our stay but the staff was really helpful and resolved our problem at least partially , A metro station with line 7 taking you directly to the city center in 15 min is just outside the hotel The hotel is also incredibly isolated so you don t hear any noise from outside or inside Otherwise it is a nice quality 3 hotel I would definitely recommend 
129557,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Some staff good about half on desk couldn t care less For a simple request they made me wait 10 minutes because he was licking envelopes and wanted to finish it , Located right next to metro Lots of eateries around the area Short travel to Parus 
129558,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, when i left the card on the door for the room to be cleaned it was not done so i had to go look for some fresh towels myself and when we arrived there was hair in the little fridge , it was very close to the metro staff were kind and helpful it was handy having a minibar in the room to keep drinks cold having air conditioning was great too felt very safe aswell as there was a security man every night and morning 
129559,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, location is not really good air conditioner was noisy and didn t work properly room became hot TV system was instable system was rebooting or became too slow They didnt have a queen bed to offer me they offered me a 2 single beds but beds casters could be locked so beds moved and opened a lag between them boring , near subway modern rooms staff cleanliness
129560,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Internet connection in the room alwaya asking for login need to improve Ladu at the breakfast not friendly, Di front office diterima org yg cukup ramah laki2 kurus tinggi berkacamTa very helpful good english Sorry forgot the name
129561,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Service is below average industrial athmosphere Information is poor and even wrong for example you receive a voucher for a breakfast on the ground flour while the breakfast is on the first floor Staff is doing nothing to compensate these failures and to create a more friendly athmosphere , Very good location at La Villette providing easy access by metro to the entire city while keeping prices below Paris downtown standards Breakfast is above French standards Rooms are OK Even the surrounding of the hotel is very busy the rooms are quiet and comfortable 
129562,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, 15 for a breakfast is overpriced for the type buffet you get The price for the hotel is overpriced as well seeing the category of hotel size of rooms and location of hotel The public areas like restaurant etc are overall too warm , Located close to metro clean rooms and new bathroom 
129563,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Tiny room with no storage space Noisy outside even from 5th floor room Very slow book in and check out staff , Hotel and Room was very clean Met station pretty much just out the door Good local restaurants 
129564,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, hard to communicate w th recept on sts They were not k nd We had to wa t a long t me for check n process , clean room and bathroom Breakfast was ok But could be better 
129565,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, night staff were not to helpful i asked for a taxi or any transport for the airport at the middle of the night and he just directed me to the corner of the counter where there was a broucher of some shuttle service he should make some effort and show that they care about their customers so can generate better profit , it is a comfortable affordable hotel value for money there are good Halal restaurant just in front of the hote so it was very convinient for us to have lunch and dinner at the turkish hala restaurant 
129566,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, I booked a double bed met 2 single unhooked bed I had to hook it up myself bed could be softer other than that its a nice hotel had to pay for VAT when checking out wasnt aware of that, Nice newly renovated good location rooms are decent staffs are helpful
129567,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Decent breakfast menu but spread out over 3 tables across the room so involved a lot of back and forth It s a rather remote part of Paris so only stay there if you really need to be in that area Internet access wasn t mentioned on checkin or anywhere in the papers in the room Had to ask at reception Why do hotels still have minibars , Metro station is just around the corner Several places to eat on the other side of the street The bathroom was very freshly renovated you could still smell the paint a bit 
129568,Forest Hill Paris la Villette, Nothing to say , Beautiful Hotel perfect for meetings in La Villette or offices nearby Rooms recently renovated clean and comfortable Great breakfast Wifi free in the whole building Metro just at the door of the hotel
