245693,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The 24 hour room service was sourced from outside restaurants and took 45 minutes We received stone cold burgers and chips at midnight , The hallways were all decorated in different themes of art the rooms the same Was absolutely incredible 
245694,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast not included in price , We had a very imaginatively decorated room trash city suite it was spacious and comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Happy hour cocktails is much appreciated given London pricing 
245695,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very limited parking nearby with overnight parking off road costing 50 Pokey room with view of blank wall a few feet away Insufficient hanging space for clothes for two people even for one night s stay Nowhere to put toiletries in bathroom Lighting in bathroom not good enough for makeup or shaving Very basic food beverage facilities coffee from small domestic type machine Very expensive for what it is many five star hotels in London offer rooms for the same price , Unusual design and decorations Convenient for museums 
245696,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I was wondering where s exactly the fifth star came from Poor breakfast and If you think that fake grass in a lift is art think again , Good location 
245697,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Boutique hotel with individual decor in the public spaces Lots of quirky art changing exhibitions Very comfortable bed and bed linen Excellent bathroom Helpful friendly staff Excellent breakfast 
245698,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Awful view from room also quite small Could do with fridge in room , Excellent location and friendly staff Only couple minutes to South Kensington tube 
245699,The Exhibitionist Hotel, It wasn t until the morning that we realised that the seal for the door that led to the balcony was broken the room was quite noisy because of that and my daughter and I were tired the next day down to lack of sleep I did try to inform the staff when checking out however the hotel was very busy with a private function so we weren t really a priority I did email the hotel twice to let them know about the broken seal and to be honest I am rather disappointed that they have not responded a month on , Loved the decor of the hotel and the rooms Once you step through the doors you see why it s called The Exhibitionist I love art so this was my kind of place You are asked to chose you re own room fragrance when you check in which is a lovely touch The location is superb short walk to museums and galleries and excellent choice of restaurants and bars 
245700,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room had no place to stow away our suitcases bathroom lacks place to put personal stuff Too small wardrobe and too few hangers for more than a few days stay Otherwise pretty nice room , Quiet room and friendly staff 
245701,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The hotel is shabby the rooms are tiny the lift is so small it s claustrophobic and the staff aren t particularly helpful Completely overpriced ,No Positive
245702,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The staff at reception seemed unable to help with simple enquiries until after much explanation to attain understanding of problems The signature luxury double room was extremely small for two people The bed was six inches away from the headboard which meant the pillows which were as soft as cotton wool kept slipping down the back The coffee and tea making facilities were poor in the room with cheap sachets of nescafe coffee provided You could not hang dress or trousers at full length in wardrobe The road outside is very busy and as there is no double glazing in the room the noise from the road is quite loud I will not return or recommend this hotel to anyone , The location of the hotel from South Kensington tube station was very good 
245703,The Exhibitionist Hotel, rest room very tiny a little more space would added more value curtains should be lined with blackouts as building facing other residency sites , everything about this place is amazing 
245704,The Exhibitionist Hotel, That the breakfast included stated continental which was fine for us but actually that only involved tea coffee and toast So that is all we had If you wanted the real continental ie croissants cereal fruit etc you had to pay additional charge And to upgrade to a cooked breakfast was 22 ,No Positive
245705,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The Room was a little small but the facilities made up for it , Great location and a balcony option was really nice We loved the toiletries supplied in the room and the breakfast was superb 
245706,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing, This is a funky modern hotel lovely decor AMAZING rain shower fantastic location however it s the staff that make it All were fabulous but we have to give a special mention to Zita the receptionist who met us with a warm smile a lovely bubbly personality full of chat she even loaned us her umbrella as it was raining out We are in the business in Ireland I can tell you if Zita was prepared to move we d steal her Mind her she is a fantastic asset to this hotel
245707,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room way too small elevator tiny and slow, Eclectic style is very unique and the staff were very responsive and pleasant The location in West London is superb right near pubic transport shopping restaurants and major sites
245708,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No negatives, This place is amazing I took my fianc there for a surprise to celebrate our anniversary and it exceeded our expectations in every way The staff are great the bar was great the room was superb Everything from the comfy bed through to the powerful shower was exceptional It was a nice touch to be given a choice of room fragrance on arrival as well 
245709,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room felt musty and very small Staff seemed untrained Breakfast well just didn t happen waited 45 minutes and order was ignored which meant that we had to leave to make out schedule without Staff failed to apologise Not a very happy welcoming environment in this hotel Would not recommend it On the positive side one member of staff seemed helpful and knowledgeable Wifi was not working in out room for much of our stay which meant going down to the small reception area to connect A hotel at best , Excellent location 
245710,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bed was uncomfortable worn down on the one side , Roof Top apartment was really nice very quiet good location if you are on business in Kensington 
245711,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Hotel and room decorated beautifully The gentleman Greg I believe his name was at reception was incredibly welcoming and friendly really was a nice welcome and goodbye to the hotel The bed was comfy and the shower was the best shower I ve ever had Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again 
245712,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Cautionary note The smallest sized bedroom is VERY small not suitable for 2 adults and 2 large suitcases , Courteous and friendly staff great location wonderful art and decor amazingly comfortable beds and pillows big walk in shower and fluffy towels The bar is the perfect place to collapse after a long day 
245713,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The dining room position was a little impersonal , The staff were very friendly The food in restaurant excellent Loved the arty ambience Although rooms were bijou they had a good feel Excellent location for museums 
245714,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Think a 5 hotel could offer a better coffee maker in the room Room rate said that breakfast was included but it was only 2 pieces of toast pastry croissant coffee and a glass of extremely cheap orange juice Option to upgrade was offered for a charge This was not made clear until you were at the breakfast table , Extra comfy bed Lovely room with balcony Very friendly helpful staff
245715,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast was a bit disappointing as it arrived earlier than booked whilst still showering wasn t what we ordered and didn t come with butter for the toast , Room was very comfortable
245716,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Had to turn the air conditioner off at night as it made too much noise Breakfast included was just toast jam orange juice and tea coffee One could upgrade to a buffett breakfast that is definitely not worth the price Better to grab a coffee and bite to eat from a coffee shop not far away , Room and bathroom are lovely Staff friendly and very helpful Location good Ambience nice Drinks in the bar area at night were great lovely cosy stylish relaxing area to unwind 
245717,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing, Great location close to the tube station museums and The Royal Albert Hall There are lots of places to eat and drink nearby too The staff are polite attentive and nothing was too much trouble 
245718,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was small given that we paid for a deluxe King Sized room Very poor value for money Also the Wi Fi was intermitten , The staff were excellent and the hotel is in a great location
245719,The Exhibitionist Hotel, This can never qualify as a 5 hotel Service and facilities were poor Only receptionists were good at English and there were no facilities at site spa area pool etc to lift the hotel Breakfast was a disaster if you want anything asides marmalade toast or croissants from a supermarket you will be charged extra Juice is apparently not standard either Far from the experience expected at a 5 hotel , Fantastic location
245720,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Perfect welcome The property was close to the Royal Albert Hall where we had a night to celebrate my partner s birthday The Staff were friendly and always willing to assist I got the Romantic package and it swept her off her feet on arrival she slipped right into her hot bath I got some cupcakes which were hand delivered promptly at about 11 45 to start the birthday celebrations on our return from the show The towel swans chocolate and roses made her blush and the staff all wished her happy birthday not a single fault The pictures and moments are priceless 
245721,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The room had a good opening window sounds odd but some places you either can t open the window or when you do its hardly worth it It was a warm weekend and we were glad of the breeze there was aircon but we prefer the fresh air The bed was extremely comfy and the toiletries were Noble Isle very posh and indulgent The Hotel was highly decorated which was delightful and there was an ipad which allowed full interaction should you need it We stayed here for the proximity to the Museums specifically for the V A which is only 5 mins walk away The area has plenty of chain eateries as well as individual restaurants we ate out for all of our meals 
245722,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing perfect , Staff are friendly professional enthusiastic about their hotel clean fresh well designed rooms ever changing art in hotel is a huge plus individual design concept so much more pleasant to stay in than a corporate hotel wonderful location for museums and great restaurants walking distance to tube lovely breakfast room and bar favourite hotel in city 
245723,The Exhibitionist Hotel, we didn t stay long enough, An excellent boutique hotel that made us feel at home and sad to leave The staff are simply fantastic helpful friendly and efficient
245724,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The only thing bad I can say is I ordered breakfast to my room and the coffee portion was tiny I would of liked an option of a big pot I need this to wake up , Staff were very welcoming and nothing asked requested was to much much trouble Rooms were spotless Bedding looked new I usually hate staying in hotel beds but it was spotless so I was fine Ordered breakfast in my room They made the porridge with soya as requested and the bowl was huge gorgeous and filling Car park is UCP which is a two minute walk away 
245725,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Staff are really nice and art is beautiful and room is clean but despite this I didn t like the lighting in the room and the water in the shower also took long to become warm , The art
245726,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Although your site says access for disabled okay there were a number of stairs at the front door so had to be lifted by the staff when coming in or going out Frankly would never had booked this hotel if I had known this Major disappointment, Staff were excellent and room was small but very clean and modern Access issues though
245727,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I was a little disappointed with the bar area Wines and some drinks were limited which was a surprise Also beacause they serve breakfast in the bar there wasn t really a comfortable relaxing space to just have a drink in the evening again a real surprise when so much thought has gone into this hotel all the tables were high and the seats chosen for people who would be eating , As the name suggests the Exhibitionist hotel is just that Full of crazy fun art and sculpture to stimulate the senses and put a smile on your face I ve stayed in many beautiful hotels all around the world but with the Exhibitionist you get something totally different without compromising service and comfort Very refreshing 
245728,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like The price for one night was higher than we like to spend but it is London so we knew what to expect , The staff were very friendly and welcoming We stayed in one of the smaller rooms but it was incredibly comfortable with some lovely little touches and the bathroom had both a large shower and bath The hotel itself is very interesting with various artwork sculptures etc which added to the enjoyment of the stay 
245729,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Pity the restaurant does not open on Mondays only bar food available but that was actually very nice , The staff were so friendly from the reception staff through to the bar staff made you feel so welcome and that nothing was too much trouble Loved the chocolate on the bed touch at night time and the black slippers were cool 
245730,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast was late arriving but when it turned up it was delicious Elevator was incredibly slow but it didn t bother me , Bed was comfy bathroom was great liked the iPad central system and the parking on the street had loads of free spaces from 1 30pm on Saturday through the whole weekend unheard of in London
245731,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Small room fine for a short stay but wouldn t want to spend much time in there One of the smaller London hotel rooms we have stayed in but similar size to Central Paris and Rome hotels , Very friendly staff happy to help Nice balcony that got the sun in the evening although no view to speak of Bed very comfortable and good size bathroom Overall a great hotel that we would happily stay in again 
245732,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, I got a good price on booking com for a one night stay here midweek The reviews I had read were mixed yes the rooms can be small I d gone for the cheapest room and it was compact but it had everything I needed big comfy bed kettle snacks coffee tv the bathroom was quite large with bath and large walk in shower which was fab The view was nondescript but it was very quiet which suited us We didn t eat or drink at the hotel Great location for the museums friendly staff 
245733,The Exhibitionist Hotel, VERY VERY VERY small I couldn t even open my luggage it was nothing like the dimensions mentioned in Booking com The electricity went down and I had to change the room The room was not clean at all the bed sheet was dirty and full with hair and the towels were really dirty The service was very slow The hotel price was really too much I seriously can t understand how do they rate this hotel as Five Stars I give it Two Stars only , Location was really good 
245734,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Wifi just didn t work in the bar Might have been my phone but I didn t appear to be the only one having probs Not sure toasted brioche works with eggs royale I needed a hammer and chisel even with the beautiful hollandaise and runny eggs , Staff were awesome from reception to porters to bar Really friendly nothing too much trouble from storing our Sushi in the kitchen fridge overnight to hailing us a cab from the main road to get us to said sushi class on time great people Very prompt room service gorgeous bathroom very comfy bed quirky and unique atmosphere The works 
245735,The Exhibitionist Hotel, the lounge area, The room for a single person was good nice d cor and TV positioned well lovely comfortable bed and very clean sheets the bathroom had a bath and shower and was also very clean Good tea making facilities and complementary crisps nibbles Warm welcome and I was accompanied to the room to ensure I knew how to operate everything On leaving that morning someone raced to open the door and wish me a good day which was 4 star service The TV did not work so new batteries had to be installed into the handset When I closed the curtain the wall fitting fell off into my hands The most disappointing was the lounge and dining area It bears no resemblance to the hotel when you arrive All the beautiful settees and grand chairs and large flower pots are not there This has all been staged for the website photographs I was very very disappointment as I made my decision to book because of this so that I could sit and have a coffee or drink and just relax outside my room The bar area when I returned from the Opera at 10 45 pm was not open but just made up for the next days breakfast I just went to my room The area is cold without carpet and not at all comfortable It is also not bright and airy as the photographs convey on the web I told the receptionist that I was unhappy and showed her the photos on my ipad in the morning however she said she did have authority to reduce my bill I paid in full on the understanding that the manager would take up my case and give me some sort of recompense with regards to the situation All that was said by the manager is that artwork is moved every 5 6 weeks to other sites Well why don t they update the website accordingly I am taking the matter up with my credit card company however wanted to let other travellers know what to expect or not expect This really is one for Trading Standards to be honest as they are not providing what they are selling on the web 
245736,The Exhibitionist Hotel, N A, Really friendly staff really good location really comfortable room really stylish hotel Also the shower was probably the best I ve ever known in a hotel 
245737,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room could have been bigger Only one small elevator that took a while to come to your floor, Staff and location were excellent Loved the intimacy of the property
245738,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I would have loved to have stayed in the blue and purple suite which we were shown round but it was too expensive I would have liked hot chocolate in the bedroom aswell as tea and coffee , Breakfast was lovely and evening meal was delicious if not a bit expensive I can recommend the lamb very designer not your traditional lamb with new potatoes but very tasty The desert was so good we shared a second one chocolate something just delicious The staff both at the reception and in the restaurant were friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble The room was very comfortable and quite luxurious in blue velvet the hotel was very quirky colourful and had some interesting art work on all levels We very much enjoyed our time there and are looking forward to going back for a second stay when we can 
245739,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very small bedroom just a bed and NOT a double room Very small dirty window Nowhere to put personal stuff in bathroom Bath not necessary should have more basin space No double glazing and thus noisy , the location and the staff
245740,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Avoid room 110 When we complained the receptionist confirmed it was the worst room in the hotel even commented a room that small should be against the law ,No Positive
245741,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Our particular suite was located in the basement so it was noisy We heard lobby traffic above us Also our room had a splash pool so it smelt like chlorine and kept the room a bit humid , Was very unique in decor and the staff was very accommodating
245742,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast was quite exspensive therefore did not take it, Staff were friendly welcoming and knowledgeable The location is very central for all attractions around Kensington Chelsea Rooms are well equipped and the in room ipad is a great touch Price for central London i found to be very reasonable
245743,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bathtub hadn t been cleaned There was hair in it and a lot of spots that could have been rinsed away There were also a lot of nail polish stains We didn t notice until late at night so we scrubbed the bathtub ourselves with a sponge removed everything incl nail polish , Pretty room and decoration
245744,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We were on our honey moon and mentioned it twice to the hotel and they did nothing to make us feel special Very disappointed, The comfort and luxury of the bedroom
245745,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Small room pillows too soft and flat although these things did not ruin my stay , Comfy bed and the friendliest most helpful staff nice big bathroom with lovely toiletries and good shower 
245746,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing All was amazing , The hotel is fabulous full of taste and unexpected delicate touches The management think of everything to make the stay beautiful water coffee tea facilities even the snacks were thoughtful and very healthy such as dried strawberries cranberries chick peas chips Even a bar of pure milk chocolates were included The most comfortable bed spacious bathroom with bath and separate shower cabin ipad to use all make the stay so unforgettable and full of comfort The personnel is unbelievable such a true match for such a extraordinary hotel Very warm cheerful and a true professionals Special thank you to Oriana Goran and Zita for making my stay so beautiful and addressing all my requests I would love to return as it is one of the most amazing hotels with the extraordinary and very much attentive personnel Love every minute of my stay 
245747,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The hotel is not a five star hotel as advertised on your website IT IS A FIVE STAR RATE BY THE AA OF GUEST ACCOMMODATION AND NOT BY THE HOTEL ASSOCIATION OF UK WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED ,No Positive
245748,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast could have been included for the per night price paid, Very friendly staff quite new and conremporary interior design very clean rooms bathroom large shower place 
245749,The Exhibitionist Hotel, You can hear the noise from the up The staris and its too noisy i couldnt sleep The room is so small, I like the Location is close to Harrods underground train resturants Hyde Park
245750,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing I didn t like enough to make a negative comment, Room was so comfortable Great central location but very pleasant and quiet Great reasonably priced restaurants near by Super close to south Kensington and Gloucester road tube station Also handy for sight seeing bus stop Really comfy bed and pleasant staff Beautiful bathroom and lovely products to go with it Really handy to shops and walking distance to lots of attractions
245751,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The breakfast could be improved the continental breakfast is a bit sparse although what is there is lovely and the cooked options not always up to scratch The room service relies on the use of an iPad however when we tried to use it it wasn t working and the staff couldn t help overnight However they did bring the menu to the room , Room was beautiful everything you need and the staff very helpful Very close to the tube station Such a comfortable bed and gorgeous bathroom 
245752,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Location the hotel looks fun but it needs to be your taste for a weekend away i would recommmend it but not if you will travel with business partners and higher management unless you are aware they can handle the odd arty interiour of the hotel
245753,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The room was fabulous The bed was really comfy Loved the art installations which I understand change from time to time The staff were lovely helpful and friendly 
245754,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The breakfast wasn t included in our room price and was quite expensive as an add on so we went out To Muriel s Kitchen nearby , Loved the hotel s quirkiness and the friendliness of the staff 
245755,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Food menu and drinks choices could have been a little more normal But it s a very out there hotel so you have to expect that In regards to drinks my partner just wanted a standard Peroni or Bud but they only had a weird and wonderful beer which he wasn t keen on But don t let that put you off because breakfast is TO DIE FOR Never tasted such a quality full English , Really cant fault this hotel or the staff Nothing is too much trouble they ll even walk to the end of the road for you just to hail down a cab The hotel is in a great locationight very close to exhibition road with all the museums etc The staff are lovely people Vibrant warm and inviting I genuinely didn t want to go home 
245756,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There was a superheroes event going on downstairs and we were not able to use the bar before we went out This was disappointing and we wish we had been informed before our stay , Our bed was amazing So comfy and big We had the Jimmie Martin Suite and it was excellent we particularly liked the terrace and the huge bath 
245757,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Lobby music can be heard very early until quite late in the rooms on the first floor Even the Ultimate Luxury Kind w balcony is quite a tight space The bed pillows are not the most comfortable , Good location on a quiet street Very original lobby and gallery Reasonably priced 
245758,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location and an excellent quirky hotel Lovely staff great decor fab room and a great base for a weekend away Highly recommend staying here
245759,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room too small nowhere to open your suitcase No room round the bed and struggle to open wardrobe so didn t bother Bedside table was too small to put anything on so had to put book on floor Lighting in bathroom too dark to do makeup , Bed was comfy staff enthusiastic
245760,The Exhibitionist Hotel, All night I was up awake as I could hear people walking across the wooden floors above me which made me feel uncomfortable all night I was honestly up all night the worsts nights sleep I ve had in a very long time Because the room also faces the main road the curtains don t close properly which also made me feel discomfort and paranoid It s really not worth the money , The access of the Wifi was great 
245761,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing major Breakfast choice was a bit disappointing and the price of 16 GBP per person is too high for what they offer Some parts were very dusty for example lamp in the room was full of dust and hasn t been cleaned at least for a year as well as the soft wall above the bed When we arrived there was only 1 bathrobe for 2 people but they brought second one straight away after we mentioned that so even if there were small things staff was very customer orientated and solved all issues fast , Very beautiful property The arts displayed were amazing Super friendly and keen to help staff quickly responded to all our requests Room was small but the size of the bathroom was impressive and it was great to have both walk in shower and bath Bed is very soft and comfortable Bathroom and room overall were very clean and well prepared before arrival Room we had was exactly as on the pictures everything was in good working condition 
245762,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The hairdryer started burning up and smelt like it was about to blow at any second Other than this I was very happy with my stay The price of breakfast was a bit hefty but it s London so was expected , The location for me is what helped me pick this hotel Very happy with the location the room was very clean and the shower was awesome 
245763,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Restaurant menu choice was poor and room service had choice of two sandwiches and when arrived the bread was not fresh borderline stale, Stylish surroundings
245764,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Double ended bath would have made it perfect I got the tap end , Loved the decor it really made it feel unique The staff were brilliant and the cocktails amazing Couldn t have a better location 
245765,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like It was over and above what I expected, There wasn t one particular thing I liked I loved it all hotel location room staff food Servuce Everything was superb
245766,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very uncomfortable bed also room temp was very unresponsive We are well traveled people and stay in many hotels over the coarse of the year due to our work I did look forward to staying here but was very let down on level of comfort,No Positive
245767,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Too soft bed but maby only for us The room was really small small King ab 9 quadra m but for us 2 women was OK a big comfortable bathroom, Everything was OK very clean the staff VERY nice and competent was predicting all our needs 
245768,The Exhibitionist Hotel, MAIN BEDROOM ON THE SMALL SIZE ONLY STAYED FOR 3 NIGHTS SO NOT MAJOR BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR A LONGER STAY, THE BED WAS VERY COMFY ROOMS WERE CLEAN BATHROOM AMAZING STAFF VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL NICE TOUCH OF CANDLES IN ROOM ON VALENTINES NIGHT
245769,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Only gripe was the electric going out in our room twice due to a faulty iron which was not convenient as we was rushing to go to the theatre, Loved the hotel and our stay the shower was awesome Room and location was brilliant just what we wanted will deffo be returning
245770,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bathroom shelf over sink flips and the same for the towel rack on opposite wall , room is very small Staff was the best All of them Very helpful and pleasant 
245771,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Too much noise slammed doors rowdy neighbours no soundproof whatsoever , The Exhibitionist is an unusual hotel out of the crowd which makes it attractive Design art works make the stay there a really special one The staff is very friendly and helpful 
245772,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Our room was much too warm but we were able to turn off the heating However it was still a little too warm probably due to the mild weather for January , We were given the option to upgrade to a full breakfast for 7 The choice of dishes was excellent and the food was delicious and well presented The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Hotel is in a great location too 
245773,The Exhibitionist Hotel, sound proof needs improvement and squeaky wooden floor, location staff especially Zita was very attentive and caring quietness of the outside balcony
245774,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast not great value for money very poor room very small shower not working that great taps worked backwards road noise deliveries commenced 5 30 am and very noisy there must be better value hotels, convenient to museums and tube
245775,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room size, For some reason our booking was lost so we arrived to some confusion the staff were helpful and after a while we were told that we would be upgraded for the inconvenience but the room we had was very small and noisy As it was only one night we put up with it
245776,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not a thing no fault, Myself an boyfriend stay at the weekend an found location was brilliant close to tub station an lost of places to eat Hotel is unique with lots or style Our room was clean an cosy comfortable bed All the staff their was very helpful and willing to chat with you a nice touch having someone open the door for you at th hotel entry 
245777,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The best night s sleep I ve had in a hotel ever The bed was so soft and comfortable and room facilities top class I just wish I could have stayed longer 
245778,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Tiny room really struggled to have two large suitcases Didn t have available a spare keycard Amazing for a 5 star hotel Crazy machine noise at 1am that went all night , Location 
245779,The Exhibitionist Hotel, House keeping was a little off sometimes Complained and they sorted it out, Staff were friendly and helpful The Greek concierge was particularly nice was always ready to help
245780,The Exhibitionist Hotel, None , The hotel was wonderful in every sense of the word The staff was helpful and the room was very comfortable and clean I ll stay at The Exhibitionist again the next time I visit London D
245781,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is amazing Greg on reception is a credit to the hotel and was more than helpful helping to arrange an upgrade for us at an extra cost of course The room with the plunge pool is out of this world and the size of room 001 is out of this world It has a restaurant on site but we did not have dinner but the cooked breakfast was lovely
245782,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Would have been nice to have had a small fridge in the room with bottled water selection of drinks some snacks etc commonly found in other rooms where you are paying a similar price but otherwise very impressed , Location and staff excellent expected room to be slightly larger but very comfortable nevertheless 
245783,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Rooms on the small side but it is London The breakfast was average at best but I wasn t too worried by this personally, The location was excellent for the London and the hotel very relaxed The bathroom facilities were good although the room got very hot The bar made some lovely cocktails 
245784,The Exhibitionist Hotel, As always there is an issue with space in London old Europe hard to have good space and nice equipped hotel But I have to say this hotel was a good choice , Welcoming reception and crowd of nice people due to exhibition going on in the lobby My room was a different one than ussual in London it has enough space to have a shower and walk for a few steps in the room 
245785,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The only negatives we have are of the actual room itself It was just too small for two people I m not sure if our room was especially small or if this is indeed standard for the hotel While the bed was comfortable it is only a queen with tiny nightstands on either side because of the lack of space We were constantly bumping into each other or having to step out of each other s way so just not ideal The closet is possibly the smallest closet I have ever seen in any hotel so I ended up having to use the chair to drape all my clothes The suitcases fit in a small niche that really served no other purpose and we thought would have been better served if it had been an extra closet or clothes hanging area There was no mini bar in the room which we thought strange There was a bottle of water in the room and some coffee and tea packets but that s it The initial feeling when you step inside the room is appreciative of the design and decor but a closer look and it just lacks the finish and quality that it initially leads you to believe It just felt a little tired The bathroom is actually a very good size in comparison to the room itself and boasts a large walk in shower full bath tub and single sink We did again struggle with the limited counter space and there was only two hooks behind the door so you had to step out of the shower or tub to get your towel or the bathrobe The mirror above the sink is so high that my wife couldn t see herself in it at all and had to use the full length mirror in the closet We re not sure how the room was heated but didn t have any issues until one night when we thought it was a bit too cold and we had no way of raising the temperature We didn t book the breakfast because we like to explore the city but we did check it out the first morning and felt it was very basic Just some cold cuts and jams etc , The staff and the location were the best part We honestly couldn t fault either The staff were wonderful during check in and even though they were working over Christmas and away from their families they were always ready with a smile and lovely to deal with We love to walk everywhere and the hotel s location is perfect for that It s only a 10 minute walk to Harrods and Knightsbridge and a 1 minute walk to London s best museums South Kensington Train station is a 3 minute walk and is surrounded by a fantastic variety of casual restaurants The hotel itself is very stylish and each room is different in its design theme colour The lift is a bit slow so they ve compensated by including a white board for guests to write messages on so the time passes quickly We actually thought this was quite fun and didn t mind the time it took The room was spotless and we were well taken care of when it came to any request we had From extra pillows to extra toiletries etc We had asked for a quiet room so our view was of an internal courtyard and neighbouring buildings While it s in the heart of everything it is located on a very quiet street so sleeping and privacy are guaranteed If you re looking for a place that is well located and very affordable for London this is a great option 
245786,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The iPad was not working to begin with but a replacement was given On two occasions we had to request towels as either some or none were left , The design art work Also location very easy for the Natural History V A museums 20 mins walking distance to Harrods Access to tube a short walk away Leicester Square 5 stops away 
245787,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Just 2 small things neither of which would put us off staying there again 1 There was a leak of some sort under the carpet near the bathroom so the carpet was very wet at that point 2 The hotel bar does not serve peach bellini but we were not told for 30mins after which point we were running too late for cocktails and had to leave for our evening event not a big issue but it would have been nice to have what we had ordered, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful the bed was very comfortable and the style inside the room and the arty hotel generally was really great
245788,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No real complaints The lift is a bit tiny but otherwise nothing that we didn t like , Friendly attentive staff convenient location tasteful decor excellent value
245789,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room was so small I felt claustrophobic Hardly enough room walk round the bed no where to put the irritating and pointless cushions that hotel interior designers insist on putting on beds The wardrobe which would not hold the contents of even a small suitcase could only be accessed by one small door as the other door couldn t open because the bedside cabinet blocked it This wasn t a bedroom it was a large cupboard and ridiculous for the room rate paid, A very quirky trendy hotel and I loved the grass in the lift The bathroom was lovely and well appointed the bed was extremely comfortable 
245790,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Staff were lacking in basic training leadership both breakfasts were chaos food was not been replaced tables left unclean ed big staff shortage the trainee was totally lost had no idea people were getting annoyed and he looked on in amasement , Great location easy access to tube 
245791,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Shower was very weak Air conditioning units on balcony were loud so you couldn t enjoy the balcony despite paying a lot of money for a room with a balcony also balcony out side was grubby looking so not worth the money Bed was not comfy Had to remind hotel staff to set up our wifi , Friendly bar staff and good location 
245792,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room could have been slightly bigger , Very friendly staff Good breakfast Very comfortable bed and very convenient location close to Picadilly Line for Heathrow and Central London 
245793,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Couldn t get to the power points near the bed because of fixed furniture blocking access Staff did provide us with an extension cord though , Great decor comfy bed fabulous location very friendly helpful staff A warm welcome farewell from Adam Luca all others on reception Also lovely quiet 
245794,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We felt kind of watched by the staff at breakfast otherwise perfect , Soft bed excellent and polite staff very pretty and charming place 
245795,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was very small much smaller than the pictures on the website would lead you to believe, The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious
245796,The Exhibitionist Hotel, For a quality hotel like this I was disappointed there was only instant coffee available in the rooms Single lift and painfully slow , Great location Lovely bed Quiet room facing mews 
245797,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, This is by far the friendliest most welcoming hotel I have ever stayed in We were welcomed at reception by a lady called Zena apologies if I m spelling that wrong and she was so genuinely warm and happy I felt relaxed straight away Housekeeping were very sweet and polite and I noticed that the vibe was generally just a lot more relaxed and happy than in most five stars For this reason alone I would choose this over other five stars I have stayed at in London Special mention to the bar manager for what I feel may just be the best White Russian in London Our room was quirky but luxurious with lovely bathroom products Everything from the snacks in the room to the elevator seems really well thought out You can t get more convenient than this location yet it is very quiet and pleasant to walk around with lots of nice shops and restaurants 
245798,The Exhibitionist Hotel, This is not a five star hotel That is quite a drastic mis advertisment by this hotel to be rated 5 star on this website The is no gym spa or any kind of facilities to that nature Hotel breakfast bar is small with a limited breakfast selection Price however is the same as if i booked at Park Plaza at Westminister that annoyed me This is a very comfortable very clean very small 3 star boutique hotel , It s a very creative hotel and as boutique hotels go in London rooms are spacious in comparison to some boutique hotels I ve stayed in 
245799,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not a good night sleep Used to a memory foam mattress Cooked breakfast should have been included in price , Hotel looked lovely The staff were very attentive 
245800,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The air condition not much good Also the internet connection was poor because the room located in the basm, The decorations was brilliant The pool in the bathroom was fantastic Also the staff veary friendly 
245801,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Ordered birthday package they did not get it and did not let me know so I could of sorted something myself It was my boyfriend s birthday and I wanted something special for him There were no lights on the balcony and the air con units were broke making loud noises but they did not get engineers until the day we left , The art work and all around look of the hotel was fabulous Great location 
245802,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, A lovely room with a very comfortable bed My stay was short in late out early But my contact with the staff very pleasant I will look forward to staying there again for longer next time I m in London
245803,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bar could have been open a little longer, Upgraded to a suite which was really special as it was my 50th birthday couldn t fault it in any way thankyou so much
245804,The Exhibitionist Hotel, N a, Staff cleanliness location private pool in the suite Probably one of the best places you can ever stay in when in London for the price We stayed in the Splash Suite and it was a unique experience 
245805,The Exhibitionist Hotel, the ipad app arrow is bugged hard to press, Like the name itself hotel itself is a gallery and every floor has its own theme quite fashion design I would say Great location in the south kennsington area near Gloucester ROad and South Kennsington There s an IPAD in the room you can simply choose room service you want with several finger points Also includes spa nails makeup service as well Staff were SUPER friendly and helpful Wifi was super fast The lift is really entertaining that you could totally lost time sense 
245806,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bed wasn t 100 comfortable two zip mattresses pushed together It s also quite noisy in the building from other guests , The staff were incredible couldn t do enough for us the design of the hotel is really modern 
245807,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No sports facilities, Very stylish hotel Rooms are very special Staff is very helpful Overall a great experience It was the third time that I staid there and whenever I can arrange it I will come back 
245808,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No breakfast included for 250 per night and considering we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights for my sons 18th birthday a more personable service would have been appreciated , The decor was fabulous
245809,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Lack service not very refined no attention to detail no controls for televisions in room room service slow and terrible quality breakfast cold took an hour to make curtains didnt close reception was directly above room very noisy all night bad soundproofing Not what you expect for 500 a night, Location decor
245810,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast was severed cold and we were not served together I had finished mine before my husbands arrived We ordered toast which didn t arrive so had to make our own Very expensive Service charge was added making the total 45 I complained at reception and was told it would be better next time I stay It spoiled what had been a pleasant experience and has left me not wanting to repeat it ,No Positive
245811,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Wasn t convinced by healthy snacks in our room Some old fashioned biscuits would have been nice with our cup of tea Mind you I m certain they would have given us some immediately had we asked , Extremely comfortable and entertainingly contemporary hotel in premier Kensington location Ideal for attending concert at Royal Albert Hall
245812,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Could do with more counter space to put things on I couldn t work out how to turn on the overhead shower in the shower box so just used the handheld shower piece , Room was very colourful unlike a lot of hotels and very clean There was some wonderful arty pictures on display as this is an exhibitions hotel In the lift filled with artificial grass is a board with magnetic letters where guest spelt out little sayings 
245813,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room slightly on the small side with little drawer space , Friendliest of staff great location for central London and excellent value for money breakfasts 
245814,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Rather greasy full English breakfast probably best to stick to the inclusive continental breakfast which was good Coffee had to be chased although when breakfast is self service it is more difficult for staff to be pro active Operating instructions for the eventually effective shower and more effective lighting for the shaving mirror a common problem in hotels would help , The ambience the staff the location the room the reception area and the limited traffic noise A basic question is whether this hotel warrants its significant premium over the local Premier Inns in my case for this particular trip it did 
245815,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, We had a night in London and chose the Drop Dead Gorgeous Suite as a treat The room was clean spacious and exactly as described and we loved the plunge pool after a long day of walking around London The in room iPad is also really handy for ordering in room dining We will be back next trip to London 
245816,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The rooms are a new standard of small you can t walk round the bed The bed covers the plugs One tiny lift which carries two people and two cases Rooms so small that there isn t a fridge or selection of drinks , Obliging staff
245817,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Themail air conditioning unit would shake anyou time someone moved around on the floor above and it was very loud The window of our room lead on to the street which was also loud , The room was HIGE The bed was massive and extremely comfortable The plunge pool was so hot and relaxing The positives completely outweighed the negatives 
245818,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not really well set up for a comfortable breakfast not enough space in the breakfast room bar and the continental breakfast was mediocre , The staff were all very friendly and helpful We loved the art work the lift lined with fake grass and a magnetic word board to amuse us on the way to our room Whilst the room was small it had everything we needed and a great bathroom 
245819,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Paid extra for balcony room but the balcony looked out into just another balcony also just had two chairs and a table on needed more decoration to carry on the luxurious feel Little things like no teaspooon for tea no plug near the kettle and generallly a very small room for what you pay for Barely any space to get out of bed , Luxurious decoration of the room only good for couples or solo Would be quite uncomfortable staying with someone like a relative as the rooms are so small Great friendly staff
245820,The Exhibitionist Hotel, It s to expensive for the room so tiny and after booking with booking com they wanted to change our original rate and their answers was because the stock market changes therefore money value does to from dollar to Pounds Overall I wasn t happy besides the art that they have hanging , We asked about cofee machine in our room and no one seemed to care Rooms where little tight and feelt isolated but over all decor entrance is Beatiful but I wouldn t go back for the price we payed 
245821,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Booking com website shows the hotel as having parking facilities which it does not There is a pretty expensive parking place within 2 mins but this has no special deal for guests at the hotel, Friendly helpful staff they all seem really proud of their hotel The rooms are well equipped really good bathroom and funky design Excellent comfortable bed The choice of room fragrance is a nice touch and we ended up buying some on line 
245822,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room had a damaged shower drain which meant the smell was horrendous When brought to management attention in arrival it was suggested this was down to cleaning products There were no other rooms available so we had to live with it When we went to use the hotel bar in the evening we found out that they were running a private function that completely took over the hotel so we went out instead There was also supposed to be an iPad in the room too but after 3 times of asking they never unlocked the screen on it In the end when we came to leave and settle we had to fight to get money off for the incredibly poor service and a room that stunk of swewage It wasn t until I produced a video of the floor tiles in the shower venting smelly liquid from their cracks were we given 20 off a 300 room which in my opinion with all the arguing that we had to do and as a customer with the hotel manager was still not enough We would never stay there again , It looked good online
245823,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room we booked was Signature Luxury King with Balcony It turned out to be the smallest room that I have ever stayed over 5 decades of travel to 40 plus countries There was literally no space for our bags which we had to leave with the concierge Through skillful photography the pictures on booking com create a false perception of space We were given Room 102 I strongly urge booking com to have the dimensions measured to realise how much of a gross misrepresentation has been made on its website , Friendly staff and good breakfast
245824,The Exhibitionist Hotel, rooms quite small the shaver socket clearly hadn t been working for a while so had to get an adapter to use toothbrush in a normal wall socket next to floor Hotel overall a little jaded decoration wise needs a bit of attention , staff helpful location good 
245825,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We slept next to the elevator and it was noisy It didn t bother us to fall asleep though it was just an annoying sound , The beds were super comfy
245826,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Could of been hot chocolate for the people who don t like tea or coffee, The bed was sooo comfy and it is in a really nice area The hotel had also decorated out room which towel swans in a heart rose petals and chocolate bars as it was our one year anniversary 
245827,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The location of this hotel is great Very near a major tube stop and walking distance to many major sites Lots of restaurants near by The staff was lovely and my stay there was great 
245828,The Exhibitionist Hotel, 2 slices of toast a yoghurt and only 1 coffee 16 Never been value for money We were the only people eating in their restaurant the menu was very restricted We were kept waiting an hour for our main course with no explanation and 12 5 courtesy charge for the privilege on the bill Not happy, the bed was comfortable
245829,The Exhibitionist Hotel, 1 I ordered breakfast one morning and it never made it to my room Staff was apologetic 2 mouse in my room the last night I figured for the hassle I would get the night discounted but nothing , beautiful bathrooms bed was very comfortable Loved having balcony
245830,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Mix up with booking on arrival I noticed the front desk was very dusty The room was very small and given how new the hotel is fixtures in the room were broken damaged Also saw a mouse in the room I won t be returning or recommending this hotel , Bed was comfortable
245831,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The concept of the hotel was lost in some of the detailing the rubber plant and other greenery around the bull The bar area was a little soulless It was great as a breakfast room but lacked atmosphere in the evenings , Staff were really friendly and the bed was exceptionally comfortable Location good for our purposes 
245832,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Staff attitude lacking professionalism Tight slow silly elevator Lack of referigerator in the room Poor inconsistent wifi And more , Nothing 
245833,The Exhibitionist Hotel, breakfast was really really average whole bathroom flooded from the ceiling had to force them to let me change rooms was made to swap rooms and took around 45 minutes to do this which made me late for my meeting my bag was supposed to be in my room when I got back and instead someone else s dry cleaning was there Overall very unimpressed ,No Positive
245834,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The desk chair was too low for comfort and there was no easy chair in this indeed Small Luxury King There was insufficient space to put your things by the wash basin Breakfast was pricey and strictly continental This goes a bit far if a cappuccino attracts an extra charge not to speak of eggs , The mattress the duvet and the rain shower were very good The free wifi was also good as was the water heater for coffee and tea Staff are very friendly Happily the name of the hotel refers only to the art in the public spaces 
245835,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Attention to detail on fixtures some furnishings was a bit amiss the room photo was misleading as taken with a wide angle lens Room 404 is tiny No fridge or decent sized drawers in the room , Friendly staff Excellent location Fabulous bathroom and very comfortable bed high quality bed linen We d stay there again but ask for a bigger room 
245836,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Upon arrival we wanted s drink in the bar We was told that the bar Restaurent was closed for a function One guy interviewing someone so it would seem We asked when the bar would open the restaurant none of the staff knew They just said we don t really know For such s small hotel to have this area closed all evening was ridiculous meant that we could not use all the facilities of the hotel that we had paid for I believe if we had been advised of this then the price should have been allot cheaper and we would have made prior arrangements booked another Restaurent near by for the evening , Bedroom the suite we booked was fab Loved that 
245837,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not worth the money and no where near 5 stars No friendliness from Mr E Upon arrival He is lacking basic skills and professionalim for the tourism branch arrogant and rude Hotel rooms are tiny as often seen in London but here no place for clothes or suitcases TV wasnt working and and and much more The arty decoration doesn t unfortunately balance the negative aspects The method they dealt with the problems were unacceptable This place did not make us feel welcome and showed us they do not need you as a guest ,No Positive
245838,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The reception asked if there was a special occasion and we replied it was our honeymoon which was not addressed during our stay We asked for a quiet room and our room was on the street and was very noisy , The property as previous reviews have said is small Good service The lift was tiny and extremely slow it pays to use the stairs The towel rail kept falling so a little upkeep is needed 
245839,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Advertised as a 5 star boutique hotel but it is not hence the comments that follow the dust in the room and in the lobby the size of the room cupboard could not be opened fully safe was on the floor no bathrobe tea was for one and we were two soap shampoo shower gel lotion for one and we were two noisy at night on the road , the tea facility in the room the firmness of the mattress which was very pleasant the quality of the shower gel shampoo soap the situation near the tube station and good restaurants 
245840,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Parking nearby was expensive My shower had a drain issue and water leaked out On departure we informed the staff , Very friendly and attentive staff Staff were also very quick at checking in and answering questions and sorting out requests Lovely room and great decor throughout In a great location next to the museums which we visited during our weekend away 
245841,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bedrooms were very small and the staff serving breakfast were not particularly helpful or attentive , Wacky decor and refreshingly different with a good atmosphere and nice location The reception staff were friendly and helpful 
245842,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, A beautiful Art Hotel A delight to stay in such fresh and artistic surrounds The staff were so lovely always happy to meet your needs Our balcony room was beautiful with a large bath and separate shower Location was amazing with the tube around the corner and plenty of options for meals Will not hesitate to book again when next in London 
245843,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing We loved everything , A fabulously funky hotel Staff are so friendly and helpful Immaculately clean Rooms are a perfect comfy place to relax after sightseeing South Kenisington station is only a 5 minute walk away Can t wait to visit again 
245844,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Safe not tacked to wall no refrigerator Small complaints as 24 hour reception is great security, Great location staff were very helpful lovely small room Very clean and comfortable 
245845,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bedrooms are quite small in proportion to the furnishings e g it was quite a squeeze getting around the bed and accessing the wardrobe but the room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was spacious , I was attracted to the originality and creativity of the design features and choices of contemporary artwork within the hotel Staff were really friendly and the breakfast was superb It was the ideal location for exploring the South Kensington museums and a very relaxing place to stay 
245846,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not easy if you have a wheel chair or physical limitations to access the rooms For our family it was not an issue If anyone has concerns regarding this manner then make sure to call for clarity and accurate information , Outstanding location decor art Iinens and customer service The team staff members were very resourceful and helpful during our stay of seven nights I highly recommend this hotel 
245847,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I was slightly disappointed I put in a request to have flowers a ballon left in the room upon booking as a surprise for my girlfriend This was clearly overlooked I believe the decor in the photo for the room I booked showed green bedding and curtains my girlfriends favourite colour but when we arrived the colour theme of the room seemed to be more red purple Although we still loved this it wasn t particularly what I booked , The art and overall atmosphere in this hotel was fantastic We particularly liked the slate bathroom and the turfed lift All the staff seemed very friendly and happy to help 
245848,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast was the only disappointed that was included in the room Took along time to get are coffee s and had a very limited selection of food compared to other hotels I would stay at the hotel but not select breakfast again If the trip was for business I would of requested a refund for the breakfast and eaten else where , Lovely hotel which was easy to find from South Kensington Station Was quick and easy when checking in and the location is good for the rate of the rooms 
245849,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I liked everything , The bed was extra comfy The bathroom was massive with an awesome bath and shower Staff were friendly no matter what time of day whether it be midnight or 9am Location was great with only a 4 5 minute stroll to the nearest underground and bus stops just a 1 minute walk 
245850,The Exhibitionist Hotel, An arrogant 20something guest who treated the breakfast staff as if they were his servants He couldn t take the top off his own boiled egg His mother needs a slap , We love this hotel and after discovering it last year it s now our hotel of choice when we re in London We ve 2 more stays lined up this year Staff are fabulous and the rooms are gorgeous The position of the hotel so close to the museums couldn t be better and we found a fab wine bar The Sampler just round the corner Breakfast which is plated service was delicious and kept us going till mid afternoon See you in October 
245851,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room could have been a little bigger but it was the smallest of the rooms available, A properly unique hotel in a cracking location The decor is amazing all the way down to the fine details Would definitely recommend this hotel
245852,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The rooms are so small but they used a panoramic lens for shooting the photos in a way to look wide enough the breakfast buffet was ridicules and poor i had to cancel the breakfast and depend on near cafe s The place is good if you only need a place to sleep as there is no facilities other than a living room, The Staff were amazing especially Sofia Elanor Agnes they were so helpful and professional 
245853,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, The quirkiness of Hotel Match the theme quite well of name of room Close to South Kensington underground train many cafes close good walking distance in Kensington
245854,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Felt the bedroom decor was on the tacky side and the lampshade was covered in layers of dust, The fun alphabet letters in the lift and the bath and large shower
245855,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I felt that maybe the art is more important than some room basics None of the rooms are equipped with a minibar I found that very odd The room I was in had a bit of a space under the door which allowed for noises from the corridors to come in Once it was 8am all i could hear were door slams The hotel compensated me with a free breakfast when i complained on my last day which wasn t expected but this is an architectural flaw they need to fix Doors need door stoppers or those de acceleration hinges so they don t constantly slam , I loved the art floors and the art pieces in the lobby Very friendly staff great hotel location a walking distance from the tube as well as the museum district The rooms with balcony s are worth the price It s a great place to wind down 
245856,The Exhibitionist Hotel, It felt like I was staying in the edgy fancy garrett of a bunch of really sweet earnest creative art students with virtually no experience in hospitality There was no one waiting outside or even within sight of the door when we arrived so we had to lift our heavy bags up the four five steps no ramp either to even get in to this alleged 5 star hotel We had to ask for everything we wanted or needed Everyone was really sweet and eager to please but bewildered as if their last job was at an art studio and the had no familiarity whatsoever with hospitality No one asked us how they could help us plan our stay When I asked for help choosing where it made most sense to start our tour of the city they had no idea where to access the hop on hop off bus tours of London or any sense of reputable companies Same for the boat tour They also had no idea about hours or wait times for the London eye These are London tourist 101things a holiday inn would be expected to know that kind of information Forget asking them to book a table at a nice restaurant They didn t even know where things were located Not one person we encountered spoke English fluently and there were numerous miscommunications as a result I asked about a boat tour of the Thames the woman at the desk thought I wanted to go to Rotterdam I specified that I needed to have a cab to the airport that I could pay for by credit card They assured me that they would make a specification for that when they booked it and the guy had no credit card machine when I got to Heathrow I ended up counting out coins to pay for it and enduring a huge amount of added stress The room advertised as a discounted rate at 210 pounds looked cool with the oversize wacky chandeliers that hand spectacularly throughout the hotel and giant built in bed taking up the whole space but it had NOT been thought through beyond the performance art factor , The concept and design are spectacular cool incredibly chic and original The look is amazing interesting There is a revolving curated art exhibition downstairs The hotel is in an amazing location a block below the base of Exhibition Road intersecting with Cromwell Road right between the famed Victoria and Albert Museum and the amazing Natural History Museum On the corner there s the South Kensington station surrounded by a ton of restaurants in a sort of mini pedestrian mall A few more blocks to the right Harrods a few more blocks to the right the Knightsbridge station endlessly chic top drawer boutique department store Harvey Nichols and the top of super chic Sloan Street home of the Sloan Rangers 
245857,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing, Excellent staff unique and fun d cor and great location Felt like staying in an upscale art gallery Rooms and bed were very comfortable and loved the bath tub Will definitely recommend this place and come back in the future 
245858,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Loved the quirkiness of this hotel A bit different to your usual run of the mill Friendly staff nothing too much trouble Comfy bed great shower Great location 4 mins walk from the tube station
245859,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The cupboard doors were not as clean as they should be there was no mirror to dress The bathroom mirror was too high for me There were no glasses to put toothbrush etc The sink is totally impractical , The bathroom was a good size Bed was comfortable The a c was great The staff were delightful friendly and very accommodating 
245860,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The rooms were a lot smaller than expected although it did not spoil our stay , The location for us was perfect The hotel was friendly and very clean we would stay again
245861,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room service was ordered via iPad After an hour it hadn t arrived We then rang reception It had been overlooked We were in a rush to leave for the evening We didn t get to enjoy , Overall an excellent hotel 
245862,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Everything very unprifessional, Reception staff terrible had late check out they kept ringing and house keeping banging door from 9am went to check out no receipt given and they couldn t take payment as card machine not working I liked nothing about this hotel rooms tiny and no toilet paper in room we had to ask for it
245863,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Ordered a bottle of beer and a glass of wine from the bar when we got back to hotel after a night out just after midnight and were hit with a 12 service charge Bit steep considering the drinks were exactly cheap themselves Apart from that would definitely recommend but take your own night caps , Very friendly staff couldn t do enough for you room a little small but great decor and facilities If you have forgotten any toiletries most will be provided free of charge just use the iPad in your room to order Bed was very comfy and got 2 nights great sleep 
245864,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The size of the room greeting to the wardrobe was an art The bar prices are excessive 31 for two gin and tonics , The ambience and decoration of the hotel is very good stunning in parts 
245865,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Good location close to everything walking distance to Hyde park for the concert we where going to Quiet street and Hotel We enjoyed our 2 night stay 
245866,The Exhibitionist Hotel, If I had to split hairs the lift is snug, The room we had 108 had an excellent bathroom and a much larger balcony than expected Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff
245867,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing really without being picky , The ambience of the hotel from the facilities comfort and staff seemed just right My wife and I found it very comfortable and appealing There was a feeling of quirkiness but in a nice way 
245868,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Service, Staff were training it seemed and requests and communication seemed to be lost in translation we asked for a taxi to be called for us to go to Hyde park a ten minute journey from the hotel and with no metre he charged us 14 which is scandalous and he dropped us a 7 minute walk away from our destination
245869,The Exhibitionist Hotel, All good, Quirky but really good A change from the stereotype London hotel Try it and you won t be disappointed Loved the art work It had a real upbeat and positive vide about it 
245870,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No Negative comments only that we wish we could have stayed there longer And giving it a 10 rating is selling the hotel short in my eyes , We stayed at the exhibisionist for just one night before our long journey home to Australia From the very first moment we stepped inside everything was 5 star artistic stylish and immaculate from the entry way all the way through to the bar and our room Every where you turn is wonderful and wacky art spectacles that are eye catching and fascinating The staff were amazing especially for me as I organised the day before to surprise my partner with a proposal It s not every day the staff would have requests like this and I left it in their hands and they nailed it Friendly attentive and very accomodating If you get the chance to book The drop dead gorgeous Suite was stunning The pictures don t do the hotel any justice really you have to see it for yourself Simply Perfect 
245871,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, for me personally the most important thing is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the staff here were great and the music was well chosen
245872,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not 5 star The rose covered light shade was very dusty The room was extremely small with limited room to get out of bed and when trying to use the wardrobe Room service at 11 o clock resulted in a stale sandwich , 5 star Beautiful hotel very comfortable bed and delightful shower Excellent location 
245873,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room and bathroom very small ipad in the room didn t work crisps were dated best before January 2016 we were there in July 2016 Staff just looked very bored and not helpful at meal times No help at breakfast with what was available apart from given a menu ie did English Breakfast mean you could help yourself to toast etc as none was provided , Bed was comfy and bathroom clean
245874,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Quite noisy as you hear all the people walking lobby is directly over the bed Also with all the wonderful design someone forgot to put dimmer switches in the bedroom Easy to fix , Splash suite is wonderful great design Room service was great I love that the jacuzzi was full of hot water it is perfect The bathroom is amazing Very comfy bed and pillows Bathroom temperature was perfect but bedroom a little nippy Very nice and helpful staff I would definitely stay again really lovely hotel 
245875,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Great looking boutique hotel but lacks atmosphere Needs nespresso machines in rooms My wifi signal was very hit and miss and the in room iPad wasnot switched on when I booked in they would not have sorted it if not told and as that gives information on all the hotel facilities it should be the first thing they do I feel they have a long way to go Definitely only 4 stars , Comfy bed quirky decor 
245876,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The Rain shower s top quality although it needs to be looked after which speaks for the hotel as a whole TBH The shower head needs to be cleaned more often I resorted to cleaning it myself I shouldn t have had to ask for complimentary items such as toothbrush diffuser or bathrobes on arrival or wait half an hour for them to show Room smelt of cigarettes too you should probably remind customers about this in the room itself Don t leave everything to the iPad a booklet would do The iron and ironing board wasn t of great 5 star quality you would expect though it got the job done Trouser press or steam iron would be a good option too Hotel branding s disappointing for a boutique but the interior decor made up for this Lose the terrible vinyls on the wall in the room s as its really dated iPad functionality needs speakers in the room and ability to play local radio or Spotify My room Ultimate Lux King included a continental breakfast one of the main reasons for my booking However I the app should notify you what time breakfast is served at The girl I spoke to at reception had to double check too Breakfast lacked variety and was served with paper napkins It did not include the Cappuccino I had albeit listed on the menu For you to charge me 3 82 against my knowledge and then add grats on top is fairly outrageous 4 30 for a cappuccino is rather extortionate and to not even be notified about it even when ordering is quite frankly unacceptable Even though it is only 4 30 I m sure it all adds up Lounge and reception area needs more comfortable seating Great room but eat elsewhere , Bedding was super comfortable The room size was better than expected considering the location of the hotel Bathroom is stocked with complimentary Noble Isle which was good to see Everything can be ordered through iPad and Smart TV a great feature and very clever though remove the surname to make it more personal If you need something urgently speak to Reception directly or on the phone Balcony was terrific really peaceful if you do choose to book get one 
245877,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The food service was very poor and on one day they had no chef so could not cook anything The breakfast area and entrance were not of the standard expected, Bedroom was OK
245878,The Exhibitionist Hotel, at 540 pounds for 2 nights without breakfast it is a bit expensive maybe offer more deals a few times a year for returning customers , room was clean and air con was on and lovely and cool very important in sticky heat in June bed was very comfortable
245879,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I wouldn t rate it 5 star Maybe a 4 star Staff were friendly helpful but some were not very professional in my opinion , Staff were friendly but seemed very inexperienced 
245880,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Everything was fantastic, Fantastic location super friendly staff we couldn t thank Eleonora and Sofia enough for helping with directions and making restaurant reservations for us 
245881,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Continental breakfast was OK but not as good a choice that we have enjoyed elsewhere , Bed bedding v good comfortable room quite small needed to keep air con running all night Good location not too noisy Quite enjoyed the unusual decor 
245882,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Black mold in shower between window and brick Was on allergy medicine the whole stay due to it Advised staff who said they would notify housekeeping room 408 If one had it I m sure all do, Bed
245883,The Exhibitionist Hotel, dirty room dank carpets horrible check in and no mini bar in what is meant to be a 5 star hotel tried too hard and no wonder its empty, One staff member who cant wait to resign was helpful The rest were surly This is ABSOLUTELY NOT 5 stars
245884,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Tired furniture with damage marks to desk and tea cady For 5 stars this just wasn t good enough Bath taps were limescale water marked Off putting again for a 5 star hotel The only thing 5 star was the location, Nice town house turned hotel Looking tired in the room Limescale residue on bath taps and hair straightener water marks on the desk Also damage to the tea cady Nice hotel Small tiny room with balcony Nice bar and general reception area For 250 pounds for the night I had a king room with balcony and I was disappointed I could have gotten more for my money else where Wouldn t stay here again but wasn t unpleasant Great location for the royal Albert hall
245885,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The only issue was the plug in the bath was broken so I couldn t have a bath Breakfast is slightly overpriced , The place was beautiful The location is fantastic and the upgrade to the penthouse suite made it very special
245886,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There was no bar fridge to put medicines and eye drops in, Hotel is amazing Artistic funky fun Staff excellent very patient considerate Brilliant location We will recommend this hotel to all family and friends and we will return to this hotel next time we are in London 
245887,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Average breakfast When we booked a room with breakfast included it didnt say the breakfast is continental no eggs sausages nothing hot and for normal english breakfast in England we have to pay extra Thats strange , Nice design Average breakfast Liked a lot of berries for breakfast The rest was good Modern clean good location 
245888,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Cleanliness could be improved Bathroom could be cleaner walls dirty Staff are dishonest They refuse to return something that was left behind in room No view , Bed very comfortable spacious bathroom Good breakfast 
245889,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room on the small side No mirror in the bedroom so almost impossible to dry hair iPad in the room a nice touch but didn t really do anything When we did want to book a room clean didn t work SMART TV also supposed to mirror your device Tried numerous times to connect to Netflix but no joy despite downloading all relevant Apps etc not a big deal but frustrating if it doesn t work , Really quirky decor Love the lift 
245890,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No cold water in bathroom both taps boiling hot Asked for more toilet roll three times no one bought any too our room in the two nights we stayed there ,No Positive
245891,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Whilst the room was very well appointed with everything we needed we were disappointed with both the smallness of the room and the view , I loved the quirkyness of the hotel and our stay was most enjoyable The hotel has a fine quality about it The bed was so comfortable like sleeping on a cloud The breakfast was lovely again good quality food I would definitely go back and stay at the hotel but next time request a larger room with a view to the front of the hotel 
245892,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Great quirky hotel full of kitschy discoveries around every corner Loved the fact we could sit out on our balcony Nice quiet location near tube station Staff welcoming and approachable Really enjoyed our overnight Close enough to Chelsea flower show Would come back again to the hotel Bar prices as you would expect for South Kensington expensive Managed to get good deal in room 
245893,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Main desk staff seemed to be new and unsure but still pleasant and tried to help, The decor was fabulous and the cocktail waitress was very friendly and helpful
245894,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Think the size of the room was misleading on the website so not expecting to be so small However this did not detract from our comfort , The decor and service comfy beds 
245895,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Requesting 50 hold in case you have a drink or send anything Room was dusted and decoration quite dark Overal decoration a little bit dark and cheap, Location Loved some of the artwork
245896,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Everything was good however it lacked the things that should have made it a 5 star hotel Breakfast selection was limited and expensive staff couldn t make cocktails were just a couple of minor things that we didn t expect, Location was great
245897,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room felt cramped and more attention could have been spared to the cleanliness on the bathroom tiles wee bit grimy, Loved the decor Breakfast was delicious and staff helpful and friendly Would definitely stay again 
245898,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Photos were deceiving Balcony was tiny with no chairs or table unlike the photos in fact u couldn t fit chairs on it And balcony was flooded Bed sheets were stained breakfast poor, Nice hotel
245899,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Ordered some extra pillows but they had none spare Bar was a bit too expensive even for a hotel , Bedroom very stylish and comfortable Staff extremely welcoming and helpful 
245900,The Exhibitionist Hotel, A mouse came into my room from under the door they didn t give me the option to move rooms and offered me a free breakfast which I declined Overall I got a 10 discount on checkout which I think was terrible , The hotel is convenient to access via the tube
245901,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No large mirror in the room and dim lighting together with location made the small mirrors difficult to use , Fun decor good breakfast and lovely staff 
245902,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The breakfast was over priced so we went to a nearby cafe But it would have been nice to have been able to afford to stay B B , The friendly and helpful staff everything pristine and clean great location 
245903,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, we really enjoyed our stay The decor was really nice My partner and I both really enjoyed ourselves The staff were really helpful and friendly and the location was great 
245904,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The cupboard to put clothes in was tiny located in a corner that was hard to get to because of the bedside cabinet and only one door opened There wasn t where in the bathroom to put make up etc The towels and flannels were hard like they had been line dried not fluffy as in other hotels I have stayed, The room was small but very pleasant The bed was very comfortable There was a selection of dried fruit and gluten free snacks these were a nice touch 
245905,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not the slickest operation given that it is claiming 5 stars Possibly the smallest room I have ever stayed in A lot smaller than looks in the pictures with hardly room to move around The main gripe was that there was no full length mirror with the only mirrors being in the bathroom This left it very difficult for my wife getting ready , Staff were friendly and the hotel is very trendy 
245906,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The sleeping area of the room was a bit small for our needs but the bathroom area with separate shower cubicle and bath were excellent , Quirky boutique hotel conveniently located for South Kensington and our visit to the Albert Hall The decor is really individual and fun and the staff were helpful and friendly IPad in the room was a nice touch 
245907,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Could not fault it over 1 night that we stayed , This was a fantastic quality boutique hotel in a fantastic location The interior design of the hotel was both modern and quirky at the same time and in some places highly unusual with lots of interesting art dotted around the place 
245908,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, It was my girlfriend birthday and i had many requests for arranging a surprise so the staff was very kind and at my disposal to arrange everything i asked Also the design of the hotel amazing
245909,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Rooms very very small not like on the photos Tv was not working rain forrest shower gave little water Overpriced and not what we expected like on the photos, Location
245910,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, All staff where extremely friendly very professional We both enjoyed our nite stay such Purfect way to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary we both enjoyed our breakfast from croissants to freshly fruit salad etc service was excellent by waitress We totally loved our room the Plunge pool that was in our room following the quirky artworks throughout the hotel We re hoping to go back soon 
245911,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Shortage of irons poor quality ones A C not working properly Not very comfy bed No fridge iPad room service does not work , Location Wuirkiness
245912,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Noisy front side of hotel as very busy street If I go again I will ask for the other side , Location Kettle in room Bath and separate shower Nice products and lovely towels Bed big and comfortable Hotel very retro and quirky Free drinking water and nibbles 
245913,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Our room was next to a noisy exterior air conditioning unit which disturbed our sleep , Staff did their best to make us feel welcome and answer our questions about local facilities 
245914,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Closed bar at 11 00 for residents and staff quite rude to people coming back hoping for a night cap the bar area is closed you will have to go to your room you can t stay here , Bedroom spacious comfy bed good bathroom
245915,The Exhibitionist Hotel, i think reception staff are shared between other local hotels particularly at off peak times out of hours this can delay check in and check out unfortunately, nice rooms comfy bed nice decor
245916,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Our room was a little small The wardrobe was in an annoying place On our return we will book a bigger room , The art The location was great The staff were so friendly and helpful 
245917,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No running hot or cold water from sink or bath Shower was only running water available Could hear water running all night from somewhere above Room s look much bigger online than they actually are I feel the room was very over priced , Food was good Ideal location for attractions General look was fab but smaller than expected 
245918,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Deceiving as expecting a 5 property No water in room on day 2 hence no shower Had to cross the street to sister Hotel and shower in a recently vacated dirty room in a dirty bathroom No restaurant offering only sandwiches in the evening No one asked me how my stay went upon check out Walls and doors are not noiseproof and I heard the neighbours having fun on multiple occasions Very average stay Will probably not stay there again , Location
245919,The Exhibitionist Hotel, A bit noisy at the night might have been due to the location of the room, Friendly and helpful staff Amazing interior with plenty pieces of art iPad as a smart ordering and entertainment device
245920,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There was honestly nothing that I didn t like Thanks guys , It was so different to any hotel we had ever been to Everything had an artistic twist to it even the lift was fantastic We was greeted as we entered to hotel and instantly looked after We got our key and went straight to the room AMAZING The bed was huge and the interior design was fantastic Bathroom was very modern and had a monsoon showerhead which I love The bar downstairs was brilliant too The bar staff were very polite and helped my girlfriend decide on cocktails they was never to busy to help The location was fantastic for us We was going to the Royal Albert Hall which was a 5 minute walk down the road Perfect It was also a five minute walk from 2 tube stations so you could get anywhere you like very quickly As there wasn t any parking for the hotel we had to use a carpark here we go again just 5 minutes away It was a little expensive but then again it is in London Lastly the night s sleep The bed was huge I like to spread out in bed and my girlfriend hates it but even when I spread out I still didn t get close enough to my girlfriend for her to complain we are close by the way we just like bed space haha So the space was fantastic Comfort level 9999 I put my head on the pillow and just passed out I slept like a log which is a good thing It was so comfortable and I didn t want to get out of bed in the morning This resulted in us being late for doing what we wanted to do the next day haha My fault not the bed D I would highly recommend to any young couples who are a bit qwerky and different from everyone else because that is what this hotel is Also they sold Voss Thank you for an amazing weekend guys 
245921,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel From the kindness of all the Doormen to the very friendly and efficient Reception team I cannot fault this wonderful hotel On a street opposite the Natural History Museum and 5mins from South Kensington tube station Very positive and upbeat style and interior design Perhaps a trendier funky style and artworks than say Malmaison but with similar modern high standards and quality Room was marvellous with balcony wonderful mattress bath and shower underfloor heating air con wifi Samsung smart tv yes all the best amenities Housekeeping was brilliant and we never saw them but such a perfect job This is a very very excellent hotel Give it a go 
245922,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Just a bit noisy in the street on a night but nothing that would put off another stay , This hotel is very unique a warm welcome from all the staff creative quirky interesting feast for the eyes Room was gorgeous and comfortable Great cocktails in the bar and breakfast was plentiful Best hotel stay in London Will be back Thank you 
245923,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing , Everything was fantastic the staff were excellent the room was fantastic the best hotel I have stayed in so far I will definitely be booking this hotel again 
245924,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bed could have been a bit stiffer and the room a little bigger , Staff was extremely warm funny and concerned about how to make our stay more comfortable 
245925,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Too noisy Could be just room 104 we stayed in but we heard just about every movement of everything both internally and externally, Trendy interior Good for Kensington location 
245926,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, I cant tell you how impressed we were with staying in the Drop Dead Gorgeous suite the photos do not do it any justice simply spectacular and such a nice treat for staying in London a real hidden gem And the staff they helped me prepare a little surprise before we arrived and were so helpful and friendly when i emailed them leading up to the weekend and on the day I m surprised to read any reviews that say otherwise Simply Amazing 
245927,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bar advertised as open to late but on our return at 2215 was closed Offered room service and charged nearly 30 for 2 whiskeys, Location is superb Our room had a balcony and was excellent Staff very friendly and welcoming
245928,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room was a bit small but still worth it, Everything Room was lovely Walking distance from station and history and science museum Easy travel into more central London Beds were amazing Rooms were amazing The little touches the lights The roses the bath which is rare in London hotels the showers were nice clean wellKept lovely staff the decor and everything else
245929,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bar and breakfast staff didn t communicate well and a general lack of understanding when you ordered anything or had a question, Quirky hotel reception staff were nice and friendly
245930,The Exhibitionist Hotel, It was suppose to be a special occasion so I paid extra for a balcony All that was different from our friends room which was a 100 less was a window ledge passed off as a balcony Which I told reception and they didn t change our room instead offered us a complimentary breakfast in our room We excepted but said we would like our breakfast with our friends After breakfast they gave us a bill when we mentioned our complimentary breakfast they were trying to decline the offer and say it was only the continental area which we wondered how we would have been able to have as room service as originally suggested They then went of to the manager Which we found embarrassing To be honest they should of gave us back the 100 they took of us for a false balcony window ledge , I really liked the artistic decor so interesting
245931,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Staff excellent couldn t do enough very warm and genuine welcome Surprise upgrade which was fantastic made our stay Room clean and very comfortable first class we really enjoyed our stay Location was fantastic close to the tube great base for visiting Chelsea and Kensington Would highly recommend and will return 
245932,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was smaller than it looked in the photos The iPad constantly froze It was frustrating , The decor was interesting The bathroom lovely The location great 
245933,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very noisy with banging of the doors most of the night The kettle didn t work unless you held the button down no quality coffee or tea Only one bottle of water The bathroom flooded from using the shower Some parts of the bathroom was dusty mirrors , Great quirky hotel staff were great Nice big room and fab location Great comfy bed and amazing shower
245934,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Small Room No chairs in room No slippers Breakfast at extra charge through booking com No bathrobes Balcony overlooking air conditioning units, Very comfortable bed Beautiful bathroom with bath tub AND shower Clean Warm Good wifi Very polite Staff
245935,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Breakfast room felt like eating in a corridor Breakfast was poor The grass lift was tacky No gym or pool The shower did not work properly There was a noise every 20minutes like machinery throughout the night, It was just ok I expected more from a hotel that claims to be a luxury Bathroom decor was nice The hotel staff were lovely 
245936,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The fire alarm went off at 12 30am for at least 10 minutes not ideal after a day of travelling and not a single word apology or explanation given from the hotel staff on the night or in the morning The plugs by the side of the bed are impossible to use since the fitted bedside table is in front of them Very warm room and air con wouldn t cool it down Room was a little too small to move around comfortably as a couple , Pleasant staff nice lobby unique place great location in a nice part of town
245937,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Noise from room above door handle to bathroom fell off room was mid floors so very confusing to find , Cosy Not bad for that part of town but prefer the Kensington Palace hotel 
245938,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Found the reception desk odd There were lots of people but it all seemed quite disorganised Staff were very pleasant though , The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was lovely modern and the towels were a good quality Nice to have some freebie snacks and the iPad In the room listing the hotel facilities was a nice touch 
245939,The Exhibitionist Hotel, N A, If you like something different then this is the place to stay Good central location friendly staff fantastic room and great cocktails We stayed in the Jimmie Martin suite as it was a special occasion Well designed clean and spacious The outdoor area has its own TV with outdoor seating We had breakfast in the room which was also very nice We look forward to staying again 
245940,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bathroom lighting very poor no mirror in bedroom supplied a hairdryer but how can you see what you re doing with it when there s no mirror iPad system of ordering room service doesn t work Was waiting 90 mins for supper to arrive and when I used the phone to find out where it was the order hadn t gone through Nowhere to put anything in bathroom so although looks very nice was not very practical , Very nice staff very good location very comfortable bed 
245941,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The small room is super small there s about a foot between the bed and the door No mirror either apart from bathroom vanity mirror, Friendly staff
245942,The Exhibitionist Hotel, separate restaurant with more comfortable seating would have been better , great location very clean and modern hotel friendly staff especially bar staff very comfortable
245943,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Booked a balcony room which was more of a ledge couldnt even stand out there on The room was smaller than our bedroom at home The room 103 was above reception so all you could hear was music until 11 and back on again first thing in the morning I was very excited for this stay and it just so wasnt what i expected I dont know how they call themselves 5 star honestly more of a 3 star Bathroom wasnt even cleaned properly no robes or slippers as promised in the intinery , The location and staff were nice 
245944,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The cleanliness of our room was disappointing the bed throw had bits all over it I found a false nail in the bathroom and the shower was dirty the head of the shower hadn t been cleaned meaning the water spouted in different directions The room was also very very small I m glad we booked into another hotel for our second nights stay couldn t manage more than one night in there , The decor was extravagant and inspiring and was definitely a welcome change to the usual bland hotel interiors The staff were fine an odd comment from the concierge whilst we were waiting for the lift diverting us to the stairs so he could go up to the next floor was a bit off standard but room service was efficient and friendly Also the cocktails were beautifully made although they took 20 minutes to be served which was off putting and we didn t drink in the bar again for fear of it making us late for our bookings 
245945,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We found somebody else s hair in our bed and were woken throughout the night by a rumbling sound even though we were on the 4th floor We brought this to the attention of the staff with little response and no resolution , Quirky hotel
245946,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Outlets next to the bed were impossible to use Bed was a bit lopsided , Location was on a quiet side street Fun concept and nice view upon first entering the room The shower was great Night staff was lovely helped me get to everywhere I wanted to go 
245947,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was slightly smaller than expected but I wouldn t fault it , Amazing hotel friendly staff very helpful Great if you re an art lover or just like unique places 
245948,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The staff were clueless Did not know what a prosecco was 1 staff on reception at night she was on the phone so we were late for our show as she was unable to order our taxi , The room and the lift
245949,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room was tired curtain hook coming off wall The room did not look like one in gallery it was next to the lift bar staff did not know the drinks they stocked I had to guide the to the bottles Returned back to find two buckets catching a large water leak in the foyer I also tripped over a large unmarked step into main reception from the stairway , The hotel decor
245950,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room a bit small but it is London Minibar would have been nice when I booked confirmation said robes slippers Not in our room there wasn t Biggest downfall for us ladies Is make up mirrors lighting Not good Also 24 hour iPad did not connect good concept if easy to use Xx, Very quirky Fabulous staff polite friendly interactive Enjoyed talking to the bar kitchen staff on the Saturday evening beautifully presented hotel A must 
245951,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Disappointed the bar was out of use all afternoon until 7pm by which point we were going out due to a kids party So we had no where to relax out of our room We could hear the screaming of the party all around the hotel The bar area seemed inappropriate for such an event anyway so not sure why it was allowed I didn t ask but no good will gesture was offered and it was a special occasion so I d chosen the hotel partly because we were going to spend some time there for an afternoon relaxing Left a sour taste unfortunately , Quirky and fun interiors very much our taste The room had a nice bathroom and comfy bed 
245952,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The pics shown online don t resemble the size of the room They are stretched to make them look larger , The staff were pleasant and so was the decor Nice shower room and very comfy bed 
245953,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We had two meals we aited ages for the first one but was tasty we prebooked the next meal because of that as we did not want to be late for our concert unfortunately it was cold but again tasty , quirky hotel very close to all attractions comfortable lounge area friendly staff Bedrooms small but luxurious Comfortable beds good linen soft towels Great bathroom nothing too much troube for the staff
245954,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Unfortunately the bar which is not run by the Hotel staff although being in the hotel weird set up cocktail was under par Had to send mine back and the remake was just as bad and went back to the bottle beer instead service at the bar was very slow and did not have a good experience , Very decent boutique type hotel Quirky and will very much recommend a stay there Decor is different but we found it amazing Excellent full english breakfast in the morning Staff were accommodating and very pleasing 
245955,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The green elevator with artificial grass covering wall to ceiling , Location was good Very close to the museums and South Ken station Very walkable to Harrods and Knightbridge A very very very different type of hotel decor 
245956,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Only one small gripe no mirror in room for make up hair Subdued lighting in bathroom was lovely but made this task very difficult , Comfortable room lovely bathroom Very helpful staff Quirky interior Location 
245957,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bar lacks atmosphere which is a real shame as it is visually very appealing Also the waitress making the cocktails we had on Friday night 21 01 16 perhaps needs a little more training as my drink really wasn t good This would by no means put me off staying again we would just not use the hotel bar , The decor is brilliantly quirky and each individual room is excellently designed The staff were fabulously friendly and helpful The location is just perfect with just a few minutes walk South Kensington tube or Knightsbridge tube ab little further up the road Also the bathroom toiletries Noble Isle are beautiful 
245958,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Tiny room like a box Hard to move around Room 105 No bath robe no slippers iPad in room was set to a different name Light above the bed fell down Directly outside the air conditioning system meant for the hotel so very noisy all night No light near mirror in bathroom so was hard for my partner to do her make up Clean and comfortable and location fantastic but very not five star and we will not be staying again ever, Location great and bed comfy
245959,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bar and restaurant looked better online We planned to eat there but decided to go out instead as it was so quiet and small The room was also smaller than expected , Nice artwork and beds looked as shown in the photos 
245960,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Myself and my boyfriend stayed for a long weekend for my 21st birthday On first impressions we were really impressed with the hotel However my boyfriend had arranged for flowers and chocolate to be in the hotel room when we arrived as it was my birthday and this wasn t done When my boyfriend asked about it the response was that they were going to do it later to which he told them not to bother as there was not much point as we were returning to our hotel very late that evening Not a massive issue but a little disappointing The next morning we were then woken up by some loud music being played somewhere in the hotel not to mention having been kept awake by the loud hum of the air conditioning even though it was switched off We also tried to order breakfast on the iPad in the room but this proved impossible as the iPad kept freezing so we gave up These may only seem like small problems but for the amount of money we paid to stay in a 5 star hotel we were disappointed When we spoke to staff about our problems they looked at us blank mindedly but told us they would log our complaints and come up with a solution for when we returned in the evening No one knew where the music was coming from nor was an attempt to find out made Upon returning there was another lady on the desk Gwen who knew absolutely nothing about our complaints No communication between staff and nothing had been done about our problems Gwen very helpful and friendly the complete opposite to her coworkers we spoke to earlier gave us a new room and told us we would be able to have complimentary breakfast the next day Not satisfied with the new room it was much smaller than the one we already had and the lock on the door was broken my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager At this point we were fed up and disappointed as we were paying a fair amount of money to stay in a supposed 5 star hotel and were most definitely not having a 5 star experience , Lovely decor quirky hotel rooms are much smaller than pictured on the website but still nice nonetheless Only staff members I would say were remotely helpful and friendly was Gwen as well as the hotel manager 
245961,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Leak from the room above which woke us up in the morning and we were unable to get ready as we didnt want the staff to fix it while we were getting ready The situation should have been compensated for all we recived was an appology for a 5 hotel I would expect more ,No Positive
245962,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Staff were generally friendly but not 5 star service seemed to lack experience to warrant The rating ie doorman kept us waiting while having a cigarette, Great location decor of the hotel was lovely comfy beds
245963,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing bad , You will most likely be staying at this hotel for the decor and atmosphere truly fantastic Staff helpfulness and friendliness to match They were kind enough to oblige when we requested to see some other rooms on checkout to give us some decorating inspiration If you can stretch to it book a suite Wow Oh and they gave us a free upgrade We will be staying again for sure 
245964,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room had a lot of wear but to be expected , Shower room location and bed were amazing and couldn t fault the staff at all they went the extra mile and really made the stay memorable 
245965,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The rooms are ridiculously tiny We booked the executive king with balcony The balcony was horrific with the only view being flat walls the room was so small that it was a struggle to actually open our suitcase around the bed For the price there are a lot better spacious rooms available in the London area The bathroom was dirty and felt like it needed a clean On the plus side the staff were extremely friendly , Not much 
245966,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, One of the best hotels I have stayed in Unique in every sense Edge funk and art A million times better than your typical 5 star hotel Homely feel as well as that X factor to it We stayed in the Squint Splash suite which was stunning with private pool and aqua tv Loved it Will be back and try another suite Highly recommend 
245967,The Exhibitionist Hotel, the room is so small It is not equal to the value of money a five star hotel room must have a minibar but they have not , the stuff was nice and friendly
245968,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I don t know where to start Firstly I would say value for Money is very poor I had to tell our breakfast waiter to blow his nose and stop him from wiping it on his sleeve as snot was running into his mouth The rooms were tiny and they didn t even make up our room on the first day or change our towels In all quite horrendous , The bed was comfortable
245969,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Night staff not so helpful Splash suit is not advertised as a basement room so we could hear everything upstairs , This hotel is incredible Quirky decor amazing rooms Lovely hotel manager Our room was incredible the splash suit exceeded my expectations and the day staff are very friendly and helpful 
245970,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Very tentative and polite staff The tablet in the room was very helpful in requesting the complementary gifts and wine recommended by the bar staff was lovely We will definitely be back 
245971,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Cost of food drinks here I know its London but a bit steep for a Northern lad like me , Style Staff Location close to tube taxis cafes shops Comfort Overall cost value
245972,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Having to leave, I was delighted with every aspect of my experience in this superb hotel as a business psychologist I have worked all over the world stayed on business extensively I will be staying here every time thank you
245973,The Exhibitionist Hotel, room much smaller then expected according to the sizes mentioned on the website room amenities slipper bathropes should be provided automaticly not upon complimentary order breakfast wasn t tasty at all Bar service is very poor and slow cocktails weren t that good bar staff needs more training our bartender had no idea what a dry martini cocktail is , the balcony was superb Room decor is modern and interesting bathroom is great
245974,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was extremely small and claustrophobic for two people I don t feel like it was worth the amount I paid for one night and wouldn t have wanted to stay any longer No mirror in the room apart from one small one in the bathroom which was too high up for me to even see into The window didn t lock and the glass shelf in the bathroom fell off the wall when I put my makeup on it Very expensive for such a room , It was quirky and in a lovely area
245975,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Travelled with friends but the place is ment more for couples only as there are no twin bed available , Nice and cozy place The staff was very courteous friendly and ready to help with anything The hotel is tastefully done 
245976,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We arrived just 40 min before the check in time and the room wasn t ready so we had to wait until the exact time of check in 2 pm Room very small No space at all not even to hang a coat or for a chair We spent there only one night and our staff was all over the place because of lack of space Wardrobe on the side of the bed not handy Also the plugs on the sides of the bed not handy impossible to plug in phone charger or anything No mirror in the room to check your dress or do hair and makeup The two mirrors in the bathroom were too dark small and high Not practical , The hall and its design The staff at the reception The design of the room The big bathroom with both shower and bath Excellent The iPad to request extra kits in the room very efficient 
245977,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We came back after the concert and had a very inexperienced bar tender He was very nice but a little untrained Also there was a very drunk man who we found still in the bar in the morning having drunk ALL night My husband witnessed him being given a double baileys when we came down for breakfast Obviously not the hotels fault his behaviour but maybe shouldn t have served him as he was then a lot of trouble Staff very apologetic , We were going to a concert at the Apollo in Hammersmith so perfect location Just by all the museums too 
245978,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, the staff was very polite I have enjoyed my stay there The location is great and even if it is in the city center it was very quiet and it was possible to sleep by open window 
245979,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Scariest elevator in history Broken three times in a five night stay Too afraid to use it The mirror in the bathroom was about a foot too high for a short lass like myself 5 and the full length mirror in the hall didn t offer decent lighting , Staff was all relatively good Great bellmen who hauled my bags up five flights of narrow dodgy stairs when the elevator was broken Other staff was relatively quiet but minded their own business which I quite like Excellent wet room shower head Not exactly eco but it was hard to leave its warmth and speaking of warmth Heated bathroom tiles is on my must have list from now on 
245980,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Our room smelt of smoke which we did not like there were 6 cleaners sitting down the stairs outside our room and we had to walk over them and our iPad or kettle did not work, I liked the overall style of the hotel and the staff were very polite
245981,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Stylish classy and a great location The suite was especially good on the top floor spacious and quiet The balconied room on the first floor was much smaller but still comfortable and well finished The design is great and I love the luxurious feel to the place Did not partake of the breakfast as it seemed an expensive extra Highly recommended hotel 
245982,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bar didn t sell beer and real men don t drink wine , Friendly helpful staff Very interesting and eclectic decor Nice toiletries Definite wow factor Lots of care and attention taken in creating a very stimulating experience 
245983,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Rooms are beautifully decorated however they are tiny and completely unworkable with luggage, Location was very convenient staff went out of their way t assist
245984,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The staff were unfriendly and they took off 150 on our credit card to cover hotel expenses which was not required and was unnecessary , The Location of the hotel 
245985,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room was cold also the floor was not levelled We was really put off by the fact we had to level 50 down payment incase we wanted anything I think that should be choice not by force , Very pretty to look at
245986,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Whilst in our room we could here everything going on in the corridor So therefor noise travailing we felt encroached on our privacy as we felt others could here us too , We pretty much liked everything The staff were lovely and very helpful and Curtis 
245987,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room had incurable plumbing noise Earplugs needed It s and art hotel but the art is Britart teenage type , Fabulous staff Giulio Simona genuine interested enthused professionals 
245988,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Not a BAD experience but could have done with a full length mirror Also the two little mirrors in the bathroom were too high for the more petite person , The staff were outstanding They would have quite literally jumped off cliffs had we asked them Faultless Oh and the bed Best night s sleep ever 
245989,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Would expect more from a 5 star hotel the room was not cleaned throughly enough when we arrived there was hair in the bath and stains of tea on the wall by the kettle even after we had put please clean my room sign on the door Also the bath didnt drain and there were no slippers or bathropes in the room when we arrived We asked for them from reception and got them for next day , Wonderfully comfortable bed and bath great location helpful staff We got a room according to our special requests which was nice 
245990,The Exhibitionist Hotel, This hotel is a sad example for style over function While it makes a stunning first impression the rooms lack in usability no plugs in kitchenette to make tea no shelf near sink to put my cosmetics no towel rail beside washbasins The sofas look great but are uncomfortable The I pad cable was fixed to the I pad and to short to comfortably use the pad in bed One had to unplug the item to use it Then it became a difficult job to plug it back in since the socket was behind a wall crevice , Very friendly staff Interesting decor splendid location
245991,The Exhibitionist Hotel, They tried to put me in a very small room without a balcony Luckily I had the print off of my booking via booking com which stated a room with a balcony bath shower I was disappointed not to find a refrigerator or iron in the room , Decor is fantastic Staff are friendly Bed was extremely comfy Room with balcony is well worth the money 
245992,The Exhibitionist Hotel, however the staff were rude they gave me the impression they didn t think I was good enough to be there The room was ok but had a hideous air freshener which couldn t be found think it may have been through the air con the balcony that we paid extra for was also pointless as it looked out onto a wall and the plug in the bath didn t work so the stagnant water sat there for the following 12 hours , The hotel was trendy well placed and had some good ideas in terms of what it could be 
245993,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Shower didn t drain and leaked all over the bathroom floor and staff on check out just thanked us for letting them know , Room was ready so checked in early and had a 1pm check out too 
245994,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Concidering the amount of effort put into the look of the hotel you would expect the little things to be right for example freyed carpet coming out of the grip the fact the shower doors open inwards and flood the room when the showers on and the drinks prices are to be desired for the 2 drinks I had I could have bought the bottle, The hotel was very stylish and we ll situated staff were friendly
245995,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We planned to eat before heading to the theatre but were told no food was available even though we had enquired that very afternoon We returned from our evening for a nightcap however couldnt relax as on our second drink we were handed the bill and told the bar had closed at 11pm Considering being charged 2 50 per drink for service we didnt feel we had good service when you cant relax Felt rushed We asked for snacks and recieved a small bowl of crisps only to be told they had run out when we asked for more The room as lovely as it was had no mirror other than in the bathroom which made getting ready awkward , Emaculate and funky a real treat from the conventional hotel stay due to the decor The room and bathroom were small but stunning and so we felt so comfortable 
245996,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The hotel staff argued about having received payment and were proven totally incorrect no apology even when it was their accounts mistake not ours Not impressed , The area the hotel was situated in
245997,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, We only went for one night an even though it was a lot of money it was well worth it The staff were very friendly an helpful and the room was lovely They even turned down the bed for us by the time we came back on the night Will stay again for sure
245998,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The bar had to turn off the music after 11 to respects the neighboirs preace not too bad but could have been nicer if sound proof layer was installed , Hidden jem in great location very clean and friendly Modern art compliments the interiors 
245999,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Rooms are too small the noise throughout the hotel lifts doors etc can be heard throughout the night breakfast was pretty expensive for what you get , Location decor and staff are all positives
246000,The Exhibitionist Hotel, They said the bar was closed at around 11pm but you could still order beer or wine Didn t bother us but strange you could only order certain drinks Barman on this particular evening didn t seem to have much of a clue what he was doing to be honest However by no means an issue and didn t detract from a lovely stay , Location was fantastic and the reception staff couldn t have been any more helpful Enjoyed the boutique quirky feel about the hotel 
246001,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Loved the quirkiness of the hotel and our room was large with a balcony Staff were great and good luck to the charming and helpful young chap who had only worked there 4 days 
246002,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely charming reception staff dressed up for Halloween in a ghoulish way which was very amusing Quiet comfortable room lovely big bathroom with bath and separate shower Tea and coffee making facilities included decaff coffee shower cap in bathroom Everything was perfect 
246003,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Balcony had no view Room was very small There was no mirror apart from in the bathroom so nowhere to dry hair I found this extremely annoying and would not stay at this hotel again because of this Clearly designed by a man , The bathroom was lovely and the bed very comfortable The decor was entertaining and different 
246004,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The staff were not helpful and in fact were quite rude and did not seem over interested in our stay with them The breakfast was over priced and with good local facilities nearby I would eat there Another guest appeared to be having a party with several people and what sounded like escorts didn t think this was that sort of hotel this went on at least until 2am The shower and light needed a good clean , Loved the art The room was nicely decorated 
246005,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Me 27 and my girlfriend 24 stayed for 2 nights beginning of the week Inside of the hotel is amazing art everywhere clean and completely different to anywhere I ve stayed before We stayed in the cheapest room still enough room for us both with water tea etc The staff were really friendly and helpful booking us taxis on so on Amazing location 5 min walk from the tube 1 min walk to national history museum 10 min walk to Harrods 
246006,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Tiny rooms couldn t work as the desk was was small small and confusing bathroom facilities took a while to figure out how to manipulate the top shower no dedicated breakfast room breakfast is served in the ground floor reception area next to the staircase , Great location reasonable price
246007,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There is no fridge in the room , Each room is different and has a really unique and memorable theme The public areas are always changing due to art installations 
246008,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Would have liked an extra room key given the price paid for the room , Perfect for location and the room was so comfortable best sleep I ever had ato a hotel The quirkiness of the hotel and the access to a balcony made the trip very enjoyable 
246009,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The mirrors in the room weren t particularly practical when trying to get ready but not a real problem at all , We stayed in the trash city room which was a complete novelty It was a true luxury stay and the staff were helpful and even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine A real 5 star experience 
246010,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Issues with the speakers in the bar and reception below our room found sleeping difficult we were in room 103 might be alright everywhere else Didn t have breakfast so can t rate it , We were attending an event at The Science Museum the location was excellent 
246011,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No hot water having to have a cold shower told the staff but didn t seem all that interested Staff then wen ton to tell me the boiler had broken down which would have been nice to know when I checked in the hour earlier No discount offered either, Locations was good good restaurants near by
246012,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Tiny room signature luxury double room with balcony breakfast variety could have been much more extended from what we noticed as our booking deal did not include breakfast elevator walls could have been dressed with full mirrors instead of green grass wallpaper for this kind of room price should have been less than 300 per night, Very clean room seemed almost brand new fantastic bathroom comfy enough convenient location few minutes away from S Kensington tube station piccadilly line exceptional staff
246013,The Exhibitionist Hotel, It s certainly not a boutique hotel the staff were of the quality of a one or two star hotel Definitely not good value for money One of the members of staff suggested that a breakfast in opportune as they only have five tables for 39 rooms The porter on arrival said give me bag not please can I take your bag ,No Positive
246014,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The cocktails we had were not the best more like a mix rather than a real cocktail , Absolutely loved the decor and quirkiness of the selection of art and lighting in the hotel Our room was great lovely comfy bed with fantastic bedding Lovely shower as well Perfect location for a night s rest before a long haul trip 
246015,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Sometimes the staff were a little too casual and not very accommodating My friend asked if check out could be extended for 1 2hr and was told absolutely not After staying there for 3 nights it did not seem to be an unreasonable request for a Monday check out , I loved the location and small intimate size of the hotel it almost felt like I was staying at a very cool friends place The bar area was an easy place to relax and have a drink or at other times of the day a cup of tea Music there was always good and the artwork fun funky 
246016,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Slight Expensive for such size of rooms price isn t including Breakfast Very small Hotel and rooms very hard to Move in the room Cleaning service isn t for 5 Starts hotel Needs to ask for Bath Robe and stuff in the bathroom which weren t refreshed , Attractive location Near the Tube and Chelsea and out of the heart of London Very clean good staff 
246017,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The only drawback of the stay was that the room door had nearly no sound insulation so you could hear everything happening outside as if it was going on in your room Earplugs may be necessary , Great location near South Kensington tube station and the museums and very friendly and competent staff We had some very interesting drinks at the Abstract bar Overall the hotel is very pretty and nice 
246018,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Ordered champagne to be in the room for when we arrived back as it was my parters birthday ordered this at reception and Was assured it would be done but it was not so not happy ,No Positive
246019,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was perhaps not as big as I was expecting We had about two feet each side of the bed Breakfast was nice but uninspiring Claims of there being a cooked breakfast option seemed not to materialise while very trendy looking staff stood about not discernibly doing anything As alluded to in the positives the staff were very friendly but in the case of the bar staff it was a bit much When we got back from the show we wanted to have a quiet drink together before bed We ended up having a long and not terribly interesting conversation with a barman who came and joined us on the sofa and failed to pick up normal social cues Right anyway followed by turning to face my wife that sort of thing , We used the hotel as a base for a show at the Albert Hall The location is superb 10 minute from the hall and that walk involves going past the Natural History and Science Museums and is an easy walk to Hyde Park The building is lovely and the d cor is very quirky and original The room was beautifully decorated and there were lots of lovely touches The staff were all helpful and friendly perhaps excessively so in one case 
246020,The Exhibitionist Hotel, small room dirty water tap in the bathtub toilet seat not attached properly to the toilet water temperature in the shower was random stain on the bed cover no chair in the room lights in the bathroom falling to its low setting on its own so little light in the bathroom, The big bed the artwork the location mainly
246021,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The only down side is that you have to pay 50 00 on your card as a security for breakages etc Did not like this as it is actually taken then it is returned a few days later depending on your bank And you are not made aware of this when booking hotel, We had a Balcony it was very quirky and would deffo love to stay again 
246022,The Exhibitionist Hotel, This was our return booking to this hotel for 5 nights altogether On checking the receptionist s paper work we saw the management tried to trick us in giving us a smaller room than the one booked We booked Signature Luxury room They made a big fuss with smiles of fixing it when they were exposed Then they proceeded to give us the same size small room This was unacceptable behaviour for a supposed 5 star hotel When we did not accept the room after seeing it we were finally allocated the correct room We could have been fooled if we had not stayed there before Also the two persons lift was hopelessly slow and small for taking luggage to the room , Good wifi reception Loved the art work 
246023,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I do not like the service in hotel No internet in the hotel for2 days which effect on my work Each room has IPad but in my room was damaged and when I informed them they not replace with other one just took it No mirror at all in the room So I have to go Bathroom to look at mirror Never ever booked in this hotel ,No Positive
246024,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very very small room even though we were expecting it Good bathroom , The great location easy stroll to museums and metro station Beautiful bed linen and the most comfortable bed 
246025,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing , Quirky great art and sculpture excellent and helpful staff plumptious big beds with lovely sheets and pillows great bathrooms good b fast and superb for Royal Albert Hall We ll be back and highly recommend 
246026,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Incredibly cool and clean and a fascinating and fun hotel to stay in Great value for money in the area If you want to avoid huge corporate hotels and like something different this is the place for you Amazing art on every wall I will order a bigger room next time but that is personal choice 
246027,The Exhibitionist Hotel, A panel that was meant to be on the ceiling was on the side of the hot tub when I arrived, I upgraded my room from ultimate with balcony to the drop dead gorgeous splash suite The room was beautiful and the private hot tub was a great addition
246028,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The room was a little small and we ordered an ironing board iron through the in room iPad service but they didn t arrive , Feel of hotel and friendliness of staff were great Bathroom was good Room clean Nice idea of having an iPad in the room through which you could order things 
246029,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing, One of the best boutique hotels in London We liked a lot interior especially the bathrooms The hotel has a bar with exquisite drinks which you can order to the room Another great thing is the apple tablet in every room where you can order anything from the bath robe to the whole dinner completely remotely without needing to call the reception 
246030,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I liked every thing about the hotel, Very whimsical and funky but excellent quality facilities The AstroTurf in the elevator is particularly amusing 
246031,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Bedroom although comfortable was far to small it was difficult to move around the room without hitting the bed Room service was very slow and returned to collect plates an half hour later which was 1am in the morning , Central Location 
246032,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Room feels claustrophobic problems with bathtub quickly fixed and hot water had to wait over night , Excellent location very friendly and helpful staff very modern feel
246033,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Had an issue with the hot water at night it was being looked at But had hot water in the mornings so we showered in the mornings instead , D cor fantastic Clean and comfortable Close to Harrods and the Natural Science Museum Very different themes 
246034,The Exhibitionist Hotel, At lunch I found a foreign object in my Caesar Salad I believe it to be either a piece of fingernail or white plastic food packaging The chef apologised and told me it was a piece of wood but changed his mind when challenged Irrespective of what it was it shouldn t have been in my lunch which I was enjoying up to that point Additionally the hotel ran out of hot water around 7 o clock resulting in a cold shower before going out for the night no manager to report problem to and receptionist not really interested The issue was fixed by the morning and my lunch was refunded I raised these issues at check out and the hotel were proactive in refunding me half my bill I felt that this was about right , Good location and some nice quirky touches around the hotel In general the staff were pleasant and helpful In my opinion the service was OK rather than what you receive at a 5 star hotel which is the market they are aiming at Things like room service was quick and efficient but had the room been sufficiently stocked in the first instance toiletries robes etc then the call would not have been necessary The room was modern and reasonably well equipped but very small 
246035,The Exhibitionist Hotel, There wasn t a full length or even large mirror in the room or hallway , Walking distance to sth Kensington station also nice walk to Sloane sq high street Staff very attentive
246036,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The hot water didn t work when we got there and no good will or compensation was offered other than 50 if we stayed in the hotel again Wardrobe doors couldn t be opened without climbing over the bed Room was very very small with hardly any room and unable to walk around the bed once the ironing board was setup Staff were not very understanding and a little arrogant and rude My last email and voicemail was simply ignored and left with no response which is a sure sign of the customer service we experienced , The location was good and there was interesting interior design
246037,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Staff not very helpful or friendly a lot of banging from the room above us and staff didn t say anything when we complained about it , hotel was amazing and stunning bedroom
246038,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Technical problems caused us to be upgraded suite was huge but decorated in a unique way which my GF was not comfortable with Staff was generally friendly and helpful although the maintenance man took our room key out of the power slot while my GF was in the room and we had to get a new one at the desk , Great location Sizable room Good amenities Lobby bar was nice Terrace was a plus 
246039,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Had no plug socket next to the mirror so could not plug in a hairdryer or straighteners to do my hair Had to ask for an extension lead but the reception had none available After several phone calls they borrowed one from another hotel I think that a plug socket next to a bedroom mirror is a basic thing to have especially in an hotel , The position of the hotel was great a 2 mins walk from the underground The room and bathroom was excellent very nicely decorated 
246040,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Just don t go the extra mile Basics in the room no minibar iron etc, Boutique Hotel with good sized rooms Quirky bar Close to transportation
246041,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Check out in the morning could of been better The male receptionist took 3 calls and was not paying attention to the guests in front of him which unfortunately was me , Very classy exquisitely decorated and exactly what you expect 
246042,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Lack of good coffee making facilities in room Similar boutique hotels would offer e g Nespresso or coffee press at least Tubes of Nescafe does not cut it , Fun quirky design
246043,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The information on the Ipad are not updated Slippers are not being provided I have not brought mine since slippers are included on the amenities list As a matter of fact I have asked for the item on my check in day but unluckily the staff told me that they are running out of stock The door of the shower stall cannot be closed As a result the water kept coming out to the washroom after every shower thus making the floor wet In fact I have reported this issue to the receptionist on the second day of my stay but such problem has not yet been fixed on my check out date I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights in total , The location of the hotel is very convenient The staff are friendly 
246044,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Personalized room scent offered on check in never delivered Turn down only 1 night of 4 Shower overflowed on first day initial response is they would fix it after we checked our four days later Dirty cleaning rags left in bathroom Wet smelly carpet the entire stay due to shower not draining Bathroom not properly cleaned the entire stay 5 star price 2 star service, Location was great Layout of of room was very nice 
246045,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Lack of soundproofing Bathroom was not very clean My king room was very small Elevator requires a rethink too tiny , Location decor Staff was friendly 
246046,The Exhibitionist Hotel,No Negative, Due to a minor issue with the room we booked we were up graded to a far better room than our original very comfortable room which we were very grateful for The entire hotel is very well presented with some very impressive contemporary art pieces A complete joy 
246047,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The lighting in the bathroom wasn t brilliant for putting makeup on But that s personal choice, As a female travelling in my own the evening reception staff were very kind and consider 
246048,The Exhibitionist Hotel, I can t say there was anything I didn t like to be honest , I like the whole decor and individual style of the hotel I prefer to stay at boutique hotels rather than the larger chain groups 
246049,The Exhibitionist Hotel, We only bumped into a few disappointments I felt it could have been made clear beforehand that we would have to pay a 50 deposit on arrival for we hadn t expected this when checking in We would recommend they have irons in every room to save calling reception to find there isn t one available It would have been nice if the fire alarm hadn t gone off admittedly not too early and we didn t have to leave our room and even nicer if they apologised for the inconvenience Other than these little glitches it was flawless , We absolutely adored the design of the hotel It was clean and comfortable with really friendly staff to help you The bedroom was stunning and we loved our little balcony which had a table for 2 I was delighted that the bathroom had both a bath and a shower had seen this when I booked but couldn t quite believe it as finding this in London for a reasonable price is especially difficult The bath was brilliant and the shower superb even the toiletries were a little treat On top of this I felt that the location couldn t be beaten It s a 5 minute walk from the tube station which means it s close enough for a comfortable walk but distant enough to be away from too much noise We really loved our stay and would recommend the hotel without hesitation 
246050,The Exhibitionist Hotel, On the negative side the reception service was below what is expected of a 4 5 star hotel eg phoned for help with luggage on check out but none arrived and when we struggled downstairs with our luggage the luggage guy was in reception and hadn t been told by reception to help us Also needed a print out of the receipt on checkout but the printer wasn t working so we were told that it would be emailed through by reception in 5 minutes but a day later and still no sign , On the positive side funky design and good location for some of the main tourist sites 
246051,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The noisy AC unit on the balcony next to ours that woke me up numerous times the dangerous cupboard light with bodged connection also that upon arriving to the room there wasn t any toilet paper I also do not like that I emailed the hotel to raise these issues and they haven t responded it s not good enough Avoid, The decoration
246052,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Glad I didn t have my children with us as artwork in main areas wouldn t have been suitable for their eyes Staff weren t great when there was a problem Very small room , Good location comfy bed 
246053,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Very compact room Tiny lift , Exactly where we wanted to be near the Museums And right on the tube line directly to the airport Wi Fi excellent Staff helpful Fun games to play in the lift 
246054,The Exhibitionist Hotel, No bath robe and slippers but everything else was fantastic and was very satisfactory Ticked all the pleasure boxes would stay again , The quality of the rooms is fantastic and the quirky twists like the astro turf lift and the abstract art placed around the hotel just made it all the more pleasing to each glance while wondering through the hotel 
246055,The Exhibitionist Hotel, SLIPPERY ENTRANCE STAIRS WHEN WET, ARTY STYLE WITH ALL MOD CONS BRAND NEW HOTEL VERY PLEASANT STAFF ACCESS TO NEARBY GYM SHOULD BE NEGOCIATED BY MANAGEMENT
246056,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Nothing, Staff were fantastic and polite the hotel itself is clean and very nice with the art and sculptures around The room we were in was lovely big flat screen TV and iPad with hotel and local info great touch Big bath and separate waterfall shower and one very comfortable bed Great hotel and will definitely return hopefully to the jacuzzi suit as that looks awesome 
246057,The Exhibitionist Hotel, The Internet connection can be better the elevator doesn t reach all floors , The location is amazing Very close to a tube station and to plenty of bars The staff was extremely helpful and very nice The Internet connection was OK There s coffee and tea facilities in the room with fresh supply every day 
246058,The Exhibitionist Hotel, Far from discrete desk check in person Upgraded room but despite asking for quiet room the air con units outside the room were very noisy at night , Unique hotel art
