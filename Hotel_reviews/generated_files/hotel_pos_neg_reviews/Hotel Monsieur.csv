225492,Hotel Monsieur, Choice of teas in the room was unusual However I am certain we would have got plain black tea if we d asked The hotel is not cheap but it is in an excellent area and very high quality , Very comfortable Quiet room with quiet aircon important with a temperature of 34 outside Fabulous shower 
225493,Hotel Monsieur, While the room was no more than 150 square feet occupied mostly by the king sized bed the most upsetting situation I experienced was with a front desk person on duty Thursday 6 22 17 at around 5 pm who treated me in the most disrespectful of ways I arrived after a very hot days work at the Paris Air Show in need of cold water When I asked this person for ice he said the hotel had no ice and if I wanted some to go buy it I told him that the night before the attendant kindly gave me ice from a back room in the breakfast area which he dismissed condescendingly insinuating I wasn t telling the truth One upsetting experience unfortunately overshadows the other people and effort made by the hotel to be a welcoming place , The 2 or 3 front desk attendants I interacted with provided good customer service except for one of them The room was impeccably clean the bathroom very well appointed the bed and bedding very comfortable and the air conditioner worked like a charm perhaps the most valued feature during my stay For Paris the location is average although a 1 km walk to the Concorde plaza I recall Daniel treating me very well and being appalled by the taxi driver that charged me 110 euros to drive me from CDG airport to the hotel when the going rates is 55 euros 
225494,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing, Staff was amazing in assisting us with a few issues from the get go Super friendly and really welcoming Rooms were typical European size however both location and views from the balcony were amazing Very Parisian experience 
225495,Hotel Monsieur, Some extra tea bags would have been good, Great room and terrace especially in the sunny weather Great location Excellent staff Visit was very good we didn t try breakfast as we wanted to experience Paris but breakfast room looked good Location was perfect for us as we were exploring with easy access to Metro Great selection of bars and brasseries near by 
225496,Hotel Monsieur, There wasn t a patisserie in the immediate vicinity which always makes mornings that much more enjoyable They had a breakfast but we like to enjoy the streets and scenes of Paris instead of lingering onsite , The room and bathroom are a great size including the shower Very cute design throughout hotel Service was very attentive hard working and consistent Room had a beautiful Parisian window that you dream of having There were no stale smells and the air conditioning worked great in the room 
225497,Hotel Monsieur, it was a little bit noisy because of the street when we came to the breakfast room at 10 o clock it was no more food left and just one girl was trying to serve the people we were just standing and waiting for plates glasses cups juices more food all tables were still with dirty dishes I think the distribution of work must be done better , It was a beautiful very cozy comfortable and newly renovated hotel Very good location just 20 min walk from Champs Alize nice staff and very clean The girl in the reception was very friendly and organized Good breakfast We would like to come here again and we will recommend Hotel Monsieur to our friends 
225498,Hotel Monsieur, The breakfast room was a little snug , The hotel staff were very professional friendly and helpful The hotel was immaculate The free wifi was a bonus and the honesty bar is a lovely way for the hotel to make the guest feel like they are really valued and trusted 
225499,Hotel Monsieur, THE INTERNET AT THE ROOM WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLU, THE LADIES WORKING AT THE BREAKFAST WERE VERY KIND ALSO THE GUYS AT THE RECEPTION WERE VERY FRIENDLY 
225500,Hotel Monsieur, The heat AC was not really on point we were always either really hot or really cold The service was not great either One night we came back to the hotel around 3 30am and had to ring the bell 3 times I even had time to look for the hotel s number and start calling when the half asleep security person apologetically opened the door At check out the person was super awkward and took forever to call a cab and give me my bill He also put any room number when calling in the cab which charged us 7 Euros for pre booking should start considering Uber p which made for more awkwardness when the driver had to come in and ask the clerk with the counter running cause he didn t believe the cab was for us All in all it was our best hotel experience so far in Paris just could use better staff , The rooms are very well appointed large by Paris standards The bathroom is big well lit with a perfect shower The bed is comfy and we had a nice view All in all it was our best hotel experience so far in Paris just could use better staff 
225501,Hotel Monsieur, Bathroom was a little chilly and as with a lot of modern hotels the towel rail was right about the toilet which doesn t seem like a good plan , Smart modern and well appointed Boutique hotel with limited facilities but in a busy business district of Paris has everything needed for a short stay 
225502,Hotel Monsieur, Only 5 day stay , The Rooms and Bathrooms were nicely decorated High Definition TV Free wi fi worked really well The staff were very friendly and accommodating The location of the Hotel was perfect for shopping and site seeing Security Room for luggage as our flight left later in the day I chose it because of its high rating and I have to say it lives up to its reputation Book with confidence 
225503,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Well located in the centre of Paris Very comfortable The staff is very attentive and friendly Some of them even speak my language too Portuguese so they made me feel at home 
225504,Hotel Monsieur, Only a minor complaint but couldnt control the temperature in the room which was quite warm at night Only nitpicking in an otherwise excellent stay, Staff were wonderful and helpful even offering room service breakfast at no extra charge Room was spacious luxurious and the bed was fantastic All in all a v good hotel
225505,Hotel Monsieur, 1 bad air conditioning no air movement It would be bad if it is summer cuz the room is stuffy 2 we are told by the receptionist on duty that we need to pay 5 euro if we use hotel printer to print over 20 pages But the Tunisian receptionist told us next day that it was free of charge Hope the hotel can have a uniform rate card to avoid confusion and keep your good reputation, 1 The room is tidy Hotel staff are nice most of whom can speak English freely Nice location The Tunisian receptionist is fantastic 
225506,Hotel Monsieur, 1 bad air conditioning no air movement It would be bad if it is summer cuz the room is stuffy 2 we are told by the receptionist on duty that we need to pay 5 euro if we use hotel printer to print over 20 pages But the Tunisian receptionist told us next day that it was free of charge Hope the hotel can have a uniform rate card to avoid confusion and keep your good reputation, 1 The room is tidy Hotel staff are nice most of whom can speak English freely Nice location The Tunisian receptionist is fantastic 
225507,Hotel Monsieur, perhaps typical for Paris but slightly high prices the location introduces difficulties insane prices for parking if came by car , comfortable bed very central location friendly helpful staff room is well decorated 
225508,Hotel Monsieur, no, 5 minutes walk to metro station st augustin which takes you to almost everywhere in town 15 minutes walk to galaries lafayette and printemps location is perfect for tourist room is clean and bed is comfortable ladies in reception spoke very good English with great attitude will recommend to friends 
225509,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Monsieur The location was so central and close to attractions yet removed enough to make you still feel like you re in a local area The rooms were incredibly spacious not at all what we were expecting given past stays in tiny European hotel rooms and the decor alternates from one room to another guaranteeing a truly boutique and artsy experience We loved the breakfast and the bespoke teas left in our room every evening Definitely a fabulous spot to enjoy a Parisian vacation felt super upscale an chic without breaking the bank 
225510,Hotel Monsieur, I didn t love that there was no carpet on the floor of our hotel room It would have benefitted from an area rug , The hotel was very clean and quiet 
225511,Hotel Monsieur, bathroom was a little bit smelly out of the sink they made a photo copy of my passport and of the credit card some days later people form France tried to use my credit card for orders in the internet, good location and good value
225512,Hotel Monsieur, The queen size bed is made by combining two twin sized beds So I could only sleep without fully stretching my legs and arms as there s a gap between them This is the one and only flaw , I love the great street views outside my windows Giving me the feeling of Living in a central Paris neighborhood Great location 5 min walk to the metro leading you everywhere I even walked to the louvre stopped at a cafe to add more fun 
225513,Hotel Monsieur, Breakfast was very minimal If I were to stay here again I would definitely have breakfast at one of the nearby cafe s , The deluxe double was small but perfect The location is fantastic for getting around the sights 
225514,Hotel Monsieur, Very simple decoration nothing luxurious , Small but comfortable beds and good shower in rooms Receptionist mr Danielle and another girl are the kindest of paris
225515,Hotel Monsieur, Took a few days to get our bearings to find the hotel again Some residents had no idea where Rue Des Mathurins was located , Location was good quiet street running parallel to the big Hausmann boulevard with shops restaurants Gare St Lazare two blocks away Has a Turkish steam bath able to reserve for private visits but very hot With shower next to it exercise equipment next to that One reception person was very helpful in guidance to places about the city and very interested in our experiences 
225516,Hotel Monsieur, man on reception has ruined impression of our dream weekend in Paris he is under trained impolite and rude man on the reception copied my credit card without my permission and compromise security of my bank account and refused to hand over copy to me when I requested it Instead he started to argue with me stating that he knows that he doesn t have permission to copy my credit card but he doesn t care about that and that I can write an email to hotel if I want to complain on him I requested for his superior but non was present at the hotel during the day on Saturday I have given phone number and I had spent time trying to reach superior on the phone I had to cancel my my credit card which left me only cash option to paying expenses during our dream weekend in Paris Hotel was unable to accomodate us at check in time 14 oclock we had to return one hour latter 15 oclock all stated is unacceptable for 4 star hotel in Paris, Room is big enough terrace is nice They offered me a refund of expenses for new credit card I had to cancel my credit card because a man who has worked temporary on reception made a copy of my credit card without permission and refused to hand it over to me when I requested it Hotel allow us late check out for one hour 13 oclock 
225517,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, The staff was wonderfully kind smiley and helpful Comfy bed lovely terrace nice shower The room was small but you d expect that in Paris nicely decorated and cosy Perfect location very central and nice area but rooms are still very quiet Breakfast was really good don t expect a massive choice of dishes very good quality products less is more in that case All in all very good value for money especially for Paris 
225518,Hotel Monsieur, Room has a dark decor but is still very pleasant and it is easy to hear neighboring guest through the walls , Hotel was very nice and clean Bathroom was exceptionally clean and staff was very friendly and helpful Sarah and the young lady that checked us in on the 17th around 1600 was very helpful They were very knowledgeable about the area and spoke perfect English Hotel is in excellent location only 15 minute walk to the Opera house and 25 minute walk to the Louvre Thank you for a memorable vacation 
225519,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, The staff made this hotel They were the best I have ever encountered for helpfulness friendliness and thoughtfulness I will be coming back on this basis I loved the fact that it had 24 hour service and someone was on the desk Made me feel safe and special 
225520,Hotel Monsieur, Staff was not knowledgeable about restaurants and places to go Breakfast server was very nice and hospitable , Comfortable room and great continental breakfast 
225521,Hotel Monsieur, I can t think of anything The cost of food maybe but that s Paris for you Ooh actually their shampoo isn t too great if you have long hair like myself as it leaves it tangled and the body lotion smells awful Really really bad But they are small things and didn t affect my stay at all I would still go back , The bed was comfortable and no Matter what time of day it was with the curtains closed it was pitch black Best blackout curtains ever The complimentary cake and drinks each day was a lovely touch also The staff were ever so kind and went above and beyond The location was perfect we walked everywhere and it was super quiet for a city Can t complain The maid cleaned up when we popped out briefly even after we had spent all afternoon in the room We didn t expect that at all we didn t require it but she still did it and the cleaning products they use make the bathroom sparkle It was super clean You can have the hammam to yourself too which is great for privacy 
225522,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing Fabulous , Beautiful boutique hotel in the middle of Paris Excellent rooms fitted out with quality items Easy access to taxis and the metro Quiet safe location 
225523,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing Everything was perfect , The bed was extra comfy AC was good Staff service was amazing super friendly and helpful Would definitely stay again in this hotel in my next visit Hotel location is amazing Price is good As a family we all had a great experience in this trip 
225524,Hotel Monsieur, Rooms were a little small bar breakfast area was cramped when busy, Great location 10 min walk to champs elysees and place de la Concorde 2 min to the Metro very helpful staff
225525,Hotel Monsieur, some stuff r not well trained I was interupted 2 times when I tried to asked a yes no question which took me 30ish minutes to get the answer because the stuff was kept servering new coming customers and left me waiting tourist info Some stuff have no idea about Disneyland special offers No sauna Only steaming room breakfast has less protein room is small and no place to move around feeling stressful, near metro station
225526,Hotel Monsieur, A man at the desk asked us if we had taken the riverboat ride on the Seine and strongly suggested we buy tickets from him for 15 Euros a piece We told him we had family at another hotel and needed to check with them He became a little too insistent for my comfort trying to sell us tickets for everyone We did go on the cruise and enjoyed it but our family bought the tickets from their hotel for 10 Euros per person , We were able to check in early which we so appreciated since we flew all night and were anxious to freshen up The hotel was near the train station Gare St Lazare where we took a train ride to Normandy Our room was lovely and nicely air conditioned which was most appreciated as it was extremely hot during our stay in Paris We had a lovely little balcony as well as a modern bathroom with a hair dryer and magnified mirror The neighborhood had everything we needed and was in a very safe neighborhood as we walked back from the train station after 10 30 pm The ladies at the desk were most helpful 
225527,Hotel Monsieur, Rooms a little warm and air conditioning unit a little difficult to work out , Good location with friendly and helpful staff Large comfy bed and excellent shower bathroom facilities 
225528,Hotel Monsieur, No parking associated with the hotel so had to find our own , We had spacious accommodation in the quadruple room which was clean and very modern and comfortable There was privacy between the two rooms and two bathrooms which was fantastic 
225529,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing, Excellent in just about every sense Staff were really helpful with everything from booking Taxi s to directions to the local metro and the quickest way to all the sights Some have said that the rooms are on the small side i wouldn t disagree but they are more than ample Bonus is it is only a few minutes walk to St Augustine Metro station
225530,Hotel Monsieur, Only thing we found a little disconcerting was handing the room key over and picking it back up when we returned each time we left the room , My wife had plates in her ankle and they were very accommodating by giving us a room with a walk in shower Staff were excellent and very friendly Well located to the Metro 
225531,Hotel Monsieur, There was very little wrong with our stay For our room we could have done with some plugs by our bed and possibly a tour map of the city upon arrival , The hotel was in the perfect location and upon arrival the staff were very friendly Our room was lovely and the little touches made the stay even better 
225532,Hotel Monsieur, It is full when I come back next time , The more I stayed there the more I like this place Staff was so friendly Good location Very comfortable bed and pillow Nothing more I want from this hotel 
225533,Hotel Monsieur, Everything OK, Everything amazing staff super kind and helpful Great service and location Super quiet to sleep and all brand new stuff Amazing shower and bed comfort 
225534,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, The location is good however the price is a little bit high for 4 star hotel staff was great they were so helpfull especially Fabio is so much fun love to talk to him at the reception
225535,Hotel Monsieur, There really wasn t anything that stood out , The staff was fantastic We were very tired travelers trying to navigate Paris and they not only got us into our room on time but was incredibly helpful in the next steps in our journey Regardless of our plan we will be staying here any time we come to Paris in the future 
225536,Hotel Monsieur, The map directions we were given were not as clear as they could have been We got lost a lot , Breakfast was fabulous varied bed was extra comfy bathroom immaculate 
225537,Hotel Monsieur, the breakfast area was small the price value of rooms is expensive copmaring with hotel web site, very good location near shopping malls nice and helpful staff clean room and comfortable bed new furniture 
225538,Hotel Monsieur, Another guest always slam the door in the morning Not only slamming the door they were talking so loud outside there room So rude Guest room number 104 when I was there 14 17 6 16 , Staff was so nice I ll go back there when I m going to Paris So in love with this place 
225539,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, We loved the staff they were so welcoming and spoke very good english The room was really beautiful We were so happy that we were able to store our bags in the Hotel on the last day so we didn t have to carry them around Paris We would definitely stay here again 
225540,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, This hotel features excellent staff and cleanly modern accommodations The breakfast was perfect to start the day off with fresh croissants breads fruit salad coffee and juices This is an excellent location from which to head out for shopping and to see the sites of Paris 
225541,Hotel Monsieur, The room was a bit small well this is Paris so we we rent really expecting big rooms We had to wait 10 minutes for a free table in the breakfast room , The staff is extremely nice and welcoming and were eager to help I was pinching myself if this is really France The rooms are nicely renovated Free coffee cake every afternoon Honesty bar in the evenings 
225542,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Very compact in the Paris style but tasteful and comfortable Helpful staff good wifi excellent breakfast of fresh fruit croissants and strong coffee among many choices Amazing location classy neighborhood on the Right Bank new to us and convenient to everything What a bonus to have a stream room and tiny gym in the lower level very relaxing after a day of sightseeing Good fund We will retrun 
225543,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Central location walking distance to all main attractions very helpful and friendly personnel spacey quiet room comfortable bed modern bathroom with a lot of light coming from a large window
225544,Hotel Monsieur, nothing to dislike Maybe the limited variety of drinks in both bar and mini bar but with so many pubs bars and restaurants in the neighborhood this is not a dissatisfier , Very good location nice design excellent bed quiet room at the back of the hotel with even a small balcony Superb small bathroom with incredible spacious shower 
225545,Hotel Monsieur, The breakfast was brilliant with lots of choice The only down side was the eating area was quite small and the waitress who seated us sat us with another couple which made us rather uncomfortable , Daniel the concierge was really helpful and friendly Our room was beautiful All the major sights were within easy reach 
225546,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Lovely accommodations Clean friendly and very gracious employees Daniele front desk was extremely kind and helpful We will definitely stay here again as well as advise friends needing a place to stay in Paris 
225547,Hotel Monsieur, Breakfast service was slow and too many confusing buttons with the lights that s all, The room was lovely and spacious mattress and pillows so comfortable and I loved the en suite The staff were incredibly helpful

225549,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing to complain about , Very nice atmosphere super friendly staff Clean fresh chic and quiet Close to the opera and the department stores but also on a walking distance from Rue Saint Honore and lots of good connections to the rest of the city Loved my stay and would definitely recommend it to others I went to visit a friend and also to participate in the Paris Marathon which the hotel is perfectly situated for a 4 min trip on the RER or a easy 1 5 km warm up walk to the start line 
225550,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, I thought this hotel was excellent The room was very clean with nice decor and the staff were friendly I also really liked the shower We didn t eat at the hotel so can t comment on the food We stayed over Easter and they had an Easter egg hunt for kids which was a nice touch 
225551,Hotel Monsieur, it would be better if the toilet is not separated from bathroom, the hotel is new and clean I like the ambience of the hotel especially the bathroom the staffs are really helpful and nice location is near shopping area and also there is also good sushi restaurant nearly planet sushi I definitely stay at this hotel again
225552,Hotel Monsieur, Not very close to the metro stations so need to do some walk , Excellent room Clean and tidy The bed was so comfortable The staffs were also very friendly and helpful Close to the city center and there are a lot to explore nearby 
225553,Hotel Monsieur, single glass windows so there was street noise garbage collecting in the very early morning , Finally a big bed in Paris Spacious room Bio certified toiletries 
225554,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, My family and I booked the Triple Room at Hotel Monsieur and it was super comfortable The room was HUGE by Parisian standards and was more of a suite including a terrace perfect for breakfast not that advantageous in winter though when we were there The bath is the best the shower head is strong We also had a Nespresso machine The location is perfect for shoppers since Haussmann and Galeries Lafayette are a close walk away Saint Augustin station is about 300 meters away and includes a line that is well connected to almost all the main lines All in all the room and the hotel are very nice a fresh change from all the hotels around Paris with the outdated styles and the rust Highly recommended Thanks to the Hotel Monsieur team 
225555,Hotel Monsieur, Refill of cosmetics in the bathroom should have been done for 2 since it was a double room everything was ok when we asked for it , Service personnel Daniele and Sarah tres charmants breakfast Nespresso and cake in the lobby comfortable bed quite room everything was lovely

225559,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Fantastic personal service Friendliest staff in Paris I ve ever met Beautiful rooms and very spacious Close to the metro Children well catered for with even a gift on arrival 
225560,Hotel Monsieur, Well I broke off a button in Paris who doesn t with all the good food and they didn t have a sewing kit for me I feel any good boutique hotel should have the tiny necessities on emergency hold But the hotel is pretty new and the staff tried their hardest to dig around for one but to no avail , The staff were amazing and the room more than generous for the price in Paris In winter the nicely done hammam room in the basement was an extra perk 
225561,Hotel Monsieur, Nothing, Could not be happier staying in this hotel Perfect location Great room MoulinRouge stule Perfect beds Nice sized bath room Impeccably clean Hospitable staff Special thanks to Daniele the front office manager We ll definitely come back soon

225563,Hotel Monsieur, At check out I was charged 20 Euro s for breakfast However a guest checking out before me had the same room charge but breakfast included On my question to the front desk clerck on how this was possible I got the reply that the other guest booked directly through their website breakfast included and I had booked through booking com and therefore had to pay extra for breakfast Maybe something to look into by the booking organisation , Very friendly and helpful staff excellent room and wonderfull breakfast Also the additional luggage storage till end of the departure day is a good service
225564,Hotel Monsieur, Staff did not give a damn to the please clean the room tag that I hung on the door nub when I left at 9 am and when I come back at 6pm room was still nededed to be cleaned and when I remind em room was not clean they waited me 1 hour at the lobby and after all this mockery no new bedsheets no clean towels no clean cups etc , It was a tiny room with a comfortable bed and quiet hotel 
225565,Hotel Monsieur, The staff manning the reception on the evening I arrived was not very experienced or so it seemed My room was on the ground floor air circulation was poor and as the AC was not working in Nov the only option to get some air or natural light was to open the windows and let the passerby s see right into your room, New hotel so the room was quite good Location was perfect well connected by metro and also within walking distance of the Opera
225566,Hotel Monsieur, nothing really , It was a one night stay so I can only speak about one night We had the deluxe room Beautiful decorated though a bit small Everything was clean We had each a little bottle water There was tea and coffee available Great bathroom rainshower Good television Nice very nice The breakfast was fine no remarks The breakfastroom was again very small Nespresso coffee and fine tea in the lobby of the hotel very nice 
225567,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, The staff was extremely friendly and helpful Me and my husband wanted to do an overnight trip to Amsterdam for one night and the Hotel was extremely helpful with holding our luggage at no extra charge We got back the next day and they even let us hang around the lobby till it was time for our flight Customer service at its best Thank you Hotel Monsieur We will definitely be back

225570,Hotel Monsieur, In order to enjoy a more spacious room I treated myself to a Deluxe Room 21m2 instead of 17m2 At checking in the room did seem rather small but upon my request I got secured this was the Deluxe Room I had payed for Only at home I realized that in fact I did pay for a Deluxe Room but was given a smaller Superior Room This made me feel quite disappointed with the hotel , Brandnew nice hotel beautifully designed classy rooms spacious and comfortable bed great bathroom with clarins products friendly stuff at the reception 
225571,Hotel Monsieur,No Negative, Excellent location clean and cosy Very relaxing athmosphere and great breakfast Liked the modern but not overdesigned room Fantastic bed Very friendly staff Will certainly come back
225572,Hotel Monsieur, Only issue I experienced which ended up as a complaint was to return after day at work to find my door had been left open by cleaners Anyone could access hotel without being challenged and therefore I felt my privacy property and the like could have been at risk , Hotel very clean and well appointed staff very attentive and helpful
