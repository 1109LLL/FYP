462577,DO CO Hotel Vienna, The lobby and reception area are not private for the guest not feel like enter into the hotel but in the fine dining restaurant or expensive club which anyone can access to the hotel We expected silent and private space when we enter into the lobby although the hotel was located in the shopping centre and crowed outside , Location
462578,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Breakfast very expensive Room TV channels had very limited English options and no movies available to rent, Fabulous location in St Stephansplatz opposite the Cathedral and right next to an underground station Bar on 6th floor has a great atmosphere and is a great place for people watching down in the square below Free wifi Great shower Quiet room Lovely comfy bed
462579,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Though the modern exterior is remarkable the modern interiors are becoming dated Dark interior corridors have worn carpeting The entry into the hotel and up to the lobby is strange and getting to the hotel itself can be complicated because of the pedestrian only zone it s in We did not opt for breakfast because the additional charge seemed somewhat excessive , This hotel is ideally situated right across from the cathedral The views are exceptional The facade is quite remarkable and now a tourist must see in its own right The pie shaped rooms are small but very comfortable 
462580,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The staff really understand excellent customer service From the bell boy to the reception staff to the General Manager all extremely helpful and friendly I have to mention the breakfast it wasn t included in our booking but we decided to have breakfast in the hotel before we left Absolutely amazing well worth the money 
462581,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, A fantastic hotel right in the centre of Vienna Friendly staff and the rooms are very spacious and clean Surprised to find out that the reception was on the 6th floor which is on the same floor as the best part of the hotel Literary opposite St Stephen s cathedral were you can enjoy a coffee in the afternoon and transformed in the evening into a super bar for a cocktail 
462582,DO CO Hotel Vienna, The city square adjacent to the hotel was being reconstructed causing difficulties for pedestrians Our taxi from the airport had to drop us at the edge of the construction area so we had to drag our bags through about three city blocks of some extremely tight and crowded sidewalks , Expensive but the view of St Stephan cathedral was well worth it Excellent rooftop restaurant and another great view from the 6th floor lounge My wife and I shared a standard room on the third floor and were thrilled by the high quality fixtures and furnishings For our next visit to Vienna we will definitely stay at the DO CO because other hotels would seem ordinary 
462583,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The location of this hotel is fantastic It has a lot of shoping restaurants and within walking distance of the Opera House and other attractions It is located inside a big square plaza so there is a lot of foot traffic and very few vehicles deliveries Guests may be surprised to find that the check in desk is actually on the 6th floor instead of the hotel s entrance This is understandable due to limited space at the hotel s entrance Not a problem though There are porters there to help with luggage 
462584,DO CO Hotel Vienna, This was the only property on our trip that didn t include breakfast in the price While there are plenty of nearby cafes we would have appreciated If breakfast had been included ,No Positive
462585,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Would have enjoyed tea and coffee facilities in the room, View to square and cathedral was impressive Restaurant meal and wine though expensive were excellent Hotel car service to airport was first class
462586,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Everything was great Nothing to say, Stuff is great in the restaurant though they look a bit stressed but serving good As the space is limited the bar and the restaurant has to be booked in advance In the bar the guests of the hotel are always a priority The bed is veeeery comfy food is fair each room has its one bar No question to the room it s great 
462587,DO CO Hotel Vienna, You can t arrive to the entrance of hotel by car You have to take your luggage and walking about 200 meters The bed was uncomfortable We stayed at the 6th floor it was horrible neer to the club too noisy, Location
462588,DO CO Hotel Vienna, The policy of thehotel is to charge the first night by keeping the amount as guarantee They say that in reality they do notcharge it but for me when I cannot use the amount they keep as guarantee is the same which of course is being returned back after a month and not 15 days It is absolutely understood When I made a name change in my reservation and ONLY that not change of number of persons or date they kept SECOND time the amount from my card Why Since they secured my card was valid on the first time and since I did not change the card number of the resrvation just the name instead of mine I put my husbund s isn t it a bit over the top to keep twice the same amount from my card whn my reservation was Free Cancellation Anyway that was the only drawback, It was much better than in the photographs the location was impeccable the bar is wonderful and the view fantastic Breakfast was very good
462589,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Coffee in room would have been welcomed DO CO ordered the taxi brought us to the airport and charged EUR 45 which we felt was expensive given we paid EUR 45 for a the fabulous limo service from the airport a couple of days earlier Which left us feeling like we had been taken advantage of as we departing what was a fantastic experience in a beautiful city , Central location amazing contemporary building inside and out Room with a view perfect the bed was very comfy and the shower exceptional 
462590,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Almost everything about the hotel i like the view is amazing the staff are beyond goodness special thanks to muhammad night staff who help me check in at 12 midnight and also give me guidance to go and buy halal food there and also to nicole who help me with everything i need since day 1 untill day 3 when i check out thank you DO CO hotel its worth very penny i pay for 
462591,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Wi Fi was sometimes weak in our room , That was our second stay in this hotel This is excellent hotel with best location in Vienna very nice rooms and great food in restaurant which has breath taking view of the cathedral Service was impeccable always with smile from all the staff 
462592,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Bedsheets with holes bathroomfurniture scratched color off Jacuzzi in front of window so that I had to climb into the jacuzzi in order to close the curtains no other way Breakfast was ordered to room 15 service charge 5 was suddenly added which was not mentioned or written on the breakfast order form In the end the surcharge was cancelled , Location
462593,DO CO Hotel Vienna, After spending 900 euros for a 2 day stay the hotel wanted credit card details before posting back a print which had accidentally been left behind, Chef cooking to order
462594,DO CO Hotel Vienna, very small reception pokey and not comfortable also this area very busy because of adjacent restaurant no privacy nowhere to sit , larger rooms and comfortable beds 
462595,DO CO Hotel Vienna, No parking space nearby on our arrival we called many time but no one picked the phone The walls need repainting as there are scratches on my room wall the robes are old and the threads are coming out the corridor carpet has big stains Some of the evening time chocolate cake they leave at our rooms contained ALCOHOL If you are Muslim just be careful The concierge staff are so unprofessional Any service they do for you they expect money in return The Moroccan guy from the concierge tried to collect money from different members of my family for the luggage delivery to two of our rooms He literally asked Where is my tip even though he knew that my husband will give him a tip but he tried to get a tip from both rooms And because there is no parking in the hotel which is so annoying we needed something from our car and another concierge member has offered to bring it However when we went down to the hotel gate I heard him complaining to the other concierge member that we requested something from our car and when he saw us he tried to patch the conversation He got us what we need after maybe 5 hours then he was repeating that I got you what you need It was clear that he meant he needs another tip beside the good 10 we gave him on the arrival day Also on the third day we requested our car the concierge introduced a third member of their staff that brought us the car and they said our colleague brought you the car and he is a good driver pla pla pla It was also clear that they are requesting a tip I have never been to hotel where the concierge made us really nervous I hope the hotel work on their concierge staff , Amazing breakfast Amazing location Amazing housekeeper Very nice view Quiet rooms Amazing and helpful airport driver
462596,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Do Co is located in the heart of Vienna you can enjoy the beautiful views to the Stephansplatz and K rntnerstrasse while you indulge in an excellent breakfast The room was not roomy but stylish and clever designed 
462597,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Air conditioning not cool engough for staff we could clearly see they were to hot visitors in reception area in bar on hot days with the amount of glass it was 34 out side expected to be much cooler in these Areas for the money we paid , Restaurant meal excellent Room air conditioning
462598,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Transportation to the hotel could be challenging due to its location However the hotel staff is helpful with the luggage , Attentive staff Location is very convenient The restaurant is excellent Room was clean and very comfortable 
462599,DO CO Hotel Vienna, We had one of the very few rooms that didn t have the square cathedral as a view but to be fair there wasn t the option available at time of booking The courtyard view was not good despite there being an area to sit out at, Attentive staff luxury hotel perfect location little cake water delivered every day to the room breakfast was delicious
462600,DO CO Hotel Vienna, little choice of breakfast hotel room is bit aged, Location is super the room is spacious and quite the view from bar is very nice too helpful staff but could be better if female staff could be more friendly
462601,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Not clean Staff focused on outside guests to bar etc not hotel guests Rooms small Gym is 2 kilometers away In a pedestrian zone so can t drive to it, Location Bar
462602,DO CO Hotel Vienna, t, location location location its in front of stephanplatz hart of veianna next to the subway and great shoping staf are ammazing and the rooms are modern and fancy 
462603,DO CO Hotel Vienna, some of the staff are a little bit snotty, The Breakfast at the hotel terrace is just amazing The view is excellent The bar has an own area for house guests 
462604,DO CO Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The location COULD NOT BE BETTER unless your were staying at Stephens Cathedral Steps from the subway Actually Steps away from just about anything within the Ringstrasse You cannot get a nicer hotel in a nicer location than the DO CO if you want to stay within the Ringstrasse in Vienna
462605,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Nothing, Location fantastic and our room had superb views of the cathedral and pestrian square The bar served cool cocktails and the restaurant on the top floor enhanced the night views great 5 days away 
462606,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Breakfast Buffet is quite expensive for 29 per person No lobby for hotel guest , Location is the best in historical old town center of everything Room is quite large and well functioned Amentities is full set and refill everyday Also still water bottle in a white box is a good complimentary 
462607,DO CO Hotel Vienna, The devil is in the detail and the designer should be forced to live in this room for a year Why Because it s a triumph of style over practicality The room funnels out from the doorway And at the doorway the narrowest part of the space you are somehow meant to store suitcases hang clothes etc But there is no closet space The hanging rail takes a couple of small jackets and the drawers are great for a pair of socks No kidding You walk backwards and forwards over 10 metres up and down steps to find anything The bathrobes are greying and frayed around collar and cuffs the hand basin is black glass chipped sends water everywhere and never looks clean The chambermaids must hate it And when you look at the detail of steps skirting and so on you realise the interior is tired and well past its refit date Because if you operate a Design Hotel that s intended to be cutting edge in style these are the small things you have to keep on top of , If you want to be right in the centre of town on the pedestrian St Stephanplatz it s a great location but you are surrounded by a tumult of tourists outside and inside the hotel The restaurant is a light and airy room with terrace the breakfast array is stunning expensive but worth every cent and the bar overlooking the square has a great vibe in the evenings My room 508 looks fabulous as you walk in the bed is exceptionally comfortable and the shower is a massive glass cube central in the room dominating the space and delicious to use 
462608,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Not much Furniture beginning to look a little tired Rooms are pricey but paying for a location that can t be bettered , Perfect location wonderful friendly staff and the Breakfast on the roof terrace was stunning 
462609,DO CO Hotel Vienna, The bar has an outlook over Stephanspltz and as such attracts tourists to see the view The staff in turn attempt to protect the bar area but in so doing alienate the hotels guests The staff make no effort to see if you are a guest of the hotel In the bedroom space is quite limited so you are unable to spread out Plus there is a lack of mirrors in the bedroom and lighting is inadequate , The location is fabulous 
462610,DO CO Hotel Vienna, It was not a hotel It is a restaurant having rooms behind No lobby reception facilities for guests No privacy as hotel guest until entering the room Room was not clean , Reception personnel were very friendly
462611,DO CO Hotel Vienna, Towels with that great shower big fluffy towels would have been nice , Excellent location and very nice room Reception in a bit of odd place but cordial they set us up with a wonderful personal guide Everyone was helpful and pleasant Great great great shower in room and great view 
462612,DO CO Hotel Vienna, If i had to pick anything Only slight thing was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room I requested an high floor room as being in the main square I thought it would be noisy One thing to note is this hotel is upside down in that reception is on floor 6 and rooms on floors 6 5 4 and 3 We ended up on floor six which meant we could hear the bar at night from our room Wasn t an issue for us but if you want peace and quiet pick a lower floor , The rooms were a great size and location was perfect We had a room overlooking the cathedral Staff were fabulous and couldn t do enough for us booked all our meals and arranged airport transfers Bar in the hotel is great and lively and staff there were great think this is one of the best city centre hotels we have ever stayed in
