365663,Eurostars Embassy, Room is in need of repainting it looks good but still you can see the usage , A good fit for family trips I will for sure book again a room next time in Vienna 
365664,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, I asked for a room with a view and they gave me one with a good view The room was very large the staff were really helpful I think it was the manager and an asian girl that were very professional had all the information that I needed and helped me with all my questions like how to get to the bus terminal helping me out when my backpack ripped 
365665,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Great croissants pillow menu and awesome rooms with lots of space and beautiful interior Love my stay here Best value for money Will definitely come back 
365666,Eurostars Embassy, The bed had some insects and we suffered from insect bite , The staff were all helpful and plesant We got a spacious triple bed accommodation with two rooms 
365667,Eurostars Embassy, Breakfast was not great compared to other Hotels I stayed in Vienna Coffee was horrible and variety not great , Good sized room nice bed nice chairs and comfortable 
365668,Eurostars Embassy, The cleanliness in the shower was not very good The carpet looked dirty and it was very loud from the street We were in a room on the second floor directly above the bus stop You cannot sleep at an open window The feeling was as though we were in a cheap hotel even though we have paid more than 150 euro pro night , The location is excellent and the connection to the center of Vienna is perfect The staff was very polite and helpful 
365669,Eurostars Embassy, Parking in underground garage entrance in garage is very difficult and too small for regular car and there is a very large possiblillity that you will damage your car Parking price is to expensive Restaurant is too small and during the breakfast you got the feeling that you have to hurry up with your breakfast so that other people can have a place to sit , Location Rooms are nice and clean 
365670,Eurostars Embassy, There was no single bed and two double were very uncomfortable , Clean and comfortable rooms friendly and helpful staff breakfast was not bad Very reasonable price for this level of hospitality 
365671,Eurostars Embassy, Nothing to mention, The hotel is on the main street close to underground U3 and also the bus station which takes you to the city center in 7 8 minutes The shopping area Wien Mitte is also close to the hotel 10 15 min walking distance and you can find quite some shops in there It is also the main transport center to the airport S Bahn 
365672,Eurostars Embassy, The room service are not doing all they can cleaning is not up to the A level we did not get our bathing items shower gel shampoo replenished for TWO days I had to go down late night to the reception to get them myself Must be a local thing due to striking individualism but they never bring you a second cup if you order the tea for two people , Very decent accommodation and value for money although the hotel is not very fresh and needs small reparations Breakfast is good and diversified Good transport links to the city centre 
365673,Eurostars Embassy, Breakfast was over priced and I didn t get the wake up call I requested on the morning I left for the airport, The room was clean and comfortable and walking distance to the subway 
365674,Eurostars Embassy, The parking is a bit difficult because the garage is too small for a normal car only smaller cars can enter This is facility capability so it can t be changed we undersand it however it is still a bit unconvenient leave your car on the street or walk to from another garage , We ve stayed only for a night but we will return It was perfect except the parking 
365675,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Very nice room clean fully ecquiped bathroom close to subway but also close for a nice 15 20 minutes walk downtown Found some nice restaurants less than 5 minutes away The breakfast although not very varied is tasty Very nice personnel just ask and they are glad to help They are not very fluent in english but they understand and they are able to explain eventually Had one day when wifi was down but they appologised for it 
365676,Eurostars Embassy, They had some issues with Internet connection the first day But works fine now , Nice hotel near city centre 15 min walk or 5 min to nearest subway U3 If you have room facing the main street it might be a bit noisy but it s OK with closed windows 
365677,Eurostars Embassy, Nothing really , The staff was very nice and they did us a surprise after they got to know I have had proposed to my girlfriend during our stay The proximity to the nearest metro was 7minutes walking If you don t like that you can take the tram just meters away that will take you to the city centre anyhow 
365678,Eurostars Embassy, My room phone was not working and they don t have the option to order room service for dinner , The room was gorgeous and soo clean Had a living room and a balcony that was really spacious Friendly staff and close to the city centre 
365679,Eurostars Embassy, the bed was from 2 parts and i reserved one big for two only this other things are great, very nice hotel the price is also good very close to the bus internet was good compare to other hotels in austria and i so more then 50
365680,Eurostars Embassy, What was strange The receptionist gave me a bill that contained the cost of accomodation minus fee paid to the booking com Which is strange The invoice should be inclusive and a client shouldn t care about the structure of the cost of accomodation , Location is good The cost of accomodation was pleasing to my eyes The room was spacious and nice All in all the very decent hotel 
365681,Eurostars Embassy, The cleaning lady was a little bit negligent didn t take the bags with trash we left near the trash bin left the window open and outside was freezing cold didn t refill the free toiletries shower gel , Nice hotel situated on a main street near a metro station and with many shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood Very comfortable and warm quiet room We were welcomed with chocolates and wine in the room at the arrival 
365682,Eurostars Embassy, The TV was very small and not up to date The mattress was already quite saggy needs renewing , The hotel location was good and the staff were really nice and helpful Rooms were very clean and warm Breakfast was good 
365683,Eurostars Embassy, The bed sheets were not changed and the toiletries were not refilled as well There was unknown hair all over the sheets, I liked the location and the staff was very friendly 
365684,Eurostars Embassy, I dont think it is a big issue but as far as I am concerned the bed mattress could be a little bit harder I am not a yoga enthusiast or buddhist monk and do not sleep usually on concrete floor However mattress of water bed consistency gives me a feeling of uncertainty at night , The hotel is conveniently located and despite the fact it is city centre it is not difficult to find a parking place next to the hotel If you are eco vege tourist worshipping public transportation bus stop is 5m from main entrance Staff is very friendly dicrete and helpful Rooms comfortable and spacious large bathroom Wifi works well Good wine as a welcome drink 
365685,Eurostars Embassy, The breakfast did it have very many options for vegetarians vegans and the food was not high quality For a 16 EUR breakfast I expected much better food and more options In the room there are very few wall plugs none near the bed to charge phones etc There was a plug at the desk with a cover on it that made it very difficult to plug in a MacBook Pro , The front desk made it easy for us to go to the Mozart Strauss concert The bathroom was also very nice A huge shower 
365686,Eurostars Embassy, Maybe tea coffee making facilities in the room Very minor detail , Lovely well appointed room It had everything I needed Loved the bathroom area the shower was really great A perfect room well decorated a pleasure to stay with you The breakfast was wonderful great selection and good quality food lovely bread pastries and your staff were all excellent thank you you really made my hotel stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable 
365687,Eurostars Embassy, Internet is always poor in this hotel , Nice staff Good rooms It is almost in the city centre Close to Wien Mitte and Bezirk 1 You can almost always find parking in front or 1 minute walk from the hotel 
365688,Eurostars Embassy, No tea coffee maker in the room, Very clean Location is in center and walking distance to groceries restaurants hospitals Bus stop is in front of the door Staffs are very friendly and helpful especially Iuliana who did an extra mile when we had emergency during the night She made everything easy for us with flexibility Her gesture and courtesy is so natural and genuine 
365689,Eurostars Embassy, The pillow weren t very comfortable , The rooms were spacious clean and quiet The beds were very comfortable The employees were very nice and helped us to prepare a birthday surprise The breakfast was good
365690,Eurostars Embassy, The room was quite disappointing the carpet and the windows were dirty No proper ventilation in the bathroom and room was an unpleasant smell Bathroom has glass door First room was facing onto the main road which meant was very noisy so we needed to change it , The staff was really nice The metro was close 6 min walk Breakfast was good 
365691,Eurostars Embassy, For a four star hotel we found this utterly unbeliavable this was a double room made in to a triple room three times we had to ask for extra pillows the walls where all marked the carpet had that many stains it was like a nineteen eighties room when we complained we where told that the receptionist was only an apprentice not a nice experience at all,No Positive
365692,Eurostars Embassy, It s such a pity that a nice hotel like this has stained wall to wall carpet Even though it is thouroughly vacuumed and the rest of the room is hyperclean stains on a carpet are degrading the whole , Everything works excellent from shower to airco to wifi
365693,Eurostars Embassy, Very narrow 90 degrees enterance to the hotel garage Scary experience , Good breakfast comfy bed nice size of a room modern great location bus stop for the city center is just in front of the hotel good value 
365694,Eurostars Embassy, Only negative of our stay at the hotel might be the Convention concerning the car park in a parking lot near the hotel Indeed there are two options leave the car in a parking lot but the vehicle must not exceed the length of 4m in practice only for small cars leave the car in a normal indoor parking in the near paying 18 day instead of 22 The discount could be higher in my opinion , Very good choice for a stay in Vienna a few days excellent location close to the city center and public transport
365695,Eurostars Embassy, No coffee or tea in the room Pillows like pancake no extra pillows were available Smelly rooms and terrible parking , Good Location Variety for Breakfast and cooperative Staff 
365696,Eurostars Embassy, Breakfast to the room would be nice , The room was fabulous with a terrace with a great view room very spacious and clean Check in very efficient Staff are very helpful during the stay Check out at 5 30 in the morning very quick and the guy at the reception offered coffee on the go that was very nice of him Great job Will definitely come back 
365697,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Wonderful hotel comfortable well located and very helpful staff Totally recommended Thank you for making this one night absolutely lovely for us 
365698,Eurostars Embassy, The windows were extremely dirty When we came in to our room it smelled unpleasant but it got better with airconditioning or open window , Nice spacey room with big windows and good bathroom The hotel breakfast looked nice but we decided to eat in the bakery across the street which was lovely and a lot cheeper 
365699,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Very lovely hotel good location stuff was very friendly Offered tea and fruits at the lobby Good rates we needed just to stay for the night to leave early in the morning 
365700,Eurostars Embassy, There was only one kind of empty pillow was not very comfortable to sleep On the second day I have put one towel on the floor and expected it to be changed was disappointed when saw that cleaning staff has smashed it and put it back on shelf The room cleaning was not done accurately and properly But have to mention that after my call to reception they immediately brought me new towels , The Hotel is a good one for me it was close to the level of Ibis Hotels chain I would rate it as a strong 3 stars although it is a 4 stars hotel Optimal use of space in rooms simple small but comfortable They put slippers in the room I liked this Towels and bath set was available was clean when we entered Staff is very friendly accurate helpful Breakfast was good they dont have a separate restaurant for breakfast bar and breakfast area is located just near the entrance and lobby which is not very usual The breakfast itself was ok usual cheese butter bread cakes plus eggs omlet and one hot dish Location is not bad U Bahn U3 is 10 min walk restaurants are close to the hotel You can also walk to the centers but it would take 20 30min so I used U bahn 
365701,Eurostars Embassy, staff was very bad they charge us money without we know from our C Card after we left the hotel they didn t even had our signature we raised already a legal case against them ,No Positive
365702,Eurostars Embassy, Breakfast needed to be improved like put more choice for asian which includes rice Also with the cleaning of the rooms for example changing towels , Location spacious room close to city center public transportation and Wien Mitte Mall is just a 10min walk 
365703,Eurostars Embassy, Dirty room carpet with stains chairs with stains dirty windows awful smell of cigarettes Air conditioning didn t work at all and even if it was May it was very hot inside Hotel is next to the crowded street so if air conditioning didn t work we couldn t open noise cancelling windows because there was ultra noisy outside Defective shower switch Power supply sockets were only on the same wall as TV It means if you want to connect your laptop charger you will have to take some extension cord Some of electrical connections in the room were unprofessionally made which also isn t very safe please see the photo of 4 stars hotel fridge connection which i added below Cleaning staff sometimes forgot to close the room leaving the door opened we had such situation so please check twice everything you left there If you go to a hotel where standard price without a discount for a double room per night is over 230 euro then i think this hotel should have free parking for visitors In this hotel you have to remember there is an additional 18 euro fee for parking per every 24h The parking i mentioned is ultra small If you have a longer than 4 7m car then don t think about using this parking There is a 90 deg corner on the way to the parking slot and it is quite narrow Peugeot 407 sedan got in but there was so tight that there was no space for a finger Getting out was a lot easier To sum up In Poland this hotel in current condition would have problems with getting 3 stars The quality you get is way too low for the price you pay I think this 8 5 10 points in ranking on Booking com is in some way faked Maybe 5 5 would be ok and even great breakfast nice staff didn t really change our feeling of wasting of money , Good location Very tasteful breakfast Nice helpful staff Nice modern room style Noise cancelling windows Quite fast wifi 8 1 Mbps Two elevators
365704,Eurostars Embassy, The city cafes close early food should be available at all times in the hotel, Location very close to the mall and cafes close to the clock as well Very safe n close to the tram line
365705,Eurostars Embassy, If you book the room online be ready that the sum will be blocked at your bank account for 1 month even you paid the bill with cash , The hotel is good 
365706,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Our room was very comfortable and clean The breakfast had enough choices to satisfy anyone and the staff at the reception very polite and eager to give information The location is very convenient only few minutes walk from metro station in a beautiful neighbourhood 
365707,Eurostars Embassy, It may seem odd but I would add a toilet brush I would improve a bit the temperature regulation in the room I sometimes felt a little hot , We have chosen this hotel for the second time owing to its very nice position with respect to the centre of the city and pubblic trasport Room was very clean Staff was always kind and helpful If a come back in Vienna I will probably choose the hotel again 
365708,Eurostars Embassy, The room was smelling cigarette even I asked for non smoking room Was like someone smoked there for 1 week there when the windows were closed I think the staff even didn t open the windows for long time it was really difficult for me to sleep there , The room was big enough 
365709,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Comparing too many hotels in mariehelfestra e They were very old and More expensive this one were so clean 10 minutes walking to Wienmitte 3 minutes walking to underground The price was nice comparing other hotels Just perfect Thanks
365710,Eurostars Embassy, Spend 3 nights in the same bedlinen after complaning the 3 day we changed it ourselves the cleaning maids played with my aftershave when complaning at the front desk they just basically said I was wrong But I remember the scent of my aftershave and recognise when it is fresh , Bacon was soft the bread dry and crispy coffee from a nescafe machine Really not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel 
365711,Eurostars Embassy, Room was not clean Although bed linens were good but carpets and walls in the pathroom were stained Furniture little bit outdated but still acceptable , Location Breakfast was really good

365714,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, The room is very clean and very comfortable and the location is only 3 5 mins by foot from the closest metro If I have chance to go to Vienna again I will still choose this hotel 
365715,Eurostars Embassy, The WIFI connection was sometimes very weak in the room , The location was good There s a bus stop right in front of the hotel with approximately 6 short stops until Wien Mitte There is also a subway station at 5 minutes walk from the hotel Kard Nagl Platz Our room was quite big even if we had only a standard room probably because we had the room on the corner The room was very clean the heating worked very well We enjoyed the breakfast it was rich and the quality of the food was good 
365716,Eurostars Embassy, Poor Wi Fi speeds shower retained too much water no toilet brush in the room carpet in the room was dirty Power sockets were too far from the bed Beds were terrible nobody from our group slept properly Cancellation policy is too strict The garage was extremely hard to get in but the staff told us that before booking Lack of smoking area The chocolate they gave us as a welcome in our room tasted like soap Poor minibar choice No in room ordering except breakfast , Breakfast was nice The bus stop was in front of the hotel You could get to the centre square in about 20 minutes on foot The staff was very nice and pleasant 
365717,Eurostars Embassy, WiFi had cut offs and was pretty bad most of the time , Room was very spacious very clean Shower was really big by size and very nice for me with high quality ceramics Breakfast was very good Staff is very friendly and helpful 
365718,Eurostars Embassy,No Negative, Conveniently located bus stop shopping areas food drink within 100 250 m the Eurostars Embassy was an inspired choice for a short stay in Vienna The large room was cosy and waiting with all the amenities of a 4 star hotel There is a parking place underground but the access is very difficult therefore some good driving skills and caution are required The staff was responsive and helpful 
365719,Eurostars Embassy, within two months this is my second time i went to this hotel and internet was either not working at all or was totally slow that you couldnt even open google After three days i had to change the hotel because of the internet windows are not good its very noisy from the outside , The location is good rooms are good also staff is nice
