21815,Atala Champs Elys es, The room was very dated and the carpets were stained and dirty There were only 2 English speaking channels available which we did not expect and the beds were not very comfortable , The location of the hotel is excellent many restaurants nearby The staff were friendly and helpful

21819,Atala Champs Elys es, The only thing I did not like that I found no one at the reception when I was leaving for my flight it was 4 am and I wanted to check out before I leave and I had to try to shout to see if anyone is there the lights were turned off and all I thought receptions work 24 7 in all hotels Another thing is that in our room there was a separate door and room for the toilet but the bidet was with the main bathroom next to the shower and sink that was so confusing there was no point of doing that Everything else was PERFECT though , The room was clean comfortable and wide enough The location is just perfect The cleanliness was impressive the staff were awesome and very helpful The backyard of the hotel is beautifully designed and peaceful to relax also there was a small gym all what you need on a holiday which is perfect Will be coming back for sure
