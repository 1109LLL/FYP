106969,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Staff Mediocre Most of them were so immersed in their work most of the time and a smile or acknowledgement came as if out of force I had sought some tourist information from them about tour buses and they provided me with some wrong info that messed up the day Location Not suitable for tourists at all Away from all attractions Train station is a walk away but it takes less than an hour to reach anywhere by it We eventually took uber Food No idea as we never ate there This hotel has no restaurant service and has justa 20 item menu which they provide at sky rocketing prices Breakfast was 25 for continental spread and 30 for American spread and I thought it is better to eat at the neighbouring places Menu itself was so so drab Room Just about ok I had signed up for a room with a pool entrance on bookings com This turned out to be a room behind the so called eating area of the hotel and when I had to draw open the curtains there were people eating outside I wouldn t even trust bookings com now on rooms Toilet Separate toilet and shower area Acceptable in European countries But a toilet with no sink or water facilities in today s age NO NOT ACCEPTABLE , If you are travelling to Paris on business and if that is centered around Bastille area this hotel is the right place to go It is a boutique hotel and all new not run down at all The area has many eating places around it that is the only next bonus I saw in this place 
106970,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, DIDNT THINK IT WAS 5 STAR ACCOMODATION AS ADVERTISED WE HAD AN UPGRADE BUT ROOM WAS STILL SMALL COMPARED TO OTHER 5 STAR AROUND THE WORLD BUT RATE WAS REASONABLE,No Positive
106971,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, the area is different than what you would expect from paris and it has a few seemingly nice places but its not an area id like to stay at again to be honest The bar is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE and dull and boring Pool is too small and always crowded, I loved the bed and bathroom at the hotel other than that all is ok and normal Staff were helpful and pleasant 
106972,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, No swimming pool however we didn t come for the swimming we came for the food sight seeing and Experience, Location excellent for visiting Versailles Excellent underground parking at a reasonable cost 20 min walk to Palaces and local French quality restaurants 
106973,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, The comfort of the mattress It s surely the best mattress I have slept on I also like the facility to have the breakfast served in the room 
106974,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, The size of the room was small it felt cramped Additionally the design was not good the sink was was in another room far from the restroom Maybe it should be four stars hotel not five , The concierges at the front desk were very professional helpful and kind 
106975,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Mini bar only one bottle of sparkling water and a jar off nuts Room service choice of a Pizza thats all Bar Snacks very poor range room very sparsely decorated,No Positive
106976,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Not many English TV channels but no biggie , Lovely hotel Great location comfortable beds quiet stylish room Very quiet great staff excellent facilities Loved the spa sauna and pool Will definitely return 
106977,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Room was a bit smaller than expected, Really polite and helpful staff Location was great metro nearby and lots of restaurants around Breakfast was really good
106978,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, No proper restaurant and poor room service menu dommage Uncomfortable chairs and cheap carpeting in the deluxe rooms , Professionalism Maud one of the front desk agents handled an issue with maestria Incredibly comfortable bed linen and slippers bravo Very nice bathroom Very nice hotel as a whole 
106979,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, My only complaint would be the cost of drinks in the bar , What a fantastic hotel the staff were extremely helpful and polite The facilities were of a high standard and the hotel was very clean and modern 
106980,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The hotel has the most comfortable bed that I have ever experienced in a hotel Nice bathroom with a nice bathtub Good quality breakfast we only had it once since it is quite expensive when it is not included Nice workout room and a very nice spa area with swimming pool sauna and a hamam 
106981,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, The location is a bit far from the center People had camera in the SPA First room 20sqm was not arrange in a way that uses the space efficiently , I did like the art deco style of the hotel 
106982,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, The same receptionist who checked me in checked me out She was rude not helpful and not welcoming The amenities were not as expected from a 5 hotel Rooms are poorly decorated and there were some large cracks in the walls esp inside the bathroom , Fairly fresh and diverse breakfast Helpful staff at breakfast room The bathtub in the room was equipped to some Jacuzzi like stuff which was interesting And really nothing special for a 5 hotel 
106983,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Just recommendation to the manager it is absolutely important to put the lighting around the steps in the pool Because when the water jets work you do not see the steps and can hit yourself , Absolutely fantastic hotel in Paris Located not in the very center but close by metro Very comfortable modern new Personnel is wonderful quick professional Underground parking is a huge plus Cozy warm swimming pool with water jets is something exceptional in the middle of Paris Area around is nice plenty of restaurants around We stayed in many hotels in Paris before this one is the best of the best Size of the room is acceptable also 
106984,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, There was a small wardrobe but even though I know hotel rooms in Paris are likely to be small a chest of drawers would have been appreciated Especially as we were staying more than a couple of nights Careful not to eat anything from the mini bar horribly expensive , I chose this hotel because of the Booking com reviews and the fact it had private parking facilities and was within walking distance of Bastille The absolute best thing was the incredibly comfortable bed I have never slept so well Moreover our room was quiet no waking up early to street cleaning or noisy refuse collections Staff were cheerful and went out of their way to be helpful 
106985,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Staff a little unfriendly and foods overpriced Pizza nothing fancy 17 euros , The overall experience was good Breakfast buffet fantastic Quiet and good location 
106986,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, We booked 2 rooms both of the 1st rooms given had a horizontal window with no view We ask to change and staff was very nice and give us a better room however none of the 2 rooms of our stay were like the photos My opinion is that hotel is a 4 star not a 5 , I lime very much the arqiuitecture of this hotel a good exemple of a excelent renovation 
106987,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Absolutely nothing , Due to a medical issue we had to remain in Paris longer than we planned and needed a hotel that was suitable to recuperate afterwards We found Hotel Boutet was close to where we had previously stayed in an apartment and chose to book in We had stumbled onto a real gem Every aspect of the hotel was more than excellent The staff were always friendly and accommodating and could not do enough to help the rooms were impeccably clean and the bed was the best we have ever slept on in a hotel All the facilities provided in the hotel were excellent and we would definitely stay here again We absolutely recommend Hotel Boutet to anyone wishing to stay in Paris

106990,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Rough area of Paris not a 5 star hotel 3 star at a push as the facilities are limited breakfast massively over priced 30 for just a standard fry up which is an absolute disgrace they will also charge you 25 extra on the day due booking com not charging correct room rates all in all a disgrace, The bed was comfy and had adequate spa facilities
106991,H tel Paris Bastille Boutet MGallery by Sofitel, Checked in at 1 20am due to late train arrival and limited taxis and had NO assistance whatsoever with my luggage Was not explained anything about facilities Was very disappointing Disappointment continued in the morning when I made a coffee in the room and there was no milk 5 star NO On check out the staff member tried to charge me for breakfast for 2 people as a solo traveller after explaining how my stay was he was happy to argue the point very very disappointing service , Breakfast was great Shower was great Bed was confirtable
