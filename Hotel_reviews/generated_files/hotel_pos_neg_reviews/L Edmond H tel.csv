108108,L Edmond H tel,No Negative, Lovely family room with comfortable beds Our room faced towards the back of the hotel which meant it was really nice and quiet at night morning Location was great for shops and restaurants There are lots of supermarkets and grocery stores nearby so you can easily buy breakfast outside the hotel
