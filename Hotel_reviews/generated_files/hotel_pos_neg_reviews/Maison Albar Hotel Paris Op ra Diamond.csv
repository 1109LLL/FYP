177671,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, It was the second time I stayed at this place and for the second time we had an issue with warm water Last time the boiler was down and we only had cold water but we expected it to be a one time issue This time there was warm water but it was only warm lukewarm I like to take a hot shower to relax muscles after walking around the whole day in Paris but it seems that the boiler can t manage to produce enough hot water for everyone , The location of the hotel is quite good being close to the department stores Printemps etc The rooms are stylish and well equipped even with a coffee machine 
177672,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Breakfast was not that good if compared to the price must be good The price is very high and does not fit the location, Good hotel and good clean so well from center to hotel

177674,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Upon arriving they said to me at the reception desk that they should have to charge in advance my credit card for 50 euros extra per day just in case that I get a service without pay They also said that my credit card will not be charged if I will not use the amount I found this insulting and unproffessional After all I booked a prepaid bed and breakfast accomodation just to be sure that I didn t have to pay anything extra Not to mention that after this treatment even if I wanted to buy anything at all the last thing I should do is to give the hotel even a single cent extra I would rather go a mile away and get it outside from the hotel , The location is perfect Staff very helpful The hotel in general is excellent 
177675,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, N A, The staff was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful with the planning of our site seeing They were kind and welcoming from the moment we walked in all the way until we left Going forward I will always stay at this hotel when I come to Paris Excellent location walking distance to several stations great food and restaurants open late right around the corner huge shopping venue nearby plus the room was perfection 
177676,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The lady serving us at breakfast was very unfriendly unhelpful and mostly in a bad mood and being exposed to her early in the day wasn t a great start to a moring on vacation Even though the food itself was lovely we opted to eat breakfast somewhere else on the days that she served breakfast , For Paris the rooms are extra large the bed and linen was super comfortable and we loved the Japanese toilet in the modernly decorated bathroom Our room had a good view too I would absolutely recommend this hotel to loved ones 
177677,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, No iron and ironing board in the room as when we have to rush for customer meetings this saves time as hotel laundry will be too slow , Clean comfortable and spacious for a European hotel
177678,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The room was smaller than expected as we got an executive suite and it didn t seem much bigger than a double room Still amazingly decorated room and balcony , The staff were lovely and the decor was amazing Loved the location as it was close to everything by cab and even somethings walking distance 
177679,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, We were given the key to a room already occupied and our key opened the door to a room already with someone else s possessions in there This was fixed by giving us another room unoccupied But later the same thing happened us when someone was given a key to our room Bad organisation from staff, Like the decor and location was really good
177680,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The only thing we didn t like twas the cocktail we had on the Saturday night wasn t great to be fair, Over all the hotel was excellent and wish I stay there another night
177681,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Apple TV did not work and we also had to connect to the wifi from another room which didn t bother us but was strange Would have liked to try the hotel restaurant but it was just too expensive , This hotel is beautiful a real treat The staff were very friendly and made the whole check in process very smooth The room was very comfortable and clean and it was always a perfect temperature The staff were also very responsive when a mistake was made and worked very quickly to resolve it

177683,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The fact the concierge asked for a tip with his hand and also walked my girlfriend out the hotel around the corner and asked her to change English money for euros and tried to con her for extra That is not 5 star Also the hotel said there would be flowers in the room as requested but there were non yet still charged These two experiences dampened the stay a little, The reception staff were helpful and the location was fantastic for getting around Paris The hotel was clean and quiet The room was great and bed very comfy
177684,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, On the second night of my stay at the Hotel the alarm went off in the hotel at around midnight all guests had to leave their rooms in complete darkness as the electricity switches had tripped Ran in the dark with our pj s to the foyer as we thought the hotel was burning or even worse maybe a terrorist attack Waited a whole hour and a half in the cold and dark before we were told that the smoke signal went off and that had triggerred the alarm and cut off the electricity supply Only one hotel staff member was on duty to assist which he was unable to do We were locked out of our rooms We only got back to our rooms at 1 30 All we were told was that they were sorry no compensation or even a written apology from the hotel management Quiet scary as the guy on duty did not have the situation under control No proper disaster management protocols are put into place PATHETIC FOR 5 STAR Wonder how and who rates you 5 star ,No Positive
177685,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The service is not as good as it used to be before the rebrand Many of the original front of house staff who were extremely friendly and helpful have gone unfortunately Also the staff seem unaware of the booking com payment policies , Location is great and size of the rooms is good compared to other hotels in Paris They ve also upgraded the general facilities as a result of the recent refurbishment 
177686,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Limited TV channels The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night the electricity shut off and all guests were in reception until the early hours There was no communication from the staff and no one was aware that it was safe to return to the room Day staff were very unapologetic upon check out, Great location Beautiful hotel
177687,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond,No Negative, Lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff Opposite the metro and near shops cafes restaurants Good location to explore the sights Even has an M S Food next door 
177688,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Bed and pillow , Staying at level 2 without Aircon and have to open the window and sleep is a pain check out early morning 6am and the staff doesn t know their system well and took 30mins for check out and can t release the deposit immediately upon check in the staff didn t inform us about city tax we only know when we upon check out we didnt go for any alcohol at bar service and the staff wanna charge us for that they waived off after a long dispute and pillow is terrible 
177689,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The Wifi was not so good It kept breaking down and the room was facing the street which was noisy but that is part of the Paris atmosphere Due to the location and busy street you need to call the taxi at least 15 mins before you need to leave , I absolutely loved the property The cleanliness the decor the location the friendly staff and service esp Tariq the bell boy The ambience was great I just did not realise that the hotel had a fitness room Next time I will try it I really loved my stay and I will definitely be back I only managed to have the breakfast on one day but it was perfect In terms of comfort cleanliness design decor location service this really is one of my favourite hotels and I have traveled around the world 
177690,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, We asked for help from the reception to recommend a restaurant for dinner however she never get back to us A bit disappointed , Great location English speaking staffs make things enjoyable Next to the station pharmacy and lots of restaurants Wifi is only available for 2 login so if you need to work on extra devices considering there 2 of you in the room there will be a problem 
177691,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The deco of the lobby looks like a night club, Loved the hotel amazing location Very clean and most of the staff members were very helpful Maybe the d cor could be more classy and the rooms are spacious compared to other hotels in Paris

177696,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The only downside we would like to point out is the room temperature The room was a bit cold during our stay , We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it seems that it has only slight differences from a standard The bathroom is really great nice spacious shower The room is also spacious for Paris standards The hotel is located next to Gare Saint Lazare which gives you an awesome position to use metro and move around town We will definitely come back to this hotel

177703,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Our room was stuffy The room was very noisy all night as it fronted the street and we needed to open the windows , Good sized very clean room Big comfortable bed and pillows Windows that opened Good value 
177704,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, There was supposed to be evening entertainment but we saw none Bar closed on Sunday , We were on the 3rd floor at the front the soundproofing was so good we heard very little noise The Lazare train station beside the hotel contains super shops and an excellent restaurant Loved the room and the bath room was beautiful and so well equipped even a very elaborate toilet the operation of which we stayed well clear of Would love to revisit

177706,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Nothing , I loved my stay at this lovely hotel The location was superb awesome cafes and restaurants are nearby Also the train station is very close as well The area around the hotel is lively during the day I actually went to the champs elysees by walking for almost 25 minutes which was not so bad As for the room i had the double one which was perfect for us as a couple The furniture is elegant and the bed was very comfortable As for the bathroom it was the best part of the experience because it was very clean modern and had an awesome walk in shower The water pressure was so good as well It deserves to be a 5 stars hotel and the hotel management are actually doing some renovations to make that happen I for one was not annoyed by the renovation works Ask for a room that is besides the court yard for the quietness and peacefulness I will surely book again if i come to Paris for another trip Oh and yes the staff are nice and very helpful when needed 
177707,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Construction outside the room we had to step over workers to get in and out of our room , The front desk staff are excellent friendly and very helpful 
177708,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Construction outside and in currently to convert the hotel to a 5 star already gets 5 stars from us , The location was excellent for easy access to trains Metro and buses to all the best sites customer service was exceptional and staff was able to assist in English very well 
177709,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The old rooms are a bit too dark and creepy request for the new rooms to have the ultimate experience here these new rooms are well lit and bright for those who like a properly illuminated room space Also didn t like that the hotel outsourced kitchen services only breakfast is served in house lunch and dinner will be ordered by the hotel on your behalf externally , Location was great staff was great too great value for money and not to forget the room upgrade twice it was such a great gesture as we had complained our room was too dark the room was changed with an upgrade from deluxe to junior suite withou5t any fuss at all

177716,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, There was construction being done at the location so a little loud at times Overall GREAT stay , The location was excellent the staff was helpful Rooms were very nice posh just a little small 
177717,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, We felt that the full breakfast is quite expensive per person but I think the express breakfast offers an excellent alternative for those travellers who are on the go We availed of this option the quality of this as well as the service was excellent , it was so kind of the hotel staff to upgrade our room as it was our Wedding Anniversary The treats left out for us in on our room on arrival was a very thoughtful gesture also The service was excellent particularly the reception and breakfast staff The express breakfast suited us perfectly and was really good value 
177718,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Nothing , The staff made this stay easy They held my bag all day after check out They upgraded me to a better room The room was great much better than the 5 star hotel I stayed in for the rest of my trip 
177719,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, recently refurbished but very poor quality lights in bathroom did not work no extractor fan for shower ventilation in room not working or does not go cool enough fridge not cold enough new lights in hallway hanging from wall and already out of order plus their rack rates were ridiculously expensive lucky we got a decent rate or we would not have booked , nice hotel and good prices good location friendly staff
177720,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, I did find that the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side for what was included Therefore i opted not to include with my booking instead visited different cafes that are located outside of the hotel every morning which was alot cheaper , Absolutely loved staying in this hotel during my visit to Paris Literally no complaints whatsoever Fresh bedding on my super kingsize bed and nice smelling toiletries everyday The decor was beautiful which was a massive bonus aesthetically The hotel was central to all the major attractions i was interested in with the underground Metro just a few minutes walk from the hotel 
177721,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Supposed to be spa but that didn t exist that was the reason for selecting this hotel above others Not value for the price paid , Good location for metro access 
177722,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The courtyard or restaurant wasn t trading accessible during our stay which just means we ll have to return when it does , The decor the location and the staff was stunning perfect and super pleasant 
177723,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, All day room service should be available Couldn t see no bar as the hotel was getting refurbished and was not told when booked Door need to be solid and sound proof as we could hear everything, Bed was comfy
177724,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Our room was next to the staircase The door to the staircase didn t have a silencer or slow shutting mechanism so kept on banging shut everytime someone went through it Made sleeping difficult we were woken up at about 5am by it Told staff about it in the morning 8am and they just asked if we had reported the problem to a member of staff Also 2 of our rooms on the 3rd floor had no WiFi ,No Positive
177725,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The check in was a nightmare we were initially put into the wrong room and when we argued about the false promises of the website in regards to our suite the front desk told us there was no room of that description despite having the confirmation of Executive Suite in hand Also there was lots of noisy construction which disrupted our mornings No apologies were made as was no warning to said work Disappointing for the price we paid , Two staff members stood out in particular Nobel Fatou without them the start of our Paris vacation would have been very disappointing The chromotherapy shower was also divine Close to shops sights and transport which was handy 
177726,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Location is good there is close to Saint lazare and a marks and spencer food market There was just nothing pretty about the location no atmosphere with Parisian barrsaries etc , Good but not great Lovely hotel nicely decorated with an awesome rain shower Bed was comfy and strong air conditioning was a must and a God send during Paris heatwave 
177727,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Highly overpriced for what it offers Designer hotel but really not offering anything special Breakfast was ok but given the price I would have expected much better The room was very small and the air conditioning did not work Given outside was almost 30 degrees it resulted in a horrible experience , Good location easy to reach
177728,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Housekeeping wasnt up to the mark Water glasses and tea cups in room were not replaced daily even if they were used , Location is fab Starbucks and Mark Spencer food is little same block as building Lots of bus stops close by lots of eateries too 
177729,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, The breakfast menu was repetitive and considering the price I paid should have been included there was a lot of noise due to building works but it stopped in the early evenings but in all it was a beautiful stay , My room was very nice the bed was comfortable the hospitality was very polite 
177730,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, As a traveler I have a large experience in hotels Well Now gotta be strict and honest on the nons as a friendly staff does not makes an hotel 1 staff knock my door at 1204 I suppose to let me aware I was going over my check out time What WELL NOOO No 2 cleaner open door without notice for room services Not as good if like me you enjoy wondering naked 3 cleaner use same lift as clients therefore lift and coredors are often pack with laundry 4 No tooth brush or paste 5 breakfast if you book direct with them is free of charge otherwise 23 or other prices on booking com I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU ANY very poor breakfast not much variety for price the home made cakes were not with a fresh feeling 6 It is indeed an boutique hotel very small and the lounge area probably is the entrance lobby 7 The garden that shows on the pictures is no longer exists Instead a place where is probably in restoration 8 Noise from construction work at 8am Would be kind to be worn about 9 You can hear and feel everytime cleaners or neigbour bang the door VERY LOUD 10 Room is dark 11 shower looks good but water will go all over the bathroom turning all very messy hard and extremely dangerous to walk 12 No spa but I was aware I don t know either will stay again however it was not a bad experience just bits and pieces and areas of improving its hard to be perfect Would suggest go and judge for yourself I m surely not regretted Good luck , Well I m one of those freaks who read all reviews before takind an decision so stay tune and I will give you the honest ever Unware of check in times I arrived at 12pm a very pleasant gentleman although check in starts at 2pm arraged a room for me and upgraded to deluxe room same gentleman gave me a map of the city and wrote down for me places nearby to see and to eat he than helped me to my room and explain that I can have access to films for free and cofee 2 Breakfast until 10pm but they let you in even if your late and always replenishing food The Nutella and lil glasses compotes is the best of the breakfast part Staff very friendly helpful and present at breakfast keeping place clean and replenished 3 Saint Lazard is just very good location and great access shopping center 1min walk I recommend you to walk as all is very close in Paris astonishing views at every conner great for photos and explore I walk with no gps or map and bumped to Eifel Tower and others landmarks Take uber over night as it is very cheap be aware that same will cancel your trip for the fact you speak English and they can t understand you 4 friendly staff again they printed my booking for Moulin Rouge 5 I m very picky when it takes to bathroom as to be modern looking brand new and extremely clean with SHOWER It reach my expectations clearly Free toiletries is a must on a 4 star 6 decoration was quirky 7 very easy to find 8 they will store your luggage if you fancy a walk after your check out Extremely recommend it 9 Wifi works well 10 staff speaks perfect English 
177731,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, to inform us that the breakfast was included as we did not know and therefore did not eat the breakfast , The room was very good and confortable and we aprreciated the upgrade to a suite room the 2nd night to compensate for the big noise we experienced on the first morning because of refurbishment works 
177732,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Work being carried out in the hotel meant very dusty in communal areas but staff did well to minimise disruption for guests Showers don t have curtain or screen so whole bathroom floor becomes a tray , Handy bar across the road for breakfast at 7euros per person Location of metro just across road Good size rooms 
177733,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Foyer hallways and stairs quite dark Given poor instructions on internet access we asked for help they said they would just be a minute fifteen minutes later still no assistance Then we found a free computer way around the corner why not offer us that in the mean time Breakfast way overpriced, Bed and room great Modern bathroom
177734,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Wifi is limited to a set number of devices with no ability to remove devices, Very modern looks great with very good room facilities and very polite and accommodating staff Amazing location ideal for tourists
177735,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, CAMERA IN THE BATHROOM See last sentences It seemed like our room had only recently been renovated The air con didn t seem to work at all and when I put my hand over the vent to check for air flow it fell off the wall and almost hit me in the head Upon inspection it was stuck to the wall with 2 sided tape The intercom handset in the bathroom was broken and almost falling apart There was a large dark rectangle in the lower half of the bathroom mirror which seemed to serve no purpose I thought it may be a monitor to display a clock and outside ambient temps that was currently not working When I enquired about it the receptionist told me it was a decoration I think this is unlikely Further inspection of the mirror showed that it wasn t even fastened to the wall properly the entire lower right corner was sitting away from the wall When my inquisitive eyes reached the top of the mirror I was surprised beyond belief to find what looked like haven t confirmed yet a pin hole camera It was a small object about 1 5mm width A cube shape with 1 side that was convex smooth and rounded 3 wires coming out of the cube extended down behind the mirror and into the wall It had been carefully fastened to the back of the mirror in the centre of the top edge with 2 sided tape The tape had been placed over the wires about 3cm from the camera and the camera had been angled so as to look directly into the space where anyone standing in front of the mirror would be When I enquired at reception they told me it s nothing Yes that s a quote I went back to the room and yanked the thing up as hard as I could and stuffed it all behind the mirror , This hotel was interesting with its mock diamonds inlaid into most of the furniture Almost everything else is made to sparkle too 
177736,Maison Albar Hotel Paris Op ra Diamond, Renovations made breakfast area a little cramped , Location was great could walk to Louvre Opera Galleries Layfayrtte Tuileries Musee Dorci evening desk clerk very friendly Also close to Starbucks and St Lazare train station
