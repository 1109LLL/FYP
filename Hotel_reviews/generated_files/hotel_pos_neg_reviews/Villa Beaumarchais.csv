201920,Villa Beaumarchais, The bathroom could have been a little bit more modern but this is a minor comment , Lovely decor in a great location in Paris and at a reasonable price 
201921,Villa Beaumarchais, The room was small which made it difficult with luggage and trying to get dressed The cupboard was right near the door which was awkward if one person trying to get in the room or leave The tv remote was not working at times , Close to metro and buses There was a self serve laundry and supermarketband restaurants nearby The staff were very friendly and helpful 
201922,Villa Beaumarchais, The only preference from our side would be to have a separate shower and not having to shower in the bath But this is just a minor detail , Very nice ambiance of the hotel had a nice feel to it Nice large room superior great bed and friendly staff Breakfast was nice Location very close to metro many restaurants in the area and quiet at night so one can have a good sleep 
201923,Villa Beaumarchais, We didn t book breakfast with our room but we had it on the last morning I have to say it was a little disappointing Apart from that everything was excellent thank you very much , The service upon arrival was excellent and it really made all the difference to my stay 
201924,Villa Beaumarchais, Access stairwell carpet a bit grubby Leak from pipes in nearby room flooded hallway carpet so the smell was not nice for a couple of days though the staff had the problem fixed quickly , Lovely staff Damon very helpful Room clean Not far from Metro 
201925,Villa Beaumarchais, The safe in our room didn t work and we were told it would be fixed the next morning at 8 30am but it was never fixed during our stay, The best was very comfortable especially the pillows
201926,Villa Beaumarchais, The breakfasts were pricey but there were 3 price options , Room was carpeted The full sized tub and shower were modern The small fitness room was sufficient for my needs The staff was great 25 minute walk to Notre Dame and metro was 2 blocks away 
201927,Villa Beaumarchais, Some members of staff not very up on assisting with tourist info need to offer a more efficient helpful tourist service with info maps pamphlets bookings etc, Well located in the Marais Quiet at night Comfortable beds and small boutique style
201928,Villa Beaumarchais, Our room was tiny but I believe they have larger ones The place is Undergoing some renovation It is a little tired old and dusty , The lifesaver for us was the heated towel rail in the bathroom on which we managed to dry our clothes after getting totally drenched in the rain The bedding was beautiful and the bed comfy 
201929,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The Hotel was in little off street beautiful and quaint No traffic noise The room was old fashioned chique The neighbourhood was friendly great for walks Plenty of restaurants and bars markets at the Bastille square Short walk to Metro Chemin Vert or to Bastille Metro 
201930,Villa Beaumarchais, The hotel decoration is old and we could not prevent the light penetrating the room early in the morning , Excellent location comfortable room kind staff 
201931,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Breakfasts were really very delicous and variety of dishes was high We appriciated big and very comfortable double bad Everyhing was clean and comfortable 
201932,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Friendly and well presented small hotel Rooms a good size by Paris standards ditto en suite Clean and characterful Outside space A more atmospheric cocktail bar area are my only improvement suggestions
201933,Villa Beaumarchais, I was able to do all I planned so no negative feedback , The staff were all very friendly and helpful and it was a nice relaxing break in a quiet area but close to the metro Lots of good restaurants in the area and near many tourist attractions 
201934,Villa Beaumarchais, Nothing it was all very good , This hotel was great The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist us especially as we were not French speaking The room was large and the facilities are fantastic The breakfast was very good A great hotel 
201935,Villa Beaumarchais, Be careful when buying addicional services in the hotel and although they had agreed in my request for payment in cash the atendent charged everything on the credit card at the check in time Explaining what I said about bying services at the hotel I would rather go to Rodin s Centenary exposition at Grand Palais and I was informed about its lines Then I tried to buy the tickets for both exposure of Rodin and The Gardens in the official site at internet at the price of euro 23 but I was not able to finish the purchase procedures neither by cellphone nor by tablet The hotel offers the use of a computer near the reception for the price of euro 5 per 15 minutes and I decided to try in the computer When I requested the access the receptionist volunteered to execute the purchase for me As I had been buying tickets for metro e buses and other things in some hotels during my trip I saw no problem When he charged Euro 22 I gave my credit card to complete the purchase as the price was very similar with the one in the internet What was my surprese in finding out that I had bought only Rodin expositon The invoice showed the ticket price as euro 16 and addicional Commission of Euro 6 Even the staff of Grand Palais s ticket office were shocked by the price charged and reported that the real price of the expositon ticket was euro 13 , The instalation cleanliness and location are great The receptionist of the evening turn was great in his information and direction and he had even negociated the refund of the overvallue for caughting a cap due to an accident with the shuttle that I had contracted to take me to the airport 
201936,Villa Beaumarchais, Having the towel drying rack take up the space where you would like to have your legs when using the toilet, Quiet area helpful friendly staff close to transport
201937,Villa Beaumarchais, Disabled toilet in the basement used as a cupboard Other toilet in the basement unavailable , Good breakfast Good access for my elderly mother Garden views good 
201938,Villa Beaumarchais, Nothing, Very quiet although close to main 2 min walk to Metro Very ckean and comfortable Lovely beds good bath and shower plenty of storage Lift also 
201939,Villa Beaumarchais, Reception was very friendly but didn t know about good restaurants nearby , We have been upgraded in a very nice and spacious suite we didn t take the breakfast there 
201940,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and accommodating They were happy to amend my booking due to a missed flight connection and didn t charge me for the missed night which was extremely generous of them 
201941,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Great location and facilities A lovely breakfast room and pub downstairs The lift is glass with murals painted on the walls that you can look at as you go up and down Team there are very helpful and can help with booking of attractions 
201942,Villa Beaumarchais, The gym equipments could be improved , The staff was incredibly nice and helpful We had a truly fantastic day In addition the hotel upgraded us to a suite as we were getting married and this contributed to a magical weekend Breakfast and suite were impeccable and we particularly enjoyed the elegant decorations 
201943,Villa Beaumarchais, Bedroom a little dated bathroom needed an upgrade The breakfast was so so at best , Very Parisian nothing generic here Set in a small lane off a main high street with good restaurants cafe s boutiques fine food shops cheese meats wine bakers etc Great location with a 20 walk into the heart of Paris Helpful staff who speak good English The most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in 
201944,Villa Beaumarchais, The bathroom had a couple of broken tiles but it was very clean so not a problem for us Tea coffee making facility in the room would have been the only thing but this got us out of our room exploring more , The reception staff were welcoming and our room was a good standard double clean and extremely quiet This hotel is down a nice small side street not well represented on google satellite so don t let that put you off directly off a main road which has some lovely cafes and only minutes from a metro station central for all our needs The breakfast was really good hot bacon and eggs fresh fruit and different cakes each morning Well worth the money 
201945,Villa Beaumarchais, We have no complaints Staff were friendly and efficient The plumbing and heating worked perfectly The bed was comfortable The room was attractive and we felt that it was both fresh and cozy , Great location near Marais two Metro lines and Oberkampf restaurants in an authentic part of Paris free of large scale tourism Extremely quiet well equipped rooms on internal courtyard Although rooms are small and hotel lacks some features of a true four star hotel rooms are great value whenever available at the price of a two or three star hotel Strongly recommended to persons who prefer the elegance of the past to the shiny brand new look of an airport hotel 
201946,Villa Beaumarchais, The bathroom appliances could be a little bit more up to date but everything functioned well , Our room was always in perfect condition after it had been cleaned and the cleaning staff was very friendly We also got a nice little gift on Valentine s Day 
201947,Villa Beaumarchais, Room has seen better days needs a needed makeover quite dated Bathroom was very awkward toilet position was bad my knees touched radiator Shower awkwardly positioned too, Perfect location friendly and helpful staff
201948,Villa Beaumarchais, there could have been more hot breakfast choices, Incredible hotel with very friendly bilingual staff First time I ve stayed in a hotel where the photos aren t as luxurious as the reality 
201949,Villa Beaumarchais, Again booking is not showing that the actual hotel is not an old building it s just the facade The name let s you hope for real 18th century but no photos of the architecture inside in our bathroom there were not all products a bit sloppy check out , the location is fabulous central and jet very quite Rooms have atmosphere a little oldish but stylish not too small may be not super clean since there is this all over carpet but O K 
201950,Villa Beaumarchais, Room on small side Would really have liked tea coffee making facility in room , Very good position for all we wanted to do Easy bus ride from Gard du Nord with stop almost outside hotel 
201951,Villa Beaumarchais, The room was very small The decor was old and not well maintained Nobody except the receptionist spoke English The location is not close to any major attractions and it s a considerable walk away from any metro station as well , It s a decent hotel but nothing exceptional that stands out Breakfast was OK 
201952,Villa Beaumarchais, Shower took so long to heat up i had a lukewarm cold partial shower add i thought it wasn t going to get any hotter , Easy to get to from Gare de Lyon and then to CDG airport Staff were very friendly 
201953,Villa Beaumarchais, Everything DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL I have never had an issue with a hotel before let alone made a complaint or left a negative review But after my atrocious hotel experience at Villa Beaumarchais I feel it s absolutely necessary to inform other potential guests I came back to my room after housekeeping had visited to find my perfume broken and placed back on the side table with the cap on to cover up the damage The damage to the nozzle was irreparable Upset as the perfume was a gift and this has never happened to me before I immediately informed the staff at reception and was told that the manager would contact me to arrange compensation for the bottle The manager was incredibly difficult to contact and appeared to be avoiding my repeated requests to talk with her I had to follow up numerous times over the course of several days before sending two emails and calling the head of the hotel group I was told that the manager would telephone me by 5pm she never did Finally the manager emailed me to say that the housekeeper had found the bottle lying on the floor unsurprisingly denied any responsibility for the safety of my belongings despite being a hotel isn t that what you pay for and refused to compensate me for my loss I am absolutely appalled by the way the staff and manager handled my situation the staff were rude dismissive and unsympathetic Not only this but the carpet in the room was wet when we arrived and the wifi worked intermittently I was woken by a baby crying in a nearby room at 3am several nights and we had to pay to print a boarding pass at reception Our room was small cluttered and uncomfortable I repeatedly came back to the hotel rooms to find my belongings moved around despite specifically asking reception to kindly ask housekeeping not to We had to pay extra to use an iron and there was no complimentary water or tea coffee facilities , Nothing 
201954,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, I stayed in a lot of hotels in Paris for 3 years now but this is one of the best Actually all I need is a good bed and a shower in a clean and quiet room for a normal price 60 80 EUR This means I stayed only a few times in Le Marais since the hotels are extremely expensive This time booking com had an offer I could not refuse and I loved it what a wonderful hotel Highly recommended I hope I will be able to stay again 
201955,Villa Beaumarchais, Creepy dead animals pictures above the bed Didn t understand why No toothbrush No hairbrush etc Room a bit small Old small TV , Great location Beautiful hotel lobby 
201956,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Great location close to the Metro Wonderful boulangerie a few doors down on Main Street Benjamin at the front desk was always friendly and helpful as was the entire staff Rooms are nicely decorated I would definitely stay here again 
201957,Villa Beaumarchais, The room being slightly small why was a disembowelled piece of furniture placed where it was difficult to access the curtains This item housed an oversized mini bar when a kettle and cups would have been more welcome and the TV screen As a result the area felt cramped The usual captive hook clothes hangers awkward devices and out of place in a 4 hotel Don t they trust their guests with proper hangers , Unusual location exceptionally quiet and calm Attractive decor Generous size bathroom Helpful staff 
201958,Villa Beaumarchais, General decor is starting to feels a bit old and the breakfast is below average for such an establishment Really could be improved , Location and most of the staff were charming 
201959,Villa Beaumarchais, They didn t fix the safe all the day they promis a wifi free but it s not working at all in the room we had problem that Were not fix small thing make big difference, The hotel is nice and very franch
201960,Villa Beaumarchais, No appropriate heating system while it was freezing Some of staff are arrogant Internet connection is bad Electrical not maintained well Closet doors don t close in a proper way ,No Positive
201961,Villa Beaumarchais, The beds were twins put together instead of one large bed as requested therefore not very comfortable , Beautiful hotel clean with a very good breakfast buffet 
201962,Villa Beaumarchais, some of the rooms need upgrading some have walk in showers some shower over bath there were 2 solo travellers and bathrooms different for the same cost, location
201963,Villa Beaumarchais, Hotel is in need of updating The carpet tile furnishings were ripped worn out outdated from the 70 s , Staff was very friendly Great location 
201964,Villa Beaumarchais, A free cup of coffee in the morning would have been nice , The location was great The room was a good size and bathroom was huge The beds were comfortable The front desk staff was very helpful and gave us suggestions on things to do 
201965,Villa Beaumarchais, The hotel is getting a bit tired but I would go back, Great position in the Le Marais Close to Place des Vosges fashion shopping in Rue de Turenne Rooms are good size comfortable Staff were pleasant
201966,Villa Beaumarchais, Breakfast offering not very good however lots of alternative food offerings in area, Nice area with great vatiety of basic and upmarket food stores restaurants bistros food market etc World famous Bolfinger brasserie 150 years old 10 minutes walk in Bastille area If you are a foodie and art lover this is the area A very good food store Maison Plisson great deli meats cheese plus bistro to eat the products from this store
201967,Villa Beaumarchais, Some decor a little tired but didn t impact on our enjoyment , Very helpful staff comfortable room Quiet surroundings and excellent connections to metro links Lots of bars and cafes nearby They organised a shuttle back to CDG which was worth the small premium 
201968,Villa Beaumarchais, I struggled with the bedding and cushions Not very comfortable , This hotel is like a hidden gem Great value for money the hotel as such great charm and is one of the few hotels in this price range that still provides a bar fridge 
201969,Villa Beaumarchais, The corridors are very dark and we had to fumble along in the blackness I don t understand why the light globes aren t changed to low voltage and they then could be left on , Service was excellent Asked for an iron and it arrived within a few minutes Close to restaurants and shops Very close to the Marais and Place de Vendome Very clean comfy bed and good facilities There are good places in Boulevarde Beaumarchais for a tasty typical French breakfast 
201970,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The place was beautiful and comfortable The staff were very helpful It was a 7 minute walk to the Place de Vosges and not too far a walk from the Seine Very near two metro stops 
201971,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The decor is so charming and whimsical kind of Wes Anderson esque yet still refined and luxurious The concierge was extremely helpful and the location couldn t have been better in the Marais We absolutely loved our stay 
201972,Villa Beaumarchais, Facilities very out of date Need a good refurbishing Very cramped Compared to London way too expensive for what they offer Poor wifi , Well located once you manage to orient yourself 
201973,Villa Beaumarchais, Huge water jet bath was difficult to get in and out needed gallons of water to part fill and hopeless with shower attachment We would recommend smaller bath with shower cubicle Pity the Bar and restaurant are not great lacking character service and quality , Love the Location and the bedroom suite was excellent Staff pleasant
201974,Villa Beaumarchais, Wifi did not work Wifi was advertised was not delivered , Very quiet clean All but one staff member very helpful friendly Great neighborhood close to public transit good restaurants
201975,Villa Beaumarchais, Everything It is located at the end of a dirty and shady kind of street Very difficult to locate Damp environment inside Smelly and damp rooms and corridors No good facilities Not at all a value for money Rude staff Worst place I ever stayed , Nothing 
201976,Villa Beaumarchais, I have no complaints just compliments , It was a small typically French hotel The rooms and baths were large they had a great breakfast and the hotel had a cozy feel to it The staff were nice as is the location of the hotel 
201977,Villa Beaumarchais, The staff was abrasive and unprofessional The rooms were cramped and stuffy The decor overall was outdated without charm The wi fi was spotty when it worked at all , Great location within walking distance of many great bars cafes and restaurants 
201978,Villa Beaumarchais, Breakfast was pretty basic for a 4 star hotel Choice was limited The Superior room we had was in need of some sharpening up Knocks on walls and corners stains of wall paper and carpet wooden part of one of the wardrobes coming off etc All this gives and leaves a bad impression like if they were not bothered enough , Staff very helpful at all times Professional accommodating and kind always with a smile Secluded and quiet location of the hotel Hardly any noise outside Room was spacious bed was comfortable 
201979,Villa Beaumarchais, This hotel is so old fashioned You feel it needs to be fully refurbished integrally The gym was unusable the 2 machines didn t work well at all For me it was a bit depressing overall , The location is good as well as the size of the rooms It is quiet 
201980,Villa Beaumarchais, Furniture and overall looks are a bit worn out The hotel would really require some renovation to bring some fresh air and light up the ambiance which is frankly a bit too dark Paris hotels are expensive by default compared to what they offer Villa Beaumarchais is aligned to this standard but again it s a category fault in this city Breakfast was ok but scarce in options it could definitely be better and provide a richer offer given the price and the hotel tier , Villa Beaumarchais is a fine hotel In a world of aseptic business hotels it manages to bring some charme to your stay in Paris even though it would require some renovation The structure feels parisienne and has a classical touch that works well so if you are for modern hotels this is not the place for you My superior room was big for Paris standards and the bathroom was very spacious and well equipped I even had a nice bathtub Nice complimentary services such as a Nespresso like machine with free coffee capsules It is located in the Marais which is a great spot to be in lots of nice bars restaurants and boutiques Staff was extremely friendly and managed well and professionally a big disservice the first night they had to relocate me to a different close by hotel because they realized they didn t have a room for me While this was quite upsetting they indulged in taking care of my case and offered an upgrade and a few other benefits for the remaining days of my stay 
201981,Villa Beaumarchais, Nothing , The location is excellent Very quiet location which is unusual for Paris Not touristy but still only a 3 minute walk to Place de Vosges Some excellent non touristy dining options almost outside the door Staff are some of the best I ve experienced in Paris 
201982,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The location was great but our check in was a bit chaotic We ended up needing to move rooms and they upgraded us which was really nice but the front desk was not very responsive I ended up having to walk back downstairs after we waited 30 minutes for someone to bring us the new key The breakfast was also terrific and well worth the price Also the hotel was quiet and tucked away which I also really liked 
201983,Villa Beaumarchais, Breakfast set up only ate there once on our day of arrival food dried up and not great offerings , Friendly front desk staff Area good Clean and comfortable 
201984,Villa Beaumarchais, Room s decor a bit dated however excellent value for money, The staff spoke very good English easy to communicate with very helpful Buffet breakfast was very good large selection excellent value
201985,Villa Beaumarchais, We choose the room because of advertised 22sqm size It was 16 Like many others The photos made it appear much larger Fisheye lenses are NOT your friend Hotels It was all a bit damaged old and not nicely repaired For 125 eur you can get much better , The hotel looked nice enough 
201986,Villa Beaumarchais, Fitness center is garbage the hotel has a haunted feeling Pictures are deceiving Parking is a pain Way too expensive The room looks like the 1920s wifi is terrible and never worked half the time The price is ridiculously expensive for everything that was offered , Close to the subway
201987,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The room is a good size comfortable bed clean bathroom with a lovely outlook It s in the best location in Le Marais We loved the area and were very comfortable during our stay Very French interiors 
201988,Villa Beaumarchais, we didn t have breakfast in that lovely internal courtyard as we just needed a coup of coffee in the morning so it would have been nice to have that instead the full breakfast of 15 , We liked the quietness in the middle of Marais as most rooms looked down to an internal courtyard rooms were nicely furnished 
201989,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, It was our 6th trip to Paris and this is the best place we have stayed in The staff were exceptional and helped us in any way they could On arrival we were shown to our room which smelt of cigarette smoke and when we spoke to the receptionist she agreed and moved us to another room no questions asked There is air conditioning and a fridge which is a great thing to have If we go back to Paris we will stay here again Oh and they looked after my bicycle as well 
201990,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The hotel was lovely and staff very friendly Allowed us to check in early and looked after our bags after check out until our flight on the Sunday evening 
201991,Villa Beaumarchais, The size of rooms despite I changed the toom twice the size was never meant to be fir a couple with traveling bags May be for one perso ok, The location The staff
201992,Villa Beaumarchais, Breakfast wasn t included It seemed expensive so we went out for breakfast , The location was great Very quiet and near the metro Only a short stroll to the lovely Place des Vosges Very comfortable bedrooms 
201993,Villa Beaumarchais, The bath tub is wonderful and deep if you want a bath But is very narrow at the bottom and so is hard to stand in and turn around The wi fi was a little weak If have more than 2 devices have to log off of one to use another No coffee tea maker in the room , The location was great Close to Marais and a lot of good restaurants The hotel is very quiet All the rooms face a courtyard so there is no street noise even with the window open We heard no sirens even with the window open rare in Paris where some emergency vehicle goes by every couple of hours The staff was very helpful 
201994,Villa Beaumarchais, Breakfast attendant didnt pay much attention to refilling the empty trays of cold cuts cheese and eggs Past 10pm they had to outsource room service and thus it would take 1 hr for your food to get to you I asked for sliced lemons it took a very long time and I had to always go down to get the ice and etc because the hotel was understaffed On the morning of the checkout I asked for my bill so that I wouldn t waste any time calculating how much to pay etc But when I went to check out it took the Lobby man literally more than 35 minutes to sort out the bill first saying that the bill is wrong and I had to pay 500 EUROS extra then he realized he made a mistake and thus had to process everything again BARELY made my flight , The peacefulness of the hotel structure and the quiet streets the staff were attentive
201995,Villa Beaumarchais, Nothing, Had a boutique hotel feel rather than part of a large anonymous chain and a very nice bar breakfast area Breakfast was a good selection for the reasonable price Staff very attentive and helpful Location was very convenient about 10mins walk into the centre of the Marais district and the Place de Vosge and close to a number of restaurants Cannot comment on the evening meal in room service because we did not use it 
201996,Villa Beaumarchais, The ad said 22m2 bedroom which was the reason why I had booked it but in reality it was more like 13m2 I ordered in room dining which took more than 1 hour to be delivered while I was asked to spend 3x more than I had originally planned 8E turned into a 24E minimum order and was even charged a 5E supplement for a past 10pm order without being informed The toilet smelled like gutter and the bathtub wasn t cleaned properly hair sticking on the walls When I asked for an umbrella at the reception as it was pouring rain outside they told me there is no such service as though I was requesting something totally extraordinary ,No Positive
201997,Villa Beaumarchais, The rooms are a bit small but not terribly so for Paris , Lovely little hotel tucked away off a major street in Paris s La Marais It is a great location to wander in the district close to the metro and shopping of all sorts Staff is excellent Stayed 4 days and wished it could be longer
201998,Villa Beaumarchais, Rooms were small enough hotel breakfast was very costly if you wanted it No hotel nightlife if you re expecting some , Close proximity to some main attractions friendly staff free wifi in the rooms Clean comfortable and what you d want on a getaway break really
201999,Villa Beaumarchais, As picky as it sounds the shape of the bathtub It is raised off the ground and has an awkward slope to it making it precarious when wet My wife being pregnant made for a little difficulty getting in and out But this would never deter is from recommending here or staying here again , It is right off of a main street near two large metro lines two minute walk to one and five minute walk or less to another but it is tucked away on a small quiet side street It is a ten minute walk or two stops from the closest station to the Bastille where you can take the metro basically anywhere The staff was very friendly and accommodating The building is well kept for an old historical building and decorated beautifully There are lots of good restaurants in the area 
202000,Villa Beaumarchais, The Wifi was literally unusable A stingy and illogical internet policy that logs you out every 2 hours and takes about 10 min to login again Continually fumbling with passwords login screens etc When finally logged in its dead slow I found the Internet experience unbearable in this hotel Given that there is barely a 3G signal you are left with no option but to suffer this experience Sort it out Such a wonderful place what a pity to have something as commoditised as the Internet ruin a stay , Wonderful location charming hotel lovely staff 
202001,Villa Beaumarchais, There was nothing whatsoever which failed to please me, The traditional style of the hotel It s quiet but very convenient location The courtesy and friendliness of the staff The impeccable cleanliness of the hotel The spacious and comfortable room
202002,Villa Beaumarchais, There were no tea and coffee facilities nor any ironing facilities in the room The iron and board will be brought to your room if you request them as will a kettle the problem was the cups which always disappeared when the room was cleaned Overall a small inconvenience though , Good location close to Metros and in a thriving historic and creative district Lots of small bistros specialist shops boutiques and galleries within five minutes walk with pleasant parks and gardens waiting to be discovered and prices are very reasonable for Paris If you like exploring and wandering away from the usual tourist areas you will love Le Marais area Staff at the hotel were always very cheery conversational and helpful and most speak very good English although do have a go at speaking French as it helps break the ice We can t comment on the food however as we never ate at the hotel preferring to skip breakfast and have an good lunch in a restaurant or bistro followed by a light dinner in the evening Allied to all the walking that you inevitably do in Paris this meant that not only did we have a great weeks holiday we actually lost weight Bonus 
202003,Villa Beaumarchais, Some of the furniture is old and rusty , The location is excellent close to 3 different metro stations 200 meters The hotel is very nice The rooms are comfortable for a Paris hotel 
202004,Villa Beaumarchais, We have no particular issue with the hotel We can sleep travel from there but it was just not up to 4 star hotel standard in our opinion If we want to use the fitness centre we need to inform reception 5 min prior first the facilities are a bit outdated no kettle very old hairdryer some of the tiles in the bathroom are broken and they tried to fix it but it was not do e properly ,No Positive
202005,Villa Beaumarchais, I had to connect to wifi username password everytime I wanted to use it if you don t use it for a while it disconnects but this is nothing At least it was working , The bed was very comfortable and the room was looking perfect every time we came back at night It was all very clean and even if the room was not huge we had everything we needed 2 blocks from underground station 
202006,Villa Beaumarchais, The safety deposit box in the room did not work, A very good hotel in the Le Marais district Near to the Bastille metro station and with lots of restaurants and beautiful shops around The room was comfortable spacious and quite all in all great value for money
202007,Villa Beaumarchais, The room was small no iron board no decent hair dryer their seemed to be darkish black marks on the wall Not all of the outlets worked and the mysterious 16 charge when I left I paid through booking com so I feel there should have been no other charges , The young staff members were very pleasant 
202008,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Very quiet clean and felt authentic rather than old Very friendly staff at reception only stayed 20 hours so didn t experience much but from what I saw very good 
202009,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, From the moment we walked in we were treated with warmth and friendliness Every single staff member we encountered were both professional and personable Facilities were the same crispy sheets fluffy towels comfy bed well appointed rooms For a hotel in the middle of everything located very close to two Metro stations restaurants main streets I can t believe how quiet it was slept like babies I would highly recommend a stay here 
202010,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Excellent location with easy bus connections recommended means of travel with a toddler and very quite neighborhood Clean rooms with beautiful decor and comfortable beds Very thoughtful hotel personnel They let us check in early set up a crib for our toddler even though we did not ask for it and removed it immediately when we clarified that we did not actually need one Merci beaucoup Definitely our favorite hotel in Paris 
202011,Villa Beaumarchais, Had trouble with the wifi pitty that bar area was not open not much going like having a drink or relax after a full day in the city , perfect location for exploring le Marais and Paris nice atmosphere Very quite for a good night sleep 
202012,Villa Beaumarchais, nternet was a bit slow Breakfast was nice but not terrific I would go there again though , Everything Location staff service really quiet outside and inside 
202013,Villa Beaumarchais, I booked a room with a king bed but the bed was actually a queen European discrepancy I guess The bar was never open in the evenings all during our stay , The wifi worked well and the staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful Close to Metro and nice neighborhood 
202014,Villa Beaumarchais, No power shower and the water pressure wasn t great , We arrived and got told we were upgraded our new room was massive and had a hot tub The staff were all friendly and spoke good English Location wise it was just off a busy street however our room was nice and quiet as it overlooked a court yard The museums such as Pompidou centre and Louvre were walking distance with good transport links for Montmartre and Eiffel Tower 
202015,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Location is in a quiet street Conveniently located very close to a metro station Hotel personnel are very helpful and courteous My room was always cleaned Can t fault anything when I stayed there Will be back soon if not sooner 
202016,Villa Beaumarchais, It is hard to say I cannot find any faults with this place , On our arrival we were given more comfortable room than I booked at the same price We could check in before check in time The staff was nice and helpful The room was huge clean and very quiet After the check out we could leave our luggage in the hotel for free till our departure The staff remained extremely nice and helpful The hotel is in Marais east off the heart of Paris but nevertheless we could easily walk to Notre Dame and Rive Gauche without straining ourselves Picasso Museum and Pompidou Centre two steps away DO NOT miss lunch in a near by little restaurant Le Petit Marche Absolutely phenomenal We will come back Im planning to stay there with my 10 year old son when going to Paris to visit Disneyland 
202017,Villa Beaumarchais, might come across a bit dated and old fashioned furniture some rooms seem a bit run down, very quiet great Location hidden and not overrun personal staff nice breakfast buffet 
202018,Villa Beaumarchais, There could have been more padding on the mattress over the springs , The location was good for exploring It was very quiet on the fourth floor as the room looked into a court yard and had good interroom sound proofing
202019,Villa Beaumarchais, NO complains, the catalogue is long 1 location near a metro station and in a very posh area with rich nightlife and host to one of the 2 organic o en markets in Paris 2 Building and premises clean neat elegant cured to the minimum detail 3 staff very professional and very polite 4 interiors of very tasteful design 5 comfort safety luxurious details everywhere 6 comfortable spacious room with superb bed and linen so good smelling always super clean bathroom perfectly working with hot running water to wash away all day s fatigue 7 extra warm and sound proof making it an ideal nest for the cold winter nights 8 great breakfast which we did not taste as we opted to get our petit dejeuner around Paris 9 beautiful furniture and nice books in the lobby 10 great hospitality of the hotel

202021,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Amazing staff very welcoming and incredibly helpful when we planned our trip to Versailles Lovely room facing the courtyard which was peaceful in such a central location Would very happily return another time 
202022,Villa Beaumarchais, The check out process very slow in the morning just one person trying to serve everyone The carpets are updated and smell they give an overall look of updated The neighborhood is not in the center of everything almost a km from Bastille and Marais, The croissants were exctra flakey and the bed extra comfy the room was spacious and the bathroom even more
202023,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Paris was in the grip of a very cold snap during my short stay When I arrived in my room I found out that the heating was not working I informed reception and they not only sent someone to check it immediately they offered me to change room or to bring me a powerful electric heater Let s not forget profuse apologies and the kettle I had requested on booking form came with a large assortment of teas and biscuits on top I opted for the heater and my entire stay there was snug and warm Also appreciated fast broadband and enjoyed the magazines newspapers left at guest disposal in the lobby and on every floor Will definitely go back 
202024,Villa Beaumarchais, I would appreciated a little more diversity in the breakfast , I lived for 3 years in Paris and the hotel s neighborhood is really great The hotel is located in a small street that is very calm and quiet and nearby of great city sites And the staff is very kind and polite 
202025,Villa Beaumarchais, The room was too warm and we couldn t work out how the heating worked , We were keen to explore the area of Le Marais and this Villa Beaumarchais was brilliantly located 15 minutes from Gare Du Nord and only a few minutes walk away from Le Marais and Bastille The staff were super friendly and very informative 
202026,Villa Beaumarchais, The only thing I missed was being able to make tea in the room It could be ordered from the bar but the bar wasnt always open , Quiet rooms no problem sleeping with windows open Breakfast was good with variety Roomcleaning and change of towels every day The hotel is in a quiet area of Le Marais Close to many great restaurants and cafes 
202027,Villa Beaumarchais, two electrical sockets in my room did not work not great as these were in front of the mirror so i couldn t plug in a hair dryer or straighners, A beautiful area and quiet hotel perfect for a good nights sleep
202028,Villa Beaumarchais, Room and furniture need renovation Urgently bathroom looks renovated WiFi very cumbresome and not easy to use , Location Atmosphere Friendliness of staff mainly reception ones Very pleasant lounge breakfast area Nice and delicious breakfast 
202029,Villa Beaumarchais, I inquired at front desk about boat trips on the river and locations specifically Batobus It was confirmed that the nearest station was Jardin des Plantes just 10 minutes walk That station was closed and the website confirmed it That caused us both partly disabled some discomfort and could have been checked , Staff very willing to please from first email contact through front desk parking porter and dining room We felt cared for 
202030,Villa Beaumarchais, In the evening we asked the receptionist to order taxi to the airport for the next morning The answer was it s impossible now you should do it in the morning 10 15 minutes before Next morning half an hour before leaving I asked the receptionist another one to call taxi and the answer was you should have done it in the evening it s too late The taxi arrived in time but those endless minutes of waiting , Great location A lot of interesting places within walking distance Comfortable room Nice and helpful lady at reception 
202031,Villa Beaumarchais, Information staff gave us was often misleading , Great location Quite spacious as for Paris and comfortable room Cosy lobby Very calm all the rooms face the inner court 
202032,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Location location location worth paying a small amount extra for ocean view also when you depart the alilaguna boat look up and hotel is in front of you so you should use alilaguna
202033,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, The location was wonderful quiet and central to all the parts of Paris we wanted to visit The staff were friendly helpful and courteous We would recommend the Hotel to anyone 
202034,Villa Beaumarchais, Not much left for breakfast but we did get up very late Still at 14 euros each for not a lot we only had breakfast once at the hotel , Good Location Good Bed Good air conditioning regulation
202035,Villa Beaumarchais, nothing simply a great place to stay , Very calm staff very helpful great Location in the centre of the Marais a real Villa with old furniture nice Change to all the very modern Hotels 
202036,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, As our vehicle was too tall for the reserved parking area the staff went above and beyond to find us parking Very impressed with the hotel staff and the lovely breakfast 
202037,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, I could walk to so many places I wanted to see Notre Dame Mussee D Orsay le Louvre My room was spacious and comfortable with a window I could open to get a light breeze 
202038,Villa Beaumarchais,No Negative, Superb hotel in a great localization Le Marais Near the subway Beautful patio in the hotel and delicious breakfast Clean nice and spacius rooms Great service Beautiful hotel with soul 
202039,Villa Beaumarchais, As mature couples we prefer a shower but 55 cm bath rim makes life difficult Also as English people we do like a cup of tea first thing a kettle in the room would have been nice Yes room service was their but haven t got the figure for that first thing in the morning , Hotel was close to the metro open top busses and the Batobus river bus making it excelent for getting around Paris
202040,Villa Beaumarchais, No one to greet at breakfast when I arrived then waited for me to start eating hot food then demanded for me to sign a paper reception called a taxi that is more expensive than usual mould around the tiles in the bathroom, Location comfortable bed peaceful food quality
202041,Villa Beaumarchais, I had no hot water the entire three days Some of the staff are very nice and others seem to be uncaring Also one of the staff gave me completely wrong directions on how to get somewhere and I ended up going way out of my way , It was very close to two subway stops and an easy walk to the Marais The center courtyard is very cute 
202042,Villa Beaumarchais, We were double booked for the first night I had booked months in advance so this was slightly annoying disappointing to receive an email only a couple of days prior to departure informing us that we had been offered a place in the sister hotel 1K We met other couuples this had happened to This hotel based on peruvian design had the feel of a nightclub everything very dark and although everything in our room was high spec our windows opened onto a very noisy road which kept us awake all night This was a hotel of acquired taste Our luggage was transferred by the hotel but it would have been nice to have had free breakfast for example for the inconvenience , The bedroom was so peaceful and the windows opened out onto a quiet courtyard with green foliage climbing over the walls This was in stark contrast to the busy cosmopolitan buzz of the city It was fab to be so close to many great places in Le Marais and yet have a relaxing sanctuary to go back to All of the staff were polite welcoming and very helpful The breakfast was a great start to the day a large varied selection of buffet style together with a few hot items such as scrambled egg A good water pressure to the shower and piping hot water bliss Best of all it felt like we were in a traditional Parisian hotel Loved it Thank you 
202043,Villa Beaumarchais, Nothing , Good location short walk to the Batobus Underground parking Interesting painted wall viewable from the glass lift Room small but had all you needed 
202044,Villa Beaumarchais, The room smelled suite 1 like an old basement when we opened the fridge to grab a drink we found an old pack of prunes partly decomposed inside There was a problem with the hot water and we did not have any during our stay We had to engage with the manager to receive a compensation which was more of a joke than a partial reimbursement ,No Positive
202045,Villa Beaumarchais, This was our second stay at Villa Beaumarchais this month Our first just the two of us was excellent This time we needed extra space as one of our adult sons was arriving in Paris and staying overnight as well So we booked a junior suite It cost a fair bit extra but really was little if any larger than the earlier room Having the toilet separate from the bathroom was good but overall it was a let down relatively speaking , The staff are great Breakfast is very good It s in a great spot but still very quiet 
202046,Villa Beaumarchais, We requested an iron and ironing board and the only iron they had in the whole hotel was broken this meant we had to go to our dinner at the Eiffel Tower in wrinkled clothes ,No Positive
202047,Villa Beaumarchais, rooms really need to be renewed bathroom not well cleaned some long black hair found in the tub tile broken not replaced bad smell in room like all of these hotel type the reception and the commons are renewed but not the rooms overrated not a 4 star comfort but surely a 4 star price even though discounted , nice reception and dining room but we don t sleep there 
202048,Villa Beaumarchais, We had to clean the bath out before we used it as it still had hair and dirt in it from the people who were there before us The walls were covered in marks and the wardrobe doors had piece of wood missing had been broken off It was a bit scruffy especially for the price we paid per night The wifi didn t work in the room which was frustrating I would say this was a two star hotel A member of staff also over charged us for our drinks and we were given coupons for complimentary drinks which we weren t able to use as the cocktail maker was never there We were not offered a substitute I wouldn t stay here again , The staff were very friendly and polite They would print us out directions of how to get to certain attractions and allowed us to leave our bags in reception after we had checked out so that we could still go about town during the day before we travelled home The breakfast buffet was also fantastic 
202049,Villa Beaumarchais, The breakfast was slightly overpriced for the quality but the buffet options were excellent with plenty of choices so it was an easy option to start a rainy day on a full stomach , The location is great and within easy walking distance to many fine places to eat and drink Staff was very helpful friendly and accommodating The decor was a bit dated but we found it charming The bar downstairs was also nice and the bartender friendly and helpful We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and bath and we slept through the night and morning without troubles We will probably stay here the next time we are in town 
202050,Villa Beaumarchais, No tea coffee making facilities normal for Paris and not near easy airport transport so the only real option is a taxi , In a quiet area off the busier roads Very pleasant environment and very clean with fresh towels etc daily Larger than expected room 
202051,Villa Beaumarchais, our first night was cancelled and we were relocated to a sister hotel which was disruptive and disappointing even though we got up traded into a great room it would have been better not to move , The wonderful staff especially Farez who went out of his way to ensure our stay was perfect 
202052,Villa Beaumarchais, Air conditioning was very weak No tea coffee making facilities in a 4 star hotel Duvet was too thick for the summer season and there was no separate top sheet to use instead on hot nights , Pleasant decor Having a minibar 
202053,Villa Beaumarchais, Somewhat small room for 4 th class hotel The toilet had little space and I had so sit somewhat sideways to use it because of a drying of towels were installed in front , Close to center of Paris Very quiet location to be in the center 
202054,Villa Beaumarchais, he room was a little bit small but that s Paris for you , This is a comfortable wonderfully located hotel near the metro I would stay here again 
202055,Villa Beaumarchais, The hotel advertised a gym but anytime I went it was locked I suppose I could have asked at reception for the key but it gave the impression they didn t really want it to be used The bar area was always empty so didn t provide much atmosphere , We had a lovely room which was spacious clean and comfortable The reception staff were welcoming and helpful 
202056,Villa Beaumarchais, Bathroom a little aged but clean Air conditioning in bedroom quite old but OK Safety security box in bedroom needed replacing , Fantastic buffet breakfast in a lovely dining area bar Convenient and quiet location 
202057,Villa Beaumarchais, Rooms were quite small and in need of refurbishment, Vey good location in the Marais and close to metro and restaurants Staff were friendly and helpful 
202058,Villa Beaumarchais, The transfer service did not greet us upon arrival at cdg airport as expected We wasted one hour searching for the driver Finally showed up one hour later Complained at the front desk and they seemed not to be bothered We paid for a service which we did not receive,No Positive
202059,Villa Beaumarchais, My stay started during one of the July 2015 heat waves and unfortunately the air conditioning system was down for a few days but all in all it was OK as there were electric floor fans available The hotel contacted me one day before my arrival offering a full refund because of the broken A C that had just occurred but I had not time to find another hotel so I kept my booking The room was quite big but a bit old fashioned furbished and the bathroom tub had poor sanitary joints attached to the wall , Rather well located in a rather quiet part of central Paris The hotel is not too big mostly arranged around an inner courtyard where the breakfast place is located in the veranda basement Would maybe recommended it for a quiet romantic stay in Paris if room price is not an issue
