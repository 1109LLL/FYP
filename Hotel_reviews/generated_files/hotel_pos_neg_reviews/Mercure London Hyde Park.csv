246911,Mercure London Hyde Park, The bathroom was very small There were cobwebs above the lamp shades hanging from the high ceilings , The bed was very comfortable The staff were welcoming and professional 
246912,Mercure London Hyde Park, My wife has a wheelchair and we told the hotel about this but they were unable to provide a ramp to get up to the front door My wife had to get out of the chair and climb 3 or 4 steps Staff helped us Very small room no space to store wheelchair had to climb over the bed to get to the otherside , helpful staff
246913,Mercure London Hyde Park, We booked for a standard king room for me my husband and 4yr old kid However they said they couldnt let my child stay in the same bed with us even if their policy states that choldren below 12 stay for free as long as sharing existing bed We ended up paying additional 50 per night which was out of our budget It was such a hassle and it was a really unpleasant experience , The rooms were clean and location was easy access 15 mins via heathrow express and there are a lot of buses to ride on going to oxford st picadilly etc 
246914,Mercure London Hyde Park, Basement family room was extremely hot not sure how effective the air con was , The whole stay was lovely Unfortunately we had to wait a while for our rooms to be ready beyond check in times but staff were very apologetic and we received complimentary breakfast for the delay 
246915,Mercure London Hyde Park, Be warned that there is no parking It is in a Resident Only parking area though staff did watch our hire car through Check In procedure , Comfortable room and bed Excellent bathroom efficient air con Friendly helpful staff Less than 5 min walk to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express About 20 min walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street Crowded breakfast room in basement but OK 
246916,Mercure London Hyde Park, The room is not very large but it was enough , 15 minutes from Heathrow Airport with the Heathrow Express Walking distance to Paddington Tube station and shops and restaurants I was tired of old rooms in the other hotels this hotel has new rooms and small but a nice bathroom They also provide a free smart phone for your stay for local calls and internet There is a short cut from the hotel to the main street so no need to walkt around the park to reach to the hotel 
246917,Mercure London Hyde Park, For the room tariff the room was small There wasn t enough room to put up the luggage rack , Room service as in cleaning and making up the room was excellent 
246918,Mercure London Hyde Park, A few more hooks in the well finished bathroom would help keep it tidy , The front desk staff were very friendly and did their best to make us feel welcome Nothing was too much trouble The room although compact has every modern convenience you can wish for To maximise space luggage can be stored under the bed A free smart phone is provided preloaded with useful apps which helped us find our way around London The rooms are tastefully decorated and our room overlooked the quite garden like square at the front of the hotel 
246919,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and the rooms were small but nicely furnished very comfortable beds Bathroom again was small but good The staff helped us when we needed a Dr for our daughter I will stay again and highly recommend this property There is a nice little park in the middle of the square where the hotel is located and it was off the main road so was relatively quiet 
246920,Mercure London Hyde Park, I had to go and ask for extra supplies for Tea Coffee Sugar Milk not a problem though just an oversight Could do with seperate hair conditioner to complete your complimetary toiletries , Had a lovely stay very pleasant and accommodating staff at your hand to help Bed was very comfy room was super clean Nice to get towels that are big and the extras touches of toiletries was a treat The self serve buffet breakfast was value for money and covered all you would want 
246921,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was too hot air conditioning didn t work Room was very small and completely different to what was in picture wouldn t have gone if I knew what the room looked like No toothbrush ,No Positive
246922,Mercure London Hyde Park, The smallest breakfast plates for the buffet breakfast basically a saucer Having said that the buffet was top notch , Lovely clean hotel in an excellent location with friendly helpful staff 
246923,Mercure London Hyde Park, 50 00 taken on my credit card even though I had already paid in full for my stay Had to request immediate release of the 50 on departure but will be a few days before it is refunded I thought this practice was no longer allowed in the UK , Great location 
246924,Mercure London Hyde Park, I was travelling with my baby and her buggie there are some steps at the entrance of the hotel and to the breakfast room that were a bit of an inconvenience The room was super small to the point where the baby s buggie wouldn t fit on either side of the bed It could only stay on the internal aisle between the bed and the door I found breakfast to be quite expensive for what it was I reccomend saving the money and exploring other restaurants in the area , The personnel was super nice and helpful The room decoration was really pleasant I loved the breakfast potatoes 
246925,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was far too small bathroom tiny no bath just about enough room to walk around the bed no room for luggage minimum storage space tiny desk Minibar advertised but not stocked it was a fridge really expected a lot more space for the money , Location excellent air conditioning good breakfast good
246926,Mercure London Hyde Park, I couldn t change my reservation because I paid in full in advance , On a very quiet street with Paddington station right around the corner One of the nicest hotels in the area Boutique with a modern updated charm 
246927,Mercure London Hyde Park, There could have been more variety in the breakfast Other than that our stay was perfect , Super modern room nice space Bathroom floor was heated my wife loved this feature Few steps from Paddington very convenient location Staff was nice and helpful 
246928,Mercure London Hyde Park, No dislikes it was a lovely place Sure a bigger room would have been good but this is London and there are not many big rooms available unless you want to pay big dollars , The property was very close to Paddington Station and the trains heading out to Heathrow Airport The room though small was of a superior standard with quality furnishings A ground floor waiting area was also of a superior standard All in all this had to be one of the better places we stayed in in the UK 
246929,Mercure London Hyde Park, The cost was much more that other hotels of similar standard in the area I was charged more than was quoted by Booking com and a prepayment was taken from my bank account a month before our arrival The first two nights we spent there were in a very small basement room where we could not even open the frig or wardrobe as the bed was wedged against them The staff originally refused to move us to a room that was pictured on your website and our booking sheet I would not have booked the tiny room we were given and only after explaining the misrepresentation were we changed for the last 3 nights of the stay , The bedding was fresh and clean Good location 
246930,Mercure London Hyde Park, Rooms were very small barely enough room to walk around the beds , The hotel was very modern new in appearance and clean The staff was very kind and accommodating They allowed us to store our luggage on the last day in their luggage room Unexpectedly our room came with a smart phone equipped with data free to use This was very helpful in walking around the city since our phone did not have international data This hotel was very conveniently located to Paddington Station Would definitely stay here again 
246931,Mercure London Hyde Park, Very compact room 2 people couldn t pass each other in room and door hits wardrobe when you enter noisey room as next to the lift Breakfast expensive so ate elsewhere Minimal beverages in the room , modern facilities lovely deco throughout very quirky furniture in reception and extra large towels in bathroom Fridge in room a bonus especially if staying for longer periods of time Staff very welcoming went out of their way to show us to the adjacent bar as our room wasn t ready when we arrived 
246932,Mercure London Hyde Park, The room was tiny just big enough for a bed but the hotel has public spaces if you need a bit of elbow room and don t mind the mod decor , A chic hotel in a convenient location The room was tastefully appointed and the bed was oh so comfortable Nice to be able to open the window on a cool evening Located on a quiet square with a peaceful green space a perfect respite from the chaos of London Just two blocks from Paddington station with easy access to and from Heathrow The staff is friendly and helpful Try the London bike share system and take a ride on the canal trail north of Paddington station Head east to Caunaght Road for pubs and interesting restaurants away from the tourist hordes near Paddington 
246933,Mercure London Hyde Park, The breakfast was very disappointing Although the food was OK the plates to have your breakfast on are far too small There wasn t enough room to have a nice size breakfast plus room to cut your food up Only negative comment to make , It was small and personal Very friendly and helpful staff who couldn t of done anymore for us The rooms are very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable 
246934,Mercure London Hyde Park, Can t think of anything really , We thought the mobile phone provided by the hotel was the best idea we had come across on our whole trip We used it mainly to find our way around London The hotel was in a quiet street close to Paddington station for easy access to the city and to Heathrow 
246935,Mercure London Hyde Park, No parking on site at all which is stated in the description it s just inconvenient for loading unloading a vehicle with luggage as all the parking out the front is for residents of the neighboring apartments , Very nicely decorated good facilities good breakfast great location 
246936,Mercure London Hyde Park, Nothing, The staff were very helpful and friendly and we were upgraded to a super room on arrival The hotel has recently been tastefully refurbished The hotel is in a quiet square so no noise from passing traffic or bars 
246937,Mercure London Hyde Park, The breakfast was a buffet The cooked food in heated vessels It was the same every day Fruit and yogurt very ordinary considering the availability of better products The towels in the room were thick and luxurious bath sheets but there was nowhere to hang them to allow them to dry A towel rack would have been helpful First world problem tho , It was just newly renovated Beautifully done
246938,Mercure London Hyde Park, The fact that in order to operate the lights your key card had to be inserted in a wall receptacle Then all lights were on all the time If the other person was sleeping you had to shower in the dark to avoid waking them , We liked the proximity to transportation the best Room was well decorated but cramped and less than efficient 
246939,Mercure London Hyde Park, Smallest king size room I remember staying in Tightly packed even for regular sized rooms , Great service and hospitality Excellent location and very nice neighborhood Just what I expected 
246940,Mercure London Hyde Park, Rooms were very tight no place to put a second suitcase, Nice bathroom with a great shower High tech room with USM plugs in the walls so less need for converters 
246941,Mercure London Hyde Park, If the room was only 10 12 square feet larger I could call it exceptional and an excellent excellent value for a couple For a single guest it could work very well as it stands , The location of this hotel approximately one block from Paddington train and underground subway stations is excellent The rooms are postage stamp sized but otherwise very well equipped iron hair dryer flat screen TV convenient excellent bath and shower comfortable bed and functional in room coffee and tea In addition each room is equipped with a Handy and its charging station The Handy is an iPhone sized smart phone that the hotel invites the guest to take during the day and use for various tasks including free phone calls including internationally and GPS mapping of the guest s location while traveling the streets and attractions of the city This Handy proved indispensible to our enjoyment as we moved about London 
246942,Mercure London Hyde Park, The rooms and general space were smaller than I am used to But this is common with the hotels I have stayed in London generally , The location was serene and had good accessibility Also enjoyed sitting in the small park area in front of the hotel to have tea and smoke a cigarette 
246943,Mercure London Hyde Park, Rooms aren t the biggest but I guess that s what you get for almost central London , Very friendly staff who couldn t do enough for you Less than 10 min walk to Paddington station and tube 25 min walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street Plenty of choice at breakfast 
246944,Mercure London Hyde Park, Bed doona was a bit hot heavy for summer weather , Bed was very comfortable Room a bit small perfect for overnight stay Bathroom excellent Very clean hotel room 
246945,Mercure London Hyde Park, The bedside tables were dusty , The staff were incredibly helpful The location was amazing We were chosen as the VIP of the day we had our room upgraded as well as other offers which was a real bonus 
246946,Mercure London Hyde Park, One useable outlet in entire room No space to store bags or manuver around bed No towel bar in shower I paid extra for two beds What I got was two beds jamed together with no space between no space around perimeter Instant coffee only Come on this is not 1950 , Staff tried very hard to accomidate
246947,Mercure London Hyde Park, As for London the room was small and compact, The room and hotel were bright modern and new on a quiet side street away from mainstream Also close to train station and services The breakfast would satisfy most needs The use of a mobile device for free phone calls and local travel needs was an added bonus 
246948,Mercure London Hyde Park, We just got a bit confused at the beginning and went to the wrong Mercure It would be nice if their website had a map from the station so you could see exactly how to walk from Paddington to the hotel Not just words but words and graphics would be handy The blow dryer has to be used from the bedroom you cannot use it in the bathroom as there is no plug for it This seems to be a Mercure thing Not sure why they don t get this part but it is a bit inconvenient Maybe they have more male visitors and it is not an issue , This is a very new facility that is modern and stylish The location is pretty handy If you arrive at Heathrow you just take the Heathrow Express and it is 15 minutes to Paddington Station then a short walk to the property There is one older Mercure a bit closer but this one is about 12 minutes walking from the station The staff showed us a shortcut through an attached restaurant and that shortened the walk from the station by about 5 minutes There are lots of restaurant options very close and even more if you want to walk a bit further It is a short walk to Hyde Park and the underground is right there at the station so you are close to all the main attractions The room was really nice The shower is great it has a push button to start it No guessing and fiddling around You just press the button and the shower is happening Wonderful Staff is very friendly and helpful There is a free smart phone to help you with finding attractions and you can use it for making calls too Very handy And the room has all kinds of charging facilities and outlets so all your devices can be charged There is a fitness room too Last but not least the staff is really friendly and helpful 
246949,Mercure London Hyde Park, We were booked in the Mecure but were in the wing of the Hotel Indigo It was a bit confusing who we were meant to speak to about facilities and issues We went to the Mecure desk to ask for an extra sheet it never arrived and we wondered if the guests of a room with the same number in the other wing might have wondered why they had an extra sheet The staff at the hotel Indigo desk were not as friendly As it is London the room was very small given the cost , Very close to Paddington station and easy access to the train to Heathrow Plenty of places to eat Found a great breakfast option Cafe 8 on Praed St if you choose not to have breakfast in the hotel The front desk staff at the Mecure were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and quiet 
246950,Mercure London Hyde Park, However I was very upset by how the hotel assigned rooms At first the hotel assigned us the room in the Hotel Indigo as they said we stayed for a longer period and the Hotel Indigo which they said was part of the same parent company had a larger room We got a really small and shitty room and this hotel was not at the same standard star level as Mercure This was not what I paid for 4 star hotel I spent more than half an hour and tried to get a room in the Mercure We were selected by the computer system to relocate to a different hotel because they oversold the rooms Doesn t it sound like another UA event , The location is very good really close to Paddington station and the subway The room is small but the facilities are good The hotel was renovated before so the hotel is in good conditions
246951,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, I travel to London frequently and used to live there This is the best hotel I have stayed in Couldn t fault it will be asking to stay here when i return next Room was very spacious always cleaned to an excelling standard very comfortable stay felt right at home 
246952,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was smaller than expected and storage and hanging space limited Certainly limited if travelling with more than one case as we were so had to leave a lot in cases We had privilege Room which is supposed to be 22 Square meters per website details I would be surprised if it was 16 18m2 including entrance and ensuite The room is per decorated and furnished as picture on website but it is smaller than it looks there is practically no room other than the bed Half a meter maximum either side and a meter at end of bed so very tight A small desk but you cant pass if someone is sat there We had to ask for additional toiletries and towels on a few occasions and there were some minor cleaning issues A nice room but not Privilege and smaller than advertised , Excellent location Very close to Paddington Station and transport links Nice quiet square Also easy walk to Hyde park The hotel is Boutique style and is cosy and comfortable Nicely decorated The breakfast choice is very good 
246953,Mercure London Hyde Park, The room is quite small but Ok if you just need to sleep some hours Some more accessories in the room would be appreciated , Great position for who fly to Heathrow and take the Heathrow Express to Paddington it s 5 minutes on foot At Paddington you can easily find the underground to the city center There are also some restaurants and pubs nearby you feel the place safe I had a good walk during the early night 23pm 
246954,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room doesn t get completely dark at night Noisy hallway Very small room Make up mirror in the wrong position Pillows not comfortable Duvet doesn t fit the cover Poor water pressure in shower I couldn t rinse my hair properly after washing it Croissants at breakfast a bit doughy Breakfast ok but leave room for improvement Seating in breakfast room could be better the lay out is not good Over priced hotel We paid 445 for one standard king room for two nights and didn t feel it was worth the money , Comfortable bed good air conditioning Clean and crisp impression of the room Nice bath towels Helpful staff Plenty of electrical sockets in room Good hairdryer 
246955,Mercure London Hyde Park, Particularly room was advertised as a family room but was really just a basic double room with a cot We were also put on the lower ground floor directly below reception and lobby meaning you could hear suitcases rolling and shoes constantly above along with not having black out curtains and a sensor light that turned on and off throughout the night That room should not be used for guests and certainly was not a value for money , Good location near Hyde Park National Rail Paddington and Tube
246956,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was opposite elevator I was woken every time it was used room was so small it was a struggle to get round the bed and once my case was on the stand you couldn t get round at all also there was a dangerous shelf above the coffee tea facilities and as I leant in to select my coffee I caught my head on its sharp corner I reported this to management but they didn t swam to care about guests wellbeing, High standards in room good bathroom shower safe deposit box and comfy bed
246957,Mercure London Hyde Park, One room I stayed in was a little bit tiny but it was only for me so it didn t phase me , The service from everyone at reception room service and the cleaning lady were all incredible Everyone was friendly and welcoming which was nice given I was a solo traveller a very long way from home They looked after me extremely well and couldn t do enough to help 
246958,Mercure London Hyde Park, Nothing, Very comfortable modern hotel with all the facilities in room that you might need Very comfy bed good shower good size room Breakfast was simply excellent best I have had in a London hotel Really friendly helpful staff Will use again 
246959,Mercure London Hyde Park, They issued a pre authorization for the entire stay Single double room was too small Poor continental breakfast selection but good quality If you stay more than one night then you have to eat the same things The room was super small and expensive, Good for one night stay The hotel is clean
246960,Mercure London Hyde Park, Only a minor thing but the water pressure was so weak it was very difficult to wash my long tick hair and get all the soap out , Great Hotel They even give you a smartphone to use for the trip I was there on business so I needed to use my phone but it was a nice option 
246961,Mercure London Hyde Park, Nothing , This hotel was only taken over by Mercure 6 months ago and completely refurbished In 20 years of Paddington hotels this is probably the best I ve found Very comfortable room friendly staff and brilliant location I will certainly be back 
246962,Mercure London Hyde Park, The restaurant is shared with a nieghbouring hotel and can get very busy this meant the buffet was constantly needing replenishment and at times this took longer than you d like because of the number of staff on duty who were always welcome would recommend this hotel, Great location on Talbot Square and in no time you can be in Hyde Park or Londons shopping areas Very helpful staff 
246963,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room is a bit small but that s to be expected in London , Generally comfortable Location was good as it s near to the Paddington Station it took us about 15 minutes to walk to the station There are lots of shops and eateries around the hotel Staff was friendly 
246964,Mercure London Hyde Park, The cooked Breakfast could have been hotter and the glass sliding door into the reception area of adjoining hotel at the rear of the restaurant for security and heat reasons should be kept closed at all times , Reception staff were very helpful and polite and always pleasant The ground floor twin room was spotless but quite small with no view at all 
246965,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room and bed were both too small We booked a Standard King room but were given a very small room 13 sq m , Modern Clean Quiet Close to Paddington station 
246966,Mercure London Hyde Park, Breakfast If there is anything that they can really improve it would be this The food served was ok but it gets really boring if you are staying for more than 5 days as it is the same thing every single day It is inconsistent perhaps 6 12 times I had breakfast they ran out of cutlery cups etc and I had to ask someone before they brought new clean ones out The servers were mostly grumpy and unpleasant some of them were ok but most of the staff there made us feel like they d rather not have us there Sometimes the person in charge of greeting guests as they come in do not even greet us or say hi which I find very strange , Our overall experience in this hotel was good we stayed for a total of 12 nights and had the standard room Location The location was great since we are touring London Paddington was one of the best stations to live close to since you can easily transfer and take different lines There are several types of restaurants near the hotel as well Indian Greek Lebanese Italian Steakhouses Fish Chips Pubs etc Rooms and facilities The rooms were clean although a bit small if you have several luggages like us 2 big 2 cabin size then you might need to re pack your things every night and put them away after getting what you need to make room for some space The toilet was great and modern we had no problems with the hot water and the floor was heated which was really nice especially as it was still quite cold when we stayed there Front desk reception Everyone in the front desk and reception were nice and accommodating everything was done efficiently and sometimes they accommodated some of our special requests They know how to properly handle customers so it was really pleasant communicating with them 
246967,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room bathroom corridors was deceptively small Breakfast arrangement was poor a scrum experience disorganised too busy , Shared areas stylish and modern
246968,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, Close to Paddington but very quiet Smart phone provided for customer use which was very handy free uk phone calls etc Staff very helpful and polite 
246969,Mercure London Hyde Park, The breakfast downstairs in the hotel was good but on the Monday in the Brasserie it was a bit chaotic , Staff were very helpful and friendly The public area bar was nice for sitting in and the drink prices were very reasonable 
246970,Mercure London Hyde Park, Breakfast on weekdays in pretty much shambolic and not a great selection expected better Asked for bottle of champagne to be left in the room on our arrival 25th wedding anniversary but this was not done as you can understand this spoiled the moment somewhat , Excellent location friendly staff
246971,Mercure London Hyde Park, More plugs That s it , This is a great little property The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly The room was small it IS London but well designed Comfy bed great shower and I loved the electronic do not disturb ready for cleaning buttons on the door Clean comfy close to transportation 
246972,Mercure London Hyde Park, No powerpoints anywhere near a standing position in front of a mirror to plug in hairdryer Hair dryer cord so short that I could not actually blowdry my hair anywhere near a mirror Universal theme in every European hotel I ever stay in but with a brand new refurb I always wonder how this gets overlooked every single time Incredibly irritating whether travelling for business or leisure , Small but perfectly formed room Incredible location just 5 mins by foot from Paddington Station Heathrow Express Amazingly quiet tranquil considering proximity to major transport hub Divine bed and pillows Wonderfully accommodating staff Immaculate bathroom the joy of a recent refurb Excellent value for standard decor location Would book again 
246973,Mercure London Hyde Park, Can t really think of anything , I ve stayed in many hotels in the Paddington area and this is the best one by far For the money it provided excellent value and service room was outstanding hotel was very quiet and staff were very polite and helpful Breakfast was also good 
246974,Mercure London Hyde Park, Check in area and bar are a bit small but it was satisfactory, Quiet and comfortable room Walking into the West End across Hyde Park on a beautiful morning
246975,Mercure London Hyde Park, Like many London hotels compact cosy rooms and one tiny lift , Close to Paddington Station Good breakfast selection Friendly efficient staff Good wifi Fresh modern decor 
246976,Mercure London Hyde Park, N A, The hotel room was small but very well equipped The hotel is beautifully presented and the decor is fresh and modern The staff were helpful 
246977,Mercure London Hyde Park, room clean up service is poor and making mistakes e g Only refill you with one towel after clean up room give you the other thing instead of what you requested , Very nice reception and clean hotel
246978,Mercure London Hyde Park, The kitchen extractors were right beneath us so couldn t have the window open due to the noise and the breakfast smell in the morning from the extractor was too much , Bed was extremely comfortable Decor was lovely and modern 
246979,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, Loved the proximity to Oxford Street and Paddington Station The staff was very helpful I found Pedro and Marko to be very pleasant and courteous with all guests they were just incredible 
246980,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, The central hotel location is excellent minutes from Paddington tube and train Staff were friendly and efficient The room was great bed incredibly comfortable and the provision of a smart phone for guests to use when out and about in London was fantastic Will definitely stay there again and would recommend it to others 
246981,Mercure London Hyde Park, Not easy to cool the room down as we don t like a warm bedroom , The hotel has been completely modernized to a very high standard The staff were extra helpful 
246982,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, Having been given a room on the lower ground i e basement dungeon we advised we were not prepared to accept a room below ground with no windows The staff went out of their way to find another room and even upgraded us to an excellent room o the first floor 
246983,Mercure London Hyde Park, Breakfast didn t match the same level as the room and the reception staff, The staff were so lovely I arrived late and they booked me a wonderful room lovely bed and facilities also very quiet
246984,Mercure London Hyde Park, My room was very small this was really disappointing, Great location near Paddington station The hotel is new and cozy the staff is great and helpful
246985,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, Very modern hotel and although bedroom is small bed is very comfortable with beautiful bathroom with all amenties Good breakfast Attentive and helpful staff You can walk through their sister hotel which brings you out 2 minutes from Paddington station 
246986,Mercure London Hyde Park, A bit too far away from main sights but depends on why you are in London so consider your activities weighed against the hotels location , Comfortable bed quiet location 
246987,Mercure London Hyde Park, The room service is not good the staff making multiple careless mistakes just in my 3 night stays including gave me 2 shampoos but no body wash put it pyjamas in my luggage instead of on the bed , The hotel lobby is really modern and relaxing
246988,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, All the staff went the extra mile provided us with the best advice on where to go for food Were more than accommodating to look after our bags And to top it off it was my birthday and there was a little Happy Birthday gesture in my room So thank you Will definitely go back 
246989,Mercure London Hyde Park, It was a bit too hot in the room It would have been helpful to have a lighter bed cover option T, Friendly helpful staff attractively decorated rooms 
246990,Mercure London Hyde Park, Price seems high but I suppose this is London and I was booking quite late , Loved the location near Paddington but also far enough away from it to avoid all the low quality parts of that area Staff were great room simple smallish but perfect for solo traveller breakfast was great and gym facilities very New and good quality Would definitely stay here again Ps big recommendation is the Victoria pub 250m away what a fantastic little traditional pub
246991,Mercure London Hyde Park, We booked a family room but this was basically a room with a very uncomfortable fold out bed in There were not enough towels for three or amenities In addition to this the room was too hot and not enough air for three people as it was so small We opened the window but could not keep it open as there was some sort of flue outside it buzzing away and expelling dirty air into our room Very disappointed with the size of the room and the lack of tea coffee cups towels etc for our son , The staff were very nice at the hotel and the decor was very nice 
246992,Mercure London Hyde Park, All ok really breakfast room feels cramped and hot long queue at coffee machine I dont want to queue for toast coffee etc But wouldnt stop me re visiting if price was right , Location bed size of hotel Staff Walking distances good to Hyde park Paddington Good underground access Taxi to oxford st 8 10 during the day 
246993,Mercure London Hyde Park,No Negative, The only negative thing was that we came here just for 1 night The Hotel was modern very clean and bright the staff room facilities breakfast were superb Definitely will stay here during the next trip 
246994,Mercure London Hyde Park, I stayed first in a standard room but felt claustrophobia Standard room are tiny and expensive so I would not recommend But once upgraded to Suite it was PERFECT , lots of choice within the buffet breakfast Suite bedroom huge modern beautiful view on tall tree and buildings Extremely quiet Kindness and availability of the receptionnist always here to help have a nice chat and give advices 
246995,Mercure London Hyde Park, There was a downpipe that came through our room which was boxed off so we heard every flush from other rooms The illuminating sign in the room was very bright during the night, Nice rooms and decor excellent shower nice facilities in the room
246996,Mercure London Hyde Park, Cleaning crew not thorough in their cleaning Left the sign to clean the room one day and the room was not cleaned at all Didn t always replenish the supplies Dislike the shampoo and shower gel quality and smell and that you have to pray that they replenish those mini bottles During the week the croissants are inedible leftovers from day before Fruit salad has no taste Coffee bitter of low quality Too bad the courtesy mobile phone doesn t allow tethering , Rainshower big tv courtesy mobile phone with data useful for finding your way in London
246997,Mercure London Hyde Park, Noisy people in room next to ours also at 4 a m Room was quite small , Mobile device with mobile internet for use all day e g Google Maps etc Room was nicely decorated and comfortable Quiet surroundings no traffic noise 
246998,Mercure London Hyde Park, Bedroom very well decorated but there were no hooks for overcoats nor towel rails in the bathroom so you had no option but to roll up wet towels A bit style over substance , Location Any problems dealt with quickly 
246999,Mercure London Hyde Park, There was nothing we didn t like the only thing we would say is that the room could do with more teabags , The staff were absolutely lovely and very friendly 
247000,Mercure London Hyde Park, The evening before my arrival at the hotel booking com sent me an email saying that they couldn t verify my credit card so maybe my booking was not sure I red the email once in the airport at the gate just before boarding it was not a good news I don t why but their booking system didn t accept my credit card VISA maybe because it s a rechargeable card I don t know But in other places in London it worked However I had also brought cash so at the end I had no problem at all Just be sure that your credit card works or bring cash , Everything Extremely good location 2 minutes walking from Paddington Station but in a very calm corner With the Underground you can go everywhere Very kind and gentle staff room very clean with kettle tea soluble coffee and chocolate biscuits In the bathroom there were shampoo body soap hairdryer tissues they didn t forget anything 
247001,Mercure London Hyde Park, Not the cheapest mercure hotel I have used but I suppose this is central London , Great location very nice renovation job making the old building modern and trendy on the inside great breakfast and good gym 
247002,Mercure London Hyde Park, It s not possible to open the window and some more hooks for towels would be helpfull , The staff was very very welcoming attentive and helpfull The room was clean stylish but small The breakfast is rich and fresh Wifi worked well Hyde Park Paddington station Marble Arch etc are in a comfortable walking distance 
247003,Mercure London Hyde Park, Nothing negative to say , I have stayed in many hotels from Grandiose to humble and I would just like to say that the Mercure was superb Great hotel but what made it was the Staff a wonderful group of people who made me feel very welcome And not just the hotel staff but the Girls in the restaurant too warm friendly helpful and always with a smile on their faces I cannot rate them highly enough stay yourself and see 
247004,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was slightly on the small side London size although perfectly adequate and very comfortable, Hotel refurbishment on changing ownership is absolutely first class Modern very comfortable and ideally situated Garden view wonderful 
247005,Mercure London Hyde Park, Not so much something I didn t like but something that was a little confusing is the fact that the hotel is linked to another hotel Indigo Hotel attached at the back and we ended up staying with them in a separate apartment a couple of doors down The apartment was on the third floor with no elevator but that was just a minor issue One of the staff was happy to carry the bags for us Also the Mercure website doesn t seem to list this actual hotel Mercure Hotel at Talbot Square on their website so it was very difficult to phone them directly It is easy to confuse it with another Mercure Hotel right closer to Paddington Station We stayed at the Mercure Indigo Hotel in Talbot Square , The hotel Mecure Indigo is in a fantastic location just a few minutes walk to Paddington Station one of London s key hub stations and just minutes walk to Hyde Park It s also next to lovely little park Talbot Square that you can access It s clean very neat and the breakfast buffet is excellent The staff are very welcoming and go out of their way to be of assistance They are as good as any hotel staff I ve ever met We had a family room two adults two teenagers and it was perfectly fine It even had a kitchenette I definitely recommend this hotel and would be very happy to return 
247006,Mercure London Hyde Park, Not really a hotel for families a high chair had to be located from elsewhere No restaurant on site , Large bed everything ready for arrival Staff friendly and helpful 
247007,Mercure London Hyde Park, The Heater didn t really work but it was not so bad , Bed was comfortable Cleaning up everyday It s about the same with Japanese hotels Close to paddington station taking for 5 10 minutes on foot No slope I booked a single room and Dubble bed the room was not so huge 
247008,Mercure London Hyde Park, Non of the plug sockets in our room worked couldn t charge our mobiles or watch TV we have phoned reception and they send the porter which was really nice out but he didn t really know where to look I think all they needed to do was go to the fuse box as it might just have trip from previous people Breakfast food itself really yummy but didn t look like the staff wanted to be there we waited to be seated but no one came so we sat ourselves then after a while got one of the members of staff attention to ask how breakfast work , Staff was very polite Breakfast was good
247009,Mercure London Hyde Park, Food could probably be improved a little, The hotel is modern and nice The staff were really helpful and friendly And the location is close to all the attractions
247010,Mercure London Hyde Park, Cleanliness not sufficient not the right place for people with claustrophobia rooms are tiny and hallways narrow, Location quiet and close to Paddington Station modern and stylish interior and rooms friendly staff
247011,Mercure London Hyde Park, Only downside which isn t too much of an issue as we were never in the room for long is that the rooms are on the small side but that s really nitpicking , Stunning hotel extremely modern furnishined to a high standard Excellent location 5 minute walk from padding tube station 5 minute walk to Hyde park 20 minute walk to oxford street The staff are friendly and eager to help Bathrooms are beautiful and the shower is amazing Smart phone in the room to use out of the hotel was really handy to have as our map for our stay really nice touch 
247012,Mercure London Hyde Park, Walking 5 flights of stairs as the lift was not in operation yet Good form of exercise but tiring after a long day out Room is on the tiny side which is OK for one person but may too crowded for two There was lack of space to open up the luggage , The hotel is newly refurbished very clean and everything in the room was in working order Love the warm rain shower and comfortable bed although just a tad too high for me to hop in There was an ironing board in the room which is helpful for those who need to iron out the creases to look good for an important meeting The lift was not working yet but the staff in attendance were very helpful and carried my luggage up and down 5 floors of stairs Excellent location near to London Paddington Station restaurants caf and souvenir shops Overall a great stay 
247013,Mercure London Hyde Park, Room was too small Lift didn t work first day No toilets on ground floor so if your having a drink or chilling in the lobby you either go ro your room or downstairs, Very very NEW Great staff Huge TV neet toilets and cupboard
247014,Mercure London Hyde Park, No bath 25 charge incase of use of mini bar etc have to wait a few days to get it back, Easy to navigate around if walking to different places like hyde park Breakfast was lovely staff were friendly
247015,Mercure London Hyde Park, The main problem of the hotel was that the room was TINY especially if you consider the amount of money we paid for it It was so tiny it was not even comfortable I am extremely disappointed to be honest I do not know the size of the ot, The location is great it is literally 2 minutes away from Paddington train station 
247016,Mercure London Hyde Park, the hotel I was hopeing to get was so looking forward to staying they again, not the hotel I booked could not have shower as bath to high very poor for what I paid
247017,Mercure London Hyde Park, We went t see a show and arrived back at 11 10pm it would have been nice to finish the night of with a drink but the bar was closed and we were told we couldn t get a drink and the nearest place was Oxford Circus We were 4 ladies who wanted a night cap not a group of young ladies wanting a night out , Access to transport and restaurants and very good breakfast excellent value 
247018,Mercure London Hyde Park, The 2 single beds were slightly small, Everything about the stay ws wonderful i hve been mny times to london and that ws the most enjoyable
247019,Mercure London Hyde Park, Wrong number of beds for guests in our apartment compounded by late night staff who did not know how to fix the problem The manager of the Indigo Hotel next door comped us a room so all could sleep that night The Mercure team owe him a huge thank you , Hotel was closed for renovation the annex our apartment was open Breakfast was served at the Indigo Hotel next door Best buffet breakfast I have ever seen or tasted Hotel was perfect location for getting around London
