329865,H10 Casanova, All the staff at the bar area were extremely rude so due to this I wouldn t recommend this hotel, The pool and bar area The decoration of the hotel
329866,H10 Casanova, One of the main reasons we booked this hotel was due to the pool however on a number of occasions we were unable to use it as we couldn t get a seat or a Sunbed which there was only 8 of The room was ok a lot of space for so little furniture The bed squeaked every time me or my partner moved and wasn t very comfy The balcony was excellent and the doors to the balcony was sound proof however the room itself wasn t and every morning we were woke by the cleaner vacuuming the hall , The staff at the hotel were really friendly and accommodating We were able to keep on our room to 3pm for an extra 30 despite check out being at 12pm The location of hotel was excellent and the transport links around the hotel to get you to the top tourist spots around Barcelona were all so excellent and really close to the hotel 
329867,H10 Casanova,No Negative, Took the AeroBus to and from the airport 5 90 EURO each way Easy 2 3 block walk from bus stop Spent the evenings walking around Barcelona easy access to University Metro Line Hotel was clean staff was courteous bed was comfortable A C was good and the shower was phenomenal possibly the best shower I have ever experienced Also the WIFI was Super Fast 
329868,H10 Casanova, Nothing Loved the stay, Friendly and accommodating staff Gave us rooms together as requested Were always helpful with directions and request for kettle It was delivered with additional biscuits and a smile 
329869,H10 Casanova, Had a room that backed up to the elevator which we heard through the wall , Great location and very helpful staff Good variety with the included daily breakfast with very convenient times 
329870,H10 Casanova, The third bed was super hard and not very comfortable and the water in the shower just had a weird smell , The property was in a great location had nice modern amentities The air conditioning worked really well and the double doors to the balcony ensured it was nice and quiet 
329871,H10 Casanova, Breakfast is very poor for its price with low quality and not varied Room was strange TV was not facing bed stairs between bed and wc they just adapted a corner of building for this room , Location is ok Reception staff was kind and professional 
329872,H10 Casanova, We did not partake in the welcome champagne drink offered as we don t drink alcohol There was no non alcohol drink offered , The bed was absolutely comfy and I slept on an additional bed brought to the room as a 3rd sleeper Best pillows my head ever rested upon Hospitality of staff was outstanding Very impressed with the service we received Will highly recommended them to all interested to seeing Barcelona Wish them to keep up their excellent service 
329873,H10 Casanova, Stayed on the fourth floor and floor smelled like carpets were cleaned with dirty water the whole floor not the room Requested a smoking room and did not get It was the little things that added up that didn t make make me feel great about spending 200 euros a night on a Monday in the early months of may ,No Positive
329874,H10 Casanova, Photos of skybar on website show it at night but it shuts at 7 so bit misleading , We stayed in a suite which was lovely spacious huge comfy beds 10 minute walk to La Rambla and 5 mins to nearest metro Complimentary glass of champagne on arrival was v nice touch as was the complimemtary water in room each day 
329875,H10 Casanova, Breakfast expensive Some splashes on the ceiling in the room not sure what it was, Comfy bed Clean room Modern Staff very helpful Lovely rooftop area
329876,H10 Casanova, Buffet breakfast was expensive compared to local cafes nearby which offered similar food options, Good atmosphere in the hotel bar area each evening with a local DJ nice powerful shower good location near to main tourist streets etc nice to have cava on our arrival 
329877,H10 Casanova, The room was spacious enough however walls are very thin When napping during the afternoon I could hear the laughter screams of people in their rooms which was very annoying , The staff were very accommodating of my requests and even went the extra mile to make me feel special on my birthday I had the most amazing and relaxing massage would definitely recommend a trip to the spa The room was neat tidy and spacious enough The hotel itself is a 10 minute walk to Placa Catalunya which is extremely convenient and it s by a road which has a lot of taxi s that drive through so was easy to grab one to go to where I needed to Really loved the location 
329878,H10 Casanova, Only niggle was no tea coffee facilities in the room which Is a must when staying for a few days Can request kettle from reception but it s subject to availability , A good standard and nice modern hotel Welcomed with a glass of presseco Comfortable big bed Balcony Perfect Location with easy access to metro
329879,H10 Casanova, No shelf in bathroom to put toilet bag Bath had a fairly large chip in the enamel which hadn t been repaired well , Beds were comfy On 7th floor so no road noise Staff were friendly and helpful 
329880,H10 Casanova, Customer service from the staff was appalling our room wasnt ready until 5 30 pm we had been on an early flight from Dublin and wanted to freshen up before seeing the city staff were so unhelpful had very little English were also very rude Also had to pay 4 euro for ice to be brought to the room and a local tax when checking out that I was never made aware of Hotel had an Elvis night on the last night Saturday pumping music until early hours of the morning and we were up for an early flight Very disappointing altogether ,No Positive
329881,H10 Casanova, As a general comment the hotel is in need of some investment particularly in the bedrooms where the d cor is tired a bit shabby and the furniture has been well used I am sure the rooms vary but mine was very dark with just a small corner window facing into a courtyard The dark coloured furniture did nothing to brighten the room There was a sense of staleness and lack of freshness The only negative on the breakfast which was really very good is that the scrambled eggs on all three mornings were poor overcooked and unappetising looking surprising as the Spanish do them so good There is no proper restaurant but you can dine from a limited menu right through the day and evening from the bar area where there are about four tables not the most atmospheric dining experience but expect most people go to restaurants nearby Because I was on a yoga course I was not in going out mode so dined in bar on two evenings and have to say bit to my surprise the caprese salad was the best I have ever eaten and the other dishes I saw looked great too , The hotel is in an excellent location on the Grand Via and about five minutes walk to Placa de Catalunya and the top of La Rambla There is a great choice of restaurants nearby I had a very comfortable and spacious room superior with spacious well functioning bathroom The Wi Fi was excellent quality and easy to use The breakfast was very good with great variety and very friendly and excellent staff The staff on reception were very professional helpful friendly and smiley always ready to offer a complimentary glass of cava to sip while a query is being dealt with I stayed for three nights and on the night of my arrival I realised I had left the key of my suitcase in my car at the airport One of the managers took great time and patience to open it without damaging the case in another hotel they would have you calling for a locksmith 
329882,H10 Casanova, The lighting in the room More English speaking TV channels could have been available The workout area needs an upgrade More space and better working equipment is needed It was still cold so the roof deck did not add anything to the stay The plunge pool is very tiny , The location was great Less than 15 minutes from the airport with no traffic and walking distance to Las Ramblas and shopping mall The suite was reasonable size and clean The extra half bath in the living room area was convenient for me being that I was with my teenage daughters They loved the selfie mirror in their bathroom The breakfast buffet was consistently good with enough choices for my vegan daughter to leave satisfied They had fresh fruits and at least one meatless dish every morning They also had soy milk 
329883,H10 Casanova, Cold pool on roof terrace bar not open Not keen on view from back windows but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room , Welcome glass of cava on arrival Jar of jelly sweets at reception to help self to Great location close to University where great reasonably food can be found Also on route of Aerobus from Airport Easy walk to city centre and Las Rambles 
329884,H10 Casanova, I honestly don t think I could fault the hotel and I would definitely stay here again as l often go to Barcelona, Location was great 10 min walk to catalunya square and metro station right outside
329885,H10 Casanova,No Negative, Good location 10 minute walk from the main square Rooms very clean great size wet room comfy beds During our stay it was my husbands 40th birthday and through no prompting delivered champagne and strawberries to our room Great service thank you
329886,H10 Casanova, Having to change rooms due to our request for a balcony not given so changed to a room with balcony however having to compromise on the room spec e g original room was great Stunning bath wet room shower lovely layout but new room only had a shower layout in the room was not as good, The bed was very comphy location was spot on room service was a lovely extra touch mini bar in the room well stocked Helpful staff lots of info as to what s going on when location advice I would recommend the bus tour on your first day Main routes red blue Green for costal resorts you Can get on and off as many times as you like runs 10am 7pm for 30 you get to see experience everything in one day of plan your trip from that bus journey as to where you want to go on your trip 
329887,H10 Casanova, To be picky probably more hangers in the wardrobes especially for couples , There was a good selection on the breakfast buffet We had a couple of initial problems that were sorted out very quickly by friendly and efficient members of staff including a change of room and being upgraded We found all staff friendly and approachable 
329888,H10 Casanova, Nothing the hotel is ideal for those looking for a break in Barcelona , A fantastic weekend at the H10 Casanova It was a special occasion for our family and all the staff from the moment we arrived were superb Every little thing the hotel did for us made our stay special 
329889,H10 Casanova, Wait for check in and check out was a bit sluggish and a little frustrating that the TV in the bedroom didn t work nor was it repaired having reported the fault , Quiet comfortable room and hotel in good location for sight seeing and transport links Very accommodating with extra bed and confirmation of booking was efficient too 
329890,H10 Casanova, The decor it was too dark and small very modern and no place to relax if you didn t want to stay in your room Finally it was a sunken room with stairs leading down to the beds I think it s a bad idea to have steps leading to the bathroom especially if you are trying to go to the bathroom with minimum light you could trip slip , Loved the shower and the location of the hotel The staff in the hotel were amazing recommending places to see and making restaurant reservations for us 
329891,H10 Casanova, Extra pull out bed was very uncomfortable for our 10 year old so he had to share with us Sky bar on the roof terrace was closed which was a little disappointing even though we had several days of great weather and spent a few hours enjoying the sun up there , Hotel is in a Great location central to everything Breakfast options good and staff friendly 
329892,H10 Casanova, We had to change rooms as the first room we were given smelled badly of cigarette smoke An unpleasant surprise in a non smoking hotel Also the furniture was showing signs of wear and tear and cleanliness was not perfect The new room was of a much better standard Still I would not call this hotel value for money I d expect more of a four star hotel at least breakfast included , Excellent location staff willing to solve issues nice view from the rooftop bar 
329893,H10 Casanova, pool is not really a pool more of a sit on the edge and dunk your feet in gets crowded easily as it is a small area on the roof top, very comfortable good location friendly staff
329894,H10 Casanova,No Negative, We had the suit room which was excellent very spacious we made use of the hotels roof top pool gym facilities they were also excellent we had booked breakfast for the next morning all the food and service was of a very high standard the hotel was also only 5mins walk from the centre I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a classy central hotel 
329895,H10 Casanova, Housekeeping staff kept knocking on our door for no reason we d answer and they d shrug their shoulders and walk away Then do it again an hour later This happened every morning It got very annoying , Great roof top plunge pool and comfy beds
329896,H10 Casanova, Breakfast was too expensive for what it was Location wasn t great I d pay more next time for a better location The pool on the roof is a bonus but there are very limited beds so we didn t make use of it in the end preferring to trek to the beach instead Awful view overlooking a courtyard Bedroom furniture was scratched and worn , Comfy bed Powerful shower Good to have air con 
329897,H10 Casanova,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful The rooms were clean and comfortable The hotel looked exactly like the pictures and we had a pleasant stay I took my mum to Barcelona for her 40th birthday present The hotel staff were aware of this and sent a bottle of champagne and platter of strawberries to her room which was a lovely touch 
329898,H10 Casanova, Nothing, The reception manger rudolf was amazing My husband and I were celebrating 30 years marriage And rudolf arranged for champagne and chocolates for both rooms as I had some friends with us I felt that rudolf went above and beyond 
329899,H10 Casanova, View from our room over looked a small courtyard and shabby apartment block no price list for the mini bar, Upgraded free of charge 12pm check out helpful reception staff large beds great location central for public transport and attractions 
329900,H10 Casanova, One hour wait to check in even though we arrived at 15 30 terrible wifi mini bar items squashed in No apology for the wait , Well laid out room clean comfortable bedding
329901,H10 Casanova, The rooms where overlooked from everywhere and had to keep the curtains shut for privacy We ordered a superior room which was not good don t know what the building was before a hotel but not suitable changed to a hotel and would not stop there again for the money we paid , The location was good 
329902,H10 Casanova, The drinks at terrace bar were a little pricey but that seems to be the way for premium chain hotels nowadays, The superb wide ranging buffet breakfast was kindly included after an issue with leaking ceiling led us to be transferred to neighbouring Universitat H 0 for 1 night The hotel made every effort to contact us to advise us of this That did lead to more unpacking and packing to return for the 2 remaining nights in an upgraded room which was superb 
329903,H10 Casanova, Difficult to arrive with a car drop off zone is hard to find and to get to , Great Location Great rooftop terrace great junior suite great selection for breakfast
329904,H10 Casanova, if you are a young couple this hotel would be perfect but with kids you may chose a little bit closer hotel to the center, close to metro and buses to beach
329905,H10 Casanova,No Negative, Bed was really comfortable Location is excellent and staff at reception are extremely helpful Also received a glass of champagne at arrival It was a nice touch Would defiantly stay again Great experience 
329906,H10 Casanova, Would have been nice to have a tea and coffee facility in the room , Location was perfect and the hotel was very relaxed but efficient We could borrow an iron and an adapter very easily and our rooms were cleaned everyday Roof top bar and plunge pool was the best 
329907,H10 Casanova, No coffee tea making facilities in the room No charging ports for phones tablets etc Poor lighting in the bathroom a universal problem , Excellent staff and superb choice for breakfast The location of the hotel was central to most must see sights and although on a main road was very quiet Comfortable bed 
329908,H10 Casanova, Two beds joined together instead of a king size bed Lots of noises in the room Can hear the others next door Flush not working properly Wifi very temperamental , Fantastic location and hotel staff Loved the sky bar on the roof Nice design of the hotel rooms 
329909,H10 Casanova, Has to change rooms initially as first room had a strong bathroom smell However staff moved us straight away and second room was excellent Would like to have had tea and coffee making facilities as there were none , Very convenient and central to all the main attractions Very friendly and helpful staff 
329910,H10 Casanova, More staff needed at reception as it seemed they were trying to do too many things at the same time but in spite of that they were very friendly polite and helpful , Very friendly and helpful staff at reception and the glass of cava on arrival was lovely The location was also very good We stayed for 1 night only and would definitely stay again 
329911,H10 Casanova,No Negative, The location was great Beds were so comfortable and air conditioning in the room was excellent Staff were helpful and friendly and went out of the way to make our break enjoyable 
329912,H10 Casanova, Nothing Excellent location to many transport links , Staff where very friendly and couldn t do enough to help us The room was clean and cleaned every day Roof top bar and plunge pool was fab although a little expensive but what do you expect for a 4 hotel With this in mind the hotel bar had no problem opening opening our shop brought wine and providing glasses There is a metro station just down the road and if you need taxis the hotel reception will call one for you The bus stop to and from the airport is also just round the corner less than a 5 min walk away 
329913,H10 Casanova, Breakfast to be cheaper , Big bathrooms with lots of extra complimentary toiletries front desk staff so helpful nothing was too much trouble Asked for iron and was sent to my room asap with an iron board Rudolf look after us very helpful Lovely jelly sweets everywhere 
329914,H10 Casanova, Breakfast was very expensive Tea coffee facilities were not in your room as standard Had to call reception who organised for a tray to be brought to our room , Lovely hotel very clean and modern And staff were very friendly and helpful Offered a glass of bubbles when we arrived which was a nice touch 
329915,H10 Casanova, The staff should be more kinder and well prepared when it comes to questions for the surroundings of the hotel Thank you, good location good view nice room 
329916,H10 Casanova, Rather more style than comfort The star rating seems a little high as room facilities are basic no bathrobe Fixtures and fittings need repairing in places , Staff were very helpful and charming which did compensate for this rather costly stay Bed comfortable and lotta pillows Place clean and pleasant but expected a lot more at these prices 
329917,H10 Casanova, No tea and coffee facilities in the room, It was my birthday when visiting without telling them they surprised me with a bottle of cava chocolate covered strawberries and a voucher for money off at their spa 
329918,H10 Casanova, room was a bit worn out also furnishers were a little used up and overall we got the feeling that the place was in need of refurbishment Overall quite ok but hey where is value for my money , very central location easy to find and close walking distance to allmost everything Most friendly stuff all clean and service of high standard

329923,H10 Casanova, Noisy had to keep windows closed and use air con Low light levels in hallways chocolate brown ceiling and voile curtains and mushroom coloured walls in room were oppressive , Good breakfast
329924,H10 Casanova, It s a common gripe from me but if you advertise a double bed make it a double Two singles placed together is not a double the single I slept in however was reasonably comfortable , Staff throughout were very nice and professional yet without being snobby Always helpful and had smiles on faces 
329925,H10 Casanova, No bad things to report , Gorgeous hotel The rooftop area is great and the service was exceptional They really went the extra mile to make my birthday a special day Can t wait to stay again 
329926,H10 Casanova,No Negative, The whole ambiance of the place to the staff and the location I had the pleasure of staying here over 3wks with different groups of friends from the uk Every1 loved it and a special thanks to the staff We wer unfortunate to be pick pocketed on the street and the staff couldn t of been more helpfull Cannot fault this place
