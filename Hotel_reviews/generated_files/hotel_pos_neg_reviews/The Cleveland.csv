169806,The Cleveland,No Negative, Had the studio room and was very happy great location friendly and helpful staff getting into the main parts of London was very very easy I would stay here again and recommend it 
169807,The Cleveland, My only recommendation would be tea and coffee facilities in the room However the hotel reception did have posh coffee available and you could take back to the room , Staff were very friendly The room was spacious and comfortable Bathroom facilities were clean and water hot My day started very early and so I wanted to check in and chill out I did just that I was also able to order food to hotel and the staff were great at providing me a range of cuisine options I had a fresh chicken burger with sweet potatoe fries and it was lovely One of the best I ve tasted in a while

169809,The Cleveland,No Negative, Good location close to the underground and restaurants Good room including small cooking facilities Perfect for working Comfortable bed good modern bathroom 
169810,The Cleveland, My room 7 was tired looking and in need of some updating and extra comfort Small things like a hook for a towel next to shower or a tray in the shower for bottles would be useful The tap was loose on the kitchenette sink but it still worked OK Also if you have a hob why not leave some pans with which to use on it , I liked the reception staff who were very helpful
169811,The Cleveland, We were on the 1 floor room 8 and could not get mobile connection in the room so if that is going to be very important to you check with reception , We stayed in one of the deluxe studio suite which has a small kitchenette It was lovely spotlessly clean Very roomy like a mini studio apartment perfect if you are having to live in London for a short time for work and would like the freedom to have some food in your room helps the budget too Hob fridge kettle toaster and microwave plus crockery Ensuite with walking shower loo and sink plus more homely features such as a decent bathroom cabinet with lighted mirror plenty of towels and lovely toiletries HUGE king bed plus sofa which made into a single flatscreen tv wallmounted which could be moved in all directions small wall table and chairs plus seperate little wall table and chair with mirror and hairdryer perfect as a dressing table No onsite restuarant bar etc made for a quiet hotel Good strong free wifi Great as a base for further exploring or if you need a home away from home whilst staying in London for work project 
169812,The Cleveland, Just felt a little misled as deluxe suite felt very basic not special as I had hoped from the website Staff brill though and moved us to a prettier room and refunded difference in cost Make sure to book luxury room if you want it to be romantic , Loved the location staff really nice and room and bathroom very clean 
169813,The Cleveland, NOISE from outside our bedroom window We were in Room 18 first floor room at rear of hotel Although there was no noise from other guests adjacent rooms in the hotel we were kept awake at night by a loud electrical hum from somewhere at the rear of the building We could not establish where it was coming from but it kicked in at about 10 15pm and then on and off throughout the night It sounded like a compressor on a refrigeration unit Very very loud intrusive and resulted in very little sleep on Friday Saturday nights It was so bad we decide to end our trip return home a day early We did ask on Friday night if there was another room we could relocate too but were told there was nothing available , Excellent location Very clean good comfortable bed Useful kitchenette so able to do basic self catering 
169814,The Cleveland,No Negative, bed was very comfortable and a good size area is quiet at night and easy to get a good night sleep having a mini kitchen in the room is a real plus a good selection of channels on the tv 
169815,The Cleveland, You could order a basic breakfast that was not the best but having the kitchenette makes up for it, The staff were very helpful and as I had an unplanned visit from my overseas family members I was able to have them stay with me as I could have an extra bed added to the room This was so wonderful and really made my holiday great The hotel is in a good spot just minutes from Kensington Garden and buses plus circle and centre line train stations so access in and around London is easy I definitely recommend the Cleveland
169816,The Cleveland,No Negative, Good location Friendly and helpful staff Spacious room Nice and free coffee at lobby Good kitchenette in the room Has a perfectly working elevator
169817,The Cleveland, Room was very small but this seems to be normal for London unless you pay a lot of money , Very safe area we walked around at night with no problems at all Short walk the tube and restaurants Staff were great Kitchenette was small but as expected from the photos Bathroom was good 
169818,The Cleveland, Room was a wee bit small for family of three bed sofa okay but had to be quickly folded up to give any room , Great location quiet but close to lots of good bars and restaurants 
169819,The Cleveland, The shower door kitchen faucet fridge and trash can did not work properly , The location was good close to Paddington station and Hyde Park The rooms were very clean 
169820,The Cleveland,No Negative, Very good value for money we ve got room 18 The room is very clean and cosy with high patterned ceilng it is adequately sized considering London standards and it has all basic facilities bath accessories hair dryer wardrobe safe electrical splitter two tables and two chairs and even a tiny kitchen where we cooked breakfast cookware provided upon request The location is perfect quiet place next to to the Kensington Gardens 5 minutes walking distance to the Bayswater tube station and Queensway street where one can find plenty of grocery stores mobile providers pharmacy and souvenirs We were pleasantly surprised with high quality Nespresso coffee and tea at the reception area The staff was very nice The night shift concierge was exceptionally nice and helpful Thank you very much

169822,The Cleveland, The bathroom too small very loud shower door Heavy stains on the carpet One whole DAY WITHOUT WATER , Nice nonsmoking upstairs room on the top floor Very comfortable bed
169823,The Cleveland, Room was a bit worn albeit clean ugly stains on the carpet and in the shower room was too large and furniture too few to feel comfy , Large room ground floor friendly staff very pragmatic and good service when there was a small issue with my invoice 
169824,The Cleveland, It was great , Helpful staff Responded quickly to concern about hot water Very accommodating about cleaning room Good coffee in lobby Great location 
169825,The Cleveland, The room was very hot at night and fairly dark during daylight hours due to the basement location There was a window but it looked over dark atrium , The bed was comfy and I liked the addition of a kitchenette in the family room 
169826,The Cleveland, The sofa bed should be renewed it dipped in the middle and our daughters kept rolling together in the middle a couple of sore backs after our 3 night stay Might be ok for kids only , The king size bed was very comfy
169827,The Cleveland, My Daughter had placed a cigarette butt in a bin and we were accused of smoking in the room which I have stated didn t take place they have debited my credit card for 100 pounds and refuse to credit it back , rooms were all good and comfortable
169828,The Cleveland,No Negative, Traveled with family and enjoyed our staying very much comfortable beds specious rooms friendly staff different metro stations nearby complimentary coffee and tea at the lobby 
169829,The Cleveland, Pillows a little flat and hard for my liking but otherwise perfect , Very comfortable and quite spacious room especially by London standards Great location quiet but easy walking distance to Hyde Park and several tube stations plus Paddington Station to use Heathrow Express from airport 
169830,The Cleveland, Nothing, The room was very good clean and comfortable bed Great location and the little kitchen facility a great bonus Staff very pleasant and helpful
169831,The Cleveland, If you have noisy neighbors in the hallway it can wake you up Just bring earplugs , Excellent value for price and product I would definitely book this hotel again Perfect for a sightseeing holiday 
169832,The Cleveland, Small TV need a larger screen , Room was large comfortable and kitchenette was well appointed Heating worked Bathroom is a teeny bit small but cannot be helped because of the layout 
169833,The Cleveland, We were in an attic room not ideal if tall not reached by the lift which meant a lot of stairs so if you can t manage stairs let them know in advance to get a room near a lift The kitchenette would be useful for a longer stay I guess but it would have been better for us to have a coffee pod machine especially as the reception coffee machine was out of order , Less than 10 minutes walk from Paddington and yet peaceful location Walkable to Notting Hill and Kensington This is a grand old terraced building with comfortable though rather characterless rooms We got a free upgrade to an executive deluxe suite with a separate seating area which was great value for money The bed was very comfy the shower was hot but not that powerful no worse than most hotels though Good towels and bedding Staff were helpful and our room was made available for us early No breakfast but you could order a packed lunch type breakfast in your room We preferred to go out for breakfast but if you book direct on the hotel website there seem to be frequent free breakfast offers Overall much better than I would have expected for London at this price We will definitely stay here if we visit this part of London again 
169834,The Cleveland, Nothing , Great location within walking distance from 3 underground stations Numerous cafes pubs restaurants at a short 3 7 mins walk The front desk staff were extremely helpful and accommodating Appreciated the all day Nespresso machine in the lobby Very comfortable 2 weeks Will definitely make this our base again 
169835,The Cleveland, Queen size bed was a bit too big for the small room a single bed would have made better use of the space Water pressure top floor was low but that s a general London problem Redecoration in parts sloppy no functional problems but cracks here and there , Friendly staff good location 10 minute walk from Paddington room was quiet functional and well equipped House well kept with nice public areas Elevator available for most floors 
169836,The Cleveland, The first night we had quite a cold draft coming from the window but the second night was better once the heating was turned up , The staff was friendly and the room was clean There was a little well equipped kitchen in our room however we didn t use it 
169837,The Cleveland, Our room was located close to an exhaust or outdoor air vent which was quite noisy and meant we didn t get the best of sleeps on our first night We requested to be moved the following day albeit in the afternoon and the two rooms we were presented with had their deficiencies The first was a basement room wow lucky we didn t get that and the other had the same issue We kept our room The hairdryer was useless and there were no Ironing facilities which made for a difficult business trip The soaps and shampoos couldve been of better quality but was no means a deal breaker Pillows were also a little uncomfortable but that personal preference , Was in a good location close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations The place was clean and the room we had was welcoming Shower had great water pressure and mattress was comfortable We could also adjust the temperature of the room which was handy as we dont like the heater to be too warm even though it s winter Nespresso coffee machine in the foyer went down a treat
169838,The Cleveland, The only problem in our perfect bedroom was that it had the loudest air conditioning in the world , The room we stayed at was beautiful The walls and the ceilings had those lovely flowery shapes with angels and leaves The room had an amazing window that was the size of the wall the bed was standing against It even had beautiful stained glasses above The bed was literally the best bed we ve ever slept in The room is spacious and cozy at the same time There s plenty of places to tidy your things in The bathroom was very clean and warm with big towels and a nice shower It had a very useful kitchenette with a mini fridge mini stove a sink a toaster and a microwave In short it was the best room we ve ever stayed at and a hotel that I d absolutely stay again at The location is great the staff are helpful and it even has a shelf with good books to borrow We just want to go back again 
169839,The Cleveland, The bathroom was scruffy cracked tiles on the floor silicon which was stained in the shower and as you open the shower door the complete screen is lose at the base It is a shame because a few hours by one tradesman could over come most of these points The ductwork in the bedroom emits a clicking noise which gets on your nerves at night I thought it was the Air Con so turned it off but it wasn t it was coming from the fresh air ductwork into the room So really a typical London room at this price I was expecting better but it sits in that category of could do better , The room was good value at 80 00 for 1 night however it is January and London is quite I would not like to pay much more than this The bed was comfy Location for tubes is good 
169840,The Cleveland,No Negative, Big room comfy bed very friendly service a short walk from Paddington even a little kitchenette which for my 1 night was not used but a nice feature 
169841,The Cleveland, A bit out of the way for major tourist sites but is excellent value Limited food options at the hotel but several good options within short walk , Easy walk to Paddington and tube stations Quiet street Staff very friendly and helpful Rooms are recently renovated very comfortable and clean 
169842,The Cleveland, The size of bathroom and also had some spots which looks like mould in the bathroom The staff tried to clean but it is something from the silicone Take care about this detail could help in the first impression , The staff was very helpful and it was a calm place
169843,The Cleveland, It wasn t a problem for me but be aware that lift doesn t go to top floor , Attractive building and very quiet pleasant location but close to several tube stations and Bayswater shops restaurants Staff friendly and helpful room comfortable reliable free wifi good to have mini kitchen with fridge microwave I was able to check in slightly early and leave my suitcase on day I checked out 
169844,The Cleveland,No Negative, Love this warm homy place Their services are much better than those worldwide branded hotels We will stay here again if we come back to London next time 
169845,The Cleveland, Small room at the top of a vertiginous series of staircases Not really an apartment more a hotel room with a kitchenette in a cupboard I should have paid more for a bigger better room , Great location nice staff 
169846,The Cleveland, The kitchenette was tiny but we knew it when booking so but there was a lack of plug ins in the kitchenette and no pans available only on demand at the reception Everything else was perfect, The hotel is located in a very nice area near Paddington Station 10 minutes walking The room was small but very clean and well equiped The matress was very confortable and we couldn t hear any noise during the evening at night we slept very well Complimentary tea coffee water at the reception Very welcoming staff
169847,The Cleveland, The sofa bed was a little hard to sleep on very squeaky every time you turned but somehow still managed to get a good nights sleep but was for one night so was sufficient enough of stayed longer would prob need a proper bed, The double bed was comfy the rooms were very clean the bathroom was very clean as well
169848,The Cleveland, Their continental breakfast is really VERY poor but still very expensive in comparison to what you can expect , I did like this is a suite not a small room as it often a case in London
169849,The Cleveland,No Negative, Small kitchen area was well equipped Room was comfortable and quiet Staff were helpful especially when it came to storing our luggage for a few hours and it was only a 10 minutes walk to Paddington when it came time to leave 
169850,The Cleveland,No Negative, An amazing room and amazing staff the staff were so kind and remembered little things about us asked about our day and made our stay feel so special 
169851,The Cleveland, The room was very small There was no facilities that I would normally associate with a hotel Not even a dining room There was no staff to help with luggage and no friendly greeting from staff when arriving and leaving My GPS showed a return distance of 1 2 Kilometres to the nearest subway station Not a good walk in bad weather , The small kitchenette was good Wifi worked well
169852,The Cleveland, misunderstanding of my arrival time as they politely refused ealyer check in inspite of approval before departure resuling in a lot of difficulties to me, every thing mentioned before and I think coming again
169853,The Cleveland, Rooms are small which I thought with a suite it would have been bigger but it use London , Our adapter didn t work and they sent one up immediately Great coffee in the reception area 
169854,The Cleveland, The bed was very soft and a concierge service for bags would be helpful , The room was clean and cosy I requested an upstairs room and it was nice and quiet However it is a rabbit warren to get to some of the upper rooms and if you have mobility issues or a heavy bag it is worth mentioning in the booking Wifi worked everywhere and staff very friendly 
169855,The Cleveland, The hotel had no bar or restaurant Breakfast is only continental delivered to your room The fittings in the rooms are a little old but not damaged The bathroom again is not the newest but is big enough and works fine The grouting around the shower shows signs of mould but this is almost certainly due to the age of the shower enclosure and not due to lack of cleaning , The room I stayed in was on the ground floor next to reception I feared that this may be noisy but it wasn t The road outside is very quiet with no passing traffic so there was no noise from the street the room was the largest I have stayed in in the Paddington area There was a very comfortable double bed and a single bed and still room for a table desk and a small Kitchenette Everything was very clean 
169856,The Cleveland,No Negative, Extremely nice people at the reception desk Rooms are small but smart equipped Location is lovely just a bit far from the main attractions but enough to feel like living in your own flat in the centre of London 
169857,The Cleveland, I was there for all day meetings so the size of the room or the bathroom was not of big importance to me If I had not been alone I would have found the room a little small The room i had was a half basement some noise early morning Under the circumstances of my stay it was perfect value for money , the little kitchenette very handy good wi fi connection and proximity to where I needed to be Comfortable bed Pleasant staff 
169858,The Cleveland, We got put into the below ground floor and our view was half hvac system The bathroom was small and the shower needed some patching up The carpet in the room seemed dull The heat was on in the room so it seemed very stuffy so we left the windows open to make it a comfortable temperature , For central London the room was huge for the value of your money Close to several tube stations in a nice neighborhood The bed was super comfortable with a choice of pillows Great refrigerator and cable TV stations 
169859,The Cleveland,No Negative, Perfect for our family two adults and two kids Generous space and a good pentry as a bonus Good to have when you are a family Nice interior design Short walk from Paddington station Would go again and can recommend it 
169860,The Cleveland, Room is very small but then again it is in London , Great location near Hyde Park Paddington Station Room comes with kitchenette Friendly staff 
169861,The Cleveland, We didn t have breakfast but the choices were very limited , Clean rooms with everything you would need for a break Half kitchen in our room had everything we needed Stove and kitchen sink included as well as kettle and toaster 
169862,The Cleveland, No pans in kitchenette how can I cook Not consistent quality of cleaning one day its clean another day it is feeling like someone just rushed in and did just part of job and run away , I slept like angel very comfy beds and pillows Like size of room and kitchenette in the room Loved water pressure in shower and temperature of water I love hot one and it was hot one 
169863,The Cleveland, The so called spacious suite was a box The kitchinette is in a wardrobe the curtains wouldn t close in our room if you put the lights on in the bathroom at night the bedroom lit up from the rear of the recessed lights unfinished diy I guess The apathetic staff moved us for the second night but point blank refused a discount for my lack of sleep ,No Positive
169864,The Cleveland, Exhaust in the bathroom very weak , Location is good The room is small but good very clean The bed is very good Staff excellent friendly and attentive Location very good The room we had was very silent We could hear the seagulls which was nice 
169865,The Cleveland, Room 32 was simply too tight for a mature couple with no lift access four big bags no telephone extension out of order WIFI issues on day three plus TV out of order for an entire day day three No view at all This room should only be sold to SINGLE with little bags and of young age , Kitchenette and friendly staff namely Martin Howard and Lukas excellent caring people 
169866,The Cleveland, Light bulb not working in shower Got it replaced but must have been a fault because it never worked Also whoever changed the light bulb left our bathroom window wide open as we were in the basement we were lucky nobody got in We did complain asked for feedback from the manager but no contact I ve been ignored , Comfy bed Clean Good facilities Convenient 
169867,The Cleveland, Cleaning products left in the bathroom and cleaners bottle of half drank water left in the room carpet needed hoovering properly and surfaces were dusty, Good location quiet suburb
169868,The Cleveland, Can t think of a single thing to complain about , Awesome location convenient to everything and very quiet We would definitely stay again They even accommodated a change in dates without penalty 
169869,The Cleveland, Rooms are very very small not suitable for big family photos on booking com don t tell the right size We had rooms in the basement ground floor and first floor I took my luggage myself to rooms no service on this , Staff
169870,The Cleveland, The light in the kitchenette which could only be turned off by removing the keycard and turning off the power to everything including the air conditioning On a hot night having to choose between trying to sleep with a light on or without air conditioning was not pleasant , The location on a quiet square within walking distance to Paddington station and the Heathrow Express is the major plus for this property 
169871,The Cleveland, My room being searched by the staff just after I checked in and left for the day My safe was searched and things were stolen No one took blame Staff are all liars, Nothing
169872,The Cleveland, The rooms were a little basic for the price , Staff were curtious and were on hand to answer any questions The kitchenettes in the rooms were useful The room was clean 
169873,The Cleveland, I would really like to have some drawers in the room I had to put clothes in the night table Our room was in between the second and third floor we had to take a lift to the second floor and walked up three flights to get to our room , The bed and pillows were very comfy Bathroom was okay Small Kitchenette and did not have any counter space but I only used it to pack our lunches and used the microwave oven 
169874,The Cleveland, The rooms are VERY SMALL They re fine for ONE person but too crowded for TWO , The staff were very helpful and the rooms were very clean And I did like the kitchenette they had somehow sandwiched into the room 
169875,The Cleveland, The sofa is a bit old and mattress saga in the middle Bathroom could be bigger , Big and spacious in the middle of the city What can you ask for more We had the big king bed sofa bed luxury apartment And it was bright airy with access to a balcony on the first floor They also has a coffee machine at the reception and is free 
169876,The Cleveland, If you want to feel how it was to be a custumer in the Soviet union be a guest at this hotel with its ex Soviet staff No customer service there Specially the male staff so rude All but one nice girl that really tried Indre , Location is ok
169877,The Cleveland, The room layout was strange The vanity mirror in the middle of the room just doesn t need to be there and makes the room feel much smaller than it is , Bed and sofa in the ropom were both very comfortable
169878,The Cleveland, N a, Awesome staff Very friendly and helpful Love the location Close to the tube but in a quiet area Good restaurants close by and very close to Hyde Park 
169879,The Cleveland, Nothing to complain, Spacious room complimentary upgrade by the extremely friendly staff after the original room was smelling like someone had smoked in there Comfy beds Well equipped Kitchenette I am very likely to return 
169880,The Cleveland, Basement room dungeon Bed was 15 cm too short narrow and small Room was tiny Terrible value for money Totally uninterested reception staff, The location was OK
169881,The Cleveland, There is no breakfast room You will get an offer to have breakfast served to the room coffee need to be prepared in a small Kitchenette by yourself But the room is to small to have a decent breakfast unless you like to do your breakfast in your bed , The room is quit fantastic compared to London standards quit large and very clean 
169882,The Cleveland, Some of the staff on reception were abrupt When checking out the receptionist had the phone to his ear the whole time even though there was another lady behind the reception she just pointed to the man on phone when we approached who just took cards off us and asked if we d paid then went silent so we just left Saturday night there was a loud noise outside all night sounded like an extractor fan which didn t stop but Sunday night we stayed it was quiet The location was a bit hard to find , The room was really clean and comfortable with added bonus of kitchenette 
169883,The Cleveland,No Negative, Excellent location within short walking distance of three tube stations and shops rooms are spacious kitchenette is very handy hotel is very clean 
169884,The Cleveland, one of the staff entered the room is spite of the do not disturb while my wife was in the room alone They could facilitate late checkout, The stuff is very friendly Good Room Good location Quiet
169885,The Cleveland, someone s dirty towels in my bathroom climbing the stairs after requesting no stairs although they did carry my suitcase very drafty room as a window did not close properly had to try and put something to cover it,No Positive
169886,The Cleveland, Nothing of any conseuence , Excellent location for Paddington station Good friendly efficient service Clean accommodation Our second stay here and will use service in the future 
169887,The Cleveland, The executive suite was a standard sized en suite hotel room with a hob fridge and microwave in a cupboard Nothing like a suite If I had been sold a standard hotel room I would have been much more positive about the whole thing There were no homely touches at all white walls and high wearing brown carpet , Good location everything was clean The nights we were there it was quiet 
169888,The Cleveland, A pair of slippers would be nice , The room was exactly like shown on picture Location perfect quiet area though in centrum of London easily accessible to three tube stations bus stop in couple of minutes of walk Clean large room with kitchenette Clean and new bathroom Helpfull staff Nothing I can complain really 
169889,The Cleveland, Having to order breakfast a night before I found a bit impractical Fortunately there are few places to eat around Paddington , Location of the hotel is very good as closed to Paddington few min drive by cab or 10 walk Room I was staying in seemed to be just freshly done so it was all new clean spacious with small kitchen facility and nice small bathroom Overall I liked it 
169890,The Cleveland, Even with a lift there are a lot of stairs I have had spinal surgery so stairs aren t helpful Breakfast is very basic just pastries served to your room not worth 13, Staff were very friendly and helpful Location very close to bayswater loads of eating places and tube
169891,The Cleveland, We liked everything and we will absolutely go back NB Do not know the quality of the breakfast as we chose to eat downtown , Excellent location Quiet and only 500 metres to town area Nice room and very kind staff 
169892,The Cleveland, Lift in between floors was a slight problem with the many suitcases we had No exhaust in the shower room toilet also missed having a bath but that was not a big negative besides it was nice and clean , We enjoyed the visit Friendly and cooperative staff The room was clean and spacious for a family room so did not feel cramped Having a kitchenette was extremely handy as staying with a 2 month old baby for 4 days Kitchenette was well designed compact and could be hidden away when not in use Liked the dimmer lights over the bed as it helped with nighttime feeding The dressing table was a clever partition between the two double beds providing just enough privacy that we needed Happy location wise nice area situated in central London and not too far away from local amenities and restaurants Little add ons good pick of newspapers in the reception lounge enjoyed reading with a delicious cup of coffee from the Nespresso machine Will definitely consider returning 
169893,The Cleveland, Biscuits in the room or some sort of vending machine as there was nowhere close by late at night open as it s located in a residential area , The staff were very friendly and the room was clean 
169894,The Cleveland, It would have been nice to be able to see the TV whilst in the bed as travelling with children means we were back early enough to watch a bit of TV but had to sit round the table to watch it because of the partition , Lovely apartments in a great location 
169895,The Cleveland, As with so many London hotels a little cramped Slightly too much in the room for its size Had to keep moving a chair in order to get to and from the bathroom , Comfortable and well appointed Close to Paddington and relatively quiet for the location Quick check in and check out 
169896,The Cleveland, WiFi didn t work properly No cell phone network in the room which was in the basement , Staff was very very nice and helpful We reached the hotel pretty late in the evening and were too tired to head out too far Thus we asked the staff at the reception for suggestions and they were very helpful and showed us the directions on a map to an area that was a 10 minute walk from the hotel and had a lot of restaurants we could choose from The Wifi was not working and we didn t get network on our cell phones because our room was in the basement so they helped connect to their other networks including the staff network to ensure that we weren t inconvenienced However those didn t work too well either Because we were having issues with the Wifi and no cell phone network the reception staff even agreed to move us to a room on a higher floor without any extra charges however they got a last minute booking and it wasn t possible The day we were checking out we had tried to book a cab the previous day But it got cancelled because there weren t any cabs available and our booking was cancelled However because we had no phone reception we didn t know it was cancelled and were waiting for 30 minutes But as soon as we told the reception staff about this they arranged for a cab that got there within 15 20 minutes Room was nice and spacious and big enough for 3 people 1 double bed 1 single bed with 6 bags to stay in comfortably Bathroom was nothing fancy but nice and clean Kitchenette was very well equipped Overall the hotel was good and the staff was amazing But we checked out 2 days early because only a basement room was available where there was no network and the Wifi didn t work properly so we couldn t plan our day look stuff up or book tickets online It would be a pretty nice place to stay at as long as you get a room that is not in the basement It was a 10 12 minute walk from Paddington Station where the Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express stop 
169897,The Cleveland,No Negative, Good location near Bayswater underground station and a street full of restaurants but in quiet district Staff are very understanding and helpful High level of service The facility and interior of the hotel and rooms display the good sense of the owner Comfortable exquisite combining both modern and classic sense 
169898,The Cleveland, Our extra bed was a squeaky sofa bed which was rather uncomfortable And the wifi strength was poor in our room , Location was great The kitchenette was useful and adequately equipped Staffs are friendly and helpful in general 
169899,The Cleveland, The elevator only went to the 3rd floor so as we were on the 4th in a adjacent building it was inconvenient for us The staff did help us with our luggage The hotel is located in Nottingham Hill just north of Hyde Park Great location for that area but if you want to be centrally located it is a bit far from the main sightseeing areas , The staff was very friendly and helpful The bed was very comfortable There was a short walk to restaurants and shopping 
169900,The Cleveland, We had a room in the basement no view and the intererior could use a bit of TLC Bit overprized for the state the room was in but hey it is London , The location was great Friendly staff Close to Paddington station Hyde park and in the beautiful Bayswater area Kitchen area was good with fridge microwave and kettle The room was spacious and clean Ideal studio to explore London 
169901,The Cleveland, The sofa bed was creaky and uncomfortable My children could not sleep there and they ended up sharing the bed with my wife I had to sleep on the sofa bed instead, The location was great Near to restaurants and cafes as well as the tube 
169902,The Cleveland, the room we got was noisy while meant to be quiet the breakfast was poor the internet connexion doesn t work well on 1 floor and there is no cellular network, the location
169903,The Cleveland, Gave us the room by reception oat street level so some street noise and coming and going would have preferred a first floor room as infact requested, well appointed convenient location reakky good shower 
169904,The Cleveland, We were staying at the very top floor and there was no elevator although the staff helped us with our suitcases Wi fi was not working properly Not very close to the tube, Room was excellent clean and very compact meeting all your needs Staff was helpful Located in a nice neighbourhood
169905,The Cleveland, No problems faced at all Should include smoking though , Amazing experience Very good location 4 Underground Stations nearby Excellent staff They will make all efforts possible to impress you Brilliant service Love the hotel and would love to give it a rating above 10 
169906,The Cleveland, You have breakfast in your room a bit pricy for 13 but you can easily walk out for 5 mins and find lots if other options , Very friendly and helpful staff especially Barbara My room 20 was lovely 
169907,The Cleveland, Wifi was non existing in our room Which was on the basement floor room 5 I feel it takes almost no effort for a hotel to ensure each room has wifi and if signal is weak invest 20 dollars in to a wifi extender to ensure adequate coverage We had no wifi in our room at all and it s a must in 2015, Location was great and so was the staff Space was extremely small and there was almost no space to put our luggage 
169908,The Cleveland,No Negative, The staff were completely approachable and very willing to help The building was beautiful and classic with clean and well utilized room space Great location Would definately reccomend and return 
169909,The Cleveland, The room was a little on the small side with respect to overall space because of ceiling and windows It was on top floor and couldn t take elevator all the way there The stairs were fairly narrow , The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating Also like the neighborhood and access to tube 
169910,The Cleveland, The studio suite advertised on the site wasn t offered We were given an extremely inaccessible and tiny room in what must have been a renovated attic which didn t have lift service Had to request to be shifted and had to pay an additional 25 pounds for a larger room in the basement , Nice neighborhood and old building which was a nice experience aside from the hotel chains Rooms also come kitted with a kitchenette which is a good touch 
169911,The Cleveland, Staff member who checked us in and out was very polite and friendly other staff we encountered in the evenings didn t acknowledge us to say hello goodbye , Good quiet location less than 10 mins walk from Paddington Very clean Smart room and nicely equipped with a mini kitchen 
169912,The Cleveland,No Negative, The staff were so helpful from early check in to needing extra tea and milk 5 min walk to nearest tube plenty of places for food drinks nearby 
169913,The Cleveland,No Negative, Wonderfully welcoming and helpful staff were able to provide assistance including a scale for weighing bags and a cup of tea when I came back to collect them 
169914,The Cleveland, The room was ok but I wouldn t stay here again There was only about 1 foot of space at the foot of the bed to squeeze bent over by the wall mounted TV to get to the other side Washcloths were not available even on request because they are afraid one might clean the kitchenette with them and lastly the remote didn t work properly but when that was reported the TV no longer worked at all The room was quiet though Most of the staff were very helpful , The room was spacious with the exception noted below Staff was mostly helpful 
169915,The Cleveland, Decor is charmless colour schemes and soft furnishings carpets bedspreads upholstery badly need to be refreshed No breakfast room or shared public space other than reception lobby Standard room was very small with less than a foot of clearance around end of bed Elevator access stops at 3rd floor leaving two flights of stairs for 4th floor residents, Location was very convenient for Hyde Park and the Underground good pub nearby ON Leinster Gardens Rooms have modern basic kitchen facilities and updated bathrooms Money has been well spent on fitted cupboards and bed was comfortable 
169916,The Cleveland, My son said the sofa bed wasn t that comfy We had to move the microwave onto the table in order to use toaster and kettle in kitchenette , Great location 10 min walk from Paddington station and 10 min walk from Hyde Park Hotel in quiet peaceful residential part of Westminster Kitchenette handy to make breakfast before heading out for the day Would not hesitate to return here 
169917,The Cleveland, The reception staff upon check out was rude the breakfast wasn t great picture an apple a bread 2 cheeses and milk no butter jam meats etc , Reception staff on arrival was very friendly and the room was surprisingly large
169918,The Cleveland, Phone reception can be quite bad at times and no special deals for frequent business , I stay here a lot when I am in town for work and the staff remember me You don t get this in big hotel chains 
169919,The Cleveland, Aircon and TV remote didn t work wifi hit and miss and loooooong climb to top floor Room very small too , Nice fit and finish helpful friendly staff fairly handing for Paddington and onto tube network 
169920,The Cleveland, We stayed for 2 nights and on the first night our room was on the ground floor close to the lift and some big machine which will buzz every 15 minutes It made us difficult to sleep But when we spoke to yhe staff on the next day they helped us change to another room which was much better , Very friendly and helpful staff Nice room with fair space 
169921,The Cleveland,No Negative, Great location very helpful courteous staff Kitchenette area very handy Hotel was spotless and bed was very comfy Would definitely stay at the Cleveland again 
169922,The Cleveland,No Negative, Super friendly efficient and polite staff thanks to everyone we met The location was perfect for our needs and close to good transport links The in room facilities for self catering our breakfast were spot on The taxi arranged by the hotel was prompt and great value for money Will recommend to family and friends and would stay again if we are overnight in London 
169923,The Cleveland, We had a really nice room on the 3rd floor the first time we stayed here Based on that we booked later for another 2 nights and found ourselves in a dark and musty half underground room Equipped like our first room but overall a lot worse and told they had no other rooms It would have been ok for half the price but definitely not for what we were paying ,No Positive
169924,The Cleveland, there is no signal in the room on the basement I had an important phone call I could only make the phone call outside the hotel , very good location Very clean Worth money Good wifi

169926,The Cleveland, Nothing , This hotel is One the best I have seen in London Very nice staff and comfortable room and spaces Close to Paddington and Bayswater Really cool 
169927,The Cleveland, Nothing wrong really Just as feedback to help the management to keep it up and improving I would recommend to update the description of the Hotel in here as the number of stars on the advert it says 4 but it is actually a 3 star Hotel The wifi is patchy and no cellular network coverage on the basement Another thing I also would have had appreciated is the description of the rooms I booked a Executive Deluxe Studio to find out it was a room on the basement with no natural light although that didn t bother me after such a nice treatment but when we got to the room I was devastated as I felt that I had been cheated , I read the comments and other reviews from other travelers before I chose this hotel and it brought my attention how the management and the staff in the hotel have actually taken on board all the negative feedback and used it to improve change and offer their customers an excellent CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE All the receptionist were very nice and and helpful and well ahead of all our needs I felt like home The location of the Hotel was the main reason why I booked it and what finally made me chose this one from the bast list of hotels available in the area were the reviews Totally recommended What you can expect if you stay in this hotel is Great hospitality well maintained and refurbished rooms free wifi good rest close to everywhere nice area 
169928,The Cleveland, The breakfast had to be pre ordered the day before Elevator doesn t go to the floor where the room is it stops in between the floors, For being a London hotel it is good and perhaps even worth the money so compared to what I previously have got in London I was satisfied London s hotels have the worse value for money in the world 
169929,The Cleveland, The carpets needed some stain removal and some other guests were noisy after hours , Friendly staff beautiful building not far from Paddington station 
169930,The Cleveland, This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and I have the same complaint about the staff as I had before They are not very friendly nor helpful They do not help with carrying luggage at all despite their bing no elevators and will not even open the door to let you in or out no matter how much you are carrying They are just not very welcoming , A very pleasant hotel with fairly spacious rooms The location is good an easy walk from Paddington station and a few blocks from Kensington Gardens and Palace near Hyde Park and Notting Hill close to several Tube stations A good price for London A small kitchenette which is great to save some money on restaurants
