304154,Hotel Galileo, The hotel hasn t been updated in thirty years the airconditioning in my room didn t work it only made noise there are no electrical outlets next to the bed instead there is some sort of control panel that looks like it came out of a 70 s sci fi movie The room has a carpet floor a carpet floor in Italy where in summer time it reaches 30 degrees I didn t sleep well and the wifi doesn t work well either This hotel needs some serious love to be able to compete with the other hotels in the city I will not be recommending it , Location
304155,Hotel Galileo, They announce a private parking in their website which in reality is a public parking I call this false advertising Beside I booked breakfast included and when checking out they tried to charge me again the breakfast , The location
304156,Hotel Galileo, In the Reception one lady and one man were rude and not frindly I was speaking with the lady but she was not listening and she speak in rude way The room is hot and they explained air condition in booking cite but the room is too large for the old small condition in the corner of the room Carpet was not clean Room is smelly Bathroom was very very old The furniture is old and profligate Breakfast is not for four stars hotel The food was bad I dont recommend this old hotel,No Positive
304157,Hotel Galileo, The parking was independant of the hotel and this point had not be indicated to me despite a mail sent prior to my trip The parking was not so easy to find The welcome is quite cold and the furniture ofthe room is old , location
304158,Hotel Galileo, The decor was a little dated We were also given bad information by the staff about the location of nearby parking and requirements for entering the Cathedral shortish shorts do not work for women We had to return to the hotel for different clothes An additional idea we learned later buy or bring a large scarf for additional coverage much easier and cooler , It is well located We had only about 24 hours and we saw the main areas we were interested in within a short walk The hotel has a 4 star rating but frankly that seems to have been based on its 1980s original design It was nice and comfortable enough for us but if you really think you re getting a 4 star place this isn t quite it 
304159,Hotel Galileo, The hotel is slightly dated , Comfortable beds in a good sized room Helpful staff Our room was upgraded due to Wifi issues The room was lovely and quiet and dark at night Great location 
304160,Hotel Galileo, Bed Pillows Air conditioner is noisy Rooms are too small for couples Mini bar is poor In general hotel is not good for the value of money, Location
304161,Hotel Galileo, The hotel restaurant no one seems happy to be working there and the food I m sorry to say is not good , The proximity to everything you want to see in old Milan Great location but best to take train from airport to metro Duomo Shopping museums and Cathedral very close by this hotel Desk staff polite 
304162,Hotel Galileo, On departure my credit card was not accepted in the system Yet when I left the property it was working else where This occurred on my three occasions staying in the hotel this year I was lucky to have cash to pay for the additional bill Please look into this it could be a night mare if you did not have the cash , The location
304163,Hotel Galileo, bed is hard A C can t cool the room you can t open windows as it is very loud outside Furniture and bath are really old with thick carpets All together the rooms really need an update and an upgrade No further facilities like a pool or gym are available , The location behind the cathedrale and next to the shopping districts is absolutely an advantage Staff is well trained very friendly and helpful They bring old school style to the house If you like retro chic and the Italian world of the 60s you will feel as in your dreams the only thing that let you feel like 2017 is the speedy wi fi
304164,Hotel Galileo, Worst customer service tried to overcharge me around 100 more when reception found out his mistake He was furious and attitude was so wrong , Location is good Near Duomo and shopping 
304165,Hotel Galileo, It was cold in May and the room was too cold I informed reception but it didn t help The cleaning staff made a lot of noise in the morning , I asked for late check out and there was no problem The bar and restaurant staff were extremely pleasant The location is very good 
304166,Hotel Galileo, Bathrooms need upgrading Pillows need to be fluffier Prefer electronics card keys for the doors , Breakfast is excellent Staff very friendly Like the cleaning shoe machine Excellent location 
304167,Hotel Galileo, The interior and equipment was a bit old And the window was sealed with a metal plate so we couldn t have any view from the window , The staff was very friendly the location was great and the breakfast was nice with a wide variation to choose from 
304168,Hotel Galileo, What I didn t like is that the interior design of the hotel is very old it needs definitely a renovation and a bed more comfortable to sleep deeper , I liked the staff they are all smiling and welcoming in addition it s a hotel very well located in the city centre next to duomo 5 mns by walk shops metro and bus station are just in the front 
304169,Hotel Galileo, Fitness center has been mentioned in facilities but one day I went to the gym and it was dark as cave And nobody was there to help me so I couldn t train , Hotel is really close to Doumo Cathedral and you can reach there by walk easily Room was big enough and comfortable Breakfast was not WOW but good at all 
304170,Hotel Galileo, The bed was a bit stiff but the overall room was spacious and clean , I stayed for a weeekend in Milan Friendly staff at hotel bar and restaurant and the front desk staff was nice and helpful Hotel room was clean and comfortable The best thing about this hotel is location You re about 400 meters from the Duomo di Milano all the shops and restaurants in the area and very close to the Metro stations 
304171,Hotel Galileo, Blonde lady at the reception is unpolite no smile no welcome no bye bye no talk even she does not talk when giving me the invoice and nothing says about extra charge she just wait that I pay Exteremely unpolite Pillows are tooo hard It is not comfortable , Lokasyon guzel duomo meydanina cok yakin temizlik iyi
304172,Hotel Galileo, bed was too hard, location chef at dinner and breakfast staff the young woman at breakfast was helpful when asked questions about the area and very pro active when one of our group starting coughing she immediately provided water
304173,Hotel Galileo, This is in respect of my stay for 16 19 January The manager who puts up only one person to work in the restaurant should get a reality check I have been waiting for 1 hour for someone to take room service order from me I am hungry I have to work till late and I need food under my face I have no time for running around getting takeways The restaurant needs at least 3 people to work in the evenings This is not the fault of the staff but the manager who totally messed up the organisation , To be fair it is well located rooms are spacious and staff are generally helpful when there are enough of them 
304174,Hotel Galileo, No air con carpwts generate so much static everytime I toyches a light switch wtc I got a shock No iron 25 for 2 shirts and jeans to be ironed and all electrical sockets are old style italian so normal 2 pin for my laptop wouln t fit, Great location and friendly staff
304175,Hotel Galileo, there is no cctv inside the hotel if there is a theft crime it would be difficult to catch a clue of who break in a hotel room for stealing , The location is good It is in central of the city very close to Duomo Cathedral However right outside of the hotel there is quite few hobo or strollers 
304176,Hotel Galileo, The staff never smile from the reception to the bar to the breakfast room to the point of being unpleasant They need a course in service with a smile , The room was very clean and made up promptly An easy walk to the metro 
304177,Hotel Galileo, I arrive the hotel they took my car to park it i asked the gentleman i have a small kids bag in the car is it okay to leave it in the car is it safe he said don t worry the next day i checked out and they got me my car and there was no bag i told the person that got me the car where is my bag i went back in and i ask them they told me its not their fault the parking took it sorry,No Positive
304178,Hotel Galileo, The families who own the hotel should realize that if they listen to their staff and invest some money to renovate some facilities they would have one of the best hotels in Milan , Very friendly and helpful staff most of them work there from day 1 they truly love the hotel Best location in all my stays in Milan Great breakfast The hotel is old 30 years but is in very good shape 
304179,Hotel Galileo, The room was very warm and good not be cooled since the fan was heating the room The room was airless, The location is excellent central and quiet the breakfast was O K 
304180,Hotel Galileo, Despite the many positives of this location and hotel there are a few areas that could be addressed Strangely the wifi was only available in the rooms themselves not even in the restaurant or lobby I assume this is to prevent random people from using the hotel s network but is not helpful to guests Firstly the hotel interior is visibly out dated and in need of some proper repair work The rooms furniture is old and the fixtures are in need of replacement Many parts of the room such as wooden frames had obviously been hastily fixed or not yet repaired The bathroom showed the age of the hotel the most with rusting fixtures and an old hose style hair dryer both my friend and I gave up trying to dry our hair while staying there take your own if this is important to you The room also featured a very old panel of buttons for a radio that didn t work and light room controls There was no clock in the room and I had to search through the TV channels just to find one with the local time One of the windows could be opened but the other was missing it s handle Thankfully I could open one window as I could not control the temperature and found the room very hot My friend found the same in her room There is currently building construction happening on one side of the hotel not in the hotel s control obviously and they often started before 7am Be sure to ask for a room away from the construction Although in a fabulous location with great staff this hotel is not what I would call 4 star simply based on the out dated rooms and need for proper repairs The star system is not regulated around the world but having stayed in many places in a variety of countries I can say that this hotel is probably now a 2 3 star that once was a 4 star It has great potential to be a 4 star once again , The location of the hotel is ideal for anyone wanting easy access to historical sites museums shopping restaurants cafes multiple types of transit and walkable routes The buffet breakfast was extensive compared to many hotels and there were always at least 3 very professional staff working There was a wide variety of food so even someone who has multiple dietary restrictions can easily fill up The coffee was fresh and served in individual pots All areas of the hotel were very clean including the room The room had the basic amenities including a cozy robe slippers various stationary tissues Kleenex which many places no longer supply The bed and pillows were very firm which suited me fine but not my friend who found it too hard for a good sleep All of the staff who we interacted with were friendly helpful and showed genuine pride in their jobs They spoke various languages and were able to make many recommendations for best transit options where to eat getting a taxi and informing us of the transit closure due to a one day strike Overall a great place to stay The staff s professionalism was unwavering and makes this hotel what it is 
304181,Hotel Galileo, No shower curtains Didn t like the water splash on the floor after shower , Its location was perfect only a few minute walk from the Duomo The room was neatly arranged and very clean Also it was spacious for the hotel located in the very center of the city Nice and kind staff 
304182,Hotel Galileo, Most definitely the bathroom was one of the worst we experienced ever Bathrooms are so much better even in a 3rd world country 3 star hotel The fixtures were rusty with the chrome wearing off The faucet was difficult to negotiate as the handles were very tough The towels are rough and most certainly unlike any 4 star or for that matter any 3 star hotel We stayed in Room 312 and I hope the other bathrooms are not similar The whole bathroom requires complete re modeling Cannot understand why a hotel that charged us more than 200 per night has a worn out bathroom On the other hand if the other bathrooms are better then this hotel may have a bigger and a more serious problem It may mean that the staff discriminates when they allocate rooms to the guests based on their ethnicity Hotel did not have any business center or any facility that allows a guest to use a computer for emails or get any printing work done The bed was hard but not uncomfortable however there were only two pillows and they were very hard We couldn t sleep well and upon request housekeeping provided extra pillows and guess what They were nice and soft No ironing facility in the hotel First time we experienced that the hotel did not have any ironing board and iron available When asked they said they had a laundry facility that would iron our clothes but at a cost This is a hotel that charged us 189 euros per night , Location is good since it is in the heart of the primary tourist area of Milan i e near the Duomo Also the metro is very close so moving around is easy Room was clean and the housekeeping staff is good but cannot communicate as they spoke no English at all Buffet breakfast is average and nothing to rave about Restaurant staff is friendly 
304183,Hotel Galileo, It s evident that the hotel is old but this doesn t really affect anything The price could be cheaper but it s not surprising for an expensive city like Milano , Location and hotel facilities were good wifi was great 
304184,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, Location just can not be better for Milano 3 min from Duomo via Montenapoleone Rinaschente Very friendly staff rooms are big and very clean Ages adding some charm to hotel Saw there for the first time an old school divice called trousers press Nice breakfast 
304185,Hotel Galileo, Wi Fi DOESN t works at all Very bad indeed The shower box is too tinny but is a problem in every hotel in Italy The tv set channels could be better I was there during the Olympic Games and there wasn t a single channel showing it , The location is the best near to Duomo metro and bus station Friendly staff 
304186,Hotel Galileo, They dont provide tea and coffee kittle in the rooms They dont have save in the rooms but they have individual save in the reception were you can keep your valuable items for free , The staff were hospitable Rooms are clean They were honest The location was good
304187,Hotel Galileo, The air condition does not work properly it is very very hot in the room although i switched to 3 different rooms but still the ac was functioning poorly The room is full of mosquitoes and the decoration of the rooms are below standards, The hotel is below the standards although it is a 4 star hotel but unfortunately some 2 stars hotel could be better The only good thing about the health hotel is its great staff and quick room service
304188,Hotel Galileo, A c was not working well there was also a miscommunication regarding age One of us was under 18 and they would not hand us the key unless we had verification from a parent this wasn t a problem from our side but it would have been nice to be informed about this beforehand as it might have been the case that the parents could not be reached at that second or were at work Small suggestion to have a vending machine with water and a few snacks since all shops close at 12 , Location was excellent and staff were very helpful Breakfast had a good variety and wifi worked all around the hotel 
304189,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, The location is great just a few minutes walk to Corso Vittorio Emanuele the Galleria and the Piazza del Duomo The breakfast was very good and the staff was courteous and helpful The room was comfortable and clean 
304190,Hotel Galileo, The shower in the room had no pressure i told the receptionist i did not want this shower before i came to the hotel as i had read bad comments about this problem but i still ended up with the same room with a trickle of water I am a muslim and all pork products were served at breakfast buffet along side non pork products , Good location
304191,Hotel Galileo, I seriously don t like the front office staff He is working for the afternoon shift I think He is so impolite and rude to me He is kind of ignoring me at first and didn t show respect to me just because I am Asian and I look young But the night shift FO staff is pretty good and polite , I like the environment and the ambience of the hotel And also the food and beverage staff they are so friendly and professional at the same time Really happy to dine in this hotel
304192,Hotel Galileo, So far all OK but at least our room will need general refurbishing bathroom , Very good central location just behind the dome close bus and tram connections bus to Linate nearly infront small but quiet room Friendly staff and very good breakfast 
304193,Hotel Galileo, The air conditioning was pretty inadequate I would leave it on in the morning and when I returned at night it would still be hot in the room The good news is that I had windows that I could open that allowed for ventilation and cool breezes to cool the room down , Location was perfect Just off the beaten path of the touristy places but close enough that you could walk to everything Breakfast that was included with the stay and was wonderful Huge variety of fresh fruit breads cheeses and other hot items Staff was accomodating and helpful Room was clean and refreshed nicely daily 
304194,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, The hotel is not brand new or fancy but it s a classic style that s well run and is in a primo location to all the shopping and transportation The bathroom is spacious everything was very clean and well organized and the staff are wonderful and quite accommodating My husband and I regularly travel and stay at hotels that range from The Four Seasons to small B Bs and we enjoyed this hotel on our European vacation 
304195,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, I always stay at this hotel when I need to overnight in Milan On this occasion I stayed there the night of Sunday 12 June The location couldn t be better literally 5 minutes walk to the Duomo Very friendly and helpful staff Maurizio at the Reception was particularly helpful My room 202 was nice spacious spotlessly clean comfy bed The bathroom fixtures in perfect order with a good shower my only criticism would be the old style hair dryer The breakfast buffet is varied and plentiful and the waiter who was on duty was welcoming and efficient Free wifi which worked well 
304196,Hotel Galileo, The hallway is so dark the room is old and the breakfast is below standard I didn t enjoy it at all , The location of this hotel is great Almost next to the Duomo it is so easy to get to everywhere The staffs were friendly and helpful 
304197,Hotel Galileo, staff members were not friendly or pleasent only people who were pleasent was the cleaner and the bell man ALSO website said no pre payment however the hotel ran my credit card an held over 100 euros and then demanded full payment at the end as i was using a travel card you transfer into currency as you need it this stuffed everything up and made me convert more money then needed as they had taken 100 deposit , the wifi was good and th elocation
304198,Hotel Galileo, So far everything is okay, Really a great location near to the shopping area Doumo square and the public transport just in front of the hotel Excellent stay
304199,Hotel Galileo, Unpleasant staff Cigarette smell all over the corridor and in the rooms Old furniture very old carpeting The room I had was beside stairwell so I slept or tried to sleep with lights on all night long Hard mattress Expensive price, Only breakfast was good Central location
304200,Hotel Galileo, Breakfast is less then what I was expecting Some of the freatures are outdated Like DND sign, Location is great and the staffs were helpful and flexible we got an early check in and late check out and answered all our queries
304201,Hotel Galileo, The decor was extremely tired and very gloomy The bed and pillow were so hard I didn t sleep at all for the 3 nights we were there , The location is excellent Staff were really helpful and breakfast very good 
304202,Hotel Galileo, Single room bed was hard and I did not get offered coffee or tea in the morning had to ask while everyone else did get served , Location 5 minutes walking from Duomo Parking service was perfect Friendly reception staff
304203,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, Very good and convenient location right at the back of Duamo Wonderful and very helpful staff and beautiful room and huge buffet breakfast provided 
304204,Hotel Galileo, The hotel is really really old and the prize does not correspond with a 4 stars hotel, The location was great and the staff specially in breakfast was really polite and helpful
304205,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, Stayed in this hotel 4 times during one year the stuff was very freindly and it is one of the reasons that I was returning to this hotel so often I will stay here again on my next trip to Milan 
304206,Hotel Galileo, The hotel is full of mosquitoes and bugs Old furnitures and is not classic at all Annoying from the construction work in the hotel area, Nothings at all
304207,Hotel Galileo, Unfortunately I couldn t get the air con to work so the room was too hot The hotel is a fine hotel but a little dated , The location was fantastic
304208,Hotel Galileo, We have always stayed in this hotel whenever we were in Milan for the last 5 years for at least 2 to 3 times a year The breakfast was the same for the past 5 years as well Hope the variety can be changed , Location 
304209,Hotel Galileo, The decor of the bedrooms the green walls made the room very gloomy Also the walls had a mark , The customer service at this hotel and the location was excellent Right next to Duomo I cannot complain about the location The staff was very helpful in giving directions On the last day the bell boy even accompanied me to the bus stop as I was unsure where it was I will definitely come back 
304210,Hotel Galileo, The TV in my room didn t work Initially there was no remote control This was provided whilst I was out on the first day but it subsequently proved that the TV itself was faulty This was immediately replaced by the staff Irritating but excellent customer service to correct , The location is great I was attending a trade show at the Rho Fiera it was a short walk to the Metro with a direct link to the fair It was also only 5 minutes walk to the Doumo The room was spacious clean the breakfast good 
304211,Hotel Galileo, i didn t like the rooms because they look old especially the single room is smelly Actually since the hotel located in the heart of milan the hotel room should be renovated or at least be more attractive to stay in i asked to be upgrate the room they weren t helpful knowing i checked through the web and there was availabilities ,No Positive
304212,Hotel Galileo, Total Hotel is very old and old fashioned However it was clean enough , Most of all location was very great for holiday traveler You can reach the Duomo within 5 min by walk And you can see the Duomo from your room window Also the room has quite large space which was also very convenient Breakfast was also good 
304213,Hotel Galileo, Rooms need of renovation and change the entire furniture It does not deserve to be a four star compared with furniture, The staff were very wonderful Breakfast wonderful The location is great
304214,Hotel Galileo, Room was warned down with limited facilities Bathroom rather old and neglected Price of room was much too high for quality of room offered , Location and very courteous staff Particularly at breakfeast 
304215,Hotel Galileo, Decor is a little dated Did not distract from all the other benefits , Location location location Lovely big bath tub Very professionally managed Using their luggage storage for the weekend was such a relief I liked the old fashion attention to details like robe and slippers and turn down service Good selection for breakfast Love this hotel

304218,Hotel Galileo, Mould in the bathroom No safe in the room , Excellent location near the Duomo 10 minutes from La Scala next to the main shopping galleries Good breakfast with lot of fresh fruit 
304219,Hotel Galileo, The only difficulty was poor WiFi reception in the rooms There are no safes in the rooms I also suggested to the staff to enlarge the breakfast possibilities of gluten and lactose freeproducts , The staff were wonderful The location is fabulous All in all a very positive experience To be recommended 
304220,Hotel Galileo, very old equipment nad interior, Excellent location in the center very profesional and friendly staff at reception good housekeeping and cleaning very good breakfast 
304221,Hotel Galileo, The furnishings are a bit outdated but nice They really need more electrical outlets considering this is the age of electronic devices But all in all a nice place , The location is great close to the Duomo The staff was exceptional especially the chef Davide Maitre D Tommaso and his watiress Federica Food was outstanding 
304222,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, Location is perfect close to the Duomo Cathedral and shops Our room was very spacious beds large and comfortable Staff at reception and restaurant always friendly and helpful the hair dryer was not working properly and they sent someone to fix it immediately

304224,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, The conceirge was friendly and very helpful He showed us good hospitality and made us feel welcomed The front desk officer that was on duty during our check in was also very helpful 
304225,Hotel Galileo, I had to wait for my room Even though I gave my time of arrival The reception did not apologies and no hospitality offered because of the in conscience When I eventually went to my room I found the window wide open at first I thought it was a good idea I shut the windows and on my return the smell of cigarette smoke was extremely strong I don t smoke myself and this I found upsetting I called reception and a chamber made arrived with a spray I was told that I could leave the window open In that case I would hear traffic all night or close the window and I hail the fumes Not a good experience in this hotel , Location
304226,Hotel Galileo,No Negative, Staff was super amazing I lost a piece of paper and the staff member spent about 30min with me searching through the garbage until we found it Location was amazing 3min from domo Room very comfy

304233,Hotel Galileo, Everything needs refeel in the room Not first time and not first year here as there is really good location but it is really need renovation now ,No Positive
304234,Hotel Galileo, From the moment we walked into reception it was as if we d travelled back to the 1970s Behind the reception desk looked like an old fashioned hotel with lots of files and paperwork The lifts landing restaurant had old carpet and old furniture As for the bedroom on the plus side it was a good size room but it had an old carpet dark green tiles in the bathroom which made it very dark 1970s style wooden fitted furniture The sofa bed room had a broken blackout blind so was permanently dark The main bedroom only had thin blinds no curtains so was light all night There was peeling wallpaper If the hotel was decorated and updated throughout it would be a fantastic place to stay Fortunately lots to do in Milan so it s possible to stay out of the hotel from breakfast till bedtime , Fantastic location few minutes from duomo San Babila metro station and right next to the bus stop for Linate airport
304235,Hotel Galileo, the bathroom was a little small and thr blowdryer didn t work well at all , you cant beat the location of this hotel you walk out the back door and the Galleria and Duomo are literally right there Nice area with lots of shops and restaurants its also a short walk to via della spiga we got a triple room and it was actually quite big with two separate rooms with two separate beds it was clean and relatively comfortable but it was definitely a little run down It could certainly use a little freshening up But we had a comfortable stay and the location kind of makes up for everything else wifi and air conditioning both worked well and the staff was friendly The breakfast area was also very nice and there was a good selection I probably would stay here again
