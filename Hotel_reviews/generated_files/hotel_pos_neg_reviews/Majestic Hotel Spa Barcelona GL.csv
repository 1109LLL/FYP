399965,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The breakfast room felt a bit crowded and had little daylight Breakfast itself was great though The only very minor comment on the room is that the ceiling above the lamp shades in the bathroom was starting to color , When looking for grand old world charm this is your pick Fantastic staff whose personal pro active approach and attention to detail made our stay a very enjoyable one The rooftop bar is a cool place to have a few sundowners on the terrace or at the pool whilst enjoying a splendid view of the city The room was exactly what one would expect from a hotel such as this one so don t expect iphone docs multiple TV screens or high tech infotainment systems but a high quality spacious clean and very comfortable room Also the location is great to explore the city or to go shopping 
399966,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, But I had two under five year olds with me and the window was not safe at all It s relatively easy to open and there s no safety after that If you re in the bathroom and your child opens the window God forbid that s super dangerous Also if you re using a stroller there are stairs even in the corridor of our floor itself so it s a hassle lifting up and down , Nice large room and bathroom and friendly staff Large bath tub so I could bathe my children without getting wet myself 
399967,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Top floor restaurant was very pricy but great view and service 18 euros cocktails Did not eat breakfast at hotel as it was 39 95 euros per person , Great front end service everything was top notch including bell and conceiger service Do charge 39 95 per night for car which I m so glad we had for day trips 
399968,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Residence for our family with children had foul odor in one apartment sounds of water in another apartment My husband I stayed in main hotel enjoyed our stay without pronlem, Overall great experience Majestic still fine European hotel
399969,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, Great location Lovely spacious apartments with use of all hotel facilities Fantastic staff The roof top bar has spectacular views and everyone welcomed our children 
399970,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We attempted to take advantage of the hotel pool but both times it was closed for private events That was disapointing because the pool was part of the reason we booked the hotel and we headed back from site seeing for a pool break only to find out it was closed , We stayed across the street from the hotel in a condo It felt very safe well appointed and spacious Having two bedrooms and two bathrooms was great for a family of four After a long day of site seeing it was nice to have some room to spread out We had a patio as well which was great for having a glass of wine before heading out to dinner Overall a wonderful experience 
399971,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We had stayed at the Majestic several years ago and everything was perfect This time the first room they gave us was simply not a 5 star hotel standard Paint was missing on the closet The table was full of dents The staff was helpful and moved us to another room which was better but there was an old soft drink on the balcony and a used breakfast card left on our bed , Location staff
399972,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Bed could have been better but was basically European standard , The 2 bedroom apartment was perfect for us and our Granddaughter It was clean and modern Maid service was outstanding Big fluffy bath towels and heated towel racks Do not miss the cocktail lounge on the roof of the main Hotel One of the best views in the city 
399973,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The terrace on the top floor was chaos Access was only possible if you queued and as a hotel guest you were not giving any priority but stood behind people who were not even staying in the hotel The car took 30 minutes to get delivered back to me even though I requested it 10 minutes before coming down to check out The spa on the top floor has to be reserved and once again in a hotel so large it is not easy to find the time you want In general this is a 4 star hotel there are far better choices for real 5 star luxury in Barcelona at the same price , Location and nothing more
399974,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The hotel definitely needs renovation Everything is quite old They have changed a room for me very appreciated but not enough windows hence not enough light in both ,No Positive
399975,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The cleaning staff are annoying they started to knock the door 9 30am to ask for cleaning even if you put Do Not Disturb card they will keep coming and coming more than 3 times This Happened everyday Food Menu need to be upgraded and to add more food especially Halal Food Pillows not that much comfort , Staff are friendly Location is near the subway There are supermarkets Pharmacies nearby 
399976,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Food and drink seemed a little expensive but probably in line with a five star city hotel It seemed a bit tricky to use the pool as it seems like a restaurant with a pool in it we went up to the roof for a drink which was lovely and the views are stunning but would have felt awkward swimming there Certainly wouldn t want to have turned up in swimwear with a towel , We stayed in an apartment across the road from the hotel The apartment was beautiful spacious and clean The kitchen was large and well equipped including a washer and dryer too We had two bedrooms and two bathrooms which were really nice Staff very friendly and helpful and all areas of the hotel were clean and luxurious The hotel is in the perfect spot if you want to do the open top tour bus as both routes stop close to the hotel city tour 
399977,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We felt that the bedroom was much smaller than we had expected and poor value for money the breakfasts were also very expensive, We found the staff very friendly and helpful and the overall standard of the Hotel was Good
399978,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The description of the apartment from booking com is incorrect and i was very disappointed to have booked a 5 star hotel and end up with an apartment without windows or any of the features booking com promised , The staff were very attentive and friendly
399979,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The rain shower didn t work well Hot water quickly turned cold Problem with water pressure I imagine Didnt enjoy that shower turning hot and cold , Friendly staff size of the room complimentary tea with kettles and biscuit turn down service etc I had room service for dinner good quality 
399980,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We loved the apartment although I did feel that sometimes it wasn t cleaned as good as it could have been and some things were not replenished such as the toilet roll and the nespresso coffee , We have stayed at the majestic a few times before and knew it was a great place It was my husband s 50th birthday and he wanted to spend it in Barcelona We knew the only place we wanted to stay was the Majestic 
399981,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Normal check in time is at 3 00 We arrived at 5 30pm but we were told to wait as the room is not ready yet We recieved our room by 6 30 , Excellent Location 
399982,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, If I had one complaint it would be that there are not many options for eating IN the hotel We did have the buffet breakfast and found it to be lacking and on the expensive side But there are so many options within a block or two that this is truly a small issue , We loved the location charm and staff at this hotel and were also pleasantly surprised that we had been upgraded to the PENTHOUSE upon arrival We had booked a suite but the room that we were given was beyond wonderful Hot tub on the balcony overlooking Paseo de Grasieg too lazy to check spelling chilled champagne and snacks waiting for us Truly a wonderful experience for our first visit to this amazing city I was also presented with a beautiful parting gift of a candle upon checking out just great customer service and attention to detail all around We had booked this hotel as a prelude to a 17 day cruise and loved it so much that we plan on visiting Barcelona again one day and will definitely choose the Hotel Majestic when we do 
399983,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Everything was perfect but we would have loved some tea in the morning there was only the Nespresso available Only a minor point though, The bathroom was well designed and very clean The bed was really comfortable too Location excellent We had a great stay 
399984,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, Excellent position and very friendly staff We were in apartments and the cleaning ranged from excellent to poor depending who you got that day Little things like they didn t pull the sheets flat making the beds etc were a pain as you pay a premium to stay here 
399985,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The apartments are not part of the hotel They are located on the opposite side of the road Just disappointed we didn t get the full experience of this famous hotel Also wonder if the toilettes towels linen are the same as the the hotel Quality not what I would have expected from a 5 star In saying that we overall enjoyed our stay very much , We stayed in the apartments Large and spacious for a family of four Well equipped kitchen coffee machine washing machine and dryer Great location waking distances to most tourist spots Staff helpful with booking tickets tours etc 
399986,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, When we arrived our room in the deluxe room in the hotel had a strong smell of smoke which meant we had to move across the road to a building of apartments belonging to the hotel We stayed in apartment 51 which had a foul water smell coming from the bath in the en suite bathroom We asked for the jacuzzi bath to be filled and the jets fkushed out but it wasn t , Location was excellent 
399987,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Overall the hotel was fine but I wasn t wow ed The W on the other hand is amazing And although the W is somewhat further away from the action as in not on the Passeia Graccia I preferred that The hotel was super crowded too crowded It did not feel like a peaceful escape from the craziness of the streets of Barcelona The room was too small and we had a view of the interior courtyard but from the first floor we were basically staring at the restaurant The W was the same price per night and I thought we got far more for our money , The bed was very comfortable and the bath tub was huge Plenty big enough for two people 
399988,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The room given No 504 is certainly dose NOT have the standard of an Executive Deluxe Room as defined by your hotel reservation and marketing department What was worse the window in this Executive Deluxe Room was over looking into a Utility Shaft not bigger than 2 5m by 2 5m This is really scandalous and shameful Finally The next day I have to check out and moved into another Hotel,No Positive
399989,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The initial room we booked with booking com superior double room for 2 adults and two kids for 439 was on the other side of the street on the first floor on streetside about the busiiest road in Barcelona i refused that one they offered us two other rooms in the main building but then i paid double the price , Bed very comfy rooms very nice and quiet 
399990,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, the room category was not match with my reservation the room was next to elevator noise the AC inside the room was not working i have asked for king size bed but i got twin beds However i have asked the front desk twice to change the bed but no action was taken, location
399991,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, as above, First night awake all night due to position of room next to service lift deliveries and laundry being wheeled around then banging into lift Next day after complaining they gave us a room on a difference floor but in the same area So was moved again to another room which was OK But the whole sleepless night and room changing spoilt our much looking forward to weekend 
399992,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Check in was horrible we have arrived 2 45 pm and have to wait till 3 30 to give us the room Check out the system was not working additional fees charged to my room and I don t know for what I have a pending claim now,No Positive

399994,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, When I Checked in at 3 00pm my suite wasn t ready and the staff told me to wait for one hour I had to speak to the supervisor to get the room in 5 minutes , Prime location and excellent junior suite
399995,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Service could have been better at the rooftop pool and would have been nice if the pool was heated , Large apartment well furnished well stocked kitchen Laundry room use of hotel facilities Loved the roof top bar and workout room 
399996,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Restaurant Booking we indeed booked for Sunday brunch while check in but there s no record that shows we re listed while heading to the restaurant on Sunday Finally we got a table but it s not appreciated because it s close to the restroom Please surely improve your hotel on site reservation manipulation procedure , location
399997,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, No issues at all really Apartment was not ready even though the system showed it was so bellman Eloy very nice took us back to Reception where they kindly made a hotel room available so we could rest while they finished cleaning So they turned even a small inconvenience into a plus , Pretty much everything was great Super service from Cristina at check in and Carlos concierge throughout The Residences are the apartments across Passeig de Gracia from the main hotel but you have access to all the hotel services and amenities The apartments are great value for money for a family Excellent finishes top of the line appliances and bath fixtures full maid service All staff were cordial warm efficient 
399998,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, The service was first class The staff was kind and friendly Check in was flawless A hotel employee walked us to our room and explained the various features of the room The bathroom was beautiful with marble d cor and plenty of bath products by Atelier Good size room and very comfortable beds The bed turn down service which included a sample of Atelier Cologne placed on your pillow a different scent each night was a very nice touch The wifi connection was excellent The roof top patio had fantastic views of the city including the Sagrada Familia A great place to enjoy the Barcelona sun and some sangrias The hotel was very close to many attractions including the Gaudi houses shopping and the Barcelona tourist bus Hoping to return next year 
399999,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, They charged us for water and coffee in the room when they said there was coffee and tea making facilities, Comfy bed lovely staff and beautifully decorated
400000,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, Immaculate very large apartment with great facilities and the majestic hotel over the road had an amazing roof terrace with great views of sagrada familia 
400001,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Room views not all have a good view , The breakfast was exceptional Hotel Staff really friendly and helpful Hotel Location perfect for people who like shopping 
400002,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, To me it is generally not acceptable for such category hotel with relative expensive room rate even not inclusive of breakfast And the breakfast charge alone is also very expensive But I still tried but ended up with disappointments Staff were nice but not quite responsive I called for service but no one was picking up the phone at all I went downstairs and spoke to the reception desk but they just blamed it to the telephone line I like to stay in luxury hotel when I am traveling pleasure To have different experience so that I can share with my friends I chose two hotels just nearby 3 nights at Hotel Palace GL which was fantastic and 2 nights at Majestic But to be honest the latter was very much below my expectations , Location is great as it is just on the luxury goods street Late check out was appreciated 
400003,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, Stayed here for a city break From arriving the staff were so lovely and helpful Gave tips on where to eat locally helped book table at restaurants nothing too much trouble Our room was clean luxurious very quiet as requested and the rain shower is superb Beds super comfortable Every attention to detail made Gym is just fine My son enjoyed it there Roof terrace is relaxing to sit in the sun and enjoy views of city The staff make the place as always friendly courteous and smiling Maid service as one would expect and really very happy with our stay Great location and always easy to get a taxi or easy to walk everywhere from here We were allowed to have a late check out as well for no extra cost Thank you Hotel Majestic 
400004,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Food wasn t amazing but we didn t eat loads so may have just been our choice , Lovely place and very friendly Our standard room was very small considering price so we upgraded to deluxe which was lovely but a lot more per night Service is excellent and room v clean and beautiful 
400005,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Only problem they have it is exchange of information between the staff , Beautiful 5 star hotel our favorite in Barcelona Friendly and helpful staff are ready to assist you at any time Located in city centre close to the shops and restaurants everything in walking distance every time when we go to Barcelona we stay in Majestic Hotel 
400006,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, These are Majestic residences which are not in the hotel but across the street The appartment is 80m and great but you cannot enjoy the luxury of a 5 star hotel lobby There are no family rooms for four people in the hotel Anyway our stay was great ,No Positive

400009,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, so disappointed my 2nd time to stay there first time experience was great recommended my whole party customers and partners to stay there while on a conference I was appalled bad room nothing could be done because everytime I ask to change they would say my booking done thru booking com isn t flexible even my date changes I paid an extra night though I didn t need to ,No Positive
400010,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, I was a returning guest for 5 nights this trip and the only thing that I had unfortunate experience with was that there was a problem with the water heating system where the water temeperature would change drastically from hot to cold vice Versace while I was under the shower I explained that to the reception after my first night and came back that same day being informed that it has been taken care of BUT the same thing happened the following day So for 2 nights showering was very inconvenient for me in that room My room was changed I was upgraded with thanx to the Majestic Staff but still I had to repack unpack again for the remaining 3 nights which was very time consuming very inconvenient for me , Loved The Mattress it s the best mattress one could ever sleep on extremely comfortable
400011,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Rooms are somewhat small and I would definitely pay more for the city view Our view was of a service entrance and often workers were unloading garbage , Staff was amazing hotel is in the perfect location beds were so comfy the hotel has a fantastic smell The breakfast was so delicious

400018,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Apartments might need more attention to be 5 star but the hotel itself is very worthy of the stars , Could not fault anything very good all round Location is also excellent 
400019,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, I felt that a small carton of milk should have been provided in the apartment The cost via room service was very expensive indeed, We were self catering
400020,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, would not rate it a 5 star bathrrom tatty and apartments were further from hotel than we expected could not believe we had to book to use sauna steam room and PAY that was bang out of order have stayed in many 4 star and much better and full use of all facilities at no extra cost would not recomend, the area and apartment was great size

400024,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Disappointed that apartments were completely cut off from the hotel you didn t get the feel of staying in a hotel so felt we didn t get to appreciate the full value of the hotel, Great location lovely hotel very clean
400025,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Noise from the street due to poor insulation We got a tiny little room in the second floor where we didn t feel comfortable at all For 400 night without breakfast this felt like a trap , Location and the rooftop bar
400026,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, More care could be taken by the interior decorator e g somewhere to put the soap in the shower a reading light by every bed The walls and doors had a bit too many scratches send a painter there, Location spacious rooms friendly and professional staff
400027,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Responses by a couple of staff when queried re late check out could be better Also room shows lack of maintenance , One of the best concierge team we have encountered Friendly professional and proactive 
400028,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The information about the swimming pool on the roof did not include information that there is a terrace restaurant in the pool are so one can only swim in there during the other people having food or wine , We stayed in Hotel Residences which were located in different building across the Passeig de Gracia Two bedroom flat was spacious and well equipped

400032,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Rooftop pool is quite small very few beds and no shade Room price is a bit high for what is offered specially when breakfast is not included and they charge 37 per person So a couple can have breakfast for 74 , Best location possible and a very friendly helpful staff Very clean and classy

400040,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The floor was consistently a bit dirty and there were ants This is probably because there was some nearby construction and so the patio was always dusty and the dust got tracked into the apartment Still it s a small compromise for the incredible space , The apartment was spacious location spectacular and the facilities very high end Enormous patio for our unit Staff extremely gracious Would absolutely stay again 
400041,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Unfortunately the booking we made apartment was not available when we checked in Staff was nice in proposing other alternatives but we were a bit disappointed as we really wanted to stay all in this apartment that is why we selected this hotel ,No Positive

400061,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The pillows are too soft they become almost flat Hot water difficult to control in the shower From the internet description we had the impression that the hotel was in the centre of town however it was further than expected from most shopping opportunities except luxury items , Service with a smile Very Clean Heated towel rail 
400062,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The toilets in both the bathrooms were constantly filling up in the cistern which kept me awake throughout the night as I am a light sleeper didn t seem to bother my husband though , We stayed in the 2 bed apartment across the road with our 10 and 8 yr olds which was very spacious but wish we had stayed in the hotel as we didn t need the kitchen but it was nice and roomy with 2 bathrooms but again not really necessary and like the luxury of the hotel 
400063,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, As I mentioned above I did not like looking out the hotel window to a cement wall outside , The room was perfect except when looking out the window to the cement walls The location was perfect Unlike Paris the people were extremely kind and helpful I will definitely be back

400065,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Booked a Queen room and the bed was separated upon arrival Had to call the front desk and housekeeper had to come and make bed into a queen These things should be done before guest arrives No wifi for the last couple of days This is a non smoking hotel yet there would be cigarette smell coming through the ventilation system several times a day making the whole room smell like an ash tray I was expecting more from a hotel with this caracter , Nice staff Very helpful when we asked questions or needed anything 
400066,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Pool could be opened earlier and later than times posted, The room including the bed was exceptional I even had a balcony outside big enough for a sofa very tastefully renovated The hotel is just across the road fromPassieg de Gracia so easy access by train from airport
400067,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Wi Fi connection in the Apartments was unreliable But the staff tried their best to help us out , When we complained about the WiFi the management went in an overdrive trying to help us out Great to see and as a result we shall be back 
400068,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, There needed to be more mirrors and plugs in the apartments not just in the bathrooms The layout of the second bedroom wardrobes could do with improving as not good when sharing with friends and everyone needed to get ready , We stayed in the apartments so opposite the main hotel however could still use all of the facilities within the main hotel The location was fantastic and the beds were so comfy Overall a very enjoyable stay I would stay here again and will be telling friends and family about this place 
400069,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, It was expensive but being able to self cater was a bonus , Excellent location from where to explore this fantastic city Very spacious apartment clean and well kitted out Great to do own breakfast in the apartment but still be able to use all the facilities of the hotel just over the road Even though on a main road was very quiet at night and super comfy beds Great Wi fi 
400070,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We did not want to leave , From the moment you arrive at this elegant hotel a bellman and doorman manage your luggage and direct you to the front desk where you are graciously greeted and promptly checked in The entire staff is incredible Everyone is warm friendly efficient and always there to help and immaculte in their sharp blue uniforms The Brunch is phenomenal a buffet alcove reminiscent of a small gourmet shop There are so many pastry bread cheese and charcuterie selections along with yogurts fruit cereal juices and an egg station The food is delicious The hotel residence apartment accommodation we chose is huge and well equipped with a full Siemens kitchen 2 beautiful bathrooms 3 flat screen TV and comfortable beds with luxury linnens The building is a quick walk across from the hotel Wow we loved the views The level of care and attention to detail throughout surely impressed our family If you can you must go 
400071,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, 1 Although the hotel has spa in its name the spa itself was very weak We ordered aroma theropy but in fact it was not so 3 out of 5 marks 2 The so called landmark view of the room selected was not really so perfect to see nice views of Barcelona It was a room with view on the street Do not know what is offered with standart view 3 Breakfast was quite good in term of options but very expensive in term of price per person 4 Some staff members does not know English very well We ordered Jasmine tea but received mint tea in the bar 5 We expected to have nice romantic dinner at the hotel with live music but was surprised to hear that there is no such option in the hotel , Very clean cleaning servies twice in a day Location was good enough The bar at the top has a nice view on the city 
400072,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, It was a little expensive given that I traveled in off season The rooms were very small Also there was lot of outside noise in the room Too much traffic disturbance all night , The location was top notch The staff was ever smiling and welcoming Check in was smooth and so was checking out I needed a late check out and hotel offered it without hesitation Bathrooms were amazing They give Bvlgari toiletries which came as a nice surprise too 
400073,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Er the prices in hotel were a little excessive but I must say offset by the service surroundings and smiles from staff, Although we stayed in appartments across the road the service peace of mind and communication from the staff was top drawer I felt at ease from arrival until departure and the facility hotel is very impressive location spot on as a base for all yours walks etc I can t wait to go again it was simply that good as a base with my young family
400074,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Very thing is extremely good, Stayed in the Residence 2 bedroom suite with wonderful views of the Main Street Excellent facilities and 24 hour room service Staff are very attentive nothing is to Much trouble 
400075,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Apartment was not in the hotel building itself it was in another building accross the street which is not mentioned in booking website No helpdesk in the building you feel somehow is not secured Bedrooms looks like its 3 stars hotel Cleaning the apartment charge was not included in the booking rate even if you leave your garbage outside the apartment no one will remove it You have to take 2 lifts to reach the ground floor The stairs are too close from the left door kids might fall, Kitchen facilities Livingroom Location
400076,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Only one thing disappointed us housekeeping lady stormed our room at 9am even tag do not disturb which was hanging on the door didn t stop her , Beautiful location in the middle of the city on my favorite Passeig de Gr cia street We arrived early morning we were checked in straight away Front desk team was very kind and friendly thank you 
400077,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Nothing, Very nice hotel excellent location and great staff I stayed at this hotel for nearly a week with my 11 years old daughter and we enjoyed our stay Thank you Majestic Hotel and keep up the good work 
400078,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, We stayed in the apartments and they were exceptional The location is within easy walking distance to La Rumbla Sagrada Familia etc and easy access to shops and restaurants The rooms were a great size and the fittings were great 
400079,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, No kettle in the room and an espresso machine where you had to pay for each capsule really mean for a hotel of this standard, A beautiful hotel with excellent facilities
400080,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Like every other nice hotel breakfast is very expensive if not included But this is minor compared to all the virtues of the majestic hotel , The rooms are beautiful quiet and comfortable The staff was attentive but not obsequious and they helped us with meals trips storage of luggage while we went to another city for two days They were beyond amazing and the rooftop views spectacular What a first rate lovely place 
400081,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The only thing I didn t like in the room is its abit small and the windows were not tall enough we stayed in the attached building But don t let this change your mind about the hotel the stay will be worth it 100 , The location of the hotel is excellent The building is fantastic The staff were really helpful The hotel have their own customized scent by Atelier Colonge brand which is amazing You can smell it the second you enter the lobby The rooftop cafe is wonderful at anytime 
400082,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, No magnifying mirror in bathroom Don t eat much for breakfast but ended up paying for E 34 per person full breakfast no alternative other than go out and nowhere suitable in vicinity, Staff very helpful and friendly 
400083,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We didn t feel part of the hotel and its facilities There was no tea and coffee and although I checked before and was told there would be we had to ask 3 times before some came Even then we were told it was chargeable at 15 for 10 coffee Nespresso pods Which when we said we were told it was included they didn t charge , The Majestic Hotel was amazing We stayed in the Majestic Residence which is across a busy dual carriageway and up slightly Whilst the apartments were spacious and well equipped we did feel like the poor relations However there was plenty of choices close by to eat and drink 
400084,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Nothing everything was great, Fantastic location staff were polite and very helpful very quick and efficient service had to organise a doctor who came to our residence within 30 minutes 
400085,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, All the top , I travel non stop every where and to the first time I was very disappointed wit the coustomer care 1 I ask to be given a vew room to the Main Street Not happening 2 I ask for king bed together Not available 3 I told the resaption to Chang they where not helpful 4 I told them to but big mattes over the 2 single bed They said ok I left the hotel and I com back after 5 hours and nothing happened I have to call a gain and a gain to the rcpation to get it Changed After 6 hours the job don I m very sorry that I shoes to stay in ur hotel I had very bad experience Thx u
400086,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Only negative is that it s a shame that the apartments are across the street from the hotel You can use all the facilities but not next door , Travelling with two children of different ages having the benefits of a hotel but a large 2 bedroom apartment made the stay even better It was great to be able to eat around a table settle down and watch a DVD in the lounge after a days sightseeing but then all have our our rooms and space 
400087,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, First time in Barcelona and Alvaro Canales the guest relations manager was so helpful and made our stay quite enjoyable He helped us with tours and restaurants throughout time in Barcelona Gracias
400088,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, We had an apartment across the road thought it not in keeping with the rest of the hotel It was a little tired Would also have liked a larger pool Disappointed that we had to pay for the use of the sauna, Amazing hotel stunning roof top bar Staff were wonderful 
400089,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, Brilliant location with excellent facilities We stayed in one of the apartments located in a building across the road from the main hotel Cannot be faulted
400090,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, 2nd bedroom was tiny and really too small for 2 teenagers to share Although we were left soap and loo roll a small welcome pack of salt pepper olive oil sugar etc could have been useful and although there was a nespresso machine we had to go and buy capsules again a few to get you going would be good , Well kitted out apartment though slightly tired great location
400091,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, It is an amazing hotel excellent location very friendly staff delicious breakfast it is one of the best hotels I have ever been and I am looking forward to go there again soon
400092,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, I really loved the welcoming from everyone in the hotel from the first day to us to the last moment for us on the hotel and I d like really to thank Mr Antonio RODRIGUEZ for his welcoming and his fully support I really would like to thank everyone in Majestic hotel for making my HONEY MOON more than great Thank you everyone and hope to see you soon wish you all the best Majestic Family 
400093,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Nothing at all , Fantastic location by far the nicest part of this beautiful city Staff at the hotel couldn t be faulted in any way they were all so friendly and helpful we will be going back 100 
400094,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, No clean towels and no room clean even tho they said it would be done once during our stay , Hotel was beautiful but wasn t until we checked in we found out we was across the road Not in the hotel where the pool and spa was 
400095,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, small bed if you are very tall For breakfast they don t serve fresh vegetables like tomato paprika cucumber , We stayed in apartment in the building across the street of hotel Apartment was excellent Breakfast in hotel is great Everything is 10 15 min walk from hotel 
400096,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Minor quibbles none of which take away from this being one of the finest lodging of my life 1 Calling the front desk was a nuisance it would ring 20 times before someone answered 2 The in room guide said towels would be changed on request and no daily housekeeping was included When we met our housekeeper in the hall he told us he d tried to get in every day but we had the no service sign up Had we known a freshening up was included we d have handled it differently 3 Unlike some other flats they throw out all the leftover guest items tea coffee salt pepper napkins etc So when you move in there s nothing in the cabinets from prior guests , The best possible location Fantastic apartment beautifully furnished comfy beds everything I needed Seriously probably the most luxurious apartment I ve ever stayed in 
400097,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The transparent minibar door The light from the minibar shone directly on us and as a result the room was too brightly lit at night , Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful The room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable In fact the room was completely satisfactory 
400098,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The wi fi went out all over the hotel for two days of our stay which made it difficult for us to connect with our transportation company and airlines Our cruise ship arrived in port early causing us to arrive at the hotel by 9 00 am We were told check in time was 3 00 pm and our room would not be available until then At 3 00 pm the maid was still cleaning Luggage and personal items of the previous guest was in the room when the bellman escorted us there for our stay , We enjoyed the roof top bar and views of the city The hotel was beautiful and our room spacious and comfortable The location was excellent we would stay there again when in the city 
400099,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, If you are coming from a place where 5 star hotels are very extravagant and very spacious such as Dubai Abu Dhabi you will be a bit uncomfortable and disappointed by how small the rooms are Rooms are quite small But I guess this is normal in Europe All in all If you are staying for few days you will adopt to the area and the space will grow into you and it will become of no issue , The Location is perfect Passage Gracia is a shopping promenade where you can find almost all high end brands Chanel is in the same building Also within a walking distance of 2 min you can reach two of the most highly regarded Guadi s architectural masterpieces you can also walk to the Sagrada Familia to the north and La Rambla to the south both within 20 min reach The Staff were very friendly and helping we had few awkward situations 1 pork was served mistakenly in our order though the dish was vegetarian but the staff were very professional to handle the situation and the dish was remade again Note pork ham is part of many dishes in this hotel and in Spain in general so please if you don t consume pork for religious reasons or any other reason make sure that the dish is pork free before you delve in it Another Situation 2 we requested a twin bed room in our booking statement and also during the check in but we were guided to a room with a double bed TWICE in our third room tour we were very tired so the concierge guided us to an upgraded room with a twin bed but with no view and the Hotel suggested that we stay at this room until our twin bed room with a view is ready so we spent half of the day in that room and then we were transferred to our room when it was ready The friendliness of the staff made the situation much easier for us despite its awkwardness The Hotel has a very welcoming sophisticated and nicely decorated marble lobby opened to the passage Gracia it was quite nice and comforting to return to the hotel after a long day and be greeted by the concierge at the entrance door or leave the hotel in the morning with the concierge helping you with a Taxi The Hotel has a very pleasant scent which is quite memorable to me that was the highlight of my stay The scent of the lobby and corridors 
400100,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, For 300 a night I expect more Our room was smaller than the cruise ship stateroom we had just left and looked out on an airshaft The promised pool is a small plunge pool on the roof with a beautiful view but water was not heated on a very cool October evening so we did not swim We requested twin beds but discovered a king too late the first night to change it They did fix this for the second night The wi fi was down the whole 3 days of our stay , The location is good The staff were helpful The hotel is clean 
400101,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Abril at reception was not particularly helpful towards us as tired travelers and trying to meet our needs but the rest of the staff were fantastic particularly Marc at the concierge desk , The hotel is stylish and beautiful in the heart of Barcelona close to everything you need

400103,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, The check in was 3 00 pm which was a bit of a pain as we arrived at 12 00 pm and had made arrangements for the afternoon This was made worse as we were then told that the apartment would not be ready until 3 30pm due to late check out of previous guests , The location is fantastic you could not be more central Very close for all transport metro bus and taxis 
400104,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL, Location as the view from the windows is on service roof that makes the price of the suite is on the higher side, Location and the size furniture and hospitality in the junior suite
400105,Majestic Hotel Spa Barcelona GL,No Negative, The hotel has a wonderful location close to most of Barcelona s highlights but also in an elegant area The staff are highly professional and couldn t do enough to assist We enjoyed the traditional grand nature of the hotel and the roof top bar area
