509020,Corinthia Hotel London, I liked everything , I loved this hotel Staff were incredibly friendly and the hotel was absolutely amazing in every way The spa was the absolute best I ve ever seen 
509021,Corinthia Hotel London, Some staff were rude particularly in the spa But that was not a reflection on the spa staff only those individuals that you can evidently see have poor personal characteristics which is reflective of their disrespectful behaviour, Ambience was great plus I got a free room upgrade I was there for a spa weekend for my birthday with my friend and the staff made my stay very special 
509022,Corinthia Hotel London, Pillows too soft for our liking but no big deal and I m sure they would have sorted it if we d asked , Excellent facilities fantastic room very friendly and attentive staff Best hotel stay in London ever this is now my go to hotel from now on

509024,Corinthia Hotel London, We felt The Bassoon bar lacked atmosphere and the bloody Mary s were rubbish, Very good outside cigar smoking terrace one of the best in London terrific cigar humidor and collection too On the whole up there with the best hotels in London Great spa facilities 
509025,Corinthia Hotel London, We did wait a little long for the dessert but this was down to an accident in the kitchen where the dessert plate was dropped We were kept informed of this by our waiter Isaac who was excellent Accidents happen so this is not really an issue I would ordinarily like to put in the do not like section But it meant that we had a rather late dessert but we stayed for far longer at the table than we should have anyway we were having so much fun the staff was very patient with us even though they had to set up for breakfast in the morning , We visited the Corinthia again due to being very satisfied the first time round Once again the service was excellent and the attention to detail and the service with a smile attitude of staff was exemplary I was surprised that you could actually have a cigar in the patio area and I took advantage of this A fine Cuban cigar while seated on a comfy sofa next to a log fire super relaxing Thank you Bensa for the wonderful elderflower drink you prepared for my friend and I and for your service I also had dinner again with friends at the north Hall restaurant where we were again looked after by Giorgio Isaac and Alessio providing great service Asima gave a great recommendation for the wine the staff know their stuff for any wine buffs out there The Hake was super fresh and cooked to perfection the steak and ribeye was melt in the mouth and beautifully presented The desserts are very imaginative and delicious it s clear that a lot of thought and care was put in the menu and credit to the chefs for producing A class food it really is Michelin star worthy and I ve dined in Hotels with Michelin stars A big thank you to Giorgio for taking us on a tour of the lesser known private dining areas of the hotel which we may hire for a larger party in future Deya at the North Hall greeted us with a smile and made sure our meal with our friends was as enjoyable as possible Thank you Deya and to all at the Corinthia 
509026,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, Everything was absolutely perfect Spent one night after the marathon and it was a great place to relax Beds had lovely linen Breakfast was a delicious feast Spa was out of this world Worth every penny 
509027,Corinthia Hotel London, The Hotel itself was great some guests were rather loud in the patio area which acts like an amplifier because of the architecture of the Hotel The laughs and shouting could be heard right up to the seventh floor where we were I did not complain as it was Easter and people were on holiday but shouting between balconies was not acceptable especially in the era of mobile phones This is not the Hotel s fault though This is due to disrespectful and in many cases drunk people s fault Although this shouting did not last too long my friend played Mozart on the violin from the sixth floor balcony all the shouting stopped I reckon everyone thought it was coming from the heavens , The staff were attentive to all our needs and requests The duty managers Daniel and Jean Phillipe were very helpful and gave a lot of their time to make sure we had a comfortable and relaxing stay The maids were polite and always wearing a smile The staff at the North Hall restaurant were particularly welcoming they granted us the table we chose and were a joy to speak to and the service was excellent Thank you to the manager Balasz and a special thanks to Alexi Deya Coco Lilly and to all the waiters And to the chef too The food was excellent We did not try the other restaurant of the Hotel as it was closed for Easter but we will soon as we ll definitely be re visiting the Corinthia Jason Clemence Nicole at the front desk were all very helpful It s the people who make a Hotel and full marks to the staff at the Corinthia for making us feel very welcome No staff had name tags but I remember their names because they connected with us in such a welcoming way on a daily basis that we remembered their names now that s a sign of how comfortable and memorable our experience was Kristina thank you for making us feel so welcome in the patio area and for the blanket The spa is something my wife used so she d be best qualified to give an opinion Unfortunately she went during child hours so it was a bit noisy But the times are clearly displayed on arrival on your TV screen and in booklets so no excuse there I did meet Michelle from the spa and look forward to using the spa when we go back My wife and I had a haircut styled by Ricky and Alex who were both excellent and fun to be with We talked so much that before we knew it our hair was done Overall great credit must go to the staff of this Hotel we will be returning for sure and we will be staying in one of the penthouses for a real special occasion 
509028,Corinthia Hotel London, We did not get our newspapers delivered to the room in the mornings but we weren t really expecting the service anyway so we weren t too disturbed by it , The floral displays were beautiful The whole experience was the height of luxury it was expensive but worth the money The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful We went out for 90 minutes on the Saturday and set the light for the room to be made up and it was immaculate when we returned 
509029,Corinthia Hotel London, On Saturday left my room at 12 30 expecting room to be cleaned in my return Returned at 3 45 pm not clean but was done as soon as I complained the response was poor they didn t know why it was cleaned ,No Positive
509030,Corinthia Hotel London, Unfortunately a brief stay We didn t find anything wrong in the little time we spent in the hotel We would definitely return , Very comfortable bed our room was plush and well maintained They seem to have anticipated all your needs as the room had everything you could possibly want Public areas beautifully kept and the spring flower displays were superb Good plentiful and tasty breakfast with very pleasant and helpful staff

509037,Corinthia Hotel London, Lacks of spa policy customers can be loud and messy The bathroom blind and curtain were broken and needed replacement for this type of hotel it was surprising Room service menu is ridiculously expensive and quality just ok , Beautiful location amazing and original breakfast room very comfortable Incredible spa mostly reserved to adults pool has kids hours best sauna I ve very seen Room was ready early also 
509038,Corinthia Hotel London, We were exploring the hotel having a look at the hall rooms as we were thinking about having our wedding reception at the corinthia when a security man stopped us and asked us to leave immediate He wasn t very pleasant to us and made us feel very uncomfortable and un welcome This was a shame because up until that experience we were having such a lovely time The rest of the staff were amazing especially the hotel receptionists who made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable , when we arrived we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite as I had proposed to my fianc that day This was a lovely touch from Corinthia hotel and apreciated it very much

509042,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, Had a wonderful stay over Christmas On the 25th we enjoyed couple of hours at the Spa which is absolutely fantastic We also appreciated the little gifts on our beds every day and the generous stocking left at our door on Christmas day 
509043,Corinthia Hotel London, Breakfast selection was just ok not worth the 36 price if its not included in your room rate Ordered poached eggs first morning and they were not fully cooked so asked for them medium the 2nd morning and they were just the same not cooked properly Croissant s and sausages are good though I would give the breakfast a miss the next time I stay , Room was truly amazing with a TV in the large bath and the attention to detail was excellent the room was immaculate and an excellent size for being in London Pool area was amazing Staff were excellent and were very helpful Great location just a minutes walk to the embankment tube station Will definitely return next time we are in London
509044,Corinthia Hotel London, We were charged for coffee and tea that had been offered to us as we waited for our room to be ready it was appeared to us as a complimentary gesture as we waited for twenty minutes Apart from that everything was excellent , Pure comfort Excellent location close to all the big sights as well as the west end for all the shows It s expensive without doubt but it s amazing Staff are exceptional chased up the newspaper we wanted even 
509045,Corinthia Hotel London, Only King Size Beds not Super King in all rooms up to and including a Junior Suite Some rooms road facing are prone to traffic noise even on the 7th floor , Facilities and decor are all excellent Quality of food and service in the Bassoon Bar and Massimo Restaurant were first class 
509046,Corinthia Hotel London, Slight delay in checking in but as it was New Years Day and many guests had delayed their check out it wasn t a big problem, Stunning hotel close to the river The Spa facilities are the best we ve ever seen in England similar in standard to those in the best German or Dutch spas A pricey break but worth it for the luxury 
509047,Corinthia Hotel London, I was told a sit down meal was 150 p p but our room service for two came to 90 total This could lead some people to pay much more than needed , The staff were amazing every need was catered for The food on the room service menu was some of the best I ve eaten the spa IS the best I ve been too in London The location is hard to rival 
509048,Corinthia Hotel London, The concierge staff is not very helpful which is very surprising all other staff are so nice When I asked for assistance to change the number of persons for a lunch reservation at a restaurant he helped to call the restaurant passed the phone to me to talk to the restaurant directly I actually told him I needed to go out asked him to leave a message for me However he asked me to just wait a moment to see if he could get through I really didn t expect this kind of service from concierge from such a hotel , Reception staff very friendly helpful A particular room service staff is so polite set our table food perfectly Room is comfy nice Location is very convenient 
509049,Corinthia Hotel London, the service in Massimo restaurant was poor but the food was excellent the amazing spa facilities were split by allowing children in who treated it understandably like a children s playground so not relaxing at all, The room was excellent and very quiet and comfortable location for central London ideal The cocktail bar was fantastic
509050,Corinthia Hotel London, The room needs a kettle to make tea there is a espresso machine which can heat the water but its tainted with coffee but the coffee is great, The staff were great and super accomodating the hotel has character unlike so many hotels the location is fabulous The rooms were well insulated no outside noise and the shower was the best
509051,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing to dislike at all, A very nice place to stay Location was perfect as it is in the centre of central London I have never stayed in a hotel as spotlessly clean as this one the staff were excellent very client focused and willing to help in any way Strongly recommended
509052,Corinthia Hotel London, Breakfast selection In addition one night there was a disturbing group of guests that rang my door at 6 am The hotel just apologised with amenities not enough for me, Location SPA room comfort and size
509053,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, A fairy tale experience The room felt fresh and new the style is classic but modern and was generously sized for an urban hotel The inclusive breakfast and spa facilities exceeded my expectations The staff were attentive but discreet Overall a perfect place to go with someone or on your own for a retreat from the city outside 
509054,Corinthia Hotel London, The cheaper smaller rooms are in need of repair The carpets are coming away the cupboard doors don t shut properly and their are towels and water dropped all over the spa in areas where there shouldn t be any Just left there The high level of finesse that it is well known for was not apparent this time The concierge even struggled to recommend bars near St Paul s and said he d look on yelp , This hotel is not just great but one of the best in the world The only issue I have got with it is the price is getting higher but the standards are dropping 
509055,Corinthia Hotel London, Breakfast Service slow and the hot food on the buffet was cold especially the scrambled eggs Toast came burnt one morning but was replaced on request and when cutlery removed after eating fruit none was replaced for the hot breakfast and had to ask and not easy to attract attention , A very special hotel with superb rooms and bathrooms and comfy beds and the most amazing spa in London on the lower 4 floors The window in the bedroom opened hurrah The Bassoon bar had a great evening atmosphere 
509056,Corinthia Hotel London, Absolutely nothing, Best hotel ever We loved this hotel every part of it Better than The Ritz or Four Seasons Food was excellent rooms are beautifully appointed and so comfortable bats and restaraunts were so beautiful service was outstanding Can t wait to go back and wish they had more hotels around the world 
509057,Corinthia Hotel London, A lot of everyday staff cannot speak English chambermaids etc , Bed sheets were amazing love the spa area too It feels good to see a good hotel in London being British that doesn t often happen 
509058,Corinthia Hotel London, Having to go home , A really beautiful hotel with very attentive friendly staff We were very fortunate to be offered an upgrade from our junior suite to a stunning spacious river suite with an enormous very comfortable bed and a magnificent bathroom Dining facilities were superb with some meals served in the room without a hitch Then the Spa was just sublime All in all we were blessed with a very memorable stay in what we feel is the finest hotel in London and possibly anywhere
509059,Corinthia Hotel London, The beds aren t as comfortable as other hotels but still comfortable, The staff are great and very accommodating Love the casual comfort and style of hotel Great location
509060,Corinthia Hotel London, Hospitality tray in room would have liked a kettle and fresh milk for our morning cup of tea Biscuits would be nice too , The turndown service was a lovely addition Love the TV in the bath
509061,Corinthia Hotel London, Having to talk to management about the basic issues that we had, Location excellent This was my go to hotel when in London unfortunately had a few issues with stay which were sorted BUT really shouldn t have been any issues at all as they were basic hospitality issues that should never have arisen in the first place in this type of establishment
509062,Corinthia Hotel London, It was a little pricey but so is everything in London , The location was excellent it was central to most everything we wanted to see The room was spacious and well laid out and the staff was very helpful We had no complaints whatsoever 
509063,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing Apart from MORE Halal options for food I think with this hotels clientele they could really capitalise on this not so nich market and be a go to for Good Halal food London lacks good Halal Restaurants Fact , I just love this hotel Espa is the best spa I ve been too in London and I ve been too a few The afternoon tea is very civilised and the abundance of fresh flowers really sets the scene for a delightful stay in very large rooms as standard for London 
509064,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, I loved the atmosphere and kindness of the staff the food and most of all the little surprises that were left on my pillow made me look forward to get back to the room to see what s waiting for me 
509065,Corinthia Hotel London, Room not ready when told that it was hadn t been checked Fridge was very smelly as previous guests had left opened cheese in there Mini bar or refreshments had not been replenished Safe was broken and had to be replaced this took nearly an hour altogether of our time No instructions on how to work anything and had to call for assistance with the TV as simply wouldn t turn on Only 1 pair of slippers between 2 guests Buffet breakfast was cold on all 3 mornings toast had to be ordered once it didn t even arrive and the other was at the end of my breakfast and cold , Location fab room lovely and spacious staff pleasant and helpful beds comfy Nice touches from housekeeping and lovely spa and pool 
509066,Corinthia Hotel London, I booked this for a special occasion for 2700 SEK for two nights which is 270 For this I expected 4 star luxury but it doesn t reflect a UK version of 4 star It was basic and clean kindve like ibis with a nicer bed There were other hotels in the area half the price and same quality , It was clean with black out blinds and air con so our sleep was great The breakfast was plentiful with a lot to choose from It carried us well into the afternoon 
509067,Corinthia Hotel London, Lovely breakfast buffet with a wide choice lovely breads fruit pastries but I don t like hot buffet breakfasts so I was disappointed that it wasn t cooked to order Quality food used but I like my bacon crispy I loathe runny scrambled egg it never seems hot enough , Fantastic spa beautiful rooms thoughtful touches An outstanding hotel 2 mins from the tube Very quiet slept really well Probably the best hotel I have ever visited 
509068,Corinthia Hotel London, One of the coffee cups was still dirty but not biggy , Lovely hotel room was amazing and a very pleasant atmosphere Couldn t of faulted the staff and their great service 
509069,Corinthia Hotel London, Once we checked in there was strong smoking smell in our room we told the reception about it and they sent a housekeeper to clean it the room we were given was very small room 106 on the night of weekend a noise from a party or club in the hotel that lasts up to 3 00 AM we could not sleep well that night My advice for hotel guests is to take room in a high level floor my room was costing 1819 Pounds but the hotel blocked 2568 Pounds at check in which is very high , staff and service were very good Room facilities and bathroom were excellent 
509070,Corinthia Hotel London, The bad food of the hotel restutant It was really REALLY horrible But they didn t charge us for it so we appreciate that Also the breakfast was a 3 stars hotel resturant breakfast not a 5 stars hotel The should also consider the children facilities , I like the peaceful atmospher We also liked the friendly treatment from the staff and the conceirge and the reception The rooms were classic but very nice 
509071,Corinthia Hotel London, When we got too our bedroom we were very disappointed We were given a disability room We had red cords hanging from the ceiling over our bed The shower unit had chairs in it The toilet area hand four handles all around it The breakfast was the worst I ever had We ordered porridge the first morning we got there The porridge was a bowl of water The 2 bowels of porridge cost 17 sterling I asked for a baileys coffee in one of there restaurants The girl that served us didn t know how it was made She gave me a half glass of cold coffee with a drop of baileys in it This cost 17 sterling There was no chicken on the menu in the restaurant I had too ask for it They should accommodate people from other countries and give them what they want Google it if they have too find out how to make these things This is a five star hotel after all , The hotel was fab The staff were great Especially the concierge staff They were the best They helped us out with all of our tours 
509072,Corinthia Hotel London, all was taken care of by Jochem Meijerink, Attention to detail and response in solving problems I think its to do with who is the leader and I give 100 to Jochem Meijerink Front Office Manager
509073,Corinthia Hotel London, I genuinely struggle to think of a single negative thing in this perfect hotel The tiniest comment or request I would make is that the hollandaise sauce has a little more lemon added to it That is literally all I can find to say ask , The service was just flawless The breakfast was just divine the homemade granola and the hash browns are just perfection 
509074,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and made us feel special Nothing was a problem Rooms were very comfortable and beautifully decorated Spa was amazing Didn t want to leave Thank you 
509075,Corinthia Hotel London, Was assigned to a smaller than booked room but being quickly corrected the next day and waved extra bed for next 9 days of stay Thanks The smaller room is very clean and comfortable I would accept it if my wife didn t think it was too small The room cleaning staff had an issue The first few nights was fantastic Seventh night on the maid missed night turn down and next day didn t clean our room till four five o clock in the afternoon We were forced to wait for an hour and half for her to finish but we saw Matt Damon coming out of hotel for his new movie premier We told the hotel about the service was not done well even we turned up the make up room light Later the maid reflect her emotion to us The maid management does not match the rest of service One of the concierge rudely reply to us that he never heard about discount card for hotel guest at the outlet He spoke in a manner that going to outlet shopping is a low class behavior This is just a single incidence and can t represent the rest of hotel staff Majority of them are very fine Polite and proud of this hotel The ESPA looks very fine from photo and it looks even better once inside It also feature individual shower room It should be very nice experience but I just don t want to stay in there and continue to use For the jet massage I used once or twice and move to next After go around all spot I just want to take shower and leave Unlike in Swiss I want to keep using the facility for hours for this ESPA one hour is more than edequate including shower and dressing Probably it has to do with dark color environment , Clean and comfort vs price ratio Nice and polite doorman Excellent Italian restaurant and good tea pastries not rated 
509076,Corinthia Hotel London, Everything was perfect, This hotel offered beautiful accomdations and outstanding service From the time we arrived staff was so helpful You couldn t ask for more in a hotel Great location 
509077,Corinthia Hotel London, I thought the food was a little overpriced in the restaurants and the room service menu 35 for a curry , Staff are in every area ofthe hotel are fantastically friendly and the service was exceptional The hotel although less grand than other 5 star hotels in central London is in am amazing location and the Spa facilties are incredible 
509078,Corinthia Hotel London, Couldn t find tea making facilities although they had coffee machine in room The cocktail bar was very dark to the extent it was difficult reading menu Didn t like the idea of showing you bar list via laptop , A touch of luxury and very professional and attentive staff Very much enjoyed afternoon tea in Lobby Had a lovely room with a view of the London Eye and the biggest bathroom I ve ever seen 
509079,Corinthia Hotel London, I couldn t possibly think of anything , The room was superb all facility staff excellent too Prompt room service and the staff just lovely bringing ironing kit to my room in a speedy fashion too Each person I encountered beamed with a smile and I had an absolute pleasure in the stay 
509080,Corinthia Hotel London, They have mischarged me for about 90 pounds for a hotel lunch whereas I havent even gone to the hotel restaurant during that timeslot The staff promised me to check at the later stage and I am still waiting for their investigation and reply , the hotel has arranged me a very late check out which really ease my travel plan as I am taking a late flight on that day 
509081,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing major but the coffee machine in the room wasn t working , Excellent stay we loved everything about the hotel From arrival to departure the staff were great the spa facilities were amazing highly recommended The room was clean comfortable and spacious We will be back 
509082,Corinthia Hotel London, The set up on the room TV wasn t very good with some key UK channels missing and the screen seemed quite out of place At breakfast the staff didn t seem very engaged to help and the tables were small I was on a table for 4 but once my plate and cup were there there was little room for anything else There didn t appear to be any toast on offer if there was it wasn t obvious or offered For some reason I can t explain I felt the least comfortable and relaxed on my own at breakfast during both dinners restaurant staff were charming courteous and attentive but not overly so At breakfast it was appeared that all that mattered was customer turn round rather than customer service, I needed to escape a hectic working life and building work at home so booked a late deal and I wasn t sorry I loved the size of my room The bed was enormous everything had been thought of even an umbrella if you needed it The bathroom was well laid out and high spec Had breakfast in bed one morning which was excellent and made me feel very special Spent 6 hours in the ESPA Spa The back massage facial and scalp massage were incredible All the surroundings were relaxing with lots of spaces to kick back and relax Fantastic dinners in both restaurants I thought the beef carpaccio couldn t be beaten but the venison carpaccio was heavenly And well done for selling lobster thermador with thin fries perfect 
509083,Corinthia Hotel London, We didn t have a kettle in the room but they soon brought one up for us , The staff seem to really care Nothing is too much trouble The spa is the best I have used so relaxing We were celebrating my mum s birthday and they upgraded us and gave us a mini birthday cake in the room 
509084,Corinthia Hotel London, We thought that the cost of breakfast in our bedroom was too high so we decided to go elsewhere , The staff were great and very understanding of our timing issue of leaving your wonderful brunch and getting to the show we had booked I liked the Happy Birthday in chocolate on my desert plate great touch 
509085,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were fantastic its was brilliant to see so many available really impressed Loved the Bassoon Bar great atmosphere The flowers around the Hotel were stunning 
509086,Corinthia Hotel London, The children are allowed in spa and swimming pool only from 10 11 30 in the morning and 15 16 30 in the afternoon The lobby lounge s food is not so good and terribly expensive , Beautiful hotel and very clean Very polite and helpful staff Gorgeous Spa Very good restaurant Northall
509087,Corinthia Hotel London, The breakfast could include some salads The food quality is not much excellent considering other facilities and services in the hotel The thermal floor is too crowded with young couples It seems not suitable for a family with children and also time is limited for children , The staffs were very kind and helpful The room was very clean and comforable A staff at the reception desk was impressively kind and she greeted us very delightedly at every moment to see each other 
509088,Corinthia Hotel London, Chose a room looking into the courtyard for noise cancellation Room service is better than OK but bacon with my eggs was not cooked let alone crispy Not acceptable for a hotel of this standard , Staff is very helpful and plentiful Lobby area common parts work despite being strangely distributed inheritance from the old building I suppose Very convenient location for West End and City Very comfortable room Fantastic bathrooms Very nice hair salon 
509089,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, This hotel is faultless from the doorman holding the umbrella over me while I get out of the car to the fabulous breakfast enjoyed after the best sleep ever in our luxurious executive room
509090,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, From the moment we arrived the staff went above and beyond expectations The hotel is absolutely beautiful clean and quite with a great service I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London 
509091,Corinthia Hotel London, Brasserie Restaurant menu was ok but could be a litle more interedting, Location room is excellent Quietness cleanliness Room service is great including staff 
509092,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing, I liked that the staff did everything to make my stay as comfortable as ever since I had very specific requirements which meant that I was in and out if the hotel several times in the space of a few hours They offered me complimentary parking and a few other perks thrown in too like late check out after my 10 month old baby joined us
509093,Corinthia Hotel London, Spa was beautiful also But I did think in places it was a bit dirty round pool edges And in the jacuzzi , Beautiful hotel Staff attend to every need with such professionalism 
509094,Corinthia Hotel London, No electric pot Yes we could use the coffee machine to get hot water but it came with a bit remaining coffee, Great location especially for the new year fireworks 
509095,Corinthia Hotel London, We had an unfortunate delay in food service on one occasion over the festive period however Rachel the Spa Manager was fantastic at resolving it immediately to our satisfaction and in our eyes this above anything else sets the service standard at the highest level We cannot recommend the hotel enough to all of our friends , Fantastic hotel with beautiful facilities and excellent rooms The quality of the hotel and the level of service for ourselves and for our 2 year old was greatly appreciated it made our New Year extra special 
509096,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing a little pricey but you get what you pay for in London , Excellent hotel very comfortable and spacious room great location in the centre and yet quiet and relaxing inside the hotel The spa is awesome as is the 24 hour gym Lovely breakfast 
509097,Corinthia Hotel London, The staff at the spa were friendly but not particularly helpful I asked if there were any men s magazines for my partner and was directed to the floor below to go and find one I would have expected one of the three spa receptionists stood doing nothing to have gone and found a selection for me , Our room was stunning and so well furnished The bed was huge and the bath was big enough for two Breakfast was fabulous The spa is clostraphobic and far too dark
509098,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing, Fantastic location and a most wonderful spa At breakfast one was spoilt for choice which included congee and dim sum I didn t have time for the afternoon tea but it looked amazing 
509099,Corinthia Hotel London, we invited 6 friends to dine in the evening at north restaurant the food was great the service appalling it took 15mins to get a drink and an age to order our meal we had to leave the table to look for a member of staff the only thing that came fast was the thousand pound bill I complained on checkout but received no redress, the staff at reception were 1st class as was the room 
509100,Corinthia Hotel London, If anything and there wasn t much not to love was the breakfast The fruits pastries cold items were all excellent the fried items were on the whole average , Overall hotel cleanliness Basoon bar cocktails staff bed comfort room comfort all fantastic This hotel is still our favourite place to stop in the capital 
509101,Corinthia Hotel London, Nothing, Service in general Polite and helpful personel no to stiff and not to loose clients with costumes and clients in Leisure outfit no problem at all
509102,Corinthia Hotel London, We had preordered a cake and bottle of champagne for my daughters birthday the champagne was not delivered to the room as requested and it took 3 or 4 phone calls to reception until it was finally delivered for a 5 star hotel I find this level of service quite simply not good enough , Wonderful location facilities and very helpful reception staff at check in
509103,Corinthia Hotel London,No Negative, Having stayed at the Corinthia for a week we felt that it is an exceptional hotel and well worth the not insignificant cost Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are really friendly knowledgeable and helpful The room was very well equipped spacious and clean and the hotel s facilities are fantastic For such an opulent central london hotel it feels very personal and family run and this creates a very pleasant environment in which to stay We would definitely recommend it and look forward to staying again
