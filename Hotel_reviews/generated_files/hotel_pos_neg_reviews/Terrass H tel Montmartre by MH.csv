37583,Terrass H tel Montmartre by MH, We had specifically booked a suite with Eiffel Tower views for our last few days in Paris only to find ourselves in a room with views of a brick wall Upon pointing out the error to the gentleman at front desk he managed it very ungraciously and somewhat arrogantly We eventually ended up in a suite with just partial views and yet rather than acknowledging this was still a lesser category than what we had booked and apologising or making amends we were made to feel like we were being done a great favour by the hotel in moving us We did not need to hear the blame against booking com for the problem at hand or about any issues they were having with them we just needed it resolved in pleasant manner and perhaps a nice touch would have been to offer us something complimentary to make up for the inconvenience and disappointment This poor customer service tainted our overall experience and opinion of the hotel , The room was very comfortable and spacious Location was very good 
37584,Terrass H tel Montmartre by MH, The maitre d was a little frosty on the busy night we ate in the restaurant , Amazing view across Paris to the Eiffel Tower from the roof terrace bar especially good at night with the tower lit up Friendly helpful reception staff who were happy to advise on local attractions and restaurants Such a comfortable bed The cocktails were outstanding Good bus routes from right outside the hotel to the centre of Paris
