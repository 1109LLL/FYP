90882,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, I missed all the daily free Champagne at 5 30 in the lobby My fault as I was always out touring Paris at that time You Will spend very little time in the Hotel Really I have nothing bad to say about this hotel having spent 4 great days there , Location Location Location Minutes from Notre Dame and Lourve walking Metro RER Saint Micheal Notre Dame Station so handy for CDG airport Versailles Eiffel Tower Catacombs etc Beside the Latin Quarter with HUGE selection of cafe s restaurants etc I could go on and on but the Hotel is in a fantastic location The Metro station with a PARIS VISIT PASS makes traveling all over the city so convenient The hotel is clean service was good and the staff were genuinely very helpful and friendly They give you a complimentary mobile WiFi hotspot on checking in that works all over Paris OMG what a genius idea I was connected the whole time while touring Paris I did not avail of the hotel breakfast 15 as seriously you are in Paris every 10 feet of walking you seem to pass a restaurant or cafe always serving food and drink what ever your takes your fancy There is a Monoprix store around the corner you can buy beer wine or any of your usual essentials very handy 
90883,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Nearly nonexistent breakfast just 1 small table of stuff no selection they don t even make omelette Only staff at the reception speaks good English others nearly none Soundproofing is nonexistent noise in the corridor and nearby rooms made sleeping difficult Water pressure in shower was very low 4th floor ventilation is shower and toilet insufficient , Coffee great champagne and sweets served for free in the evening is nice too interior on the reception floor is nice considering limited space reception staff was very helpful 
90884,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, The doublebed is a little bit too small for my daughter and I I thought it risky that there was no gripp which helps to get out from the bathtub , Champagne happy hour everyday Free drinks in the fridge Free Portable Wifi Friendly and helpful hotel staff

90893,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, It says it s a 4 star hotel but it feels more like a 2 3 stars The rooms are tiny the to had no brush trash can and no isolation cold and loud all the time The shower door didn t fit so I couldn t close it There was only a small plastic shower gel The rooms were extremely loud to the point we thought people were trying to enter our room when guests would go back to the rooms next door The bed and overall space was very small , Delicious sweets at the entrance Staff was friendly 
90894,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Nothing, Staff were very helpful and excellent The hotel location was near all the tourist attractions shops and restaurants All I can say it was an amazing stay and the hotel felt like home 
90895,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Breakfast was ok nothing Special The rooms was heated with two Heatimng Station but still cold espicially in the bath, Its very close to the Saint Michel Station and next to a lot of Restaurants Around the Corner is Monoprix where you can by some groceries and Drinks Very friendly staff and nice cute Hotek
90896,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Breakfast was a little pricey and it would have been more convenient to not have a separate toilet in the room However room was nice and cosy well equipped and very clean , A small comfortable friendly hotel is in a great location to explore this wonderful city Nice touches Inc free mini bar orange juice champagne and little delicontasant cakes avaliable in the reception area 
90897,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, The flowers decoration in the bedroom was a bit too much and consuming much space in the room , This is our second stay after we got back from Lourdes Finally we got a nice smaller bedroom with a bigger bathroom and no longer on the 6th floor The main elevator was finally fixed We got all out luggage ready in our new room The male front desk staff was treating me nicely and friendly that time The free soft drinks in the mini bar were finally 6 items as it was told in the email 
90898,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, The main elevator was out of service We had to use the very small elevator We stayed on level 6 and we had to climb up the stairs due to the back up elevator only served to the 5th floor In the email we were informed that we would be given 6 free soft drinks but we got only 3 items instead until my first check out One of the male staff needed to be more friendly and he was a bit defensive when I asked him politely about my inconvenience His answer was ok but the way he answered was not ok , This is my first stay I love the spaciousness coziness and cleanness of the room nice bathroom the refreshments at the lobby was very entertaining very good location 
90899,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Better cleaning housekeeping of rooms in the day Housekeeping not making loud vacuum cleaning noise at 9 10 am while guests in bed waking us up Start later Provide actual double beds instead of joining together two single beds which are very uncomfortable due to gap in middle For the price we paid over 110 per night a simple breakfast coffee croissant etc can be included in price It s a small thing that makes guests feel warm and welcome and costs you next to nothing in real terms , Very central location close to metro and attractions 
90900,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture,No Negative, Excellent location for restaurants and Parisians sites Great access to metro and CDG airport Nice touch providing a complimentary glass of champagne each day of the stay 
90901,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, There was mildew around bathtub , Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast had good variety and was plentiful Hotel location was good Enjoyed having champagne every afternoon at 5 00pm Always had macarons at front desk for guests 
90902,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, very small room in spite of paying 430 euro per night wi fi is very poor you have to reconnect every almost an hour very poor quality of territories in the bathroom, location Nesperesso coffee machine in the reception
90903,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, There are some rooms that don t have window Actually there is but you can see only emergency stairs and wall , Nice location for both of business and sightseeing Close from metro station restaurants grocery stores and huge park Staff can speak English fluently You should ask them where to eat because there are too many restaurants around there I like free macaroons free sparkling wine and yummy break fast 
90904,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Decor is starting to look a little tired Rooms looked nice but carpets looking well worn and paintwork faded , The complimentary champagne was a really special touch as was the nespresso These details will stick in my mind and win my repeat business 
90905,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture,No Negative, Room was cleaned so well The curtains pulled back The beds were made nicely with cookies on the turned down sheets The air conditioning was a dream The bathroom had a great tub and shower combo and though small was a top flight bathroom The staff was extremely helpful in every way very gracious and friendly They served a delicious champagne every late afternoon with nibbles Very close to Luxembourg Notre Dame and many wonderful restaurants especially heading west on Ecole and intercepting Saint Germaine and everything in the edges of 6 and 7 A further walk to the Louvre and D Orsay but easy and beautiful 
90906,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, The breakfast was at basement in a very small dark room and unfortunately was not serve for a person who paid about 215 per day was unacceptable ,No Positive
90907,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Rooms were way too small The head board area had a small shelf that we hit with our head while getting in and out of bed, Wine and cookies at the reception
90908,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Nothing , Everything The location and ease of travel in and around Paris Free nibbles and champagne each day between 5 and 8 o clock was a lovely touch too 
90909,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, We had 2 rooms for our group Tiny but that s Paris In 1 room the noisy outdated airco froze into a block of ice and then dripped all over our things soaking them In the other the tiny sink was blocked and even after the night receptionist tried to plunger it never drained properly Pictures on web a bit deceptive cozy looking old Bathrooms had been renewed although very basic The rest of the facilities bedrooms halls and lobby area haven t and need it Wifi constantly cut out if you were able to connect Minibar in rooms didn t even have a bottle of water just 3 cans of some odd sodas that maybe the previous guests had left Luckily there s a Monoprix not far from the hotel Too much perfume potpourri being sprayed into lobby area , The staff at reception were very nice and helpful Think they do everything from delivering an extra towel attempting to plunge our stopped up sink never drained properly still to helping us get our bags to the car down the street Champagne coffee macarons nougat in the lobby were a bonus Location is the main positive point Public pay parking lot at the end of the next street was great very clean secure and excellent location

90916,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, There was a slight bad smell in the bathroom which has no ventilation and the wireless connection had to be setup user and password each time you open your cell phone which was quite annoying Also the mattress wasn t so comfortable , A great hotel in an excellent location with special atmosphere created by beautiful lobby friendly staff and small gestures such as free espresso and macaroons as well as wine in the afternoon happy hour along with additional special sweets 
90917,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, Bed was hard rooms were slightly small but to be expected in Paris Try to take a room away from the lift as it can be a bit noisy when the door opens and closes Wish the AC was cooling as a few nights it was slightly warm and it got a bit noisy when the window was open , Location was amazing we walked all over the place plus loads of cafes and supermarkets around the hotel wifi strength was good staff were super nice breakfast was good and fresh I only wish they had an egg station The complementary nespresso and macarons was a nice touch 
90918,H tel Belloy Saint Germain By Happyculture, The rooms could do with a slight bit of modernization Bathroom facilities are fine just the bedroom area even just new style duvets pillows , The staff was surprisingly well located In a nice quaint area of St Germain The rooms are a bit dated but still very nice a decent size for the price The hotel granted my request of a balcony had fresh macaroons at the front desk which were a nice touch Most things are within walking distance I would stay again
