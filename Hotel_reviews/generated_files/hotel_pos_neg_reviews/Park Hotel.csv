461546,Park Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful which made the stay even better My partner and I were given a free room upgrade when we arrived and the room was gorgeous the bed was unbelievably comfortable which is always a bonus the views from the room were lovely as well room was cleaned very well each day we were there I could not fault this hotel at all 
461547,Park Hotel, The lighting within the hotel is a bit too dim for my liking It totally contradicts the beautifully light restaurant downstairs and makes the reception area feel uninviting , The restaurant downstairs Momo was absolutely incredible The cuisine is an Asian fusion type that blends modern with traditional The prawn tempura sushi and the Waghu in my opinion are a must have The rooms were comfortable and clean Perfect for our short stay in Amsterdam The staff were also incredibly helpful and were prepared to go the extra mile for us The location of the hotel is perhaps one of the most appealing things about this hotel It is situated within the center of town and is close to all amenities and popular streets such as Prinsengracht 
461548,Park Hotel, Not much with the exception of having to go to a separate room for ironing, Location is ideal for central Amsterdam Comfortable room and pleasant staff 
461549,Park Hotel, Cost of food drink Breakfast was 18 5 Euros per person but excellent bars and restaurants within a stones throw of hotel and used mini bar to stock with own drinks from supermarket , Modern hotel in excellent location to tour all of Amsterdam especially the Museum quarter 
461550,Park Hotel, Room a bit small toilet closet a bit small and separate from shower and wash basin , Good location close to museums and restaurants short walk to all the main attractions friendly staff good breakfast 
461551,Park Hotel, When elderly guests arrive with a full night of inter atlantic travel and exhausted it would have been helpful To have the flexibility to enter our room earlier We arrived at noon and had to wait in lobby for 3 hours and fell asleep exhausted on the couch , Breakfast was excellent Lots of fresh fruit choices of egg dishes different meats cheeses Plentiful and services personnel was professional and friendly The room had a nice view of canal and bed was comfortable The shower was amazing 
461552,Park Hotel, nothing could nt fault it, friendly staff so helpful i upgraded my room do like my comforts would recommend this hotel to family and friends could not fault the hotel from when i booked in to when i left
461553,Park Hotel,No Negative, Room was lovely we asked for a quiet room so that is why the view wasn t so good but we didn t mind They gave us a free upgrade to a a junior suite so that was a nice surprise The only problem we had was that we found the bed was very very soft not too good for someone with back trouble Otherwise the hotel was lovely The hotel is one minutes walk from the nearest tram bus stop with direct links to the airport or central station 
461554,Park Hotel, The beds were way to soft and even taking the mattress toppers off did not help Need new beds , The staff and the location were par excellent the best
461555,Park Hotel, I booked an Executive Double for myself and my husband it was advertised on booking com as having a luxurious bathroom with a separate bathtub and rain shower There was a welcome note addressed to a different guest I was clearly allocated the wrong room No bathtub for a start it had a separate door to a shower cubicle The sink was in the main room there was another cubicle for the toilet It had an unnecessary extra bed taking up space perhaps that works if you have a child with you or are on a hen stag weekend but only 1 chair to sit in The TV did not work and it took several calls before anyone came to fix it because the Receptionist failed to pass on the requests to Maintenance I was given a bottle of wine as an apology for the hour wasted getting someone to deal with it I disputed the room at the time and asked to be moved this was refused It was full and the person claiming to be a Manager did not have any authority to refund me the price difference I requested a refund of roughly 60 on my return When you pay 269 60 city tax for a room for a night you should expect first rate customer service From the moment you enter the hotel and see the long line to check in with the Receptionists taking other calls when they should be dealing with the person in front of them it is obvious service is not a priority here They have also failed several times now to respond to emails within their own service guidelines The first response was robotic and clearly used for all complaints I chased them up again and the second response failed to address the issue no separate bathroom I am told the room I had cost 60 more Really dream on That could only be if you are paying for an extra bed to be slot in more people I will try a third time I really feel this place is a shambles I wasted so much time while there and since my return No apology or acknowledgement they made a mistake with the room allocation ,No Positive
461556,Park Hotel, Bathroom was only separated by a curtain but this wasn t a huge issue , Staff were very friendly and helpful At the end of each hall there was a bowl with complimentary apples to get your day started which was a lovely touch 
461557,Park Hotel, There was a funny smell in our room possibly coming out of the sink Too warm in the lobby Wifi was slow , Excellent location Wonderful porters Nice staff Comfy bed Loved the coffee and drinks bar in the lobby with the servers and comfy chairs 
461558,Park Hotel,No Negative, Our daughter has lived in Amsterdam for nine months and when she gave us the opportunity to join her she made a reservation for us to stay at the Park Hotel As we entered the hotel we were immediately greeted with a glass of cucumber water from a staff member situated separately from the registration desk This was a very welcoming gesture Every staff member no matter what their role provided us with the same care The entrance and reception areas are modern and light pours in through the large glass exterior We landed early stored our luggage and left for our daughter s home Hotel personnel texted that our room was ready before the checkin time From our room we could see a bit of the main canal which was fun and we discovered the hotel is located in a central location Our experience at the hotel was short but we very much enjoyed Amsterdam seeing the city through our daughter s eyes Her choice of the Park Hotel played a part in our enjoyment We highly recommend a stay in the Park Hotel 
461559,Park Hotel, The staff was very formal and distant Maybe this is typical for a 4 star hotel but it s a feature I don t like , The position is great and the room comfy However nothing above average 
461560,Park Hotel, The hotel has the awful service Everyone in the hotel startibg from the concierge and receptionist business center stuff are so rude and arrogant and slow I wont stay there anymore , It is my second stay with Park hotel I Like rooms and breakfast Location is very good as well 
461561,Park Hotel, Everything was very good but the staff was extraordinary Especially a young man named Pim who was most helpful with anything we needed , The bed was like a cloud unbelievable 
461562,Park Hotel, Somewhere to put our bags, Room was very modern Plenty of living room but could have done with more space for our bags Bathroom was well set out Very clean Good Wi Fi Located close to Van Gough museum A few parks were very close by a canal across the road A few restaurants across the canal as was the Casino 200 metres away 
461563,Park Hotel, No balconies apparently not allowed in Amsterdam , Heavenly bed and fabulous breakfast buffet spread Leidseplein is almost across the street and Rijksmuseum less than 10 minute walk away Famous Vondelpark also just around the corner 
461564,Park Hotel, The rooms are very cosey and the bathroom was in the room just a glass bifurcation was made The room had cooler no AC, It was at the centre walkable distance from public transport Friendly staff
461565,Park Hotel, It was a last minute booking due to the cancellation of our original booking It stated on the website the price cones with free breakfast but upon check in we were told we have to pay extra for the breakfast The room given was tiny and the housekeeping wasn t up to stardard , Location
461566,Park Hotel, Initially we were offered a room without windows on the ground floor with light coming from the half glassed ceiling We had to ask for another one and only then we were offered a standard room on the 5th floor Minding that the hotel most likely was not fully booked it was a drawback , The location is pretty good Just a few steps from Vondel park and a few more from Meseumplein The surrounding district is just great A few trams which stop nearby run directly to the center or one can walk for 25 30 mins The bed was really comfy as well All the basic stuff was in the room including tea coffee facilities 
461567,Park Hotel, While in good shape hotel is getting old Very noisy room on the street Hallway always smelled of food quite fishy often bed was old and misshapen very soft , staff was nice Location is great walking distance to everything Momo restaurant attached to the hotel is a nice place
461568,Park Hotel, Room a little small but room facilities very good and room was quiet , Very good location Airport Express bus 197 to from Schiphol stops about 200m from the hotel Canal boat opposite the hotel Rijksmuseum 200m away Many restaurants nearby Entrance to Vondelpark opposite Excellent breakfasts 
461569,Park Hotel, We had a shower in a bath the water didn t drain so you stood in a foot of water to shower I didn t find most of the people on reception very friendly or happy to help bar the one girl who was great , Great Location really comfy beds breakfast had a wide variety Staff mainly very friendly and helpful Really lovely girl helped us out when my dad fell on the tram tracks and cut his hands she bandaged him up got us a taxi to the hospital and checked back with us the following day 
461570,Park Hotel, Bathroom is an embarrassment Shower toilet and sink are in 3 distinct areas each away too small a small bit of reconfiguration would solve it and make for an adequate bathroom, Well situated in the Museum area with public transport to the city centre and airport nearby Stayed in the standard room with super comfy bed it was very clean and the air con worked well Breakfast was good with ample choices 
461571,Park Hotel, Not much bathroom privacy But the room was lovely , The staff gets a 10 I had a fall out on the street they called the hospital arranged for a doctor and called a taxi They were spectacular in their care and concern for me The accident had nothing to do with their property but the young staff members treated me like family I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with the Park Hotel staff They recommended restaurants got us museum tickets and transportation tickets This is truly a lovely place to stay Close to restaurants museums and the canal tour Easy access to public transportation 
461572,Park Hotel, Upgraded room Got a stinking toilet after paying 30 Euros extra per day Complained to them but they couldn t remove the stink completely, Momo restaurant Excellent food with flavours
461573,Park Hotel, Liked everything except bathroom has many irksome design issues that can be annoying as you stay and realize how problematical they can be This is quite surprising for a Dutch facility The Dutch usually think of nearly everything However it would not prevent me from recommending the property I might warn seniors that they might want to find another location merely because the bathroom could be hazardous , Great location Staff very helpful 
461574,Park Hotel, the bed was too soft and uncomfortable we had to lie on the floor for two nights i had paid for a superior room and it felt very basic staff were not helpful regarding same and we were not asked at departure how our stay was,No Positive
461575,Park Hotel, The staff was not warm nor friendly The carpet in the room was a bit musky The shampoo and soap was also not well replenished Certainly not very value for money , Location is good 
461576,Park Hotel, The beds were the worst beds I have ever experienced Soft and narrow with a very narrow single duvet We couldn t open the window The eggs Benedict was inedible But lovely omlet the second morning, The position for visiting many attractions is fantastic The staff were great particularly the concierge 
461577,Park Hotel, A heated towel rail in the bathroom would have been nice Having to pay extra for breakfast I can never do justice to the vast buffet on offer at breakfast time , The location is perfect for exploring the city centre museums etc You can pick up a canal boat tour right outside the hotel and the public bus from the airport stops only few minutes walk away The staff irrespective of their role in the hotel made an effort to have a conversation with us e g one of the cleaning staff who was in the lift with us seemed genuinely interested in whether we had enjoyed our day 
461578,Park Hotel, Public area furniture modern poor quality uncomfortable The music played on a sound system in the restaraunt was so loud conversation was impossible request to turn it down were refused scored, Food outstanding bed very comfortable room quite Staff excellent
461579,Park Hotel, Room 322 was just above the tram line and very noisy from early morning until bedtime Also breakfast was in restaurant attached to hotel but food that was meant to be hot was in fact cold coffee machine gave watery coffee price for breakfast was very expensive even booking with hotel , Easy access to centre and attractions staff brilliant clean tidy and comfortable 
461580,Park Hotel, The bed was way too soft and the bathroom was weird and pretty uncomfortable for friends since you could see into the bathroom and shower , Location is perfect right next to Vondelpark and really close to the shopping streets 
461581,Park Hotel, Cost nearly 600 for 3 nights with no breakfast included Also city tax wasn t in our final price so cost more, Tram stop outside so handy travelling to the main areas Free WiFi a bonus Within walking distance of city centre too
461582,Park Hotel, The receptionist staff were a little abrupt when we were checking in, The beds were so soft and comfortable The whole place was spotless and had a modern and trendy vibe 
461583,Park Hotel, Wifi you could have complimentary for a 1MBPS or you paid 10 euros per 24hrs for faster internet to stream video or download larger files This is the first time I have seen this in a long time and was very annoying for a nice hotel, excellent location easy to reach by public transport really comfortable rooms and helpful staff
461584,Park Hotel,No Negative, The beds were incredibly comfortable and the rooms were clean I left my jewellery in the hotel I emailed the hotel after returning home and they promptly replied to say they had found them The hotel posted my jewellery and thankfully I got them back safe and sound I can t thank the staff enough for this 
461585,Park Hotel, This is my second and last stay at this hotel The desk personnel were rude on my first stay but I thought I might have caught someone having a bad day After this stay I know that customer service is not a priority I will stay elsewhere on my next trip to Amsterdam and am so glad I booked a different hotel for when I return to Amsterdam tomorrow , The property is great location
461586,Park Hotel, Parking costs 65EURO a day No complimentary water instead 4 50EURO for a small bottle, Excellent breakfast in Momo perfect location friendly staff Comfortable exec rooms 
461587,Park Hotel, we ordered food for a child but the hotel made a little mistake but promptly they sent a new order without charging from us This was great because usually the hotel would charge twice from us, The location is very perfect there are a lot of good options to do around the hotel all was ok at the hotel 
461588,Park Hotel, No complimentary Wi Fi even for the high cost of accommodation, Comfy bed ample lighting clean bathroom premium toiletries hairdryer kettle friendly service
461589,Park Hotel, Although close to the museums it did take 10 15mins via tram to get into the foodie or city centre for the sights sounds There were no good food options around the hotel they were only tourist traps Hard Rock and a bad Irish bar Room service Very expensive for mediocre food Breakfast would not be worth the extra 20 25euro Electronics in the room The telly and hair dryer didn t work Room Acceptable but bare bones No slippers robes or those other minor creature comforts Loud next to the tram that ran between 5AM 12AM Neighbouring walls were not sound proof we could hear the other guest and their telly Service Staff We had pre booked paid for a superior room We arrived around 11AM to check in and asked if there was a room available There wasn t but for a 25euro a day increase we could have an executive room available right now We did not take the option and opted to wait for the hotel s stated check in time of 3PM We left our bags with the porter and went out to explore the city We came back a little after 3PM to find our room was still not ready We were advised to go out and explore the city while the front desk found us a room We decided to wait this time in the lobby It was after 4 when we went went up the desk where they informed us they had a room available We were advised to use a service lift at the back side of the lobby conference area it was strange but as we later found out all the nice rooms lifts were in the lobby and all the cheaper rooms had to use the service lift It wasn t a deal breaker what was was our room We step in and it stank of smoke regular cigarette We called down stairs and was advised a service agent would be up to the room The front desk agent came in and confirmed the room smelt of smoke ensured us as a property that does not allow smoking we would be moved , Location Good It was close to the museums Transportation Less than 5min walk to the trams to take you into the city centre or to one of the main stations to the airport Comfort Acceptable if you upgrade above a superior The soap lotion products provided was very nice 
461590,Park Hotel, I seriously did not like being set up by Booking com to pay the extra City Tax A comparison price should include the 5 extra Not hide it Can I believe the prices quoted I came away feeling that Booking Com or the Hotel had just stung me for more money than I expected The bed and bedding was poorly designed two soft mattresses with two different sized overlays does not make for good restful sleep After five nights I have come home to get some rest , Excellent location close to museums restaurants boats busses and night life Clean and very friendly helpful and conscientious staff 
461591,Park Hotel, Black carpet in the room Not sure how dirty it was or not , The bar in the reception made the best gin and tonics Bed was super comfortable Apples in the corridors to munch on a nice little treat Near the park and you can rent bicycles from the hotel 
461592,Park Hotel, Hotel was perfect in terms of comfort staff food and facilities In terms of value for money the room was small and decoration finishes were a little tired , Great location Nearby restaurants were good City centre is walking distance Tram rail connection make out of town parking easy 
461593,Park Hotel, Was given a room with two single beds instead of the double bed I booked Early check in was not possible requested that beforehand so had to wait till 3pm There was some sort of mix up and at check out I was told that I have given a guarantee for another room to use the mini bar on my credit card never did that but was not charged in the end so that s ok The reason for the stay was my friends engagement I asked the manager whether it is possible to do something a bit more special for her free of charge but this was not possible The shower does not have a handheld shower head so not ideal if you have long hair and you don t want to get it wet don t like the shower cap solution Was not told about the breakfast time at check in Had to ask have to say the receipt did not make us feel welcome at arrival I think she was just finishing her shift and in a bit of a hurry The breakfast times are different on the weekend and weekdays so on Monday morning we nearly missed it , Breakfast was very nice buffet style and lovely environment The hotel location is great 
461594,Park Hotel, The price of the breakfast is 25 euro per person which is ridiculous so we just went across the road to an Irish bar restaurant where they do an all day breakfast and coffee for a fraction of that The hotel also takes a deposit of 50 euro per person when you check in which I didn t know about until I got there It s returned to you when you check out, Hotel was spotless the room had everything you need including a well stocked mini bar tea coffee and snacks Shower was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable Staff were excellent and there s a 24 hour room service for food and drink Location of the hotel is perfect with loads to do in the immediate area and the no 5 tram around the corner brings you to dam square and central station etc We will definitely book this hotel again on our return to Amsterdam
461595,Park Hotel, Hard to explain but we had a superior room and it wasn t a bathroom it was like a toilet cubicle and shower cubicle it was nice and modern but didn t like how it wasn t really that private, Like the modern interior The bed was so soft and comfy you just sink into it 
461596,Park Hotel, the long wait to check into the room international travellers normally arrive in the morning and the thought of waiting until 3 pm to check in is very frustrating , the overall attitude of the staff unlike 3 years ago they seemed much friendlier and accomodating enjoyed the cappuccino served close to the reception the breakfast was awesome and wholesome squeeze your own orange juice was fun and healthy 
461597,Park Hotel,No Negative, The Park hotel was a very nice hotel and located very central for everything My partner asked for a free upgrade of the room as it was a special occasion but the lady that checked us in said it would be 25 extra per night So we didn t go for that She wasn t that obliging overall We had a lovely stay and the rest of the staff were more than helpful We didn t get a chance to eat in Momo restaurant which was disappointing 
461598,Park Hotel, No movies available for that 1 or 2 hours we had spare time , The hotel made our stay very comfortable The room was great with a good view and staff were always wanting to help The location was also very good Really had no problems here and would advise anyone going to amsterdam to stay here 
461599,Park Hotel, There is no extractor fan which would seem ideal when an open plan bathroom faint smell of damp entering the room had to air this out Put do not disturb on the first day came back to a pile of new towels on our bed with a note that they didnt tidy up as DND was on but had to access for security reasons didn t feel comfortable with this Our hairdryer wasnt working and actually smoked when turned on I reported this and was questioned why I only reported this on my second day my partner towel dries and I only wash my hair every other day No milk provided in the free tea and coffee facilities so after brewing two teas on day 1 realized we couldn t drink them Forgot to buy milk whilst out so on his birthday morning decided to order 2 x extortionate pots of tea at 4 25euros each doesnt mention in menu or hotel info anything about the additional 3 50euro charge for using room service 12 euros for 2 pots of tea id have been happy with just the milk pods or a cup but wouldnt have bothered if I knew about the additional charge Overall lovely hotel but could be so much better if it wasnt for these little issues , Stylish hotel reception room Loved that I told hotel in special comments that trip was a surprise for my boyfriends birthday then arrived to a banner and balloons on the bed really nice touch Location was pretty good walking distance to Leidesplein and Rikjsmuseum and their tram stops which was useful so for the money it was lovely the comparable hotels in price in better locations where no where near as nice looking Luggage storage was good In hindsight we would have booked the breakfast with the room we chose not to as it seemed expensive but most of our breakfasts just a pancake and drink each or toast and a croissant with cheese and ham came to over 20 euros each and meant we had to try find something in the morning Just to clarify as I couldn t tell from the photos the toilet it not open plan to the room its in its own dark glass cubicle at the back of the open plan bathroom 
461600,Park Hotel, Superior rooms are small cold and dark Not comfortable I had to upgrade my room and pay more They tried to charge me more than my booking reservation I had to explain and discuss more than 15 minutes to receptionist that they were doing wrong Receptionists and other staff are not helpful You have to always wait at the reception because lack of receptionist I guess When you asked something to receptionist they said wait a minute and they were going to a room behind the desk and you had to wait them for a while for a simple answer I m totally disappointed with this hotel Price Value index is very low ,No Positive
461601,Park Hotel, Housekeeping services could have cleaned the room with a little more attention to detail for a hotel of this caliber , The beds bedding and pillows were amazingly comfortable I regretted having to leave for that reason alone 
461602,Park Hotel, I have nothing negative to say , Staff are super friendly and helpful The location was perfect for us The bed was very comfortable Breakfast was great with lots of choice 
461603,Park Hotel,No Negative, Great stay here location was superb and right next to the beautiful Vondelpark We left for one night to Antwerp and the hotel kept our suitcases safely stowed away until we returned 
461604,Park Hotel, The room was either a bit too cold or too warm apart form that nothing to complain really, Great location if you are interested in the museums and also close by Leidseplein restaurants and a nice jazz club and the De Pijp a very cool area in the south of the city plenty of caf restaurants and bars Hotel was good value for money compared to Amsterdam s average Staff was nice and helpful
461605,Park Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and the staff so very helpful I would recommend the breakfast in Mono as it was amazing Also the Dead Clean toiletries in the hotel are the nicest I ve ever used 
461606,Park Hotel, Unfortunately there was loud music outside at night time which made it quite difficult to sleep , We were given a complimentary upgrade to an executive suite which was very nice The staff were lovely and the location was great 
461607,Park Hotel, Only as for us the bed was too soft , Really good staff nice looking and professional We got upgrade what is really nice Good breakfast beautiful lobby and clean room And really good cosmetics 
461608,Park Hotel,No Negative, Free upgrade to an amazing room Most comfy bed i ve ever slept in at ANY hotel Lovely breakfast Awesome location very near to Paradiso concert venue 
461609,Park Hotel, Very costly breakfast we didn t have it Several other options nearby TV program choice was a bit limited but it didn t matter , Very nice modern rooms Free apples on every floor Excellent WIFI Near many of the museums Very friendly staff 
461610,Park Hotel, Hotel generally quite expensive, Rooms good not massive but big enough good TV and bathroom Staff very helpful and general decor was beautiful in the hotel Location was amazing and fairly quiet 
461611,Park Hotel, Breakfasts were expensive though of good quality The lighting was dim in bedrooms and the entrance foyer , An excellent location for the main museums city centre and a large park All the staff were friendly and helpful Bowls of free apples on each floor provided a welcome additional gesture 
461612,Park Hotel, Not that it was poor but like most hotels gym basic enough Could do with more free weights and squat racks etc However that s just me being funny on an otherwise perfect stay , Bed incredibly comfortable Shower was really good Heated floors in bathroom Friendly staff Nice layout Of room
461613,Park Hotel, Little bit far from centre but easy to tram, Hotel is gorgeous When checking in they noticed it was my birthday on 2 days and noticed it was my boyfriends birthday that day they gave us free drinks a free upgrade to am exclusive room highly reccomend and left us balloons to come back too So friendly and i would deffinatly stay again 
461614,Park Hotel, The only negative thing I can say is the public computer didn t have a mouse but the receptionists were more then comforting as they let me email them what I needed and they printed it off , The bed in the hotel was amazing and also the location was perfect I couldn t have positioned the hotel in a more ideal location right next to the museums next door to vondel park and only a short walk away from the lively dam square 
461615,Park Hotel,No Negative, Your beds were by far the best bed i have EVER slept in Me and my boyfriend came back to the room early just so we could get in that bed Amazing Everything was just Perfect The shower was wooowwwww 
461616,Park Hotel,No Negative, The bed was SO comfy And the mood lights behind it were a really nice touch Great location and really nice hotel to stay at would definitely recommend 
461617,Park Hotel, We had separate beds then got an upgrade so chose to have double the singles were joined but not very well felt like I was sleeping on a hill most of the night stayed in back area so not much of a view, Service was 5 star Best Luggage service we had in EU thus far Room was clean and well maintained Close to key landmarks and areas we needed to visit Was quiet
461618,Park Hotel, There is no solid wall into the toilet in the room therefore no privacy Only bad thing about our stay , Very comfy bed amazing location fabulous lobby to sit around and have a drink gorgeous Christmas decorations 
461619,Park Hotel, Some minor details like a frayed laminate on the cupboard door no bathroom exhaust and some tiles grout looked a bit worn out , The ambience and staff were excellent 
461620,Park Hotel, I was a bit disappointed to see a lot of dust on the shelf under the sink in the bathroom where they placed towels Face towels and dust is big No No As well there was a big seed like the one that nectarine has on the floor in the bathroom corner Did ask reception to send a housekeeping however the room was cleaned only next morning and the dust and the seed were still there Guess someone needs glasses , The location is just perfect The lobby bar is super comfortable and the staff who works there is very friendly They serve fantastic macaroons and sweets with a hot drink 
461621,Park Hotel, It was a little pricey , Very welcoming and warm hotel This was our first stop on our honeymoon and they laid rose petals out on the bed and gave us a free drink in their living room 
461622,Park Hotel, Lift going to the 5th floor, The breakfast is really nice and lots to choose from Location to the canal and the trams from Amsterdam Centraal brilliant 
461623,Park Hotel, The staff was very slow and rude they all just wanted to be bossy i am talking about the receptionists and the personnel from the bar you couldn t block all the light in the room in the morning , good position right next to the high end stores clean nice bathroom very comfortable bed pretty big rooms 
461624,Park Hotel, We had to go home , Excellent location for our night out at Paradiso All the staff we met were extremely helpful and cheerful The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room temperature was perfect 
461625,Park Hotel, It didn t seem like a four star hotel my first room was smelly the second room was very clean but cold no hot air to heat the room and no bathrobe provided , Location bed was comfy
461626,Park Hotel, The mattress is very soft a good quality bed but just down to personal preference , Excellent location Near to all the action but it was good to have a short walk away from activity noise of the city The hot rain shower was amazing especially after being out in the cold Comfy lounge and room The staff were lovely We didn t sample the breakfast which was 24 per head because we had over spent in the brilliant shopping area Loads of great cafes nearby though Really recommend this hotel 
461627,Park Hotel, I was incorrectly billed twice The shower and toilet only have a glass partition and so are not very private And there was a faint smell of sewage , Location was good 
461628,Park Hotel, The mattress was very strangely soft and one of the windows in the bedroom was not sealing properly so we could hear some noise , Hall was great location was also fine to reach both from airport and to city center 
461629,Park Hotel, I didn t like checking in only to find that my bill had gone up by an extra 200 euros before we started I didn t like the fact that for the 250 per night we didn t have a wardrobe for this money you shouldn t have to live out of a suitcase I didn t like the the mis leading inference that we were going into a SUPERIOR DOUBLE ROOM when in actual fact it seemed more like an abandoned staff living area The walls had black marks on every side and and we had to shuffle around the bed to move around the room which probably explains the marks We do this every year in a different place in Europe and every other time we have given excelent for everything We were left with a sour taste with this one In reality out of season this stay was a complete rip off I would recomendamos Amsterdam but not this hotel , The beds were comfy and the breakfast good 
461630,Park Hotel, I didn t have a credit card so they had to take a 200 euro deposit for the room this was fine but it would have been better to be told I needed a credit card before I left this way I would have bought one with me instead of having to use my debit , The room was excellent with a great view the staff were also lovely and helpful and even circled places on a map when we told her where we were planning to go 
461631,Park Hotel, I was charged an extra 40 Euros for a small 7th floor garret room already priced at 279 Eueorsbecause I arrived about 7 3o even though the room was totally ready had not been occupied the night before and required no intervention whatsoever Robbery , Breakfasts were good 
461632,Park Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly team with great attention to detail i found birthday card on my bed with little treats and baloons on my birthday which was really sweet
461633,Park Hotel, I did actually not have the best stay this time There was construction taking place right outside my window hotel and they worked until 2am and for that reason I was unable to have a good sleep I was not informed at anytime about this work Due to that reason this will not be my preferred hotel next time, Great location
461634,Park Hotel, The beds were very uncomfortable I had to put the mattress on the floor the first night then they put boards under the mattress They wouldn t let me change my booking even though they had space So I had to pay for a night I didn t need As the dates we were in Amsterdam changed to the 24th to 27th I even called the hotel to see if I could change So inflexible I had to do the same for my Paris accommodation and they let us change the date Because of this I won t be recommending the Park Hotel, The staff were really lovely and the lounge bar was really lovely Room service was good too 
461635,Park Hotel, The room was a bit small the bed was extremely soft might be an issue for some and the sound isolation between rooms was not that good we woke up several times due to the housekeeping next door And the room price was super expensive typical Amsterdam thing though , the location of the was awesome just few steps from Leidseplein Vondelpark and Museumplein The room was compact comfortable bed 
461636,Park Hotel, Communication from the manager when a pickup for a tour was cancelled Her written note was delivered to our door 5 hours after the cancelled pick up time and the note suggested the hotel would have provided a taxi for us However when this note arrived it was already too late The note was written two hours before the pickup time and if it had been delivered then we would not have missed the tour Sad when all her staff were going above and beyond to be gracious to us and it was the manager that fell flat not her staff She should have made sure the note had some urgency to it and made arrangements for it to be delivered before the scheduled pickup and not after , Location was perfect staff made tremendous effort to make us feel welcome and took note of our upcoming anniversary and surprised us with a small gift in our room on that date 
461637,Park Hotel, After flight delay no show pre booked taxi got to bed 3am Management tried 3 times to enter our room error showed it empty No sleep and no compensation , Superb quality bed very comfortable 
461638,Park Hotel, The shower toilet basin being part of the bedroom prefer to have a separate room , The bed was very comfy The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was great 
461639,Park Hotel, The rooms are designed for looks rather than comfort One couldn t access clothing and the bathroom at the same time No door on the shower and no fan which made for a dripping bathroom Banged my head on the clothes hanger more than once The dispensers in the shower shifted when the levers were pressed which made them almost impossible to use , The bed was indeed like a cloud The breakfast is terrific the location great People were very helpful The rooms look beautiful 
461640,Park Hotel, Although the hotel is a non smoking facility there is a fair number of people puffing away by the entrance which makes the lobby smokey , The room was large enough the bathroom modern and efficient the front desk persons helpful and cheerful 
461641,Park Hotel, Hey guys pay attention on the check out i m going to apply to the court as they took more money money as per booking com city tax and an additional 16 that s not acceptable ,No Positive
461642,Park Hotel, The elevator only takes you to the 4th floor so you have to take the stairs to the 5th floor And nobody offered help me with my luggage , Staff was friendly Bed is amazingly comfortable Bathroom was clean
461643,Park Hotel, We were told that we had been given an upgrade from a superior room to an executive one The room was very disappointing even for a basic or superior one The carpet did not feel too clean The bed had a very soft futon placed on top of an old mattress The toiletries were minimal and presented in a dilapidated box There were no slippers of gowns , Location
461644,Park Hotel, We were on the 5th floor but the lift only went up to the 4th so had to walk upstairs with our luggage Shower cubicle was small and the smell from the drains in the shower and toilet was unpleasant Bar in reception closed at 11pm so unable to get a nightcap unless you visited the very busy and noisy restaurant , Location was good close to bus tram and canal stops Also close to restaurants 
461645,Park Hotel, Beds were too soft for my tasting Breakfast is advertised at 18 euros but actually cost 23 euros if not booked in advance You might be better off having it outside , Great central location and surprisingly very quiet 
461646,Park Hotel, Struggled a little to get the liquid soap from the pump Puzzled by the strange taxes added to our bill , The bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud Big shower head with immediate hot water Big TV screen was another bonus Loved the extra shelving in the bathroom as this is an ongoing gripe that hotel bathrooms never seem to consider Women need shelves for make up bags etc Hotel toiletries and yes big thick toilet rolls a huge plus Lots of thought and practicality was given to the comfort of the spotless rooms Well stocked mini bar tea and coffee and even a universal travel plug were provided Bowls of apples on each floor was a charming gesture The location around the corner from the Rijksmuseum was perfect Dutch hospitality courtesy friendliness is superb 
461647,Park Hotel, Our room was at the front which is quite noisy from street traffic at night If you like a quiet room request the rear of the hotel , The location and staff made a perfect holiday All very helpful 
461648,Park Hotel, There were no bath robes, Yes breakfast was excellent and the staff were really helpful and beds were very comfy Location was fantastic literary 2 mins from the Van Gogh etc
461649,Park Hotel, The price is slightly expensive but you do get what you pay for , The bed was so comfortable Also the staff were so kind and helpful Behind the main receptions the staff are able to give you tickets to museums and canal cruises at a cheaper price 
461650,Park Hotel, The room had really bad smell which the staff tried to address but the smell came back shortly after real shame as great location and thought the restaurant lacked variety and ambience Would try Marriott up the road next time due to the very unpleasant smell maybe if the bathrooms were separate from bedroom it would be much better , Great location 
461651,Park Hotel, Staff at breakfast is a bit slow the plates are left on tables forever staff doesn t seem to come to take orders you have to chase them , Nice hotel good gym nice breakfast
461652,Park Hotel, Room would of benefited from another comfortable chair as there was plenty of space to accommodate it , Excellent hotel in all respects friendly staff excellent location comfortable room room very well specked cleanliness top rate 
461653,Park Hotel, Expensive Breakfast not included for us Quite a long walk to the centre Very soft bed , Very modern classy clean hotel with polite friendly staff
461654,Park Hotel, Breakfast caters more for continental rather than English any is a little expensive , Staff very friendly and helpful excellent location for seeing all the sights
461655,Park Hotel, The hidden 150 deposit you must pay when you check in 50 a night deposit I didn t see that written anywhere when I booked Very misleading Some people my age don t actually have 150 to just put on hold until the end of their holiday or business trip Especially if they re staying a week That s 350 Very very bad No other hotel I ve ever stayed in in Amsterdam has ever taken a deposit I don t mind giving my card details incase of damages to the room etc but to actually ask for the money upfront is very bad , The bed was very very comfy 
461656,Park Hotel, The noise from outside was a bit to much And hotel drink prices were a bit expensive, Beds we re super comfy Lovely freindly staff Breakfast was also fab
461657,Park Hotel, I found the staff to be rude they took an extra 150 when we arrived instead of holding a card so now I have to wait for the refund of that which is poor Then when leaving they charged city tax which should be charged on arrival so that it s not a surprise What if I didn t realise and spent all my money because I knew I was going home Did t like the hidden charges and they already upgraded us prior to going because we was unhappy with the shoddy service during booking,No Positive
461658,Park Hotel,No Negative, Staff couldn t have been more helpful and the location was perfect with city centre and museum district within easy walking distance and lovely strolls along the canal 
461659,Park Hotel, It would be good to have some free biscuits to make a tea in the room, Great welcoming staff and central to the best things to do and visit in Amaterdam 
461660,Park Hotel, Air conditioning not functioning properly in 30 degree weather Room next to elevator which was very noisy even into early hours of night , Great location super comfortable beds Good internet Would stay here again just make sure room away from elevator and air conditioner working 
461661,Park Hotel, The room was slightly on the small side but we only stayed 3 nights so it was ideal for us also breakfast is not included in the hotel price , The bed was very comfortable it was so soft It was my boyfriends birthday and the staff had placed balloons in the room and gave 2 free drinks vouchers for us at the hotel bar The location was good resturants and bars across the road and a tram stop around the corner 
461662,Park Hotel, Was miss sold breakfast which cost an additional 200euro staff were apathetic and fairly abrupt shame , Great location great interior and reception area Fabulous restaurant and comfortable beds 
461663,Park Hotel, Not sure if there was double glazing but as the hotel is on a busy inner ring road it wasn t the quietest but windows gave a panoramic view in compensation The stairs up to the bed bathroom are fairly steep and narrow so would not recommend for those with any sort of mobility problems The only thing missing to make it 5 star was a swimming pool , A big chain hotel but much better than most with an unusual two tier room overlooking the canal and casino with great storage facilities and super bathroom So well thought out and designed Extremely comfortable huge bed and the lower floor was well arranged for relaxing with a downstairs loo in addition to bathroom to avoid having to go upstairs Restaurant was pleasant and breakfast was good offering a wide selection Staff were charming and plentiful all very helpful and efficient On site parking is a great plus Very close to all the big museums and the Vondel Park with easy walking into picturesque canal areas All in all an extremely pleasant overnight stay and would definitely return
461664,Park Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely above and beyond what we expected Lady on the desk when checking in noticed it was my birthday during our stay and upgraded us to a luxury suite Fantastic room Would definitely stay there again 
461665,Park Hotel, First room so small we couldn t even put our luggage anywhere and the bed WAS NOT a queen size AS I ORIGINALLY BOOKED and we were told twice Worst part was the mattress was actually so soft and each sides hanging off the bed almost 10 cm so you couldn t sit or sleep on the borders I had to make a complain and we were told they could put wood board under it to make it harder WOODEN BOARD IN A 250 NIGHT HOTEL Incredible We were told we couldn t be moved in another room as the hotel was fully booked and we would have to pay 45 night extra for an upgrade I was so upset they accepted to move us to another room the night after The room was much bigger the bed WAS INDEED a queen side bed and still hanging off on the corners and we were told it was the same room rate WHY THE HUGE DIFFERENCE THEN At the end we were told the room was actually an upgrade they offered SO THE SIMPLE DOUBLE ROOM WITH A QUEEN SIZE BED DOES NOT EXIST staff was helpful but we were still disappointed Second room was with a view on the main road and the windows were really bad noise insulated Parking is 65 night , Location was ok Some staff tried to help Good wifi
461666,Park Hotel, The Booking com said the Park Hotel was a 4 star hotel I would give it a 2 1 2 to 3 stars My sister also staying at hotel found mens under wear on chair in room when she arrived to her room Our rooms were not cleaned until I called at 730pm The bathroom situaition was just weird , Hotel was near museums The front desk person recommended a great local restaurant Food was good service was very slow thought 
461667,Park Hotel, Bed and BIG pillows very soft and very uncomfortable Bland room bathroom black hard to see unless the lights are on and our lights didn t work TV on the wall at the end of the bed hence going to the bathroomeans you run into it Needs to be recessed Badly designed uncomfortable furniture in the lobby No security Anyone can enter the hotel lifts etc We had someone knock at our door , Location was excellent MoMo restaurant was excellent for dinner 
461668,Park Hotel, We felt the property was tired and not well maintained as visible repairs looked like they were made by an amateur When we arrived late at night we went to our room only to find we had been given 2 single beds instead of the double requested It took approximately 40 mins for the Front of House staff to move the beds together and then the beds were so soft we almost disappeared into the mattress Also for almost every request we made at the front desk over the weekend the staff at the counter had to check with someone in the back room before providing a response Overall we were not impressed with the property and would not stay here again , The location was quite convenient wifi was good
461669,Park Hotel,No Negative, Supposed to book in at 3 pm but they had upgraded the room but had put the wrong bed in and couldn t get in our room until later then messed that up it want fixed till next day only booked for two nights so wasn t impressed at all
461670,Park Hotel, We didn t get our room cleaned during the day while we were out even though we had asked for it But to be fair wasn t the end of the world as the lady did look very busy , The location was perfect close to all the major attractions on Amsterdam walking distance Rooms were lovely the bed was very comfy had a really good nights sleep Staff were really helpful with our luggage and directions to places Made our stay much easier
461671,Park Hotel, Nothing bad to say , Brilliant staff reception and the relations manager helped with a minor problem we had and couldn t have been nicer about it Fantastic room and spotlessly clean Great breakfast try the local honey and the location is spot on Perfect for Leidseplein and Vondelpark 
461672,Park Hotel, From arrival our experience was a bit tense We landed in the evening and got to the hotel around 11pm We waited for a long time by the front desk where no employees could be seen A couple of times bellhops or other sort of employees came past but apparently they weren t the sort who could check us in Finally we called out Hello and two women came out from a door behind the desk The one who helped us completely ignored me and asked my husband what name the room was under I jumped in and said I made the reservation the name is but that was a little bit of covert sexism The lady proceeded to check us in but mixed up what our reservation was tried to charge us for the room which I had to remind her was prepaid then she printed keys and sent us off When we arrived to our room it was a very small slightly musty twin room where I had paid a premium through Booking com to have a superior double room I called down to the desk to point out the mix up and was helped by a man who seemed to have good intentions but informed me that there was nothing he could do about it for that night but that we d be changed in the morning to an executive double room So we made do but the twin version of the wonderful double bed that we eventually got was extremely uncomfortable so soft that I was constantly waking up feeling like I was falling off of it When we got back from sightseeing the next day we checked in again at the front desk to get keys for our new promised room The woman behind the desk asked several times for my name and seemed confused kept stepping into the back room and talking with a man who we couldn t see Overall we waited for about 10 minutes expecting to understand what the hold up was but ultimately she eventually just handed us the keys and told us the room number then went back to the back room , If this were just a review of the double bed this would be 10 10 without hesitation 
461673,Park Hotel, When we checked in staff is cobtnously asking our names passport since to them we have difficult family name I think they should have tried better, Location is superb overviewing the gracht clean and smell nice bed is super comfortable breakfast is great
461674,Park Hotel, Couldn t give us early check in , Staff was very helpful and pleasant Location was great Near all of the art museums and good selection of restaurants Streets less crowded than central station area 
461675,Park Hotel,No Negative, Really comfortable beds black out curtains amazing staff who accommodated my delayed arrival and late check out Really central location easily accessible from Centraal via tram 2 or 5 Close to Melkweg Paradiso 
461676,Park Hotel, Nothing Everything about this hotel is amazing , Bed was extra comfy Heated floor in bathroom was amazing Also the happy birthday banner laid out on the bed for my fianc s birthday was excellent he was thrilled Thank you
461677,Park Hotel, more storage for clothing I very small wardrobe for 2 people was a challenge Breakfast seemed a little expensive, The service was excellent the breakfast was superb
461678,Park Hotel, A larger supply of ice packs , The bed was probably the most comfortable I ve ever slept in better than ours at home But most importantly the staff they were absolutely phenomenal I d injured my leg everyone was concerned checked on me etc 
461679,Park Hotel, Staff not accommodating at all Poor Wi FI service unless you pay for an upgrade Had to report bad cleanliness to manager with photos to prove Elevator out of function for 24 hours Had to change travel itinerary and they still insisted on charging me for the last night, Excellent location
461680,Park Hotel, Bed a bit too soft Would be nice to have free iced water available for travellers as they come an go , Service very helpful nice to have apples on the floor staying on 
461681,Park Hotel, The beds are EXTREMELY soft We asked for a bed board to be placed under mattress which they did Not the most comfortable sleep even with bed board The breakfast is not included and expensive , The location is great just opposite Hard Rock Cafe and on the canal Short walk and you can get to all the historical sites Easy access to the tram and to the water ferry 
461682,Park Hotel, Room was beside lift which had a manual door which would bang when people exited the lift the last night was the worse This spoiled the the up grade we got , Room was good big and clean 
461683,Park Hotel, I have paid for an executive room and I have received an improvised bed made by 2 3 mattresses overlaying one over each other I couldn t rest in the night because the mattresses where moving and the bed was not very stable ,No Positive
461684,Park Hotel, At the check in time they asked for a deposit covering the full sejour plus 100 euro extra This condition were not specified during reservation time on booking , Location excellent beds were very comfy
461685,Park Hotel, There were stains on the carpet a little of what looked like blood on the curtains and the fire alarm in the room was covered in plastic wrap The room felt dated for what was marketed , The staff was nice and helpful The location is good and a nice area 
461686,Park Hotel, why they are collecting city tax and vat because whatever you offering price its already included and they are collected additional also very poor Wi Fi,No Positive
461687,Park Hotel, The toilet shower hand basin in room even though they had glass doors we had no real privacy only when a shower type curtain was pulled across very poor for a so called superior double , Hotel very modern and clean good location On fifth floor and at back so we had a quiet room and the bed was absolutely superb 
461688,Park Hotel,No Negative, My husband and I absolutely loved this hotel The staff was very friendly and competent Our room was immaculate During our trip through Europe this was our favorite hotel 
461689,Park Hotel, Nothing Loved our stay , The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in Beautiful hotel in a great location very close to the Van Gogh museum and Vondelpark Staff were so friendly and helpful We have been to Amsterdam 6 times now and this was the best hotel we have stayed in 
461690,Park Hotel, For the price room was tiny Shower and toilet were just glass separation rather than separate room and view was of back side of no where , Location was perfect
461691,Park Hotel, The reception area was boiling hot uncomfortably so The bathroom public toilets areas too dark For the money I think little touches here and there missing, Location of the hotel great for any traveler breakfast nice lovely ham cheese and juices and the bed pillows very comfortable if you like soft 
461692,Park Hotel, I couldn t connect to the hotel wifi using my phone I asked for assistance but none of their suugestions worked I was able to connect to all other wifis I tried elsewhere so I doubt it was the phone This caused me some inconvenience as I had to go to cafes just to connect to wifi , Breakfast was excellent The bathroom was very roomy the bed was extremely comfortable
461693,Park Hotel, Duvets too hot Hate instant coffee in room Way overpriced at nearly 400 p n in Sydney you would get a harbour view suite for this with good coffee in room , Apple supply near the lift a thoughtful touch Good breakfast Smart modern hotel with free wi fi
461694,Park Hotel, a bit expensive for a smallish room with limited practical facilities in the room compared to asian hotels of a silar star rating, Liked location near museums and at the edge of the old city with its many canals and parks
461695,Park Hotel, The twin beds were far too soft and they dominated the room We felt the room was only big enough to sleep in and not to spend too much waking time in Not impressed with the cleaning used room service breakfast dishes and an unfinished room service pizza left in the room for 2 days Also bar is badly located as people in restaurant get table service but people having a drink in the lobby have a long trek to get a drink , Restaurant was great seating comfort in lobby marginal though Great location 
461696,Park Hotel, Nothing Everything was lovely , Stayed here when it was my birthday The lovely staff put balloons and banners up in our room with little chocolates The staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much to ask for Recommended this place to so many friends and family already 
461697,Park Hotel, We had a main road facing room As the hotel exterior is lit up with bright lights the light tends to come in thru the folds of the blind If want a dark room to sleep that might bother you Else all good , Great location Comfortable rooms
461698,Park Hotel, Some might find the bed too soft OK for us for a couple of nights City bylaws against opening balcony door but window could be opened a few inches, Very convenient for visiting the city Basket of tasty little apples by staircase 3 min walk to from express airport bus Coffe tea available in room Great hairdryer and lighted makeup mirror
461699,Park Hotel, That there was a confusion with the booking again as at check in the girl thought i paid for 1 night instead of 2, The cleaner didn t replenish daily toiletries the rest was ok
461700,Park Hotel, Staff at the reception was cold not kind Rooms are comfortable but the design is very old and needs renovation, Location the nice restaurant just aside 
461701,Park Hotel, The carpet in the rom is pretty old and dirty Needs to be swapped out with hardwood floor , We got a complementary upgrade and loved it Beds were super comfy and the bathroom was huge Also loved the luxury toiletries The set menu and drinks at the downstairs restaurant Momo is highly recommended 
461702,Park Hotel, Gave me an upgrade I ll never forget Booked breakfast for me three times when I said no Rooms poor value for money Very dissatisfied won t make that mistake again ,No Positive
461703,Park Hotel, We found the pillows really lumpy , Loved staying here Really modern clean hotel located centrally We were recommended it and we would now recommend it to others Rooms are spacious very clean quiet and equipped with all you need 
461704,Park Hotel, Loved everything, Beautiful comfortable spacious room It has everything needed for a pleasant stay Would highly recommend this hotel it has lovely extra touches 
461705,Park Hotel, The breakfast is extremely expensive and one can get a decent breakfast with fresh orange juice croissants and coffee around the corner three times less expensive , The location is perfect to see the museums and take a nice walk in the centre Comfortable rooms although the carpet was stained and old Very helpful staff thT helped with bookings at museums and tours 
461706,Park Hotel,No Negative, Updated and beautiful room Bed was soft but comfortable Very clean Staff was really helpful and friendly Location was perfect walking distance to museums parks and city centre 
461707,Park Hotel, Rooms were compact though not out of line with other European city hotels , Staff was super helpful The location is perfect for museum visits shopping and tasty dining Lobby with cocktail and food service was a cool hangout 
461708,Park Hotel, It could be cheaper Next time I would definitely go for a cheaper hotel , I travelled with my 71 year old mom chose this hotel for its great location and was happy to do so The hotel was close to major tram routes restaurants canals vondelpark Rijks and Van Gogh museums It was possible go in and out for short rests during the city visit We had the opportunity to be able to go out taking photos of the beautiful city at night with our tripod and cameras and be back in our comfortable room in minutes We had delicious breakfasts including at least 5 kinds of premium Dutch cheese fresh orange juice that we ourselves squeezed with the userfriendly machine provided Our room was clean and comfortable We had no problem with the Wi fi The staff was very friendly and welcoming 
461709,Park Hotel, Very poor light in bathroom hard to do makeup , Scrumptious breakfast fluffy pillows big clean bathroom Ideal location for both business and pleasure 
461710,Park Hotel, The Receptionist Staff were so super helpful and friendly but you had to queue a while to get to speak with one of them We had to wait about 20 minutes before we could check in , The Staff couldn t do any more for us My boyfriend celebrated his birthday in the hotel and the staff were so helpful arranging the room with baloons and banners it was a nice touch
461711,Park Hotel, we had the junior split level but was very disappointed especially when we paid about 1500 just for 4 nights Not worth the money at all The furniture is so so dated especially down stairs Also our flight was not until 7pm and we asked if we could stay an hour extra for check out until 1 and the receptionist refused It was also very noisy when the window is open as it did get warm in the room , Location is good friendly staff
461712,Park Hotel, The Momo restaurant wasn t our style of food although it looked very modern and was quite busy, Really liked their bathroom consumables dead clean and the modern style of hotel Rooms were quiet and the air con didn t keep us awake 
461713,Park Hotel, As we were checking out we overhead two other couples who had paid far less than us per night A third and half respectively We had no way to fairly compare the circumstances but obviously it did give us some concern ,No Positive
461714,Park Hotel, Very narrow room at 5th floor I paid for superior double room small wardrobe and only 1 nightstand Noise from adjacent room At check out difficulty to persuade the receptionist to cancel breakfast charge as this was paid during room booking settled after 2 interventions of the supervisor , Excellent hotel location Cleanliness Nice breakfast Easy ticket booking for museums and cruises 
461715,Park Hotel, The beds are too soft we like a hard bed We prefer a king size bed Also found the breakfast very expensive not to mention the rooms , The food at Momo was good 
461716,Park Hotel, My room was clean but showing signs that it is time for an update chipped paint soiled bed skirt It is customary in North American and South American hotels to offer free coffee in the room this would be an added feature , The staff were efficient and knowledgeable helpful in many ways with arranging admissions to museums I enjoyed the sustainable features but it took some time to figure out how to turn on the lights a brief instruction pamphlet in the room would be helpful the Breakfast is definitely worth the price the presentation freshness and variety are excellent and would meet most tastes I felt safe as a single woman traveller in the hotel and the district 
461717,Park Hotel, The toilet was a bit smelly even after the cleaners had been in all day But other than that it was very comfortable There was no bathroom door however so keep that in mind if you like privacy ,No Positive
461718,Park Hotel, The hotel carpet could have been cleaner, I enjoyed your breakfast it offered a lot of choice Your staff were very friendly and helpful I also liked the location of the hotel
461719,Park Hotel, We arrived to the hotel at 7 pm and the room was still not ready they offered us to take a twin room for the night and then move to the original double room on the day after we refused and got our double room only at 9 pm after we were exhausted from the flight , The sfaff was very helpful and nice and took the time to explain us how to get to places and how to transport and etc We booked the double couple room which was small but nice but not as impressive as we expected the gym was excellent location was very close to leidsepplin which is the center of a lot of bars and resturant 
461720,Park Hotel, Suite was not available yet at check in around 6 pm was quickly resolved Living room was very cold and remained cold on ground level Sleeping area temperature was OK No bathrobe in the suite available was quickly provided after contacting reception Meal options for room service very limited and only 1 4 of the menu was available All in all quite disappointing for a 500 suite , Staff is very friendly and helpful Space of the split level suite upgraded to Executive Very comfortable bed and sofas in room
461721,Park Hotel,No Negative, Good location for short stay tourists but a bit noisy via the street for a long stay or light sleepers You are close to the action but that means there is lot of associated noise
461722,Park Hotel, We wanted to check out an hour later and they were going to charge us for the hour which wasnt great , Great sushi restaurant and very good location Close to everything but without the noise of being close Great sheets 
461723,Park Hotel, It s not the cheapest for a two night stay breakfast not included but plenty of places nearby , Good location comfy beds Nice touches throughout Love the lobby area nice drinks coffee s and chocolates 
461724,Park Hotel, The hangers in the wardrobe up far too high The shower head in the bathroom in a crazy position not behind the glass screen It was impossible to have a shower not wet the entire bathroom floor No opening window or fan in bathroom to let out the condensation , Reception area and staff We got two extra free drinks as it was our wedding anniversary Beds bed linen very good 
461725,Park Hotel, The toilet bathroom is a glass square inserted in the room with zero privacy The hotel needs new carpets everywhere It is dusty , Good location nice lobby and friendly staff 
461726,Park Hotel, Heating in our room was a little unpredictable , Great location The beds are incredibly comfortable given how soft they are Would certainly stay here again 
461727,Park Hotel, When we booked our room we were informed that there wasn t a superior double room with wheelchair accessibility and the room category does not exist with wheelchair accessibility we were offered an executive room with wheelchair accessibility with a supplement of EUR 40 per night We were not happy with this so we sent an e mail saying we didn t think we should pay extra for having a disability We were then told that we could have the executive room at no extra cost This should be a standard procedure and not expecting the guest to pay extra , The friendliness of the staff and they were very helpful and efficient The room was perfect and the bed was very comfortable I really liked the bar area where we had a late night coffee and it was served with a chocolate and by very friendly staff there was a lovely fireplace which kept us lovely and warm after coming in from a very cold evening My husband is a wheelchair user and we found the hotel to be very accessible for our needs 
461728,Park Hotel, Really poor breakfast In the past they used to have a super cool breakfast with lots of unusual small things and a great variety of the usual stuff Now it is really back to basics and poorly presented , Super friendly and helpful staff Great location Cool ambiance Nice fancy lobby and bar Excellent price quality ratio 
461729,Park Hotel,No Negative, The location close to the museums was ideal for us with both tram and canal transport close by The disabled room was good and the management welcomed our ideas on small improvements Momo s restaurant within the building was a surprise find 
461730,Park Hotel, The bathroom facilities in room 212 were just too small and practically on top of the bed , Breakfast was delicious and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in 
461731,Park Hotel, The bed was a bit on the soft side for me, good location very good travel links great staff clean comfy room great breakfast choice especially the eggs benadict
461732,Park Hotel, The room descriptions are very misleading We booked a so called superior room assuming that as a fairly late booking there were standard rooms which had already booked up and were not available We found that the superior room was in fact their basic standard room It was MINUTE with no separate bath room just a screened area It was no larger than a Travellodge room at 3 or 4 times the price although we realised that the central location would be expensive We upgraded to the next size room which would normally have been 40 Euros more but they let us have one for 20 euros more They need to make clear the sizes of the rooms and hotels should not use the description superior if there are no standard rooms as a comparison NB The room price was reasonable value given the location for weekdays but prices increase hugely at weekends our Friday night there was almost double the Thursday , The hotel is in an excellent a location for Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum the airport bus stops round the corner and also frequent trams to Amsterdam Central station The staff extremely helpful reception staff gave us a good recommendation for a small restaurant serving typical Dutch food in easy walking distance Breakfast buffet very good with a do it yourself fresh orange juice machine breakfast not included in room price Bed very comfortable We had a view towards the canal On a busy road but good sound proofing from traffic noise and silent effective air conditioning 
461733,Park Hotel,No Negative, Great location Friendly staff with excellent command of English We had asked for a quiet room and we got it What really touched us was when our 3 year old daughter came down with a virus and I can not tell you how helpful and caring the staff were The hotel maid even left a gift for her to cheer her up We ll definitly go back 
461734,Park Hotel, Thought it was a bit expensive as the breakfast was not included and also we weren t told about the city tax that had to be paid at checkout , Very comfy beds and very clean hotel 
461735,Park Hotel, This was my second time at the Park This this I was allotted a room which was tiny with the wash basin in the room itself The bath WC were two small glass cubicles which spilled water inside the room after each shower , General atmosphere of the hotel is very good including the location 
461736,Park Hotel, The bed was uncomfortable Too soft you literally sink into my it Checking out was a nightmare they charged me for two people breakfast for two days I was only one person and had breakfast once They also charged me for a high speed internet I was given a password for free internet so not sure they could then charge me The lady at reception had no clue what to do and she called another lady who acted like it was my fault they made so much mistakes on my bill and I am still waiting for a response to my email over a week later Will never stay here again again, I really what to say nothing because I had such a bad experience I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times so maybe it s under a new management Location

461738,Park Hotel, The bathroom was poorly designed and the staff weren t friendly , The bed and the location The bed is almost comparable to the famous heavenly bed and the location is just awesome the park museum casino there s so much to do around it 
461739,Park Hotel, 1 Staff were courteously indifferent 2 Don t ask the doorman to call you a taxi takes ages he has some lecture about safety if he calls one for you instead of taking the perfectly good ones waiting outside the hotel , Location

461748,Park Hotel, Found ladies underwear in our room from previous guest and had to ask for a room change Was not told about holding deposit of 50 per room per night that would be charged because I was paying with a debit card When I enquired on check in about this I was told this would be refunded when checking out Was not refunded for three days Hotel has now frozen the full amount room rate 50 per night in my account when I called for an explanation could not have been less helpful they didn t seem to care Now a week since we checked in and I am left not knowing where this money is The same experience for another of our party ,No Positive
461749,Park Hotel, Television Some more Indian channels should be provided to cater people from INDIA , Location Food Comfort Clean good internet speed courteous and helpful staff 
461750,Park Hotel, Due to the modern design of the bathroom which looks fantastic and simplified water from shower sometimes come out to the floor And the space in toilet and shower were relatively small , The bed is very comfortable had great sleep Excellent location still with a quiet environment 
461751,Park Hotel, Whilst the hotel was well located and had a very good restaurant the staff behaved appallingly Every phone call from my room whether I was connected or not was charged On one occasion I asked the hotel operator to dial a number in Sierra Leone but I could not get through Shortly afterwards I found four armed policeman knocking on my door and asking to come in They fully searched my room and myself and left it in an awful state When I asked why they had come they said that I have been trying to make a call to Syria The operator had obviously confused Sierra Leone with Syria I also booked my hotel on a daily basis as I was never sure how long I would be in Amsterdam The hotel manager also commented on the fact that I ve been wearing the same pullover for over two days All this made them think I was a terrorist and therefore they called the police The hotel never offered to tidy up my room nor did they offer an excuse for their inexcusable behaviour Instead they told me never to come back to the hotel I have stayed in many other good hotels in Amsterdam and I strongly recommend you to choose one of these ,No Positive
461752,Park Hotel, Limited number of English television channels Stains on bed sheets and pillows on arrival Bathroom no privacy Price of food drinks 26 for two Vodka and Diet Coke , Staff Food tastes great although expensive Chocolate and truffle bar at Reception Decor in the Lobby Surrounded by lovely views 
461753,Park Hotel, I asked for a double room at the time of reservation but we got a twin one instead The mini bar charge was more than what we consumed luckily I spotted this at checkout and it got fixed immediately 18 euro person day for breakfast is a bit unrealistic A bit too expensive from what it had to offer Room was a bit cold even with the heater maxed out I started to get weird unauthorized transactions with Travel reservation as a reference the day after the checkout and eventually had to cancel my card and get a new one Not sure if related to the hotel but it s the only place I used the card in question while in Amsterdam , Staff was smiley and nice overall Location is great just a couple of blocks from the famous Rijksmuseum which was super handy The hotel was clean and the room was pretty spacious 
461754,Park Hotel, Price is a bit high and no breakfast is included in the rate I was expecting a sauna or steam bath there s a nice gym though, All location perfect room fantastic staff super kind
461755,Park Hotel, The superior double room was too small and in serious need of refurbishment When arrived TV wasn t working although it was later rectified the light bulb was out in one of the bedside lamps and the snack bar wasn t fully stocked , Really great location friendly staff cosy lounge area with a fireplace Momo restaurant was trendy and busy on all nights 
461756,Park Hotel, Room stank of sewage duty manager did not acknowledge problem and manager refused to talk to us Very small room very bad value No thought given to guest convenience things hidden in cupboards no plug in basin Very slow check in too few staff with other staff just looking on despite long queue Unhelpful and unresponsive front of house staff , Excellent location especially for the Rijksmuseum Public areas comfortable and tasteful Breakfast good and breakfast staff excellent 
461757,Park Hotel, The location of the hotel was a little further out than we would have liked The centre of town is a good 30 minute walk an hour round trip In the end we purchased a 7 50 24hr tram ticket which was super Definitely recommend using this if you stay at the hotel The trams were super easy to use , The hotel was lovely and clean The staff were polite and helpful The area was nice across the road are a few nice restaurants inc The Hard Rock Caf happy hour Monday Friday 5 7pm 
461758,Park Hotel, The travel directions from the airport are a bit confusing If they d just said opposite the Hard Rock Cafe that would have been fine but they just give the street name of the tram stop which isn t the same as the name of the tram stop , Very friendly welcome from reception and the staff were helpful all through our stay The hotel is really convenient for the museums 
461759,Park Hotel, From the start our experience was bad There was only one person on check in so we had to queue Having been allcated our rooms we had to change them as we had specified adjacent or interconnecting rooms which they failed to do We then had to queue up again for the one person still on reception and 45 minutes later were allocated 2 adjacent rooms But one of the rooms had a smell of drains which I reported and which the very discourteous duty manager Thalia refused to deal with In fact she told me several times that I was wrong The rooms were small the beds very soft and the shower and toilet were part of the bedroom The smell of drains was coming from the shower For such an expensive hotel this was unacceptable especially the way the duty manager treated her customers I don t think I have ever encountered a more unpleasant manner in my many years of travelling , The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that the location was great Otherwise it was one of the least pleasant experiences I have ever had in a hotel
461760,Park Hotel, Breakfast not included for the price i thought that could have been complementary considering it was one of the more expensive hotels in the area Also the check out process was very slow little frustrating as we needed to leave, Hotel was very clean staff were really helpful in organizing our airport pickup while we were out for the night they left a note for us in the room to save us waiting around the little things Location was great just a few minutes walk to all major attractions
461761,Park Hotel, Air conditioning was noisy Shower seal spilled onto floor , Bed was great Rooms had plenty of space Staff were very helpful and overall ambience was good 
461762,Park Hotel, Staff entered room without permission on numerous occasions while we were out and in Reception staff did not inform us of additional room fees which would be incurred PER NIGHT not as a one off payments as they originally stated leaving a large bill on check out Executive room upgrade does not include the min bar and next to no additional benefits Room heating was faulty , High quality establishment situated in a good area 
461763,Park Hotel, Only 1 long mirror in the room behind the bathroom door , Great location with parking in the centre of amsterdam Beautiful view of the Vondelpark from the room 
461764,Park Hotel, The fact that the internet is slow and the hotel offers an 8mbps for 10 euros day In my opinion for paying a room that is the bathroom as well i should at least get high speed free wifi, Location of the hotel
461765,Park Hotel, The room did not have a good view as was at the back of the hotel , Great location and nice environment in the reception area The room was a good size and was very clean 
461766,Park Hotel, Not good value for money You have to pay 50 euro deposit per night when you get there which I didn t know about In hindsight I d rather have stayed somewhere cheaper that was a little smaller , Friendly staff clean room really good food 
461767,Park Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location many shops and bars near by staff are very helpful and friendly I would highly recommend Park Hotel and would most certainly stay there again 
461768,Park Hotel, Some of the reception staff Being given a box room at the back of the hotel with no view after incorrectly being given a twin room despite booking months in advance and requesting a view , The porters

461772,Park Hotel,No Negative, Amazing location close to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh Museum Vondelpark Leidseplein on the canal and tram routes and cycle path Very comfortable rooms and the best bedding and pillows ever Stylish and well appointed lounge area on the ground floor Would definitely stay here again

461775,Park Hotel, The hotel is rated 4 stars and the room was advertised as superior and spacious however the room was tiny It had a small double bed not queen size and no space to store luggage which are both basic requirements to be classified a 4 star hotel I discussed this with staff and was offered portable storage racks but of course there was no space to put them Disappointing , Great location modern decor 
461776,Park Hotel, The bedroom we booked was supposed to be a superior double It was very small and the bathroom facilities were very quirky Although the toilet and shower were enclosed in glass cubicles there was no privacy at all In fact a curtain separated bathroom from the room On the plus side the bad was very comfortable , The reception area and the breakfasts were very good We were a little surprised when we tried to order a coffee from the bar at 11pm to be told that the coffee machine had been turned off 
461777,Park Hotel, The receptionist who was dealing with us on arrival asked us to stand to one side whilst she delt with a businessman who stated to her to carry on dealing with us as he would wait Just felt a little pushed out, The hotel is spotless couldn t fault it the beds are excellent great night sleep The staff in the evening on the bar and reception were a credit to the hotel Would defiantly recommend 
461778,Park Hotel,No Negative, The location is excelllent walking distance to many attractions Friendly staff fantastic breakfast and the bed in the room was to die for Momo restaurant and bar was very nice and cool 
461779,Park Hotel,No Negative, This hotel was beyond excellent The staff were more than helpful the room was gorgeous We booked the superior room but when we arrived at the hotel they told us they had made a mistake all the rooms were booked up so they upgraded us to an executive room which was well Amazing The hotel itself was in a brilliant location and in walking distance to all the main spots Would definitely stop here again 
461780,Park Hotel, Before we check in my friend arrived 3 hours before me and they did not let her in the room since she had no money and credit card for the depozit I called the hotel and asked them to let her in and told them to use my card They didn t do it She waited in the lobby for 3 hours even we had paid all the amount for 3 days stay , Perfect location great rooms very soft comfy beds And a great bathroom with great water presure 
461781,Park Hotel, The bathroom it will be little bit embarrassing coz it s open in the room, It s in the one of the best location in the city every thing is near of you I liked that I can rent a bike from the hotal and it had one of the bests restraints momo 
461782,Park Hotel, Standard double rooms have an unusual setup with shower toilet being behind an almost transparent glass doors Therefore in a quite small room you take shower and use a toilet literally on someone s eyes I would say the rooms are suitable for 1 person only There was no properly working iron in the hotel during our stay , Beautiful hotel located in the heart of Amsterdam Amazing hotel lounge comfy seats fireplace and real books decoration make the atmosphere 
461783,Park Hotel, The bathroom set up in the superior room did not offer much privacy with the toilet being in a frosted glass cubicle feet away from the bed , Really friendly staff great location seriously luxurious bed

461786,Park Hotel, the mattress of bed was too soft, the location is juste awesome everything is next to you coffee stores museums 3 lines of TRAM next to you to go to the centrium
461787,Park Hotel, We booked a superior room personally I wouldn t categorise this the room we were allocated as superior at all with views over the flat roof of the hotel I presume However hotel very accommodating and we were upgraded to an executive room that looked over the canal This room was better and I would class this as superior Just check what type of room you book , The location is great central for going both to museums and then walking up the main shopping roads the other way all the way up to the palace and beyond Tram stops 5 minutes walk away that lead to all the main attractions Good relaxed lounge and bar area 
461788,Park Hotel, Rooms were too small and the layout was just not right Bathroom was open there was no luggage rack beds were too soft if you have a back problem you can t sleep in there , Location thats it

461793,Park Hotel, Room was old dark bathroom was inside room no seperate doors tiny VERY hard to access Also it was smelling very bad from the shower and you could smell it in the room The hotel in general was old and needs restoration , Location
461794,Park Hotel, Bed was awful, They were ripped me off over the cost of hotel and I got per night through booking com as 129 and they charged me instead for 2 nights as 385 It s a rip off and I told everyone not book this hotel 
461795,Park Hotel, Sadly the room didn t so much have an en suite so much as a shower cupboard and toilet cupboard separated only from the bedroom area by the glass door and a curtain you could pull across Our toilet cupboard was also not clean with urine stains on the toilet seat on checking in which took four phonecalls to get someone to come and resolve it The hotel was running at capacity and it had evidently just not been cleaned properly in the haste to ready rooms for new arrivals ,No Positive
461796,Park Hotel, Walk from train station is a little long which was fine for us since we pack light but just a heads up We did have a cleaner try and enter our room about an hour or two after we had got in and woke us up There are little lights on the outside of the room to stop this which we were initially unaware of Just another heads up , Room was very clean with excellent shower and a very comfortable bed Perfect to chime back to after walking around Amsterdam all day Location is also great to get to the museums etc 
461797,Park Hotel, My room was in what seemed to be an annexe of some kind and the corridor was very narrow and so dark I couldn t see the slot inside the room to insert the key to work the lights In fact the room was also on the dark side and rather bland , Great location and super friendly and helpful staff The bed was extremely comfortable I would definitely use this hotel again 
461798,Park Hotel, There s no complimentary in the room even a bottle of water will be charged , The accommodation is great I got an upgrade to canal view room it s impressive 
461799,Park Hotel, Bit out of the way but that was nice to some extent as was free from stag and hen parties Its a good 20 mins walk to centre Plus double glazing for room isnt brill so hear passing traffic throughout night , The friendly staff and modern vibe Super cumfy bed and free speedy wifi 
461800,Park Hotel, The requirement of 50 euro deposit Also I believe I was ripped of On the night of arrival I paid 50 euro in cash while the next morning the desk clerk insisted I paid for it on my credit card the receipt does not reflect such a transaction, The location and the breakfast 
461801,Park Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful staff in a well located comfortable modern hotel Trams and boats nearby make travelling throughout the city easy and enjoyable Excellent breakfast Well equipped quiet room including trouble free wifi 
461802,Park Hotel,No Negative, every single member of staff was polite helpful and friendly and the room was spacious and included great lighting and a lush bed so comfortable can t recommend this place enough

461804,Park Hotel, Cold bathroom forgot to tell the staff so they could fix it for the next guest The superior double room were small in size Breakfast at the next door restaurant was not as great as they promoted and way to expensive 5 discount if you order in advance at the front desk , Location was great for us Close to museumdistrict and the high end shopping street Nice bathroom Bedsheets were very nice 
461805,Park Hotel, The shower and toilet were very close together and the doors had to be shut to open the other No space to lay a shower mat down after showering so had to squeeze out shut the door and put one down Not a major issue though, My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights from 20th November When we got there it s such a cosy atmosphere and smells great Of turkish delight There s a posh sweet chocolate counter as you walk in So tempting Room was good bed soooo comfy and just a very nice hotel right opposite the hard rock restaurant

461813,Park Hotel, This is the first time I encountered problems with early check in in these years that I booked through Booking com and not the flexibility to change the room that I requested The hotel staff who assisted me has not much authority and confidence in assisting to my requests although she did try to help I was so afraid that she s on duty each time as I know I cannot get much help from her , The ambience and design of the hotel and it s near to the shopping street and the museum
