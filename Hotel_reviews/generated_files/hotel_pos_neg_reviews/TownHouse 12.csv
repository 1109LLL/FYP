407109,TownHouse 12, Location is pretty far from center 40 min walk 15 min subway Value for price but slightly overpriced , Lovely bathroom nice staff ask for room with balcony there are only 3 
407110,TownHouse 12, Room was too simply decorated A terrace was promised but a simple street window was given instead , Breakfast is OK although did not like the big shared table Room was small but comfortable and view was not so nice from the window Common areas are superbly decorated excellent style 
407111,TownHouse 12,No Negative, I stayed at this boutique hotel for my birthday and it was perfect The staff were so lovely and accommodating as we were new to Milan so we had to treat them with a bottle of Prosecco to say thank you Brit style The location was great also Literally 30 seconds from Gerusalemme metro stop and walking distance to Sempione We clubbed in the evenings and the hotel booked a taxi for us that can take you to Milans hotspots Corsmo Como Duomo Sempione for under 15 euros even past midnight When it comes to aesthetics I m very particular with hotels but the interior was very pretty and modern I must say the bathroom especially was very posh and exceeded my expectations I would definitely stay here again and a special thanks to everyone here for being so helpful and sweet 
407112,TownHouse 12, Unfortunately the AC broke down during our stay and they weren t able to fix it before our departure Consequently the rooms were sauna like When it was working though everything was perfect The room street side are too noisy kids school at 8am garbage truck noises electrical power supply buzzing noise We had to ask to change room Curtains and shutters could be improved to have less light go through , The personnel was super nice and always ready to help The design of the hotel is original Easy to access by underground M5 You get a sort of mobile phone that you can use to have internet in the city so that you don t have to use your own The room court side with a balcony After asking to change from the street side one this was a lot better and they accepted without saying anything Close to Chinatown and therefore Corso Como 
407113,TownHouse 12, The air was out when we got to our room so it felt like a sauna They got it fixed a few hours later but then it broke down again The following morning it was unbearably hot Together dufd fix it for the rest of our stay , Nice place centrally located The reception lounge area is very spacious and a good continental breakfast is served there The desk manager Samuele was incredibly genial and helpful He worked extra hard to please us in every way 
407114,TownHouse 12, Wifi was not easy to catch , Hotel atmosphere is amazing very modern room We stayed it room 401 bathroom is very big Hotel location is perfect 1 min from metro station and there is big supermarket next to the hotel We loved our stay 
407115,TownHouse 12, Very small room Not comfortable No balcony as advertised in the photos only some room have Smell of in the room Needs a bit of renovation , Lobby and outside area 
407116,TownHouse 12, All facilities in hotel are old and need renovation In reception and in rooms was cold because of the central heating which was already of during our stay ,No Positive
407117,TownHouse 12, Rooms need a serious refresh and long awaited investment Equipment lookds and feels cheap Wifi was so slow that it became an issue for working I and that is more problematic also realized that I came back with bed bugs bites all over my legs , Staff was very kind available flexible and motivated Metro is 10 metres away Neighborhood is very pleasant 
407118,TownHouse 12, The breakfast was the same every day during our stay and there were no vegetables at all The kitchen had a long table everyone sits at the same table If you love private space I don t recommend the breakfast at this hotel for you Second day at the breakfast they ran out of bread There was a small bottle of red wine on the table in the room when we have arrived we have expected that this is a welcome drink At the checkout we had to pay 10 euro for that wine because it was part of the mini bar even if it was not in the mini bar but on the table The wine itself was quite poor so I recommend you not to drink it The hotel has a metro M5 station within 50meters but that line doesn t take you to the main attractions of Milan you have to change the line at Garibaldi Zara If you prefer to walk be prepared for a 45min walk to the cathedral The tourist tax is a bit expensive 5 euro day person we had to pay this extra at the checkout , The interior design of the lobby is awesome large open space with huge mirrors well furnished unfortunately with some traces of leaks on the ceiling Our room 106 was on the first floor reachable from a long dark stairway We had a view on the interior garden from our room which was nice 3 rooms shared the same terrace on the first floor but it was long enough so this was not really a problem for us The bathroom was nice and clean large enough for a couple and it had a window The room was well equipped cleaned daily The coffee at the breakfast was great you have just to ask for it it s free 
407119,TownHouse 12, When you enter the building it smells a bit funny could be a room refreshener but is a bit disturbing, Spacious rooms very clean and quite great access to Metro Gerusalemme
407120,TownHouse 12, A bit more variety in the lounge bar would be great I couldn t get a proper whiskey or better any whiskey at the bar Just this minor thing, The staff was amazingly helpful offering detailed tips for city escapes always with a smile on their face Very cozy lounge area and great decoration The breakfast was very basic but enough to get you started Metro line M5 is right in front of the hotel Great value for money highly recommended
407121,TownHouse 12, The condition of rooms could do with some repair , The staff are always great here willing to help with anything They gave us a free upgrade to a suite for my 50th birthday The common spaces are lovely and the breakfast good as well The location is perfect for getting around by the Metro and we always have luck finding free parking right by the hotel 
407122,TownHouse 12, The room was small but that s to be expected in a city centre Breakfast was included but was very basic and the receptionist on the second day was not very friendly , Townhouse 12 is a lovely boutique hotel not too far from the centre of Milan and very easy to reach using public transport the Metro stops right outside The room was nice and the communal areas were very chilled and welcoming The receptionist who greeted us on the first day was super friendly and very helpful 
407123,TownHouse 12, The breakfast was not good at all I would not recommend to get the breakfast in the hotel instead of it you ll find plenty of other options outside There was missing bread the food bar was not refilled at all and I waited almost 15 minutes for a coffee and needed to ask for it twice , The beds are comfortable and the rooms equipped comfortably and with taste 
407124,TownHouse 12, The breakfast was just normal and the hotel entrance door like a fire exit common When I saw it first time I regretted immediately for booking the place though when you enter inside as mentioned before the hall is amazing Please change this door , Clean and tidy place smiling and helpful stuff huge nice hall Good location right near the new metro station but in a quite street Nice park Sempione in 1km
407125,TownHouse 12, There isn t the restaurant in the hotel so you have only the breakfast in the morning that is nothing special and for the lunch dinner you have to go out , I liked the hall and the location of my room 
407126,TownHouse 12, Fairly small double room completely dominated by bed Somewhat expensive considering the quality of the room , Tasteful decorations and a very nice big lounge Fine breakfast The neighbourhood is fine there is a metro stop right in front of the hotel and there are really nice places around for dinner 
407127,TownHouse 12, The personel was really friendly helpful and service minded Great resturant in the vicinety Osteria Delle Corti on Via Giovanni Battista Fauch Really near public transit Metro Three stations away from Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station,No Positive
407128,TownHouse 12, The corridors are a bit tatty Room fine but could also use a little tlc WiFi poor in the room though fine in lobby , If you re doing business at the Mico convention centre this is a good location Good breakfast Helpful and friendly staff Nice lobby with sofas and Wi Fi 
407129,TownHouse 12, Breakfast was basically gone by the time we got to it The bathroom and the room need redecorating In the middle of a residential area so lots of schools nearby Staff weren t ok but not overly helpful felt like I needed to ask lots of questions to get information , Had our own lovely little terrace Big comfy bed Lots of light lovely entrance way with nice sofas 
407130,TownHouse 12,No Negative, It was amazing that this affordable hotel came with a large balcony The hotel was very clean and comfortable The staff was very courteous and happily supplied a map of Milan and talked a bit with us about things to see should we venture out and about 
407131,TownHouse 12, It s amazing how deceiving photos can be You look at luminous beautifully pictures and instead sadly you find some rusty old furnished rooms extremely pricey or at least crazy pricey for the Salone week Breakfast is extremely poor The staff is helpful but there is a sense of sad deserted island in the whole place ,No Positive
407132,TownHouse 12, The smell there is an overpowering sweet and sickly scent throughout the hotel so strong it even effects the taste of the breakfast and although the bedrooms are not scented the smell pervades everywhere and it was necessary to sleep with the terrace doors open Also it was unexpectedly very hot in Milan but I was told the air conditioning would not be put on until the end of the following week , Lovely staff comfortable bed charming friendly and tranquil good private terrace 
407133,TownHouse 12, Bathroom was nice but with an emergency door as unique door Also classical wooden outer windows needed to be close to have intimate feeling on a basement , The reception hall is wonderful with a great common table for the breakfast also the bed the decoration the feeling 
407134,TownHouse 12, Rooms are very small and furniture and other equipment look quite old for that price I expected much better room , Good location about 50 m to subway 
407135,TownHouse 12, The condition of the room was not so good it is old and there are lots of scratches on the doors The bed was very bad and uncomfortable There is no isolation on the window it was hard to sleep on Monday morning , Great lobby area very friendly and helpful staff The bathroom in the room very modern and newly built 
407136,TownHouse 12, The eggs at breakfast buffet felt to me a bit dry maybe it s just because I like them more wet and fluffy , Comfy beds beautiful decor The staff is simply AMAZING Very well trained and genuinely happy to host you 
407137,TownHouse 12, the heating was extremely high I switched off everything but still the temperature was too high A bit overpriced overall, room giving on a wonderful terrasse super friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms complimentary water in the room very close to customer location 
407138,TownHouse 12, Location was a little fair away but rather close to the trolley so really this was not that bad, The staff was always helpful and they all spoke perfect English not a single one ever said they could not help me with anything 
407139,TownHouse 12, The whole experience was disappointing We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights The staff was kind but a little bit untrained The hotel did not recreate a home like atmosphere The lounge was beautifully decorated but the whole place looked shabby especially the rooms which looked so dated that made you feel they were not clean The rooms were not sound proofed so you could hear disturbing noises from the other rooms The breakfast experience was not pleasant at all The cutlery was dirty The table runners had stains from previous guests of the same morning which means that nobody from the stuff checked if the runners were clean after the first guests had left the breakfast table The refilled bottles of water on the table looked again shabby and didn t give you the essence they were clean We didn t want to have breakfast the next morning This hotel was definitely NOT worth 274 euro per night ,No Positive
407140,TownHouse 12, Can t think of a thing , It was a very nice surprise to walk in there wasn t much on the outside to suggest a hotel but once you stepped in it was a definetly WOW Beautiful foyer and artful decorations and some cosy narrow pathways with more comfortable looking sitting areas Room we had a superior suite and it did not only have two rooms but also two fully equipped bathrooms what luxury Breakfast too had a friendly atmosphere with one big table and lots to choose from Staff was very friendly and helpful and had many suggestions especially the pizzeria and gelateria they told us about were a treat 
407141,TownHouse 12, Loud school behind the building if you want a lay in , Lovely staff very helpful and at tentative Great location about 50 yards to the under ground Clean room with fabulous cleaners can t fault them 
407142,TownHouse 12, Rooms were too basic and extremely small Breakfast was very limited with the same choices everyday Hotel is far from the city center Hotel is expensive for what it has to offer , The staff was extremely friendly 
407143,TownHouse 12, WiFi in my room didn t work properly, Nice boutique style hotel very friendly staff Once the underground station opens right in front of the hotel the location will be even better 
407144,TownHouse 12, A room service if you arrive later in the evening , That you you feel that is like a home
