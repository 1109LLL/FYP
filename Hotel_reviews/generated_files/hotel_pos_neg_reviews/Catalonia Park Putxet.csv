423505,Catalonia Park Putxet, Far from the beach room a little dusty lipstick stain on a glass in the room , Big comfortable beds Great Price Near Metro Stop The staff were friendly and helpful Great terrace room 
423506,Catalonia Park Putxet, Every night around 2pm there would be people talking very loudly outside Even with windows closed it could very well be heard The windows and walls are not vet sound proof So bring some ear plugs Otherwise a hotel ver good value for money ,No Positive
423507,Catalonia Park Putxet, About 700 away from Metro and we had to walk up the hill to the hotel The room was small for 4 pax , Clean and friendly staff Located near El Parc del Tur del Putxet Park which was easy to walk to 
423508,Catalonia Park Putxet, WORST STAY EVER Hotel is filled with extremely loud guests on football camp or something Had to complain about the noise in the middle of the night The breakfast room looks like a highschool cafeteria So loud and incredibly rude people There s a smart TV in the room but you can t even use the USB port unless you go ask for it AND NOW MY PANTS ARE STOLEN OUT OF MY ROOM I lock everything important away Has it come this far that I need to safekeep my clothes as well Didn t want to accuse anyone of stealing maybe cleaning service took it by accident along with the towels But reception won t do anything about it They just wrote down my room number , Breakfast is varied 
423509,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, Rooftop pool view is really awesome Breakfast was good too Bed are nice and comfy Very close to park and monument so nice distance for travellers 
423510,Catalonia Park Putxet, Toilet smelled very strongly of urine Ceiling started leaking with water because of the aircon maybe Mini fridge didn t work very well not good when u need a cold drink Hotel charged the first night on debit card which wasn t agreed refund for this took up to a week don t let any of this put u off think we were just unlucky , Short walk to closest metro L3 Pool area was nice to sit at Beds comfortable Staff very helpful
423511,Catalonia Park Putxet, Staff wasn t too friendly overall and a few members were even rude The swimming pool and the gym are tiny Our room was ugly and did not feel clean , The hotel is at a good location close to the subway 
423512,Catalonia Park Putxet, It is located close to the Park G ell but it is necessary to take public transport to visit other places Although it is not a real problem The pool is small compare to the hotel s size , The room was spacious and clean The hotel is located in a quite neighborhood Good restaurant s service 
423513,Catalonia Park Putxet, Swimming pool burnt daughters eyes hotel staff did not care No taxi ordered Safe broke Room keys did not work 10 min walk back to reception and 19 min wait ti be served Would not recommend or go back,No Positive
423514,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location of the hotel is on the hill so it takes you longer to get to the hotel and to the metro, The view from the pool is amazing and the employees are very nice
423515,Catalonia Park Putxet, It s was up a hill so was a walk to the metro even lo it was only 5 minutes Was a good distance to the beach and centre 20 , Staff were friendly and helpful
423516,Catalonia Park Putxet, The staff wasn t very helpful with the first room air condition problems the water came to floor and air condition could not be used the first night was nightmare When we came back from the city next day the receptionist said that problem is fixed but NO same situation Finally we were able to change the room but no apologies Unfortunately this left the feeling that this wasn t the first time this happened with this same room , The breakfast was excellent many alternatives to choose the second room was nice and clean Metro station in walk distance The pool was smaller than we thought but it was nice though 
423517,Catalonia Park Putxet, My room was horrible only one window that didn t even let in much light and looked onto other people s rooms My bath tab broke on the first day my toilet on the second day the fridge didn t work after they fixed the toilet and bath tub the toilet broke again on day 4 and me and the family had to use the public toilet in the lobby It took all that before they changed my room This is supposed to be a 4 start hotel but I would rate it as a 2 star at the most In all I will not be returning to this hotel , Location was very good in terms of getting to most sites 
423518,Catalonia Park Putxet, We travelled as a group of 6 2 teens 1 11 year old and 1 4 year old We asked for adjoining rooms but were refused and instead given 1 on the 5th floor and 1 on the 3rd Also when booking a taxi to the airport reception hung up to get a 6 seater taxi They rang back five minutes later saying it couldn t be done They said we needed to take two taxis more money for the company they had a partnership with I told them I arrived in one so it was possible and to go figure it out again a few minutes later they were back and said a six seater was booked , Comfortable bed
423519,Catalonia Park Putxet, Price for breakfast 14 Euro person to expensive compare value for money poor bar offer bar closed at 2300 Seems that our bathroom shall be renewed soon , Profesionnal personel at the reception 
423520,Catalonia Park Putxet, I booked two double bedrooms and received two single small rooms with 2 single beds each on different floors The pool is very small and the height of the water is only 1m is there only with the name There is a 20 minutes walk from the hotel to the nearest tube station and you have to change 2 trains to get close to the beach Would not recommend , The cleaning and staff were ok 
423521,Catalonia Park Putxet, The swimming pool is listed probably just for meeting some bare minimum 4 star requirements Since the pool is really tiny no swimming is possible Door veneer was hanging the main window was broken could not be flipped in The staff said they will look into the issues but nothing seemed to happen afterwards The bathroom was poorly separated from the room by a really noisy glass door Water splashes from the shower would spread everywhere including towards the bedroom Also to structure of the rooms was quite different from one room to another , Quiet location clean rooms friendly staff English proficient Helpful with storing luggage before actual check in since we arrived quite early 
423522,Catalonia Park Putxet, It was a 8 euro taxi ride away from the centre of Barcelona and the area immediately around the hotel wasn t particularly characterful View from the window wasn t great , The food at the cafe was nice Staff friendly and helpful Overall pretty good value for money bearing in mind I booked it at the last minute 
423523,Catalonia Park Putxet, We decided to spend the extra money on getting a room with a bathtub as we have been choosing budget accommodation for the majority of our trip However the water flow was terrible It took 45minutes an hour to fill the tub Water barely came out of the shower head when we decided to shower And the hot water wasn t very hot unless you were using it for the bath If you have noisy neighbours especially if they re out on the balcony you may have trouble or sleeping , Great location abit further from main attractions but very accessible by transport Rooftop pool was very nice especially after a long day of sightseeing Rooms were very clean and air conditioned Rooms also have a fridge which was great for keeping drinks cold 
423524,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location wasn t the best you need to consider a taxi if you are going to this hotel public transport isn t so close, We just were there a few hours before caching our plane back home however the hotel was very good clean amenities etc 
423525,Catalonia Park Putxet, We didn t dislike anything , Originally booked room with terrace told on arrival that there was a problem with the room and we were upgraded to a premium room which was excellent Staff extremely helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble Beds very comfortable and rooms include black out curtains a great nights sleep Excellently situation for metro and Park Guell 
423526,Catalonia Park Putxet, It is not even close to be a 4 star hotel Too much noise not enough light in the room very uncomfortable beds which are on wheels and keep moving tiny rooms ,No Positive
423527,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hilly area Not good for over 65s and unfit, The wifi system did not work well We had 2 iPads and 2 iPhones All worked perfectly but my iPad did not and could not connect They did not know why I have use this device around the world no problem Now in Venice working well Worked perfectly in Singapore too No fooling around with the settings needed 
423528,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and gave excellent advice on using the metro to get to various locations and also to get to the airport Breakfast was lovely a wide variety of choices which would cater for everyone The room was a great size for two and the air conditioning was a god send A great stay thank you 
423529,Catalonia Park Putxet, The staff forgot our orders more than once and room service took over an hour long Also the bar staff didn t seem to talk good English, The pool on the rooftop was very relaxing
423530,Catalonia Park Putxet, These aren t major issues at all but worth knowing It is a fair way from the main city but this might be what people want and public transport is excellent Pool isn t suitable for swimming lengths it s only 5m long 1m deep but great to just sit about in and enjoy the view of the city , A really nice place to relax during hot summer weather Some of the best most professional hotel staff I have ever come across Roof terrace is great Rooms modern and clean 
423531,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location sukced Really far from everything The toilet didint flush We told about it to the staff 3 times and they did nothing Then one night we woke up to a sound of water and the whole bathroom and half of the room was full of water Apparently there was something wrong with the pipes and the whole second and first floor was flooded They changed our room but still you woudnt expect this from a 4 star hotel And on top they didint apologyce and did nothing to refund my shoes who got totally wet We are never again going to this hotel ans wouldnt rexommend it to anyone , Cant really saa much to this even the Coffee was bad 
423532,Catalonia Park Putxet, Far from the city center after 10mins walk to near metro station you should pass 5 stops to reach La Rambla located in a tight street stucked between buildings , Staff is so kind breakfast was OK 
423533,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location of the hotel is fairly far out from everything Also it s up a steep hill, The pool though small was a lovely way of cooling off on hot days
423534,Catalonia Park Putxet, Check in was very slow First room smelled smoky Second room had a plastic bag wrapped around the smoke detector Closing room doors of neighbors was extremely loud , Pool breakfast AC and wifi were good 
423535,Catalonia Park Putxet, I didn t like the fact the bar closed at 11 00 and at 11 30 I had my glass taken away they should let guest be able to finish there drink without it being whisked away also asked for late check out night before and the receptionist who had no people skills said well you talk to my assistant if you want to extend your room some staff were good some were short of a few people skills food was a bit limited choice advise going out for meals in evenings, brilliant room with terrace view of Barcelona on roof top central to metro line hop on hop off bus
423536,Catalonia Park Putxet, The noisy people who took over the pool making it uncomfortable to be there and intimidating to go in the pool, The Reception staff were very helpful re Metro and Buses
423537,Catalonia Park Putxet, Air conditioning wasn t good and a fan wasn t available until the last 2 nights of our stay , Top floor room was fab Close to the pool with great views 
423538,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room was not very clean Toilet was a bit dirty with yellowish stains and the room had a strange smell Don t know the reason , Location was very good Staff was very friendly and helpful 
423539,Catalonia Park Putxet, Everything in the hotel you have to pay for it like coffee breakfast even for bags weighting and there is no minibar in the room, The neighborhood of the hotel is calme and comfort near to park guell bus and metro station
423540,Catalonia Park Putxet, Some of the staff were really nice and helpful while some don t look like they want to be there, The room was cleaned up pretty early I went back at two in the afternoon and everything was all done 
423541,Catalonia Park Putxet, It was far away from the centre The air Condition was too small , The staff were helpful and they answered everything we asked The room was amazing without any noise 
423542,Catalonia Park Putxet, Walls are not very sound proof all depends who your neighbours are , A very nice hotel in residential area with beautiful views from the roof top Good quality very clean and crazy comfy beds Located on a steep hill so be prepared it wasn t a problem for us 10 min walk to the station and then a short journey on the train to get to the city centre The roof top area is an excellent option to relax with loungers and towels provided 
423543,Catalonia Park Putxet, Paper thin walls you can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbours do Windows and doors have no sound proof at all Housekeeping staff exceptionally loud slamming doors talking very loudly to each other just outside of your room banging your room door to offer cleaning service early in a morning , A nice cosy rooftop terrace and a pool It was very clean and relaxing place A comfy big bed Good hotel location 
423544,Catalonia Park Putxet, A nice hotel for the price Close to metro and only 10 minutes from downtown The pool area is nice as well with great views and the staff was very helpful ,No Positive
423545,Catalonia Park Putxet, It was up a very steep hill and was kind of a pain to get to The area coming up to the hotel smelled like sewers but a lot of the city did and the hotel itself didn t smell The area around us ie the stress up to the hotel and on the way to park guell had rude and alarming graffiti on the walls about tourists Sometimes there were official posters against tourists too Didn t make us feel welcome in the slightest , The beds were comfy Shower was nice The restaurants food was super super tasty Staff were helpful enough Everyone has access to the rooftop pool but was quite the let down It s close to the metro stop Lesseps so buy a T 10 on your first day and you ll be able to go everywhere you need on the L3 green line 
423546,Catalonia Park Putxet, Its good value for money but it is not a 5 star hotell But it has everything you need The rooms are not soundinsulated so you do hear alot of noise between the rooms But that is to be expected from a hotell of this standard Ask for a room that doesnt face the street and not on the first floor The Garbage man comes late at night to empty it and it makes noise But except from that it is a quiet residential area so its not that much noise, Great little gym with new fresh equipment Very cute rooftop terasse with beautiful panorama view of the city We traveled as a group and the others commented that the cleanliness was great 
423547,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel s location wasn t practical at all It is far from most of the attractions and has limited shops restaurants and attractions within its surrounding Basically there is nothing to see there Therefore me and my fiance relied on the metro to take us to interesting touristic places Also we found a few ants in the bathroom on our first day there , The area is calm and safe The hotel is close to a supermarket which was great The staff are very nice and welcoming too 
423548,Catalonia Park Putxet, There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room , Good price for a 4 hotel It s a little outside the centre but the Metro is a ten minute walk away and it s only four stops to the centre The pool is lovely and there are fantastic views across the city 
423549,Catalonia Park Putxet, It was almost impossible to have a decent sleep The room was just above the main entry and was terribly noisy It was too small as well, The person at the reception was very helpful
423550,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel is a bit out of the way from the city centre However it is well connected through the metro Lesseps station It only takes one metro line and some 7 minutes to get to Place Catalunya which is the centre of the city The uphill street to the hotel from Lesseps metro station is a little tiring , Overall the hotel is a good place to stay in It is quite modern and clean The room we stayed in is quite sizeable as was the bathroom The bed was comfortable and the aircondition functions well and is quiet The snack we had in the restaurant was decent The staff catered to all our needs 
423551,Catalonia Park Putxet, All was good so no negative feedback, I likedon t the roof top pool and I thought the hotel was very clean and location quiet bit not too far away from the centre of Barcelona 
423552,Catalonia Park Putxet, There weren t many restaurants close to the hotel but metro was a few minutes away so it wasn t really a problem , The hotel was really nice the room was pretty with comfortable bed Hotel staff was very professional and helpful We spent there 2 nights and everything went perfectly well 
423553,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, Breakfast on the rooftop was amazing the food was really good too Staff were so helpful they moved our room so we could have a better view which was amazing hotel was close to the metro and bus stops Overall really enjoyed our stay 
423554,Catalonia Park Putxet, The rooms are too small for a 4 stars hotel Walls are far from being sound proof No mini bar no coffee maker One has to take the stairs to access the hotel , The hotel is not difficult to find from the nearest metro station Staff is friendly and helpful 
423555,Catalonia Park Putxet, Room too small for 2 people Bathroom door glass kit room up at night Door so close to bed Window opened to brick walls Very noisy hotel Walls very thin could hear every sound next door , Breakfast
423556,Catalonia Park Putxet, Would be nice to have a tea pot in the room , The staff was extremely helpful Comfortable bed and nice views over the city from the room and the roof bar 
423557,Catalonia Park Putxet, Room AC didn t work for my entire stay Despite complaining a couple of times nothing was ever done , The staff were very friendly and check in was hassle free 
423558,Catalonia Park Putxet, Disappointed that no tea coffee making facilities available in room Toilet paper almost unflushable Service at bar for coffee tea very slow Our room was on 1st floor and below outside many people appeared to congregate to smoke and talk so it was noisy late evening Quite a difficult position for people with walking difficulties , Nice comfy and large beds Bed linen and towels changed daily Room very clean and tidy
423559,Catalonia Park Putxet, A lot of noise outside during the late and early hours bin collectors most nights and sounds of motorbikes, The location size and comfort of the room was perfect
423560,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, The staff was very pleasant when we arrived and were helpful throughout We ate in the restaurant on the night we arrived and they were very accommodating and food was nice The rooms were cleaned everyday and room size was good Breakfast was enjoyable 
423561,Catalonia Park Putxet, The water in the pool was suuuuper cold but we were there in April so maybe it wasn t heated yet , Eating breakfast at the top floor with the pool and the view of Barcelona was amazing The food was great and the variety of things was stunning 
423562,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room was ok and comfortable bed but the room was NOT sound isolated even though it was written on booking We colud hear the neighbours having sex every night and som of our personal items disappeared during our stay , Comfortable beds Clean room
423563,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room was actually molding The AC system didn t work so the room was a weird temperature and the loo needed the water to be run before you flushed it I took pictures of how run down the room was not four stars at all , They offered a free drink on arrival which was nice but the barman didn t know what one of the advertised drinks was or how to start making it There was no sangria even though it was on the menu and they had all the ingredients and the Chicken wings with blue cheese came with no cheese 
423564,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel had the heating on during spring holidays Heating Outside there were 25 degrees We actually needed air conditioning We asked our room to be changed because the one we were firstly assigned was facing east and the morning sun and was hence even warmer especially at the beginning of the day when you would like to sleep till late and mildly dirty The new room facing west was much better overall we had a good time The pool is not a swimming pool but rather a grown up bath Don t choose the hotel because of the pool Overpriced for the quality they should charge as a 3 stars hotel or maybe refurbish it a bit The door frames are consumed especially at the bottom the bed has these old fashioned faked leather cushions on top that we had to put somewhere else every night the toilets are all made of marble nice but perhaps in the 70s , The personnel was extremely nice and helpful The bed super comfy The location is not bad at all despite the reviews I am a walker I have to admit but the underground station is 5 7 minutes walk Passeig de Gracia 2 or 3 stops away nearby you have very nice bars for breakfast Park Guell is 15 minutes walk away If you are fine with walking and climbing a bit don t be fooled by the reviews regarding the location it s convenient and in a nice area 
423565,Catalonia Park Putxet, The air conditioning was quite poor and the size of the room quite small , The rooftop pool was an added bonus the staff were really friendly the room was comfortable and the hotel not too far from a metro centre 
423566,Catalonia Park Putxet, The air conditioning was programmed in for winter setting so the room was very warm at times The weather was stunning outside It would of been nice to have tea coffee making facilities in the room however a fridge in the room was great to keep water cool The hotel bar was way overpriced Considering there is NO other bar near the hotel A Gin and Tonic was10euros Almost London prices , Very easy to find once there very accessible to metro and local attractions
423567,Catalonia Park Putxet, Room 106 the room itself was clean comfortable and everything that would be expected However and this is a gigantic BUT the bathroom was so badly designed that the designer installers should be shot sacked or otherwise dealt with forthwith a 4 year old could possibly have done a better job The marble shelf above the basin was so low above the basin that it was impossible to turn the tap on properly especially for hot water The marble basin top had a large crack in it obviously broken on installation was neither repaired nor filled in In fact it was a natural trap for Yuk Dirt etc The bathroom door was a glass modern design badly designed didn t fit properly that gave little privacy in either sound or sight I can only talk about this one room but this bathroom does not do Catalonian Hotels any favours and I would seriously think on whether to ever stay here again This is from someone who has stayed in Catalonian Hotels in a number of Spanish cities , The staff were very helpful where possible see adverse comments on the room I would like to point out that I did mention the bathroom condition to reception and the lady did say she would bring it to the attention of the management BUT whilst I trusted her in what she said I am not convinced that the people further up the chain will be bothered to pursue the matter 
423568,Catalonia Park Putxet, Tea and coffee in the room , Fantastic hotel good location upgraded to include breakfast best decision I have ever made The pancakes were fab Great location The view from the top of the hotel was amazing 
423569,Catalonia Park Putxet, The noice isolation could be improved I was able to hear loud noices outside of the room very early in the morning , The room was good the bed was comfortable the bathroom was small but enough 
423570,Catalonia Park Putxet, The remote control of TV was crashed We tried change but there was no one , The breakfast was very good and with good options The employees are so kindly and the services are very good The view from our room was amazing too 
423571,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location is too far from centre and a bit difficult to find if you rely on map and go by foot , Comfort Good Sleep not noisy Friendly Staff and printing facility Spent two nights at the noisy city centre this is a good break 
423572,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location is very far from the center of Barcelona The room was not ready when we reached The price 88 euro for a night without breakfast is a lot of money for this hotel , drinks in plastic glasses The pool is very small 
423573,Catalonia Park Putxet, Wifi signal was very poor I don t get signal to the room Difficult to go with public transport Because hotel is on Hill and difficult to walk from Metro stop Be ready to walk 0 5 km within hotel to reach your room , Staff
423574,Catalonia Park Putxet, Very loud no soundproofing whatsoever and the plumbing noise was terrible I have waken up with the nearby room using the shower sink or flushing , Breakfast was very good room had a minibar and the bed was great 
423575,Catalonia Park Putxet, Bathtub could be bigger but that s not a big deal Could hear some noise from outside and other rooms isolation is not as good as the rest of the hotel , Staff very friendly enormous bed and comfortable Nice pool Value deal everything had a nice smell and it was in a calm zone metro and bus nearby Supermarket as well Tv in bedroom was also good Internet is awesome Best Internet I ve come across in a hotel 
423576,Catalonia Park Putxet, Other guests were noisy and the walls weren t sound proof Would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Bed was really comfy rooms were clean and towels changed daily Lovely quiet location close to city buses and underground and a lovely restaurant just down the hill from the hotel 
423577,Catalonia Park Putxet, It is still a long way uptown in dire streets Taxi drivers be patient It could be a little bit closer to the airport , After six months I returned to this fine hotel close to Parc Guell The neighborhood remains fascinating the hotel perfectly integrated with the surroundings A nice walk and you are right there in Paseig de Gr cia with plenty of thrift shops and lofty restaurants Extraordinary accomodations Lovely toaletry Somehow it seemed less expensive than before And staff more cordial Waiting for the comeback 
423578,Catalonia Park Putxet, Hair dryer did not work well It worked for short time and had to load again , We liked the bed It was very comfortable to sleep Good Location and great service 
423579,Catalonia Park Putxet, They did not advertise that the parking is not free The rooms are old not sound proof garbage colection is every day at 04 30 down the street and the noise is horrible , Clean property
423580,Catalonia Park Putxet, The rooms were small not sound proof couldn t sleep due to too much noises from neighbouring rooms and cleanliness was not great, Location was very good close to metro station and local shops very close to park guell and sight seeing bus tours stop Staff was brilliant extremely helpful and courteous
423581,Catalonia Park Putxet, Construction going on at the hotel waking up to hammering and drilling every morning Even aside from it would not be a place for you if you re a light sleeper positively no sound insulation can hear every door and toilet five doors down from your room and every step of the person above you , Very nice and helpful staff 
423582,Catalonia Park Putxet, I didn t like that we could clearly hear our neighbors and didn t like the glass door to the toilet And we also heard noises when we were in the bathroom from the ventilation , The location was very good and good staff 
423583,Catalonia Park Putxet, The Hotel is a bit far from main Bus and Metro stations The hotel is located on a valley , Big room mini bar in the room very quite Varied breakfast menu 
423584,Catalonia Park Putxet, Considering this is a 4 star hotel we were a little surprised to have to buy drinking water from a vending machine in the foyer Everything is extra dressing gowns water slippers towels for the sun loungers They don t even provide shampoo It is also a little far from the main tourist sites , The hotel itself is fine clean small pool looking over the city etc 
423585,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location isn t good it s 15 minutes walk from the metro and the hotel is located on a heal so you need to Go Rising The room is small and it feels like there is no air we could have heard the neighbors TV bathroom is also small and there isn t enough light I felt I was showering in the dark Over priced to my opinion I wouldn t stay there again , The staff was nice to us good Wifi 
423586,Catalonia Park Putxet, Security My friend was stolen her bag becuase of very poor security at the restaurant Nobody checks people who come into the restaurant so thieves can easily get into the restaurant and wait for target , Nothing
423587,Catalonia Park Putxet, no hot water and poor water pressure on the first morning of our stay warm water the next and hot the other three days no coffee or tea facilitates in the room only a coffee machine on ground floor 1 50 euro a pod we were on fourth beds on wheels so always moved when getting in or out and pillows very soft and it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the top of La Rambla but is harder finding the hotel in the side streets in the dark , The breakfast was very good the hotel was clean overall and staff very helpful TV in room was good with 100 channels for most languages 
423588,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location was poor We had to walk climb quite a way from metro bus Hotel was not clean at all Sheets and towels were old and stained Blankets were like 20 years old I would never advice to anyone , Nothing

423590,Catalonia Park Putxet, We got a corner room where the bed was exactly in front of the door We d have to squeeze by it when going out coming back , Awesome breakfast menu good location close to subway and transport Good neighbourhood 
423591,Catalonia Park Putxet, Walls made of paper do not expect to sleep if you have a noisy neighbour Room giving view on the garbage Room giving view on inside court without view on the outisde world Old and dirty building Lost in a back street of Park Putxet Metro station far from the hotel , Nothing

423595,Catalonia Park Putxet, the croissants and the breakfast could have bben better but the ratio price 8e quality was good, the confort of the room the swimming pool space on the roof
423596,Catalonia Park Putxet, I was in the top floor There was water leak from the ceiling because of heavy rain I couldnt sleep because of the noise of water , I called the reception at 2 oclock in the morning and they changed my room because of the water leak Solution was good and quick 
423597,Catalonia Park Putxet, Our room was very small and not very modern The walk to the metro isn t too great as the hotel isn t in the nicest neighbourhood Also the walk back to the hotel is about 15 minutes uphill nightmare after walking around the city all day The hotel didn t have a plaster for a cut or even an iron for us to use , The roof top pool is nice although only small
423598,Catalonia Park Putxet, Breakfast room is tiny and you need to pass throught the main doors to get there Althought most of the staff was nice we had a pretty bad experience at check out the recepcionist was pretty harsh not to say rude We left a bit uncomfortable , First of all many thanks to Isis who welcomed us very well and was able to give us nice tips about the city Then the room was very nice with a terrace and an amazing view to all the city and the sea Breakfast was excellent and the waiters very nice The whole stay was a success 
423599,Catalonia Park Putxet, The locaton was far from city center and about 15 minutes walk till metro I didn t like the tiles in the toilet and the sheets were not clean , The staffs were nice and helpful 
423600,Catalonia Park Putxet, Everything Location room food was ok staff just forget about going there plenty of other options in Barcelona , Some of the Staff seemed arrogant Kitchen waitress was downright rude Room very small and smelly leaks in the bathroom all over our clothes wouldn t change our room Location is a taxi or metro from anywhere keep away 
423601,Catalonia Park Putxet, a little narrow no fan in the bathroom , quiet place a little far from downtown but you can still reach the subway the hotel is nice but there was no fan in the toilet however i like the balcony 
423602,Catalonia Park Putxet, The price was quite expensive but ok we booked it last min But when i saw the offer it was saying 134 with breakfast included and as I was receiving the mail I realized that there was saying paying your breakfast If I knew it I could take a photo screen to prove it Also the price was 134 and as I was starting to pay it was almost 160 without the taxes to Spain o good reputation for the hotel or the bookings , We liked the surprise of the inside of the hotel as when we arrived we thought from outside that maybe it s gona be a disaster The crew of the hotel was very nice and we loved the roof pool 
423603,Catalonia Park Putxet, I booked a double bed as a single traveller and they gave me a good size room with terrace but no double bed I asked for one as I booked and then they gave me a tiny box room on the other side of the hotel I eventually asked them for the same sized room as at the beginning and the only one available was with twin beds Disappointing in general and inconvenient I think as a solo traveller they did not put much importance into my stay Pool very small , The room was clean The salad I had and service of the bar man was very professional 
423604,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel parking was full which meant I had to use local parking which was very expensive The location requires a degree of walking A single loading parking space is available outside reception , Courteous and helpful staff Provided a bed a bowls for dog Good view of the city from the sun deck Gym adequate although needs some heavier weights ideally The nearby park offers great views of the surrounding area 
423605,Catalonia Park Putxet, The Internet service was poor swimming pool wasn t very clean They have taken my money before I ve seen my room the room was very small It s just not what I have expected ,No Positive
423606,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room was old and small window into the inner outyard Dark in a secondary tight street far away from real downtown No room service nor Minibar empty just an external TelePizza restaurant with fast food The parking is in other building extreme small not adequate for normal cars Not recomendable not really a 4 stars in Spain ,No Positive
423607,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, This hotel is too far from every where and you need to take a taxi for each time But overal is nice and clean But for the same money you can get the better place in center and you can just walk out to the middle of city 
423608,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, Breakfast is amazing Bar prices good value Food is very good All staff very helpful Stated on the first floor paid extra for a terrace worth it for the extra space
423609,Catalonia Park Putxet, The walls were pretty thin and the area setting of the hotel wasn t very attractive Also quite a walk up bank to get to it and the meals were a bit pricey , The bedroom was clean and well equipped It had a bath though it was small a safe and air conditioning with a nice view The staff were pleasant and helpful 
423610,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, The bed was actually really comfortable I stayed here cause I saw a picture ov the rooftop pool and thought it would be fun But it was actually really wasn t and it was pretty far from everything From the beaches and the night life 
423611,Catalonia Park Putxet, The walls are very thin and you can hear your neighbours taking a shower or flushing the toilet Car parking is expensive and very very tight Swimming pool has wonderful views of the city but the photo of the pool on the website is quite misleading as it is more like a large jacuzzi rather than a pool Just keep this in mind if it is the main reason for choosing this hotel Not enough sunloungers for the size of the hotel , Family room is large and the beds are very comfy A safe and a fridge is provided and wifi works well Complimentary welcome drinks was a lovely touch Large flat screen tv with lots of channels All areas are very clean Metro station in Lesseps is only a 5 10 mins walk 
423612,Catalonia Park Putxet, The swimming pool was tiny a size of a big bath tub maybe for a couple people Not suitable to swim there Very crowded too Never could use it The operating hours for both swimming pool and gym are only from 10 to 8 Breakfast was good but extremely expensive 30 euros for 2 , Room has ac Sometimes staff can speak English 
423613,Catalonia Park Putxet, Be carefull swimming pool is smaller than you expect especially if children are around Shame that bar didn t work there We didn t take breakfast which is too expensive in my opinion , Hotel is in very calm place but options for nightlife are not so far away Metro is not far away but city centre was reachable by foot through main streets Park Guell is really close We had room with terrace which was great Swimming pool on the roof is very convinient We could stay there after we checked out thanks so much to staff for this 
423614,Catalonia Park Putxet, A lot of noise during the night close rooms with any noise isolation cleaning of the street More an hostel than an h tel Tiny swimming pool Bed badly done day after day and sheets were not changed unless we asked we stayed 4 nights , Large room and king size bed Residential neighborhood
423615,Catalonia Park Putxet, Parking was a big disappointment Parking was suggested but not available and even too small for our car And the information is not clear and accurate The facilities and the rooms are not worth the stars that this hotel has , We liked that the manager took time to listen to our complaint
423616,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel couldn t accept my credit card Very loud neighbours total lack of noise insulation No toilet brush in bathroom, Great wi fi signal Fantastic view from top floor swimming pool Comfortable and huge beds AC and fridge in room
423617,Catalonia Park Putxet, Hotel is a bit off he beaten path That being said it is centrally located to 3 different metro stops which gets you to the center of Barcelona within 10 minutes , Fabulous breakfast buffet Outstandingly friendly and helpful staff Comfortable and spacious room Great seating area for the bar Wonderful pool with an amazing view of the city 
423618,Catalonia Park Putxet, Bathroom and hotel showing signs of age and use little more attention needed to the bathrooms and the air conditioning , Breakfast was great for the price 
423619,Catalonia Park Putxet, We had run out of shower gel and cleaners didn t give us a new one we had to ask for it at the reception The room needs redecoration e g basin in the bathroom Not so clean Unfortunately we had also problem with the ants coming inside from the terrace It needs to be addressed , Very nice staff Quiet at night We loved the terrace where we could sunbathe Close to metro station Lesseps Fairly close to Park Guell Brilliant swimming pool on the roof with amazing views 
423620,Catalonia Park Putxet, The staff was unfriendly We asked on booking and at reception for a double bed and they ignored our request The bathroom was dirty and smelled bad It was one of the worst accomodation that I tried ever considering we paid 120 euro per night I do NOT RECOMMEND ,No Positive
423621,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel was located up a hill in dire straits which barely allowed a large car Barcelona is quite an expensive city this hotel costed as much as Madrid s and Zaragoza s combined Hotel staff was not that friendly when guests slept a little longer and did not allow room cleaning early in the morning , A beautiful hotel with very comfortable rooms A charming neighborhood with plenty of arts close to Parc Guell and nice restaurants with a metro station a couple blocks away and the Parc de Gr cia street with plenty of attractions right there below The pool was really cool I intended to stay in Barcelona for 3 days and I extended my stay for a week 
423622,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not too fancy for a 4 star hotel the rooms are spacious enough but the buildings close by do not allow a good view and light The closest metro station is 10 minutes away walking , Good service clean room FAIRLY close to the city center 
423623,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, The hotel was nice and clean room ok The distance to down town was better than expected and we walked down with kids taxi going back Bar restaurant was nice but did not have any Glutenfree food 
423624,Catalonia Park Putxet, The rooftop swimming pool appears larger in the photographs and it was not very clean The rooftop sun deck was great though , We enjoyed the eminent service and consideration from all employees Furthermore we thought the breakfast buffet was as delicious as it was varied highly recommendable 
423625,Catalonia Park Putxet, I would ve enjoy to have public transportation closer to the hotel , Love the pool and the view room was comfy and plenty of towels Staff was very friendly and helpful I will definitely go back on my next visit to Barcelona 
423626,Catalonia Park Putxet, second time that we stayed are not doing well i like the first room that we stayed huge bathroom clean well and not smell cigarettes the second time thats i don t like the bath tub and washroom are not draining well the room always smell cigarettes and we complain already and wants new room but they did not provide so my husband decided to ask a spray to lessen the bad smell , the first room we stayed are ok but the second time very poor
423627,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location The hotel was far from the metro station and the staff was not able to help us get information about the bus stops and it s timetable, The bed was comfortable
423628,Catalonia Park Putxet, The only minor downside is the parking It s underground and costs 18 euros per night When I say underground I mean down a slope in the dark of about 70degrees like a roller coaster , Absolutely fantastic Our room was HUGE and comfortable for 4 of us The pool on the roof is exceptional also 
423629,Catalonia Park Putxet, It is far from subway Station The distance is important after walking of full day some young guys shouted during night please pay attention about it few employees don t know English It is not acceptable for the city like barcelona , At least what I asked for they did it without problems 
423630,Catalonia Park Putxet, Tiny pool area could have done to be open till 10 pm, Beds super comfy Rooms good size Pool and loungers nice although very small and photos deceptive Ate in cafe area and prompt and enjoyable but v expensive Breakfast good
423631,Catalonia Park Putxet, The staff sometimes struggled to understand our english Walking back to the hotel from the nearest metro station is very tiresome uphill especially if you ve been walking all day long Neighbours can look into your room through their terrace 5th floor , Our room had an amazing view over the city The staff was friendly Sushi or pizza service directly to your room Even though it was small the rooftop pool was nice 
423632,Catalonia Park Putxet, The first night while we were sleeping suddenly the door opened someone had the key to our room we woke up by the intruder when we contact the reception the employee told us that in their system the room was shown empty so they gave it to someone else although we had paid as soon as we arrived of course that disturded us because it was matter of safety not only of our belongings but our selves too , Near metro station and clean 
423633,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location can be limiting for some guests you have to walk 0 5 km slightly uphill from the metro , The hotel is clean and quiet Extra points for the pool at the roof 
423634,Catalonia Park Putxet, A minor first world problem the hotel is uphill from both closest metro stations tricky when coming with large luggage You may want to consider using the taxi for the first trip , Staff was super friendly and helpful Staying at this hotel offered us excellent value for money comparing to other options we had in Barcelona 
423635,Catalonia Park Putxet, This hotel tried to be a 4 hotel but it just wasn t Little things like some old furniture and a not so clean looking pool made the experience less good then expected They also attrack a crowd you don t want in a luxury hotel groups of english youngsters drinking own beer and playing loud music at the pool terrace We even encountered human fecies in the hallway at night And no excuses were made to us when we reported this to the receptionist , Nice hotel quiet part of the city but near public transport Gym and pool nice big beds and spacious bathroom Room was nice and clean every day and reception personell was helpful 
423636,Catalonia Park Putxet, drainage of the wash basin was moving water very slowly, nice little saltwater pool at the roof top decent gym lobby area with nespresso machine good variety in the breakfast menu
423637,Catalonia Park Putxet, Pool very small and not enough sun beds for the number of guests , Excellent bed Very inviting entrance and lobby all very clean Not far to nearest metro station so very accessible for all parts of the city 
423638,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room was small and the bathroom spacious The rooftop pool is small and shallow 1 m and felt a little crowded on Saturday , I enjoyed the terrace upgrade which is a nice area to lounge in if you are a little bit jet lagged and not quite ready to start the day The hotel is nested on the hills of Gracia with great views of the city and ocean far from the loud tourist areas in the old city pla a catalunya but is located walking distance to Park Guell and to metro and bus stops The adjacent Jardin del Tur de Putxet is lovely area for a morning or evening jog A short walk down the hills into vila de gracia allows access to great restaurants This area has fewer crowds and helps to appreciate the local catalan culture 
423639,Catalonia Park Putxet, No improvements necessary , Airconditioning Fabulous breakfast buffet Good coffee Quiet location Luggage scale available Lovely bar area with intimate seating areas Outstanding Italian restaurant 2 minutes walk away Easy access to 3 different metro stops and several bus lines Really friendly staff 
423640,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful trying to facilitate all our needs clean facilities with room service available every day all round great stay 
423641,Catalonia Park Putxet, size of pool and pool area quiet small the pillow case on the small pillow made your back head sweat the bar didn t stock prosecco , friendly helpful staff 
423642,Catalonia Park Putxet, The bar staff man was a little rude and grumpy It was my boyfriends burthday and He wouldn t give us ice or an ice bucket to take up to the room for our champagne Rooftop pool could be open earlier than 10am and close later than 8pm You re not allowed to even sit up there and enjoy the views after 8pm , The staff were really friendly Irene checked us in with a big smile and gave us lots of helpful travel tips and travel information The housekeepers work hard and it shows We had clean sheets and towels everyday Rooftop pool was small but really chill and has a great view There are towels provided and we were offered fruit kebabs as refreshing snacks from the staff 
423643,Catalonia Park Putxet, Parking a bit dodgy to get in and out of hotel located up a slight hill in a narrow street , Amazing breakfast lovely room extremely comfirtable bed helpful staff bargain for what it offers 
423644,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location of the hotel is far than I expected from the main tourist area 15 mins walk from Metro Need to walk uphill with my luggage I was tired from delayed flight from Paris and had to wait for long to get my room key Limited facilities for a 4 star property , Hotel is clean and good breakfast 
423645,Catalonia Park Putxet, Lots of noise in the room during the night I could hear someone snoring in the neighbouring room and people talking all the time Also the trash was collected every night at about 1 a m right under my window , Looks good from the outside and inside the rooms were quite clean and the staff was very helpful Nice view from the pool and good food in the bar WiFi was great 
423646,Catalonia Park Putxet, Sound insulation is really poor We heard everything from room next to ours and from corridor as well I slept with earplugs , The pool was excelent Beautiful view from pool area 
423647,Catalonia Park Putxet, Little bit far away from station we schould walk ten min and little bit crimb We could hear everything what my next room s customers said , The breakfast was tasty and we could enjoy local meal And room was clean and stuff was friendly 
423648,Catalonia Park Putxet, I had to deposit Euro at the reception to take the safety box key Minibar on the room was empty only 2 bottles of water on it lobby area fool of automatic machines all this in a 4 star hotel , location was good
423649,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location Nothing much in the area except Parc Guell Very hilly and difficult with children and bags No cafes or bakeries around the corner like the central hotels Breakfast not vast in quantity or variety Queue for coffee machine Staff good in the restaurant though , Very good staff service where nothing was too much trouble They got me a kettle for the room when requested within a couple of minutes The provided a baby cot free of charge even though Booking dot com website says one could not be fitted in the room all done and set up within five minutes Ordering a taxi for the morning no problem Borrow a fork from the restaurant not a problem Gym not bad although not many machines Have a multi function Life Fitness Smith type machine treadmills and bikes Nice lobby lounge area to view the football on the big screen 
423650,Catalonia Park Putxet, Rooms are tiny and rather dark at least rooms on 2 3 4 floors with windows looking inside yard Audibility is amazing you can hear neigbours talking Receiption twice refused to call a taxi to the hotell WTF On check out they tried to charge me extra EUR72 for room service food delivery I ve never ordered But finally the charge has been withdrawn which is good There was no refrigerator in my room 600 still they were in the others , Guell Park is close 15 min on foot There are a lot of supermarkets fruit stores restaraunts cafes suvenir stores nearby Street where the hotel is located is quite and nice please consider that it has a steep incline which may be uncomfortable for old or disabled tourists Roof pool is a nice place to lay on a sunbed and smoke a cigar with Barcelona sea mountain view It will be fun for children to swin in the pool with such a great view the pool is small with 1m depth I recommend room 600 it is a tiny one but with a nice view Barcelona sea mountain roof pool and no neighbors which is important Breakfasts are OK 
423651,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not everybody from personnel English speaking Rooms could be cleaner same bed sheets for a week stay not everyday cleaning with vacuum cleaner and not that comfortable for 2 persons Rooms also not that soundproof , Very good location near to a park quiet neighbourhood Metrostation about 10 Minutes walk Personnel very friendly Facility also very good Rooms clean Bathroom couldn t be better with everyday change of towels Breakfast very good and a lot of food to choose from Certainly value for money 
423652,Catalonia Park Putxet, We asked for a double bed and there were two single beds put together the same for our friends room , Staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel is pretty quiet and 2 3 subway stations from the city center The breakfast is a must try 
423653,Catalonia Park Putxet, The bathroom was very dirty the door and the window were all stained seemed like they were never cleaned the small window would not open fully which is better because just outside the window was this spiky plant and a lot of dirt and there was no ventilation system The towels were also stained there wasn t a toilet brush and at a certain point we had ANTS all around the sink reaching for our cosmetic products The sink and tub drain were very slow and I honestly couldn t tell what the cleaning lady was cleaning in the bathroom Our toiletries were only replaced once in 4 days and not all of them just the shower gel Also the pool was only open until 20 00 Definitely overpriced overall and deceiving for a 4 stars hotel , The room was exactly like in the photos the hotel has a pool 
423654,Catalonia Park Putxet, The check in took too long There were only 2 people in front of us and we waited for over 20 minutes The hotel room ours was 506 was absolutely not sound proof When i called the reception to ask where the ironing room was i was told to go and get the iron at the reception That was a bit unpleasant to hear at a 4 star hotel Later on they called back and said someone would bring it to my room , Spacious room good terrace good selection of food for breakfast I quite enjoyed the location despite walking up the hill The hotel is quite close to lots of nice cafes and bars it is a bit farther from Plaza de Catalunia approx 40 mins of walk though 
423655,Catalonia Park Putxet, When we arrived it had taken too long to check us in The receptionist was slow and pretty nervous He was not that well informed where can we find a market When I asked him again if he is able to help he responded may be later He said that he is not form this part of the town How badly it is not to know what is around the Hotel There was only one nice gay who was giving us the whole attention that we reserved His name was Eduardo The building was really old but the night costs 90 Euro the pool looks like like a little tiny jacuzzi and the fitness as well Four stars hotel probably 15 years ago but now now Fully disappointed , Although the breakfast was not free was delicious It was clean and the WIFI was for free as well 
423656,Catalonia Park Putxet, No real problems minor issue in that the toilet kept running needed jiggling to stop continually flushing, Only there one night but the room was very nice and the bed fantastic
423657,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel seems to have a management policy of not allowing guests to utilize rooms until after 1PM even when the rooms have been cleaned and ready for use Sure there are checkin rules of 2 or 3pm and most hotels around the world have similar policies BUT if a room is available for use when a guest arrives the use of that room is provided This did not seem to occur here and miraculessly rooms suddenly became available at 1PM not 1 room but many rooms Staff and management should understand that good service is more than applying standard policy good service is about providing a little extra to help travellers along the way by understanding some travellers have travelled long distances to get to the hotel, Acceptable as accommodation when all else is fully booked
423658,Catalonia Park Putxet, I guess it s not their fault but I couldn t find any TV station in English no matter the type music movies news etc Other than that nothing to complain , Friendly staff quiet and clean rooms good position nice park nearby small and cozy pool on the rooftop with great view 
423659,Catalonia Park Putxet, I m disappointed that even after speaking to the hotel I am still waiting for my credit card to be refunded with the booking pre authorisation Given that we have to pay the city tax I appreciate that there is a slight difference in the amount taken but it has now been 13 days after check out , The staff were very helpful and friendly We were upgraded to the premier rooms which were very stylish The jacuzzi didn t work but other than that the room was lovely The bed was very comfortable indeed The pool was freezing but still the roof terrace was a lovely experience and of course the view superb 
423660,Catalonia Park Putxet, The cleaning of the room could be beter on the sink we found toothpaste form a previous visitor a lot of dust in the room and in those 5 days we stayed there they have never used a vacuumcleaner , Nice and kind staff 
423661,Catalonia Park Putxet, I booked 2 twin rooms for myself 3 friends which had been confirmed by e mail When we arrived the receptionist claimed that she was expecting 2 guests only had two double rooms available even though the hotel seemed empty We were not best pleased forced to share double beds Very little apology no offer of a discount or free drinks etc I asked to complain but was told I would need to contact Booking com because it was their fault nothing to do with the hotel The bedrooms are quite small our terrace views were of people s back gardens , The hotel reception lounge bar area was quite smart The location is good 5 minutes walk from the metro near a nice park 
423662,Catalonia Park Putxet, quit far from old town thin wals you can hear everything from other rooms all 24 hours round Room needs some repairs could be bigger as 4 I value room 3 not 4 , very good dishes in bar caffeteria restaurant 
423663,Catalonia Park Putxet, That what happen with me and i didn t like 1 Bad location it s hard to find in GPS only catalonia hotel in bercelona 2 change option for date of reservation uneffective 3 long time to answer in call center bad quality 4 when i chose the option by cash in booking they depit from the visa credibility 5 the picture in booking not same the real not matching , booking com help me to find the hotel in which city i want
423664,Catalonia Park Putxet, To get safe key you have to leave 50 Euros at reception , Bad location Far from bus metro stations You have to climb a hill to arrive at hotel 
423665,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not so close to restaurants cafe shops etc Also not so great with English speaking 1 person OK , Great Wi Fi Very clean and good facilities Picture view from roof top down to Barcelona and water
423666,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel does not merit four stars There is some mold in the bathroom the tab leaked and flooded the floor Significantly we did not have the phone line in the room We complained that we need the room phone but the management did nothing three days without a phone line impeded our local contacts We do not fancy mobile phones so the absence of a phone line in our room spoiled our stay in this hotel , Yes the staff is nice and diligent but the hotel is significantly understaffed One receptionist in the rush hour was not enough The staff did its best to serve their guests well 
423667,Catalonia Park Putxet, Unfortunately our room was horrid On the corner and virtually no noise insulation as window disnt shut tight Boring fluoro lit room , Location though acbit hard to find One of the male staff was extremely helpful in getting oir tickets purchased online fir Sagrada Familia He saved our visit from being a disaster
423668,Catalonia Park Putxet, Could do with tea and coffee facilities in the rooms it s a pain having to keep going down to the snack bar and not being able to take away Also breakfast staff not understating much English and being rude when we tried to explain as best we could about already paying for breakfast with the room Although they then charged us anyway, Everything was lovely bright and modern Staff very helpful and welcoming nothing was a hassle
423669,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not much really Perhaps some noise in the floors but the hosts are responsible for the noise not the staff , yes quality of food as well as curtesy of the staff are exemplary which gives a true image of the positive spirit of the Spaniards 
423670,Catalonia Park Putxet, The breakfast buffet was a little bit limited for a Muslim client like me who is looking for more Halal food , The staff is very helpful and kind The WIFI was brilliant and they had computers conected to a printer for free use The place is only 10 mins walking to Lesseps subway station 
423671,Catalonia Park Putxet, Location is quite poor although reasonably close to a metro if you re fit for the hills Very noisy hotel , Comfortable room friendly staff Free wifi is brilliant 
423672,Catalonia Park Putxet, Instead of the requested double bed we got two single Small issue because the two single bed was really comfy , Really good value for your money nicely decorated room really kind staff members and close to the metro station 
423673,Catalonia Park Putxet, Our room was located beside a maintenance room the noise from this maintenance room during the night was terrible it left us both tired during the day we got moved to a different room on complaining The first three nights were shocking The walls were paper thin and we could hear other guests talking in adjacent rooms and further away rooms quite easily We ate lunch in the hotel bar on arrival this was our one and only time the food was overpriced the chicken was destroyed in salt and the burger was undercooked in the middle not nice Took a long time to get served too ,No Positive
423674,Catalonia Park Putxet, As I read before coming here paper walls especially in the bathroom are really true So if you have good and silent neighbors that is ok otherwise it could be trouble We were lucky that our neighbors were our parents so we knew when they are getting up , Residential area where is the hotel is quite safe and cozy you don t feel city noise here Coming to and from metro station takes just 10 minutes so it s good And walking up the hill didn t scare neither us nor our parents We liked Gracia district itself because it s quite close to the center but you can dine and spend time with locals escaping crowds of tourists 
423675,Catalonia Park Putxet, The room noise was only occasionally noticeable but it didn t bother my girlfriend who is usually a light sleeper so I did not have the same experience as other guests More expensive than would have liked but booked last minute so we didn t have much choice , Room was clean Beds fine they gave us 2 singles and not a double slight sticking point but even the singles were pretty huge We didn t have breakfast there is a lovely bakery and fruit veg shop that sells great produce which I think is better than any hotel breakfast take it to Park Putxet for a morning pic nic Location is good slight distance to travel but would recommend getting Lesseps into central metro Shower has good power and bathroom was otherwise clean Nothing outstanding but enjoyable stay 
423676,Catalonia Park Putxet, The food which we never intended to buy seem quite expensive Hotel is on the way of an uphill so you need to climb a bit No bargain is accepted in prices If you try they will probably say you why , The rooms especially bathrooms are definetely clean but really dull so if you want to wake up early in the morning forget about sun light and set your alarm And hotel personel Yes they were helpful at some important points It just have 500m distance to the metro can take you anywhere If you are just looking for a place just to stay at night I can surely recommend park putxet 
423677,Catalonia Park Putxet, I couldn t sleep two nights in a row because a lot of italian students arrived and it was a mess people shouting everywere beating doors at anytime it looked like more a student hostel than a 4 stars hotel We called the police last night , The mattress was very good the room was clean the staff was very good 
423678,Catalonia Park Putxet, Bathroom needs to be renovated Or at least cleaning staff should more focus on details when cleaning not sure if that would help though Seems like they literally only clean floor toilet sink and bathtub But what about the dirt around tap on the walls etc It s called deep cleaning you should try , 7 mins walk to a metro or bus station then it takes around 10 15 mins to get to the centre not bad even at 3 in the morning by night bus Toilet clean Bedroom clean 
423679,Catalonia Park Putxet, The bathroom for our hotel room didn t have an operational extractor fan or a window so naturally it started to smell , Staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was fantastic views from the room were second to none and the walk to the metro was very short 
423680,Catalonia Park Putxet, The air conditioning wasn t very good and when we had our window open the people in neighbouring rooms were noisy apart from that we didn t really have anything we didn t like but it should be noted that we didn t have breakfast and we never used the gym , The hotel is set in a quiet street but very close to the Lesseps Metro station We stayed in a triple room however we didn t feel cramped and the beds were very comfy Although we didn t use it we did check out the swimming pool up on the roof and whilst it is small it offers fantastic views across the city and there are plenty of sunbeds in the atrium and towels provided We had a meal from the snack bar the first evening which was good and cost on a par with restaurants outside of the hotel Our daughter got excellent wifi reception in our room on the 4th floor 
423681,Catalonia Park Putxet, The menu was very poor I was travelling with my ten year old son who is a very fussy eater There was nothing on the menu that my son would eat when I asked for just a bowl of fries I was told no they couldn t do that because it was not on the menu ,No Positive
423682,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not a 4 start hotel standards Very noisy and no restaurant for dinner Staff was not very helpful nor informative and only answered questions with the minimum effort , Breakfast was good Location was ok as not far from the tube station and only 4 stops away from Catalunya 
423683,Catalonia Park Putxet, We had street side room so there were a little bit noisy in night We wanted double bed but there where two beds Breakfast were a bit dissapointing almost no vegetabels , Good location about 10min walk from Lesseps Metro Station Only 20 30 min walk from Park Guell Room were cleaned every day towels were also changed every day 
423684,Catalonia Park Putxet, quite expensive breakfast, It was very Nice to stay at this hotel the service was Perfect they could check in us earlier and check out later without extra payment The staff is Nice polite especially Alexandra she was very helpful 
423685,Catalonia Park Putxet, Parking was a bit difficult if your car was big View from room wasn t great , Loved the quietness and the staff very friendly Rooms very clean Metro only walking distance Would visit again 
423686,Catalonia Park Putxet, Not too much to moan about You get what you pay for with hotels Bathroom could have been a bit cleaner Nothinf a bit of elbow grease couldnt fix Seal on the bath needed replaced and we found out the hard way as the bathroom floor was covered in water after we showered , 5 10 minutes walks from Lesseps metro station which is only a few stops away from Las Ramblas Yes it is a bit of a walk up hill to the hotel but its not as bad as some people have made out Hotel rooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable Breakfast was great plenty choice of hot and cold food and drinks Staff were friendly and helpful even with a boisterous group of lads Rooms were cleaned each morning and fresh towels provided 
423687,Catalonia Park Putxet, Rates were high for the type of room offered but this is likely due to MWC conference and the scarcity of hotel rooms , Friendly staff Location near a main subway train line also great 
423688,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel is impossible to find without a GPS since the street signs are not clearly indicated The parking which is also nearby doesn t have sign saying it s for the hotel which led to some confusion The room we had originally which we had booked as non smoking smelled of smoke because we were on the fourth floor and the third floor is a designated smoking area but the hotel handled it well and changed us at no charge It was also somewhat expensive for the original room we booked for two nights but that might have been due to the new year , The location of the hotel was ten minutes from the main subway leading into the heart of Barcelona s city center and the park guell was only a 15 minute walk The onsite parking was cheap 10 euros a day and safe and the staff was wonderful They provided us with great directions and advice and upgraded our room to premium on a different floor when we complained about the smell of smoke in our original room Also walking distance from several bakeries small corner stores and chain restaurants 
423689,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, We spent our honeymoon in this hotel and were very happy with the stuff Reception stuff was very helpful and friendly made us feel really welcome and appreciated The location is great We would really recommend this hotels for everyone 
423690,Catalonia Park Putxet, noise easily transferred from neighboring which means the walls don t have acoustic protection they easily mix the family rooms or business trip with young and student tourist very much noisy after midnight and can t get good sleep ,No Positive
423691,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel is a bit far away My room had a very small bathroom When sitting on the toilet your knees are basically stuck against the lavatory , Very effcient and quick check in 
423692,Catalonia Park Putxet, The toilet was flowing a little all the time from when I ve arrived at a hotel and then suddenly its stopped and this time the toilet is no flash in the morning I told the reception about this but toilet was not fixed This is the point I disappointed , the room has very nice balcony view is beautiful the women at reception is very friendly and kind 
423693,Catalonia Park Putxet, Paper thin walls had neighbours who thought it wise to have a perfectly normal conversation from 1AM to about 4AM The maid probably unconsciously managed to plug my sink down and it was impossible to lift the thing up so had to use bathtub as sink or else it overflowed Poor internet in the evening night decent to great in the morning to midday Pool was a bit disappointing since the water was really cold , It was tidy fairly close to the Lesseps metro station Very close to a hill with incredible view of the city Nice clean neighbourhood Decent gym 
423694,Catalonia Park Putxet, Advertised with air conditioning but there is none in the room Got a fan from reception the did the job instead Ask for a room for 3 people and we got 2 double beds instras, Excellent gym and swimming pool Service was excellent Easy to get to the city by metro or bus Approximately a 5 minute walk by it is hilly You can catch the hop on bus hop off bus near by Close to cafe and good shopping around Breakfast available at the hotel at a reasonable price
423695,Catalonia Park Putxet, This is a purpose built large hotel building built some time ago probably in the 70s so is looking a little tired now Don t expect personality or charm It is quite a way from the centre of Barcelona, The hotel was nice enough and had a gym with free chilled water 
423696,Catalonia Park Putxet, We went in Oct 19th swimming pool was cold My children 12 10 tried the pool but freezing It s a pity Also too noisy with doors You need to pull ready hard to close door and so it create a very bang noise , Our bedroom was good 
423697,Catalonia Park Putxet, Parking garage had low ceiling s and tight spaces Was challenging to use but glad they had it , Very convenient location with parking garage Staff was great Marta was at the front desk to greet us She was great She handled three guests and the telephone at once switching between 4 different languages seamlessly Amazing Room with balcony was nice bed was comfortable with nice linens 
423698,Catalonia Park Putxet, Nothing , The location was good We walked to the attractions we wish to visit The stop for the city on off bus was a 15 minute walk The hotel wS clean and comfortable The staff were very helpful and please tell to deal with The breakfast was great with a good selection of good food 
423699,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel is old and need urgent a face lift My bathroom was really out dated This is definitely not a 4 star hotel The location is far from the city center and for the nearest metro station there is a walk of 15 min to do , Nice gym and swimming pool arrea
423700,Catalonia Park Putxet, extremely thin walls between rooms regular cigarette smoke smell in the bathroom, excellent breakfast comfortable bed full panorama over Barcelona from our window
423701,Catalonia Park Putxet,No Negative, I liked the situation of the hotel as it was situated close to Parc Guell on the hill that affords the classic view of Barcelona from the roof terrace and pool The staff were very friendly and helpful particularly when an item went missing from my room and left no stone unturned in their efforts to help me recover it Shame that our efforts were in vain Many thanks to Romario Eva Pol and Luis for their help and their kindness 
423702,Catalonia Park Putxet, Drunk people coming back at night time lousy and shouting and running throw the floor, I did t like the way the staff and the Manager in charge of the Hotel are dealing with the issue with there client
423703,Catalonia Park Putxet, Disappointed with the room and hotel fascinates The pictures are way better than what the hotel actually looks like I was surprised that it has 4 starts Miniature 1 meter deep swimming pool looks very deferent in the pictures as well as the quality of rooms Not easily accessible by public transport ,No Positive
423704,Catalonia Park Putxet, The hotel is located in a quite area so there is not a lot to do in terms of bars or restaurants There are a few coffee bars a short walk away with metro station about 10 min from the hotel , Staff were excellent and the room was very clean and comfortable There was a great breakfast on offer and good value Good gym and a nice pool area on the top of the building So good value all round 
423705,Catalonia Park Putxet, I wanted a late check out as my flight home wasn t until 21 30 They couldn t accommodate this Also there was no balcony so drying wet beach and pool clothes was hard That walk home up the hill every night was an effort and a half , The power shower was amazing and the staff were friendly I really liked the pool too Club sandwich in snack bar was amazing loved it 
423706,Catalonia Park Putxet, A staff remember behind the bar restaurant was rude unhelpful he basically refused to take our order then hid in the back until we gave up left , The buffet breakfast was amazing the staff behind reception were always friendly and helpful The pool gym were also great 
423707,Catalonia Park Putxet, Didn t like that the hotel took the guarantee fee after booking and we are still waiting for it to come back Also there was no bath curtain so each time we used the shower the floor was flooded We said it to the reception staff but they said they can do nothing and we were not the first who mentioned it , Stayed for 4 days Extremely nice reception staff especially Marta was very helpful We mentioned that it was our honeymoon and she suggested us to change the room for the bigger and better one sent us the champaign the wedding gift from the hotel That was very nice Also the staff helped each time we need advice on how to get somewhere The location is excellent 10 minutes walking from the metro station 20 minutes walking from the Passaig de Gracia where Casa Mila and Casa Batllo situated Putxet Gardens nearby and quick way to the Park Guell The breakfast is tasty and various The rooms are different The one we stayed was good one with good view we saw la Sagrada Familia big bed and big TV Rooms are a little bit used but clean Cleaning is also good and careful Overall opinion is very good Especially suggest this hotel to those who travel to Barcelona for the first time you will enjoy the location and service 
423708,Catalonia Park Putxet, Difficult to find the street of the hotel different name on the map Dangerous parking very steep a lot of pillars Swiming pool schedule from 10am 20pm only, Clean big room Good airco Close to metro station 5 min walk 
423709,Catalonia Park Putxet, Likely source of fraudulent activity on my credit card The very next day Didn t clean my room on Sunday , Room was clean and staff was polite 
423710,Catalonia Park Putxet, Uphill walk to hotel from metro More than the reported 9mins Not great with luggage and children, Lovely hotel and pleasant staff once you find the place 
423711,Catalonia Park Putxet, Very basic breakfast, Pol at reception is the most helpful man ever The bed is so comfortable best sleep ever Excellent wifi all in the hotel Lovely gym So clean Loved having a swimming pool too 
423712,Catalonia Park Putxet, Was not such a good experience the hotel is situated on the top of a hill they were very understaffed The one receptionist answers phone calls to take orders for the kitchen and manages the check in at the same time The swimming pool is really tiny not even worth it My shower had no curtain so there was always a puddle on the bathroom floor ,No Positive
423713,Catalonia Park Putxet, The location is terrible especially sinceit s located near Parc G ell that means you have to get on a quite a steep hill to reach the hotel Furthermore if you don t have a car or bike you will need to walk that same hill multiple times a day just to reach the public transport which is about 10 15 minutes walk , The roof swimming pool is very small but it s a nice spot is just lay around when the sun is up The free Wi Fi is reliable and fast The gym facility is small as well but adequate because they have a cable machine for multiple purposes 
423714,Catalonia Park Putxet, Only downside was the sound from the hallways early in the morning when people were going for breakfast and we wanted stay in , It was good location and the people were very kind and helpful We even got our room upgraded to premium because they didn t have a double size bed and higher floor room so we were super happy with that The Internet was good and the whole place was clean 
423715,Catalonia Park Putxet, Hotel is located almost out of Barcelona It was very difficult to reach there and far away from city center Cleaning lady changed only towels and kept the room the same No shampoo no shower gel , Internet connection was good 
423716,Catalonia Park Putxet, The same keys from our room were given to a french couple who opened our door after we went our room and started unpacking our baggage Gym is basically a cardio zone And the swimming pool is too small to be considered a swimming pool sorry, A very polite helpful receptionist at check in and ckeck out the same lady Nice breakfast
423717,Catalonia Park Putxet, On the day we arrived we were told they were fully booked although I booked the room a month ago and I suspect due to our late flight time we were given a triple room 211 instead of the double we had booked Although it slightly resembled the pictures on the website it was definitely not the same standard as the room we had booked standard double Bathroom was not particularly clean and there were ants We stayed one night in this room but on the second day after catching a glance at the rooms on the other side of the hallway when they were being cleaned I realised that our room was definitely not an equal standard and asked to move Staff were really great and moved us straight away The second room was great clean and ant free I was really happy with the second room but probably would have been left feeling rather disappointed if we would have stayed in the original for our full stay I should point out I marked down cleanliness for the first room we stayed in however the second was spotless , Location was good easy to reach city centre on metro whilst being far enough away to be quiet more reasonably priced and relatively tourist free Pool area was nice Great value for money Breakfast was on offer during our stay for 8 usually 13 and was really delicious with lots of choice and even a gluten free section Staff were really friendly and helpful had a query described below during our stay they were very accommodating and apologised and immediately changed our room and gave complimentary drinks 
423718,Catalonia Park Putxet, Ants in the bathroom Two single beds instead of a double one Inconvenient hotel parking one spot which is always taken , Inexpensive great breakfast a pool for kids free parking nearby at least in August friendly staff more less walking distance from the city center Fridge in the room 
423719,Catalonia Park Putxet, Staff are not responding properly as we have couple of issues My phone set was not working all the stay although I reported the issue in day one plus my daughters room door had an issue in opening and each time staff have to open it English Language is poor as well, Clean and comfortable
423720,Catalonia Park Putxet, We cannot fault this hotel Up hill walk to hotel is not as bad as other reviews suggest, Friendly staff quiet location below lovely park 10 min walk to Metro walking distance to Park Guiell assisted by escalators good food breakfast well worth getting up for Chambermaids attention to detail is a credit to the hotel 
423721,Catalonia Park Putxet, Check in check out too slow Important to have always 2 people at the reception The parking that the hotel provides is honestly the most difficult parking I ve ever entered and left Public park house about 4min walk but it costs about 30EUR a night In general everything was fine but quite honestly it s not a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
423722,Catalonia Park Putxet, i think its not 4 star hotel its only 3 or 2 stars because they dont have mini bar in the rooms and rooms are dont same with the pictures that i saw on booking com ,No Positive
423723,Catalonia Park Putxet, The rooftop pool is very small The area is pretty much being used as a smoking area which is annoying for non smokers The view is only nice when you re standing up but the wall underneath the windows blocks the view when you re in the lounge chairs I don t understand why they didn t just put huge glass walls , The hotel was modern and comfortable Overall good value for money It was nice that they gave us an umbrella on a rainy day Wifi works well 
423724,Catalonia Park Putxet, No snacks available in snack bar at 22 45 It does state that it s open until 23 00 Minimum charge of 18euros for room service , Pleasant reception staff Lovely roof with pool although it did get busy 15 mins walk to Park Guel
