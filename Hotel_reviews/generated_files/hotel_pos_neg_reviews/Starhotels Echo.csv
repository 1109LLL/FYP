493580,Starhotels Echo, The location next to Milan Central railway station doesn t feel that secure at night , Staff was very friendly and helpful The location close to the Railway Station Milan Centrale 3 min walk The bathroom was very clean and beautiful The hotel is very modern and cool Breakfast was amazing 
493581,Starhotels Echo, As an Ecco hotel I expected a nice rooftop terrace but the plants were all dead That didn t fair well for it s reputation, Nice breakfast buffet but dinner was overpriced and average and drinks very expensive 
493582,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Easy walk from the train station This hotel is so beautiful and it smells incredible when you walk in the door Staff were welcoming and very accommodating Loved our dinner and breakfast was delicious Wished we were staying an extra day 
493583,Starhotels Echo, everything was perfect , everthing amazing location right next to central train station so very very close to buses direct to both airports hotel seemed new clean beautiful room was beautiful and spacious well stocked mini bar Breakfast was wonderful had everything you can imagine 
493584,Starhotels Echo, Being near the Train Station there tend to be more transient people You need to watch your surroundings but in general it is safe if not a beautiful part of Milano although the station building is quite impressive , the location across the piazza from the Milano Train Station is very convenient if you are traveling by train since it is 5 10 min from the station There is also easy access to the subway lines The breakfast was above average and the complimentary light snacks during the evening cocktail hour were a great treat 
493585,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast was poor and terribly same every day They didn t pay any attention to the signs do not disturb and clean the room woke us up twice after the night flight despite the sign don t disturb and didn t clean the room day after despite the sign please make up the room For this money we could book much better places in Milan unfortunately we trusted the reviews on booking And also very important the breakfast is not included to the price small and very cheap trick to make the price to look like lower The queen size bad is not a queen size but just two usual beds connected together Disaster to sleep frankly speaking And what is even more important DON T TAKE APPLES DURING THE BREAKFAST THEY ARE NOT WASHING THEM We poisoned immediately after tried them both of us , Reception girls were very polite
493586,Starhotels Echo, It was an OK accommodation Did not think it deserved a 4 stars rating , I liked the location a lot I also thought the curly haired brunette woman who was working on the late afternoon night shift during our stay was extremely extremely helpful The other staff spoke broken English and were not helpful at all We had a car and were lost with the one way streets on our way to the hotel The staff during the day told us they couldn t help and to basically figure it out haha crazy yes I know Did like though how they valeted parked our car for us and brought it back when we needed it 
493587,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast could be better not much variety Hot meal is not included in the breakfast standard rate , Location is ideal next to central railway station which makes the commute easier The city center is in the walkable distance Hotel is very new with great facilities 
493588,Starhotels Echo, Housekeeping was our sole issue while staying at this hotel They skipped us a couple of days until we requested with the reception desk that our room be made up Even then they did not supply us with new cups glasses or toilet paper , Loved the decor of the room We had a little balcony that was really nice The breakfast in the morning was excellent Overall very pleased with this hotel 
493589,Starhotels Echo, More selection at breakfast may be good The bacon sausage at breakfast not too great Otherwise a great option to stay in milan The breakfast staff are very friendly makes your day great when you head down for breakie , The hotel is just opposite milano central train station which is very convenient if you plan to commute by train to other parts of Italy It s also where the airport shuttle drops pick u up It also has connecting room for families I was there with my parents sis Great trip harder pillows are available upon request More selection at breakfast may be good The bacon sausage at breakfast not too great Otherwise a great option to stay in milan 
493590,Starhotels Echo, Dark lift area, The fact it s an echo hotel Good location extremely close to the train station and all other public transport options Smells divine when you walk in Modern and clean
493591,Starhotels Echo, Need to request for more fluffy pillows , The location is just literally across the milano central train station Very convenient Hotel furnishing is modern Breakfast staff is very friendly 
493592,Starhotels Echo, The restaurant bar in the lobby works great for breakfast but in the evening could use some improvements in terms of service , The air conditioning in the room worked great unusual for a European city Was a blessing having stayed while there was a strong heat wave hitting the area I also loved the bathroom with a nice and comfortable bath and shower with perfect water pressure 
493593,Starhotels Echo, The room was on the small side though well appointed and quiet , Generally good facilities and helpful staff the hotel also has an excellent bar foyer and restaurant 
493594,Starhotels Echo, There was nothing we didn t like , Our room on 7th floor had a balcony with an amazing view of the station and city It is located close to the station which was good for us Staff were very friendly and helpful Good breakfast 
493595,Starhotels Echo, Nothing as far as Echo is concerned , Facing to Milan central station and the view is super from valucony The room space is big enough Recommendable to stay at room 407 and or 507 for single use 
493596,Starhotels Echo, Two elevators for all these rooms is problematic The check out took some time but to be honest the hotel was practically fully booked , I liked the hotel very much I would stay there again 
493597,Starhotels Echo, The information about the Superior double room the one I booked size was misleading the room was much smaller than claimed 18 sq m When I went to inquire at the reception they said that was the one we booked and offered a bigger room for just 20 euro additionally At the time of my check out the bill along with agreed 20 euro per night was 30 euro higher than the price indicated when booked Another annoying thing was a clogged sink in the bathroom And we were not happy returning after a very long day and being very tired to find out that our electronic keys did not work so we had to go back to the lobby and stand in a long line to a single receptionist no apologies were offered for the inconvenience , Perfect location just across the Central Station few steps to metro connecting the place with the city center Beautiful design of the hotel lobby Great breakfast comfortable bed airco with a right balance of cooling and low noise
493598,Starhotels Echo, Very low value for money Paid 290 per night for a room on 1st floor overlooking the street from which the hotel supplies were loaded each morning Extremely noisy While I was there 1 of 2 elevators was not working so each mornings here was traffic Room service food was of poor choice and average quality ,No Positive
493599,Starhotels Echo, Our stay was too short therefore didn t have much time to assess lots of things , Proximity to the train station Decent breakfast Room upgrade Helpful porter Balcony overlooking train station 
493600,Starhotels Echo, Lots of people loitering around the train station Not much you can do about that , The location is what I liked most It is just beside the train station We got off the train and walked to the hotel We stayed for a couple of days and then caught the light rail train to the airport for our flight home It was also easy to get to the historical centre using the subway which is also just there We found a good restaurant just around the corner I like the hotel The staff were very helpful The Eataly restaurant in the hotel was reasonably priced the staff were lovely and the wine was fantastic Highly recommend it The room was comfy and clean It was also green which I like 
493601,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Suite size was excellent The staff were fabulous very helpful and friendly A very short walk from the train station easy to find Wonderful breakfast
493602,Starhotels Echo, Couldnt try the breakfast on both mornings as I had early meetings before 7 am have breakfast time earlier for those who have early starts or travel, The food was excellent Super nice staff at reception and restaurant 
493603,Starhotels Echo, The rooms are a bit on the smaller side , I rarely give any hotel such a high score but I think this was totally worth it You get exactly what you expect a modern clean functional room next to Centrale Train Station It was a bonus that the food was high quality and catered from Eataly 
493604,Starhotels Echo, Got down to breakfast around 9 30am and it was pretty picked over Pretty poor for a hotel that s quite expensive , The location and convenience to the train station 
493605,Starhotels Echo, Nothing, The concept and feel of the hotel and how it was run was very good We loved the garden atmosphere of the foyer and found ourselves wanting to come back and relax after a big day in a busy city like Milan The staff and management made you feel very welcome We will definately be recommending this hotel to stay in Milan and will stay again Bed was very comfortable Breakfast was great We look forward to visiting more of the Star hotels chain through Europe 
493606,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Booked with proximity to station in mind and was so easy to access Beautifully stylish hotel Comfortable beds in lovely rooms Fabulous oversized sofas in public areas and staff very friendly and super helpful 
493607,Starhotels Echo, Room a bit far from elevator , Bed is v comfy location is right there at Milan Centrale Roomis nicely modern decorated new We upgrade the room to deluxe Type so we got early check in at 11am
493608,Starhotels Echo, Not a sound proof room Can hear everything especially at night time , Excellent location Close to the central train station underground as well as shuttle bus stop to Malpensa and Linate Good design nice room and friendly staff 
493609,Starhotels Echo, THE NIGHT SHIFT MANAGER OR IN CHARGE SHOULD UNDERGO A REFRESHER COURSE ON HOW TO TREAT THEIR GUESTS AND SHOULD BE FAIR TO EVERYBODY EVEN WHEN THE GUESTS ARE NOT CAUCASIANS , THE ROOMS ARE VERY CLEAN AND A LITTLE BIT ROOMY
493610,Starhotels Echo, The staff could not be bothered with customers answering questions seemed to be a very difficult task The fitness room was locked all the time , The room was clean and the breakfast was excellent
493611,Starhotels Echo, There was a big spread in the breakfast but the breakfast was not that good I think that needs to be worked on Even the Panettone was Hard not soft how it used to be Also breakfast should start early by 6 30 am Atleast this is what I think ,No Positive
493612,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Near the station bus taxis Continental breakfast with pastries fruits cheese Mozzarella cold Italian meats and other products No problem to get soja instead of milk Comfortable beds
493613,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Wonderful hotel right next to Centrale station Around 10 min drive to the Fashion District or a 30 min walk Very comfortable great design friendly and helpful stuff Looks much better in life than on photos Good breakfast good coffee Room very clean bed comfortable though pillows could be better they were a bit too flat for my taste Restaurant on site offers great food Overall very good experience very recommendable would return 
493614,Starhotels Echo, Bathroom toiletries not always replaced Could hear noise from underground trains although maybe because we were on first floor, Hotel nicely decorated although area near lifts a lttle dark Room very comfortable and clean Breakfast good Reception staff very helpful good location opposite central station
493615,Starhotels Echo, Awful technical service wasted 1 5 hours with multiple times told my friend promises to have a working kettle , Just 50 meters from Milano Central Railway Station MilanoExpress airport train
493616,Starhotels Echo, More for business travelers as it is conveniently located right nice to the train station To head to Milan shopping will take about 20mins by metro transfer one line , The room is big and spacious and quiet Breakfast has an excellent choice of food Restaurant served good dinner too TC comes with good international channels and stable good wifi signal Friendly English speaking counter staff 
493617,Starhotels Echo, Rooms besides being small are really not well sound proof You can hear from your bed people walking in the hallway Double bed is actually 2 single beds with 2 small bankets , Overall modern look especially at the lobby Nice hotel restaurant 
493618,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast terrible chease or cake selection made in nearest shop No egs What for you need stuff helping with tea or coffee in the morning if the tables are not clean Put coffee and tea maker let people clean breakfest faster , Quality of the hotel is just fine
493619,Starhotels Echo, Prices at the hotel s bar, Location 3 minutes from Central station 10 minutes from city center Quality of the hotel everything is new and clean
493620,Starhotels Echo, Unfortunately they use sprays scent marketing in all public areas including reception bar and breakfast area so that I could not stay anywhere near these areas as I am highly allergic to those sprays Eyes nose mouth swelling coughing rashes and nausea So I do not recommend this hotel for people who are allergic or asthmatic etc , Nice hotel friendly staff comfortable beds good location
493621,Starhotels Echo, Despite asking for a room away from the elevator I was right by the elevator and you could hear it all night Unfortunately the prices has increased by over 500 for one night in February so I wont be able to stay there , Everything was great 
493622,Starhotels Echo, Poor service and coffee at breakfast , Nice room Good location close to railway station we were in transit to Parma Friendly and helpful reception staff 
493623,Starhotels Echo, Check in is a nightmare slow and tricky They will block 20 Euro on your card to guarantee you wont use room s bar for free, Eataly restaurant and breakfast are prettycool 
493624,Starhotels Echo, 1 No hair conditioner among toiletries not once the rest of toiletries were not of the quality to be recommended indeed 2 The towels were not changed on daily basis 3 the shower in the room was not very convenient to get in out and it s very configuration was somewhat tricky the breakfast was poor in selection and definitely not of the highest quality 4 the hotel charged us for the water in the room that was supposed to be complimentary the very process of charging is complicated and puzzling 5 wifi was slow and required registration over and over again, 1 because of the doubled charging prior to check in the hotel staff upgraded our superior double room to a Junior Suite which in fact wasn t much bigger 2 staff reacted on our concerns and tried to do their best to fix little things we approached about 3 the location of the hotel is really good 
493625,Starhotels Echo, For light sleepers I would recommend to ask for a room far away from the elevators as you might hear luggage noises in the morning An extra tip for the manager a nice plant or flower would lift the room to that little bit higher level and make it absolute perfect , I stay in hotels several times per month This hotel is a REAL 4 star hotel super professional friendly personnel you really feel taken care of Beds are of excellent quality a variety of cushions available nice bath room breakfast is very good to Italian standards the breakfast room is a delight to go to in the morning Everything is well furnished with lots of taste and good quality materials Located next to the railway metro station while still being a quiet safe area Ample parking possibilities 
493626,Starhotels Echo, Hotel restaurant was not as special as the hotel , Beautiful comfortable and wonderful hotel service Excellent central location Would stay there again 
493627,Starhotels Echo, Stuff told us it would take 15 20 mins to get our car but it actually take more than an hour to till we re able to getting our car at reception when we check in there is no any recommendations for tourist which is pretty sad for 4 stars hotel, Location
493628,Starhotels Echo, Wifi internet was not very stable in the room, Great location next to central station Very clean and new and reasonably priced We enjoyed our stay there very much 
493629,Starhotels Echo, No, My flight was arrived in the early morning and I was at hotel around 9am The staff said the room is ready and let me check in room rightaway It helps a lot for me and husband to settle down and refreshed before going out for sight seeing Also it located near both train station and Metro which is very convenient I have wonderful experience during the stay and recommend to all type of travelers 
493630,Starhotels Echo, Twice we had to phone down for another bath towel and no base for kettle , The convenience for getting around Milan really nice hotel staff very helpful and friendly
493631,Starhotels Echo, Each time I say the sane 1 Lack of English channels on TV 2 it would be so nice if the receptionists said welcome BACK to a regular guest and the occasional Upgrade , There is nothing you cannot like about this wonderful hotel where I always return to except see below
493632,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast was a bit strange cauliflower Orange juice not fresh and sweetened This is an area to stay if you need to be near the station and this hotel amongst the most attractive in this price bracket we stayed in two but there is little to like in terms of a flavour of Milan without walking for 50 minutes or so , Great location if you need to be close to the station for travel We were meeting family and were politely upgraded to a very pleasant small suite Clean comfortable stylish The barman was very polite welcoming and helpful Opening windows for fresh air always a great bonus Very good did what it said on the tin 
493633,Starhotels Echo, nothing , Loved the decor Comfortable bed Very nice rooms Location good opposite Central station for getting to from airport Only 5 stops on train to Duomo Staff professional as well as very friendly Especially our waiter in the dining room in the evenings Thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
493634,Starhotels Echo, The front desk personnel during our reception offered a different room from that which we had booked presenting silly excuses Despite the fact I selected and paid thru Booking com they claimed that they should offer what it was currently available They consider customers surprise as fair Needless to say I was about to search for another hotel ,No Positive
493635,Starhotels Echo, Room near stair exit a little noisy when someone exited the floor through stairwell but only used occasionally, Convenient location and friendly staff despite how busy they were over long weekend still very helpful and remained smiling
493636,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast poor quality of food could be better for 12 euros Noise of the metro in the rooms Very slow registration Suspicious visitors have to let their identity card at the desk , situation near Centrale Station
493637,Starhotels Echo, The staff was pleasant and eager to please but a little clueless about the city for example Us where is the design museum Them We don t know what the design museum is but it must be near the castello because all the museums are there Us is there an area with small shops and art galleries Them No that would be in other cities They also discouraged us from walking anywhere when in reality things weren t that far When they finally gave us walking directions they were weirdly circuitous , Very stylish clean and comfortable 
493638,Starhotels Echo, The rain makes a lot of noise dopping on the metalic window tablet Needed to put towels to stop the dong dong dong , just accros the station
493639,Starhotels Echo, The reception staff are generally discourteous and provide poor customer service There is an air of them doing you a favour when they do actually get to provide an expected service i e timely and professional reception duties The bar in the main foyer is lovely environment inadequately staffed by a person who at best could be described as miserable , A well appointed hotel in relation to key places of interest Beautifully decorated clean and tidy hotel and the rooms are well maintained comfortable and adequately equipped
493640,Starhotels Echo, Food was nice but not fresh came out freezing in the middle returned and re issued microwaved , Location is awesome for exploring Close proximity to central station and hop on hop off tour bus tour 
493641,Starhotels Echo, Really nothing Maybe rather small rooms but everything was tasteful , Good location very friendly personel nice modern contemporary interiors quiet rooms very good breakfast buffet We liked the free snacks for our two kids family room and the general attention to being a guest One felt very welcome 
493642,Starhotels Echo, Dinners were delicious and staff very helpful and friendly but the included breakfast was a disappointment Coffee wasn t very hot or very good , Really like the decor Very clean and modern Excellent linens and pillows Very comfortable beds 
493643,Starhotels Echo, got room upgrated but with 2 single beds I booked king bed if you gave customer upgrate I suppose the bed should be king bed also checked with them told me no king bed there , the location is perfect 2 3 mins walking from the station the room is clean bed is comfortable
493644,Starhotels Echo, It was all great , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was very clean and modern The snacks provided when we ordered drinks at the bar was a very nice added touch 
493645,Starhotels Echo, The pillows kept going flat through out the night and the light from the clock under the tv is poorly positioned as it glows in your face during the night , Beautiful hotel modern facilities good breakfast and good location
493646,Starhotels Echo, The restaurant and bar The food at breakfast was poor no hard cheese no jam no marmalade Bread was hard Im not fussy but a bit of soft bread and cheese is not a lot to ask for as the hotel isnt cheap Plenty of lettuce tomato and cake Worse was having to chase a waiter to get any coffee or tea as it is not self service and was never offered If youre lucky you may get some at the end of your breakfast The bar staff in the evening ignored us for 10 minutes despite the bar being open and no customers they made eye contact several times but carried on setting up for breakfast Eventually we left the hotel and went to a bar around the corner where we had wonderful service , Room was clean comfortable and quiet The reception staff were particularly helpful at check in and helped with making reservations at restaurants and general questions couldnt fault them The location opposite central station was perfect Hop on hop off bus 5 min walk Cathedral 4 stops on metro The hotel itself was lovely if you dont eat or drink there 
493647,Starhotels Echo, Throughout the whole hotel there is a slight humming noise whenever a train passes probably the underground train Whoever isn t so noise sensitive it s fine , Changing the room because it was too noisy was incredibly swift and friendly The beds were fabulous lovely cotton sheets and perfect mattress Also the bathroom was spotless and modern Great to have tea and coffee facilities in the room The staff was very friendly and non obtrusive 
493648,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, I liked the room I was staying in it was very clean and the bed was comfy Most importantly the hotel is just literally a 2min walk to central station which was great as we had to take the train often for day trips around Italy 
493649,Starhotels Echo, Two superior rooms at the same price one was great the second one the size of a postage stamp If you had a cup of coffee in the bathroom while you were shaving or whatever the only place to set it down was on the soap dish That small , clean efficient uber friendly staff 
493650,Starhotels Echo, The wifi in temperamental , Location is very good Staff are Good and helpful Breakfast is good and restaurant staff are very good The hotel is very clean
493651,Starhotels Echo, Nothing , Staff were very helpful They allowed us to extend our check out and the whole experience was very hassle free This hotel is in a great location and great value for money Breakfast was good quality We liked our stay at the hptel so much we stayed again after we returned to Milan from Lake Como 10 out of 10 
493652,Starhotels Echo, Nothing, As we intended travelling to Lake Como by train after our stay was good being close proximity to the central railway station Also easy to get to Milan Central by train 4 stops to the Duomo 
493653,Starhotels Echo, One of the lights in my room flickered when turned on the bathroom door didn t lock properly and the cleaning team didn t leave any tissues or paper towels in the bathroom after cleaning the room Just little niggles but if improved would mean a great room for the price , Bed was excellent bathroom facilities were lovely and the breakfast buffet was very nice Location was perfect ideally located next to Milan Centrale station 
493654,Starhotels Echo, First room offered had 2 double beds but this was quickly changed to one double and one twin which was great and more suitable for brother and sister sharing If we stayed again would double check this in advance Area straight outside the station not great especially if like us you struggle to find the hotel Tried hard not to stand out as looking lost and vulnerable , Helpful staff good breakfast Close to station Clean quiet and very comfortable beds Great shower and adjoining rooms for families with children 
493655,Starhotels Echo, Having to leave , Everything was exactly as expected but that little bit better which was a bonus Our room was very quiet which surprised us considering the busy location 
493656,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, We enjoyed the Eco focus of the hotel The interior design is very pleasant The location close to the train station makes it very convenient to catch the Metro to get around the city And finally when it was time to return to Rome the hotel porter wheeled our rather heavy bags over to the station Great service 
493657,Starhotels Echo, Very little However single bed in room for 3 was unmade and we had to ask for night staff to come and provide bedding , Smart Hotel swish Very pleasant outside space Staff were all polite and helpful Good selection of food for breakfast 
493658,Starhotels Echo, There was no vegan choices for breakfast and we felt that that was a waste of money Other than that all good , The location and helpfulness of the staff was great 
493659,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Location location location Only 5 mins walk form Milan central station Room is pretty small but the facilities are fairly good Plenty of choices for breakfast pastry cheese fruits etc In a nutshell a good choice for travelers at a reasonable price 
493660,Starhotels Echo, The doors can be shut very loudly We woke up many times by that sound from the corridor , We visited four hotels in our italian tour all had four stars but this was the only one I can accept as a four star hotel Everithing was perfect the room the services the restaurant the hotel staff 
493661,Starhotels Echo, I ordered room service and I wasn t overly impressed by the quality based on the price but it did arrive very quickly , Great location and I loved the eco element to the hotel there were info cards in every room describing how they d used recycled wall paper energy saving lights etc

493664,Starhotels Echo, The shower did not stay on temperature but fluctuated from way too cold to way too hot not a little fluctuation but enough to jump out several times The room was very small , The location is convenient right near Milan s central station I also liked the style of the hotel and the bed was great 
493665,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Location is very convenient as there was transport nearby such as the trains or the metro The staff at breakfast were polite and very helpful and the reception gave us directions to places 
493666,Starhotels Echo, As one might expect from being next to a central station the immediate area isn t the nicest place to walk around but the Metro stations are immediately nearby and get you everywhere you need to go , Beautifully designed super modern hotel Standard room was spacious huge bed decent bathroom all facilities you would expect from a big name hotel 
493667,Starhotels Echo, Nothing negative Would recommend it to anyone , Nice location exactly at the opposite of central station Friendly and helpfull staff Clean room and nice atmosphere Breakfast was perfect And late check out 12 00 noon Super hotel 
493668,Starhotels Echo, Restaurant had a limited menu and was very pricey although they also recommended some local restaurants which were better quality and less expensive, Very clean hotel located just across the square from the central train station it could not have been in a more convenient location for getting to and from the hotel when arriving at Milan Centrale station

493682,Starhotels Echo, The receptionist called roger was extremely rude and didn t want me to leave the hotel upon check out and I was going to miss my flight coz he didn t have a credit card registered on my brothers room who was still checking out the next day so I told him that my brother isn t leaving and you can take his credit card when he wakes up since it was 5am when I was leaving and he still insisted and called my brother at 5am and woke him up and told him you have to come down right now to give ur credits card and he was so rude to my brother although my brothers room was booked through booking using a credit card for security against any extra charges , fair value for money
493683,Starhotels Echo, Less space in bathroom tiny shower also damaged a bit , Very close to center nice breakfast very clean room incl balcony with awesome view perfect staff fitness room
493684,Starhotels Echo, Although there was valet parking for a fee we would have liked to have street parking available , Having breakfast included was a plus There was a wide variety of food for all As we were using the Metro to get around the city the hotel was in a very good location

493688,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast could be much better While the puree options for yoghurt were very good the cappuccino was awful and juices tasted artificially sweetened Moreover the pastries were not flaky or warm I highly recommend going to for breakfast at Marchesi or Cova instead , The bed was perfect and the interior design was exceptional and exceedingly comfortable I loved the built in chairs on either side of the desk 
493689,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Excellent hotel with great restaurant We also tried the happy hour very good wine and snacks Staff were super friendly and helpful and we were given an upgrade for our wedding anniversary It was conveniently located next to the central station and just a 15 20 minutes walk to the old city center

493695,Starhotels Echo, Not so friendly staff Its seem overly and robotic trainee The answer you in an very antagonist form I stay in this hotel in 2012 with a very positive impression enough to came back , Modern facilities very close to the main train station in Milan 
493696,Starhotels Echo, I left my handbag in the room after checking out and only realised it after reaching my overseas destination 1 day later Contacted the hotel and give detailed information on the bag They said that it was not found even though I have insisted that I am sure it was there Not happy at all as it was an expensive handbag and they should have ensured all left items in the room got returned to hotel guests , good location very near the train station 
493697,Starhotels Echo, First day when I was there I stayed in room no 309 then air condition and electricity in my room can not be used and when I told the operator they told me in your have 20 degree celsius already and we will fix it tomorrow , Great location

493700,Starhotels Echo, everything is up to the good standard it would be good though if the restaurant at breafast is slightly more happier about their role , perfect strategic location cost effective in terms of getting to from the airport I am their loyal customer and would certainly be back
493701,Starhotels Echo, The Ac made a Fluttering sound all through out which was disturbing The area around the hotel did not feel safe at all Lots of Bums loitering around keeping an eye for tourists Just the vibe of the place was creepy , Breakfast was pretty Lavish for a european country 
493702,Starhotels Echo, There was nothing that we could fault , The hotel s restaurant was excellent and very good value Our bed was the most comfortable of all the beds that we had come across on our Italian holiday The staff were all very efficient and friendly at reception in the restaurant at breakfast and in the rooms It was very impressive and although we were on a leisure trip we could see that their business and conference facilities were very well organised 5 minutes walk from Central Station 
493703,Starhotels Echo, the staff is very unfriendly with the exception of the people in charge of helping with our lugagges the breakfast was poor and the staff in charge very rude we will never come back to this hotel , the only good thing about this hotel is the location it is close to the central train station
493704,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, We ve been here several times before and the staff are always welcoming The location is very convient for getting around the city and the price is very reasonable 
493705,Starhotels Echo, Staying on the second floor meant we could hear the metro grumbling beneath us Otherwise nothing we didn t like , Close to train stations brand new so very state of the art facilities
493706,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast was not 4star quality Disappointed with no ordinary tea bags had to ask twice plus no milk Rooms are small Staff at front desk not very friendly ,No Positive
493707,Starhotels Echo, need to train up service level to non English speaking customer , just the basic needs you need for biz travel Centrally located 5 minutes walk from Milan Centrale station Superb convenient Conceigere was helpful to bring our luggages to shuttle bus stop to Melpansa airport which was unexpected 
493708,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Location was perfect for us and the reception staff very helpful Ordered room service one evening was very good and fast and no more expensive than going to a restaurant 
493709,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast selection was smaller than those at larger Starhotels where we ve stayed , The location is a very easy walk from Milano Centrale train station The staff was very attentive and eager to help us and the front desk sells single use metro tickets The room though small was very clean and quiet Stops for all three metro lines are within two blocks 
493710,Starhotels Echo, Expensive parking and mini bar, Very close to central station which gives you complete access to Milan had a joined family suite do our kids had there own room which was lovely
493711,Starhotels Echo, It is just info not opinion Due to close proximity of the railway station you find some not so shiny and happy people on the street It did not bother me at all but some people might be more sensitive , Staff was extremely helpful and friendly I have arranged for a surprise gift for my wife and it was perfectly arranged The hotel is a very short distance to Central station For 1 5 Eur you can be anywhere in Milan in 10 15 minutes Hotel was clean furniture and everything is fairly new I was pleasantly surprised that everything functioned well In some hotels in Italy it is not granted even with four stars The city food drinks were the usual high Italian standard but be ready for high prices 
493712,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, The best stay we have ever had on a holiday The room was fantastic the staff was great and the food was delicious We could not have asked for a better stay in Milan We will definately choose Starhotel again 
493713,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Firstly the hotel is within easy walking distance from the combined Centrale Railway Station and Metro station which was very convenient The staff all were lovely friendly and helpful and breakfast was excellent 
493714,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Location is amazing if you are planning to travel to other locations as you are across from the Milan central station This is also where the airport bus stand is Great restaurants nearby and waking dustance from Bunoes Aires shopping street Very safe
493715,Starhotels Echo, It s quite a walk from the centre the bathroom was very cramped and the gym did not have enough equipment for a hotel this size one treadmill one bike and one stepper , It is convenient being close to the main station the room itself was a good size and the included breakfast was value for money with a wide range of products 
493716,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, great location from the train station as we were leaving via train the next morning despite prior information found this location quite safe greeted warmly by porter as soon as we entered the hotel room small but pristine wonderful array of breakfast food wonderful only negative was policy re getting an iron and ironing board we were told we had to return same within an hour of use found this strange but understand that we are not in the US when hotels usualay provide this in the rooms overall a great stay after an overnight from the us porter even offered to take our luggage to the train station the next morning 5 out of 5 rating would stronglyou recommend this hotel to felow travelers 
493717,Starhotels Echo, Bed wasn t very comfortable A little noisey you were woken by the banging of doors and no air con so it was very warm at night, The hotel is very chilled atmosphere right across the road from train lovely food and rooms
493718,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, the Hotel is very nice you do have to remember where your room is but that makes it more interesting everyone was very pleasant and helpful the room was excellent Food was good breakfast a Little sparse but adequate

493721,Starhotels Echo, Despite joining the star hotel membership the discount was not accorded to us with the reason that we had booked and paid upfront In future do not pay upfront ironically , Proximity to main train station without compromise to the comfort level of hotel Would gladly stay there again and have done done so 
493722,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Loved the Nature emphasis of the hotel Awareness of food allergies very helpful Calm rooms All textures and surfaces beautiful with a fresh natural approach Very helpful staff 
493723,Starhotels Echo, nothing, Walking distance to Milano Cetrale and therefore easy access to Metro Piazza del Duomo can be reached after few stations Good restaurants in the neighbourhood of the hotel Nice very clean and modern rooms Good wi fi connection limited to two devices Breakfast is basic but adequate We would certainly book this hotel again 
493724,Starhotels Echo, Its not hotels fault but the room was very expensive as it was design week and quite small for 2 people even though they said they had upgraded us For that money I would have expected a bigger room and perhaps the teas coffee milk to be refreshed,No Positive
493725,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, The hotel was clean and breakfast was perfect The staff were friendly and helpful It was a short walk from the metro train station which made traveling into the city via metro 4 stops on same line and arriving to from the airport very easy 
493726,Starhotels Echo, Heater wasn t working too well, Good breakfast buffet and it s very near the central Fs station making it very convenient to visit the places in Milan Comfortable hotel with modern design 
493727,Starhotels Echo, We were only there one night , This was possibly the best hotel meal we have had The carpaccio of swordfish with the fabulous fresh asparagus was stunning The Osso Buco with sage polenta was so tasty and the semifreddo magnificent Sadly I can t transfer photos on this PC 
493728,Starhotels Echo, Ironing board would have been handy to have Television choice very poor in English you can only watch news and financial reviews as if bussiness travelers don t like to disconnect Wifi restricted to 2 divises , Very close to Central Station which was perfect for us to do some day trips out of Milan 
493729,Starhotels Echo, Can t request for early breakfast Limited choice of snacks available before the restaurant is opened for breakfast , Close to Milan Central Station Friendly staff Clean room and bathroom 
493730,Starhotels Echo, Hmm let me guess there s nothing , Breakfast spread was wow Very professional staff and well trained in treating guests Rooms were high quality Right in front of Milano Centrale Railway station and metro station makes it very comfortable to move around Italy It s a great find for us We will certainly come again to this hotel when we come to Milan next 
493731,Starhotels Echo, Check in and check out too slow need a separate concierge desk I was in a rush and waited 25 mins to check out as 1 check out counter was occupied with concierge functions and 1 counter was processing checkouts at prime time This was very frustrating and made a good stay a poor experience It wasn t good enough We also had a coffee order in the restaurant forgotten that also isn t good enough , Comfortable accommodation
493732,Starhotels Echo, The bathroom s door is from glass The breakfast is the same everyday The rooms are not soundproofed so you can hear everything happens in the rooms around you and the hall way , The location is very great 
493733,Starhotels Echo, Bed could have been more comfortable , Great location 1 minute from train station supermarkets restaurants Very good price Great interior and designs Environmentally friendly and green 
493734,Starhotels Echo, The location is perfect for a quick trip given how close it is to the station but if I were in Milan longer I d probably prefer another part of town , Very central location clean ridiculously good shower good breakfast 
493735,Starhotels Echo, Even for a room service of bottle of water they block it in credit card which is for me abnormal For room service or restaurant they should settle it during check out , The location is very good and just walking distance from Milano Centrale 
493736,Starhotels Echo, Those staffs They should treat everybody the same way , I asked for a room with balcony on the booking and they really gave me one Also love the big clean washroom 
493737,Starhotels Echo, You have to pay extra for tastier breakfast menu items Breakfast package given for early departures was just terrible One would be better off having breakfast at McDonalds not far from the hotel or elsewhere It was not possible to sit straight on our toilet seat a wall segment blocked my knees Quite odd , Staff was friendly and the hotel is quite modern Very convenient when flying to Bergamo since the airport shuttle stop is a short walk from the hotel 
493738,Starhotels Echo, Whilst it was in a great location for the central train station it was a good half hour walk into the centre but the trams and underground are very accessible from the hotel so it didn t matter We just walked everywhere , Rooms were very comfortable and nicely appointed Loved the extra touch that we could order a pillow to suit our needs soft firm etc Hotel was clean lovely fresh smell is piped into the foyer Quite a funky vibe to it which we liked Staff were amazingly efficient Lovely bar area and the restaurant looked excellent although we only had breakfast there 
493739,Starhotels Echo, Wifi not great ordered chicken curry in bar after a late arrival on Friday had to send it back because it was cold came out again still not hot but was charged the full amount , beds really comfortable spotless large modern bedroom and bathroom Really convenient for train station Good selection for breakfast 
493740,Starhotels Echo, It felt like the hotel was originally designed with a lot of effort but taken over and run with lower quality Small details the internet was really slow for extra money you could get real internet as the included one is OK for webmail as indicated by the rules the mirror in the bath was lose the bathrooms toilets in the common area restaurant were left not cleaned stinky and the door to some rooms could not be closed the breakfast was the worst we have seen since long The personnel could not tell us if shops would be open on Sunday The personnel was not capable of telling us where to find nice areas in Milano, The room was friendly the lights were nicely set 
493741,Starhotels Echo, Terrible room on second night Tiny and couldn t move within bathroom One set of bathrobe slippers etc No consistency in the size of rooms and set up , Good bath products and clean Breakfast was good
493742,Starhotels Echo, The receptionist lady was rather indefereny Not a good way of welcoming visitors She seemed to have attitude not a good impression a little smile would help, We liked the location and the restaurant and the service especially the bar reception very friendly 
493743,Starhotels Echo, The charges for weekdays are rather high for March much more reasonable for the weekend guess it is so for Milan Sometimes the queue at reception can be long maybe because of the popularity but ok at some other time too , The location is perfect less than 5 min walk from the side of the Central Train station subway At night the lights are bright all the way and we felt safe walking The interior design is nice from the lobby to the room nice and stylish modern ambience The rooms are clean new and efficient very well design and looks like what they show in the website Comfortable beds with pillow menu There were tea coffee making sets electric kettle not coffee maker Wifi works ok but they allow only 2 devices per room or you pay extra Bathrooms are spacious and well supplied with amenities also with bidet our rooms have a small balcony Reception staffs are efficient and helpful The doormen are very friendly and quick to service We left the luggage with them and came back for another night after a trip to another city this made it very convenient Breakfast is good with egg plus continental plenty of fruits In all we had a pleasant stay and will come back here if the trip requires taking trains to from Milan We appreciate the attempt to be an environmental conscious hotel 
493744,Starhotels Echo, can t think of anything , Excellent value for money Great room beautiful use of materials modern and clean nice bathroom great breakfast with free fruits and all possibility to leave your luggage after check out free of charge It s close to the station where you can take a bus taxi or a rent a bike It s a 30 minute walk to downtown Milano 
493745,Starhotels Echo, This hotel was like the Italian equivalent of a travel lodge with a price tag of 210 Euros per night midweek Smallest bedrooms and bathrooms I ve ever stayed in Can t swing a cat in the bathroom and I m not a big girl at size 8 hate for someone bigger to move around in there I would not stay again , Great location across the road from the train station in Milan 
493746,Starhotels Echo, Only downside of the hotel was that the room had a little space It was 3 of us and we were a bit tight Otherwise everything was perfect very clean , Location is great right next to the central station Very comfortable hotel great restaurant and bar and breakfast 
493747,Starhotels Echo, Lack of smoked ham prosciutto in the breakfast Insonorization of the rooms could be improved , Lobby deco Location is really good if you travel by train not so close to the old center Variety of free tea and cappuccino in the room Would definitely come back if we return to Milan 
493748,Starhotels Echo, Shower water sometimes hot and sometimes cold, Close to central station and friendly helpful staff We received free upgrade to a bigger room with station view because it is our honeymoon
493749,Starhotels Echo, Computers and printers for guests, The design of the hotel is excellent The staff mostly helpful not everyone Perfect location facing Milano Centrale Clean
493750,Starhotels Echo, You can t use the espresso bar to order simply a coffee if you meet in the lounge like lobby but need to actually get seated in the breakfast area which is not too meeting friendly noisy , Very attentive staff great central location to go to airports tube express trains 
493751,Starhotels Echo, They don t change the towels every day Also the sheets The breakfast is not that much and when I order omelet They charge me extra , Large space of rooms I get connected rooms 
493752,Starhotels Echo, Access immediately outside could be improved too few lifts particularly when one was out of order resulting in long waits at peak times, Great location for central station and airport transfers well equipped and beautifully clean room excellent breakfast with gluten free options
493753,Starhotels Echo, The bar was pricy but it s quite usual in every hotel , Everything was fine Very nice staff I really appreciated that they provided us with a city map without asking The location is perfect If you arrive by train this hotel is the best choice Easy to find 2 min to the railway station but you don t hear a sound at all 10 min to Duomo by underground We just arrived dropped down the lagguages and we headed straight away to the centre Comfy bed clean bath free WIFI nice design breakfast is also OK quick check in and out really good value for the money 
493754,Starhotels Echo, Expensive restaurant even by Milano scale WiFi a bit slow , Great modern interior style new furniture and equipment fantastic lobby great location near the railway terminal highly professional staff tasty and diverse breakfasts 
493755,Starhotels Echo, There s room for improvement when it comes to the sheets and the linen There was nearly no room for the wardrobe , The hotel is right next to the main station the room was clean and we even had a balcony Great breakfast with fresh fruits continental breakfast goodies and a good selection of sweets The kettle in the room was nice 
493756,Starhotels Echo, The scrambled egg at breakfast was watery and tasteless , Eco friendly modern hotel in a very convenient location Our elder kids aged 12 and 14 thought it was very cool The reception staff were helpful on arrival and recommended a great restaurant for dinner Will definitely book again when we come to Milan 
493757,Starhotels Echo, Nice decor and new hotel Many art works dispayed inside and outside hotel Excellent , Breakfast though not with much variety it covered egg beacon fruits vegetable cerael in general ok Pillow too soft need to be filled with bog towel for comfoet Bed hardness very comfortable Bathroom size reasonably large for tourist hotel Nice and new decor very contempory to modern standard Will recommend to friends for this budget 
493758,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, It will always be our Milan hotel We love the location the public areas atmosphere and design the lovely breakfast and the most comfortable bed and the cosy modern room We will come again Thank you 
493759,Starhotels Echo, You can hear the metro under the hotel rooms are tiny and breakfast was the worst i have seen in a long time the had boiled carrots for breakfast ,No Positive
493760,Starhotels Echo, The hotel room doors are very noisy when being shut not good in the morning Also the smell of cigarette smoke was a surprise didn t think people could smoke in their rooms anymore , The hotel is very close to the central station good for airport transfer and the metro Reception staff were very helpful and spoke brilliant English although I d have liked more opportunity to practice my Italian 
493761,Starhotels Echo, Nothing except there was only one lift working for our two day stay , Locality cleanliness and very helpful staff In Milan would not stay anywhere else 
493762,Starhotels Echo, Buffet breakfast could be better, The gentleman at the reception when I checked in was extremely kind n pleasant Breakfast though could be improved in terms of variety 
493763,Starhotels Echo, The breakfast was very good The coffee was slightly disappointing Each morning my jug americano coffee was weak and rather tepid Only a small gripe though , Convenient location just across the square from Milan Central station Well designed and comfortable bedroom Beautiful illuminated garden mural in the restaurant We ate in the restaurant on one evening and the meal was one of the best we d had on our Milan holiday Polite and helpful staff 
493764,Starhotels Echo, As a Muslim we couldn t find any salty thing to eat at breakfast Only croissants and Bacon sausages even we needed to ask for some boiled egg which came while we were finished Too poor breakfast for a this kind of hotel , The Hotel is clean and near Central Station
493765,Starhotels Echo, There was nothing I didn t like about the hotel , The hotel was top quality the staff were excellent friendly and helpful the breakfast was fantastic and the location was perfect for us I would definitely recommend it and will go again myself 
493766,Starhotels Echo, They took 30 euros as a deposit in case if you break something I think nowadays hotels rarely do it Also the TV remote didn t work and the water boiler had a broken cover , Comfortable clean hotel Also quiet Location is good close to the railway station and also 30 min walking to downtown Metro is also nearby Breakfast is fine room looked very pretty In the bathroom they had hairdryer shampoos soaps 3 towels per each person bathrobe slippers 
493767,Starhotels Echo, Staff at breakfast was very slow the coffee cappuccino was always cold For the price we found that it was strange to charge quite a lot for fresh orange juice and eggs We were asked if we wanted a smoking room or not and when we said yes we no ashtray in the room small detail as it may have been a misunderstanding , Really nice hotel with an amazing location which is very close to metro and train station The bedroom is small but more than enough for a city trip weekend The bathroom was really nice and design Staff was polite breakfast buffet was satisfying
493768,Starhotels Echo, The location next to the station makes the surroundings ugly There are few options for a nice dinner at night on the region but the hotel offers a good restaurant Everything was fine , Located near the train station This is great for anyone who will spend a few days and drive away as well as for those who like to be close to the subway The hotel is very new clean and comfortable 
493769,Starhotels Echo, The fact that we chose to stay near a strain station No fault of the hotel its just that hotels near train stations anywhere in the world are generally a bad idea , The best value for money near Milan Central We were using Milan as a base for day train trips out and this fits perfectly 
493770,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, I needed to rest and was moved to a super quiet room where I was not bothered by cleaning crew etc The room was very comfortable and had a full sized bath tub Beautiful design throughout the hotel 
493771,Starhotels Echo, It was noisy We just came from another hotel in Paris where we could not hear the traffic outside our door Here not only we heard people talking in the corridors at all hours of the night but also the noise of the elevator it felt like an airplane was taking off , Very nice room
493772,Starhotels Echo, A couple of the reception employees did not seem very cherry or helpful The contemporary decor is attractive though sparse and a little cold , Contemporary eco friendly hotel across the street from the main train station in Milan and 3 metro stops away from the center of town Excellent breakfast helpful manager 
493773,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, The hotel is conviently located across from the centrale termini rail station All of the staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast in the Eataly restaurant was delicious The decor in the lobby and restaurant areas is unique and provides a relaxing and soothing space to sit 
493774,Starhotels Echo, NOTHING , All of the above 10 Not overdone but in our opinion it is just right with clean modern design and a beautiful ground level view toward an old restored piece of Milan architecture next door The staff was very professional courteous and engaging Our Italian is a bit rusty but the staff would allow us to us it as far as our skills held out The location of the ECHO hotel was absolutely perfect for our needs right next to Milano Centrale rail station and the Centrale Metro stop It is perfect for getting to anywhere in Milan or to any city in Italy 
493775,Starhotels Echo, A bit of a walk to the city center , Nice modern hotel Room were well appointed and small but efficient Very comfortable Most of the staff was very pleasant except for the gentlemen checking us in A bit curt Great breakfast 
493776,Starhotels Echo, Iron use only 30mins Should make it complimentary as any other hotels No bathrobe Bed should be made as double and not twin beds to be joined as double bed More variety of English channels Breakfast menu so so could be improved , Cosy room Nice fragrant as you entered the hotel Warm welcome by staffs Friendly and hospitable staffs Comfortable bed and pillow menu Accessibility to train station good location 
493777,Starhotels Echo, Nothing to complane , Everything was perfect Early check in was my birthday so they gave me free upgrade bar was excelent restaurant was realy good Good options of wine 
493778,Starhotels Echo, 1 Because the hotel is located near the central train station there are many homeless people and beggars but we weren t worried about walking in this area in the late hours 2 We stayed for 4 nights and the food for breakfast was always the same without changes but all was fresh and tasty 3 For 3 days the towels weren t changed but I m more than sure that if we had asked they would have changed them immediately 4 I m a native Russian speaker and speak Hebrew fluently but there is not even one TV channel in Russian or in Hebrew and there are only a few channels in English , 1 Good geographic location 2 There are several groceries within walking distance one of them inside the Central Train Station but I preferred to buy in Pam on 2 Via Nicola Piccinni 3 Good breakfast 4 The personnel were very friendly polite and ready to help with issues related to hotel maintenance and personal questions 5 Very clean and there is very nice smell in the hotel 6 Fancy and modern look of the room The room size is acceptable for two people but the bathroom is big and very comfortable 
493779,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Perfect location if you want to be close to the railway station or airport buses Hotel and facility s perfect for a short stay Modern tasteful decoration
493780,Starhotels Echo, Just add free bottle of water if you put teapot in the room I do not want to drink tap water , 3 minutes walk from Centrale Very modern and clean Quiet rooms Good breakfast Restaurant is good and with reasonable prices It was nice to have teapot in the room 
493781,Starhotels Echo, The wash basin in the bathroom started blocking and the water came up from the sink surprisingly the staff were not apologetic it was like okay we ll send someone in it was very inconvenient The breakfast was average , The location was great the room was nice and clean
493782,Starhotels Echo, We weren t informed that there would be an additional tourist tax until the moment we were going to pay And they charged us twice on the credit card and made it a really difficult process to get the money back that they owed Overall the stay was pretty comfortable but the consequences of their mistakes make us never want to go back there again We requested a king bed but got two separate beds at first had to ask them to change after the first night Bathroom lock was faulty Though their pastry selection was quite good breakfast buffet turned out to be disappointing esp as vegetarians as the meat and vegetables were presented in the same containers , Location was great really close to the central station and corsa buenos aires and easy transport to tourist areas Free internet was a plus 
493783,Starhotels Echo, Breakfast was good but not great At night you could feel the vibration from the metro passing below the hotel That said it must be pointed out that this may be felt in many places in Milano and did not prevent us from having a good night sleep Please note that there is a city tax amounting to 5 euros per person for each night which is not included in the price , As soon as we entered the hotel we were welcomed by a wonderful flower smell The room was remarkably clean The bed was very very comfortable The Peruvian bartender whose name we never learned was very friendly helpful and eager to provide information about the sights and nightlife of Milano and Como lake 
493784,Starhotels Echo, Poor sevice definetly not 4 star qualtity issues with restaurtant 2 evenings in a row very poor service very poor attitude , Location good size rooms good breakfast
493785,Starhotels Echo, Can t think about something , The poeple at the reception were so nice always willing to answer me and my friend s questions on the best side The location of the hotel is the closest we could ever imagine to the central station 
493786,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is first class It has quality right through from the breakfast to the superb room The staff were excellent helpful always available and friendly The bed was enormous and comfortable Superb 
493787,Starhotels Echo, Rooms were quit compact , Location is good for the station but a little out of town Nice bar and restaraunt area with comfy chairs Nice rooms albeit a little small 
493788,Starhotels Echo, Narrow parking space in front of the hotel when arriving by car , We stayed family room which has 2 rooms with stylish furniture Staffs were very friendly to kids 
493789,Starhotels Echo, Drinks were expensive at the the bar , The room size was excellent for a hotel in an Italian capital City Great breakfast If you are coming into Milan via the Central train station you couldn t wish for a better location Metro is within easy reach Great shopping for the likes of Zara H M etc within walking distance from the hotel 
493790,Starhotels Echo, Staff at check in counter are rather busy so might not have much time to answer your queries , Location is perfect just next to the train station Hotel is new and modern 
493791,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, The hotel is new it s beautifully decorated and the room we stayed in was very comfortable We also liked the close proximity of the hotel to the Milano centrale train station The breakfast was very decent 
493792,Starhotels Echo, They upgraded my second stay Yay But the lovely big bathtub I had on my first stay was now a very fancy shower I was looking forward to that nice soak but they meant well , As a first time Milan visitor I took the shuttle to Central station It was a great relief to find the hotel was right beside the station and I just had to walk across the station to get to it 
493793,Starhotels Echo, Late checkin Difficult communication with housekeeping We have four people and two rooms but there was only ONE bathrobe and ONE pair of slippers in each room , Location Five min walk to Central Station even with lugagge Nice breakfast 
493794,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, What a beautiful and comfortable stay we had Hotel in general and our room were very tastefully decorated pleasing to the eye Comfortable bed fabulous shower lovely toiletries and towels And the breakfast was delicious many great choices from continental to American Tasty cappuccini which I miss terribly Location was very convenient for getting around Milan to Expo and around Italy I loved the fact that this is a green hotel And most importantly the staff was very pleasant and helpful 
493795,Starhotels Echo, Limited Wi Fi for only 2 devices per room , Excellent location in the meaning of transportation Just few steps from Central station same side with taxi stand Near restaurants and bars Clean and comfort Nice staff 
493796,Starhotels Echo,No Negative, beside excellent interior design we want to express a great compliment for the attentive staff outstanding performance even during peak hours of breakfast buffet always professionally quick precise in service and always clean and well equipped buffet 
493797,Starhotels Echo, Restaurant waitstaff weren t as friendly and accommodating as front desk staff Took 10 minutes to get hot milk for my coffee 3 different mornings Strange position of toilet next to shower wall have to sit at an angle A bit pricey , Welcoming and helpful front desk staff and bellmen Upgraded to junior suite without asking No extra charge Comfortable beds Upscale modern decor in earth tones Eco friendly Breakfast buffet has large selection 
493798,Starhotels Echo, The breakfast had not enough variety , The theme of the hotel that it is green And the location of it being just across the street from the central station
493799,Starhotels Echo, Terrible value for money Definitely not worth paying 440 a night for a so called Suite Breakfast not up to the standard I expected the quality was similar to that of Premier Inn in the UK , Conveniently located to the train station 
493800,Starhotels Echo, Hmm I sometimes need special menu cause I stayed long time But taste and quality was great , The best is kindness of staffs breakfast Location is nice too 
493801,Starhotels Echo, Some of the breakfast workers seemed overworked and short on manners , Plentiful breakfast and a welcoming front desk staff A safe convenient location arriving by train from Malpensa and for further train travel from Milan That said a bit far afield from the city center
