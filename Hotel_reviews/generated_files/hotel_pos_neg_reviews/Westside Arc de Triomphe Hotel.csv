162877,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Bathroom looked tired and was in need of a re fresh Grout was dirty Towels were thin cheap Fridge in room did not work Skip the 14Euro Breakfast and head to one of the many local bakeries for your morning meal and coffee , Good location with easy access to several Metro stations Nice neighborhood with good selection of restaurants and bakeries within easy walking distance Good value for money Room was clean and bed was comfortable Air Conditioning worked well Friendly staff 
162878,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Doesn t have a GYM and when I need to swim they have change a water and I don t know why they didn t change the water before they are opening and there is a small rooms, It s close from a lot of thing as like shopping transportations etc
162879,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Nothing , Very helpful staff and good location in relation to city center Just far enough away to not have the noise and bustle of the center but close enough to walk to it Good wifi Nice breakfast buffet Great bathroom although bedroom a bit small if you are like me close to 2 meters but not a real issue 
162880,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, My fianc and I are not big people I would say average and It was very small for the money But it is Paris and real estate is very expensive so it s understandable Just beware , It was nice but very small 
162881,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, our room was the escape for the floor the air conditioning never really cooled down the room the view was to other buildings around a center courtyard or something not a city view , price was right 
162882,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Room view was depressing Right on other buildings A dog was barking each evening from a neighbor building Very small shower , Friendly receptionist Clean hotel Supermarket close Little eateries as well 
162883,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The worst room I ve ever had in Paris Dirty Tiles in bathroom were falling off bugs in the tub water damage on the ceiling and outside our room Dirty walls Absolutely gross and overpriced The staff was rude and downright mean I would never stay here again and advise everyone to steer clear of this tourist trap I come to Paris multiple times a year there are so many wonderful hotels for the same price point where the staff is actually lovely and helpful AVOID AT ALL COSTS Do not eat the breakfast Just gross all around , NOTHING
162884,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Iron was useless spend an extra 10 Euro for a model with steam The hangers in the closet were broken The layout of the room especially the washroom was challenging A bit of creative thought into design of the room layout would improve things quite a bit , Front desk staff were friendly and helpful 
162885,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Downside of the topfloor was the high temperatures in the room as the sun burned the roof The airco could not keep up Must say the temperature was almost record high in Paris , Comfortable beds French queen size so not the biggest We had a room on the top floor with a big terrasse 
162886,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, This hotel was perfect for our quick trip to Paris Convenient to navigate from by either walking the Metro or hop on hop off bus tour We didn t use the restaurant as it is so convenient to many sidewalk eateries and pubs For the price this is a great deal 
162887,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, It s not alt all the reality of the image shown st booking com Room are horrible dirty the location is very bad for vacation very far of Arc de Triomphe all shopping It s not the ideal hotel to book for holiday Wifi not good too, Only staff Only staff
162888,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, You couldn t open the window to get any fresh air it was screwed shut The view onto the back of the building behind was ordinary but we weren t in the room during the day The lift was supposed to hold 4 adults 2 adults fitted fine with luggage it was a struggle 2 people in the lift with luggage and no one else could get in, The location was good it was about a 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe Lots of little places to eat around The breakfast was cheaper than eating out but still expensive for what it was 
162889,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, Great location just 10 min walk from Arc de Triumphe Staff are very nicely especially young girl on reception Whatever we needed they were on disposal Hotel very clean 
162890,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The shower is somewhat cramped , This is a fantastic location It is an easy walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Charles de Gaulle Metro RER station The neighborhood is very quiet and safe The hotel is very comfortable and the staff is very helpful The pool is a nice touch after a long hot day 
162891,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The space quite clostraphobic and lack of parking at affordable price , The staff were very helpful and the macaroons left on the bed were a nice suprise 
162892,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The breakfast was expensive 14 euros for each of us My husband had a croissant and tea and I only had coffee still 28 euros the sauna is very bad shape many boards loose probally should be closed until repaired The lift elevator was right next to our room I booked three months in advance I asked for a room not facing the street and got one facing the street next to the elevator There is a nice bakery and many other breakfast choices within one block so don t eat there They did give us but one bottle of water stayed there three night with weather in 90 when I asked for a bottle more money charged Never gave us additional soaps or shampoo s, The front desk staff was nice and they spoke English which was kind as we know very little French 
162893,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, Very clean Very professional staff A 10 mn walk from the Arc de Triomphe and a 6 mn away from the direct bus to Monparnasse and the Direct bus to the CDG the conditioning is very good as well Thank you
162894,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The rooms are very small and badly isolated from each other so you ca hear from all your neighboring rooms I had the luxury room and supposedly the largest and on the top floor Still I could hear the toilet flush from other rooms as if somebody flush the toilet next to my bed Breakfast was very average given its price , The hotel is very centrally located 
162895,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Rooms not too sound proof Shower from next room quite noisy , The property was in an excellent location Breakfast very good Walking distance to Arc de Triomphe easy access to other sights 
162896,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, It takes about 15 minutes to Porte Malliot where the Air France express bus drops you off from CDG The nearby Metro stations Argentine and Perriere are also a 10 15 minute walk away Therefore budget for it , Staff is very cooperative and speaks English which is very helpful in a city like Paris They are eager to help if you have questions about where to go look up Google maps etc WiFi in the hotel works well we got good high speed connections most of the time 
162897,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The pool was amazing The location is the cutest little spot nestled in Paris You wouldn t even know its there and its perfect The breakfast was amazing 
162898,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The cooling in the room was never fixed so it was a bit too warm sometimes , Great pool friendly staff rooms were cleaned every day Food locations and metros were close by 
162899,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The hot chocolate in the buffet tastes cheap and should be made out of proper milk and chocolate Otherwise there is nothing negative the best hotel I have stayed at in Paris , I loved the stay and the service and location would come back 
162900,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The view out of my room s window was the only negative point it was just narrow space surrounded by buildings all around, hotel location is like 10 minutes walk from metro station and 15 minutes from Arc de Triomphe with nearby grocery pharmacy asian food restaurant boulangerie vegetables and flowers market Rooms are small but neat and clean and with a powerful shower
162901,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The bathtub was abit small i m 6 3 so i guess all are and you could not open the glass window wich prevents water splashing out if you shower making it abit tricky getting in and out of Regarding the breakfast i think they could add a hot meal or two and it would be perfect There is not a big sign so you cannot spot it from a disctance yes it is a petty thing but there really wasnt any major issues with this hotel so , Really nice and helpful staff everything was neat and clean The room itself was very nice with an extra door that you could close to shut the noise out from the corridor toilet if your partner had to go at night There was also this iron curtain outside your windows that you could close security felt safe though There are also some slippers and two robes if you are planning on going to the spa or sauna Never got the chance to tryout the spa facility but it looked really nice and inviting and they got a computer that you can borrow free of charge mac wich for me was abit tricky Lots of lighting comfy bed with four pillows and one cover big enough for two You get an umbrella to borrow if need be wich i needed at the time And if you got an early flight it is super easy and close to Porte Maillot takes perhaps 10 min normal walking pace The breakfast was nice but nothing over the top will get you going though The hotel is located on a sidestreet away from the worst noise and you got restaurants just around the corner The whole experience from when you walked inside until you left was very pleasant and i would not hesitate to go there again 
162902,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The Hotel was very old and not painted well The bathroom was smaller than the airplane , One of the worst 4 stars Hotel I have ever visited I have arrived at 9 o clock and the reception they told to go for a walk till 13 30 which ist anacceptale the hotel has no real lobby
162903,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The location was very good The metro station is approx 450m away and the bus stop is only 100m away from the hotel We used the both Metro N 3 and Bus No 92 It was so convenient that we could buy the 10 pcs of tickets for EUR 14 50 Carnet for Metro Bus Train at Tabaco Shop around the corner 50m from hotel and Bus Stop is also approx 100m away We were upgraded to the 8th floor top floor and the view over the Paris city was great Considering that it s in Paris the room was not too small and it had a balcony Breakfast was also fine and coffee was very good The personal at the reception were very friendly and welcoming and we will of course stay here when we visit Paris again 
162904,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Nothing, Our room Room 801 was very spacious for Paris standards and had a double length balcony that overlooked the roofs of Paris From one end of the balcony we had a view of the Eiffel Tower and from the other side a few of the Sacre Couer
162905,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Receptionist not at the front area during night shifts Might be a precedence for thievery as anyone can go in and out without employees guard visible, Cleanliness
162906,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent hotel facilities were second to none and the hotel was near the arc de triomphe but was in a quiet neighbourhood The hotel was excellent value for money and the staff couldn t be anymore accommodating I would definitely return in the future
162907,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Slightly further from the main hub than we thought but Metro nearby was easy to use when we chose not to walk , Great room well equipped with fridge and kettle Spa was lovely after long days of sightseeing Staff very helpful Highly recommended 
162908,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Bathroom and toilet are small but spotlessly clean and modern , A great location in the centre of Paris 5 mins walk to Metro and about 10mins walk to Arc de Triomphe Great shower and plenty of hot water Very friendly and helpful staff multi lingual Good wifi internet service Nice lounge on the ground floor with Apple Mac printer complimentary newspapers and magazines There is a small swimming pool in the basement
162909,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, We checked in to Westside on the 6th evening The lady who checked us in was professional and courteous The lady in the morning every day was also very professional and courteous But there was a gentleman we dealt with in the evening every time who was eternally grumpy and seemed to react like we were an interruption to what he was doing The Hotel rooms were very small for a 4 star hotel and not what we expected The breakfast was one table with bread and croissants and few other knick knacks You would definitely expect more from a 4 Star hotel On our second day we ordered room service and I ordered Lentil Soup Lebanese Platter and French Fries We waited for more than 90 minutes and after multiple follow ups I got Lentil Soup a plate of cheese and no French fries I did not have dinner that night Apparently this hotel does not have Room Service in house They just order from a nearby restaurant and so there is a lot lost in translation My Sister s family who were staying with us could not get water delivered either Overall it was a very disappointing stay especially after travelling through Italy Switzerland and getting some amazing service from similar sized and similar category hotels As mentioned the plus points were the location and the friendly lady receptionists who were professional and courteous The remaining staff were quite unfriendly and we felt quite unwelcome including the ladies at the breakfast who were very curt I provide this feedback as a constructive feedback so the hotel can view the service from the perspective of the recipient of such services and look at ways to enhance the same , The location of the hotel was the only bright spot in our stay The lady manning the reception during the mornings was very professional and very friendly Also the second lady we met during our stay whose name eludes me was quite friendly too 
162910,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The room was tiny and not clean It was more like a 2 stars hotel with a pool I did not use the pool They take a copy of credit card which is pretty stupid in the sense of security and not secure for the guest They give a login and password for the WiFi but WiFi does not require any password When I called them about it they suggest me to reset my computer They do not have a twin bed in the room but they brought two 1 person beds together and this was extremely uncomfortable 
162911,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and willing to help Especially the gentleman at the night shift Maddy Besides that the room was very clean and the location of the hotel was very near to the center Finally I can say that it was a very positive experience 
162912,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The room was very basic but all the amenities were great Room was very clean shower was great bed was comfy TV was good and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout the trip We only used it as a base as we were out all day and night so it was great value for money Would recommend to others
162913,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Nothing, Didn t have breakfast or coffee so couldn t comment there Great location staff were very friendly and accommodating Very positive good paris experience
162914,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The whole hotel had an awful smell when you walked in The mini lobby smells like vinegar The old carpets smell bad and our room smelled like puke mixed with baby wipe products The bed was supposed to be for 2 people But I think they measure them for midgets not normal average humans The washroom was so tight when you sit on the toilet you face a wall and your knees touch it The rooms are so tight to each other that you hear everything Including the 2 hour sex sessions of your neighbours We also woke up to a fire alarm And people who close their doors next to us wake us up since the walls were paper thin and super close to one another Definetly not a 4 star hotel But If you have no other choice in terms of money the area is safe because it s all rich families and old people , The only thing that I liked from the hotel was the fact that they gave us a free water bottle in the room 
162915,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Perhaps a little more milk coffee and tea in room would be appreciated , Rooftop room with balcony wonderful views of beautiful Paris very pleased with accommodation Thank you 
162916,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, No negatives really bigger lift , Excellent welcome Manny was a credit to the hotel beds were great and comfy rooms v clean Would recommend and use again 
162917,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, If I was being really picky I would say the bathroom is incredibly small If you are tall using the toilet is a work of art , The staff were fantastic always happy to help The location was very central close to the Arc de Triomphe and in a nice area The hotel was very clean and the bed really comfortable Enjoyed the breakfast it had a good selection of food both hot and cold And although the classic double room was quite small my friend and I each had one it had everything needed and was perfect for one person I would happily return to this hotel Very reasonably priced
162918,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, There was no hot water for the first 2 days having travelled for a long time a cold shower is completely unacceptable Our first room had a big crack in the wall and flaking paint above the shower which was cold and leaked I had to ask to move rooms to be fair the second room was much better In need of some TCL the stairs were in need of decoration there was plaster missing on the walls on every flight of stairs and the carpets were very worn Lift wasn t great had to lug 2 cases down 4 flights of stairs after waiting 20 minutes without stopping ,No Positive
162919,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, No hot water for our stay Came on a romantic holiday to a 4 stay hotel Really unimpressed I tally offered a croissant as compensation Eventually offered 20 off the bill ,No Positive
162920,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, We were told the Metro was closer it was definitely more than 250 yrds The bed was uncomfortable as I woke with a sore back each morning which lasted the duration of the following day Staff were as friendly as could be but their English wasn t great and directions to places were hard to understand , Location was good very near the Arc de Triomhe There is a beautiful Patisserie very close to the hotel up beside the chapel which we had breakfast in each morning eat here Metro was about an 8 10 minute quick walk and had access to many places 
162921,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Small pokey room with no view out of the window other than a dark area for the fire escape We could barely see the sunlight on a bright sunny day as we realised when e left the hotel Walls were damaged by water next to the air conditioning unit Very small room for the price ,No Positive
162922,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, I was on the top floor and difficult to access with luggage as stairs stopped at 7 , Location great walking distance to arc de thromphe lots of places to eat drink and shop locally Hotel staff very helpful Rooms spacious for Paris and very clean with comfortable bed

162929,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Very uncomfortable rooms we were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor that was pathetic there was no lift to the eight floor we were expected to carry 4 suitcases up a flight of stairs requested another room and was given one on the second floor this was much better than the upgraded room but this was never cleaned properly no towels replaced and trays from room services never collected definitely not recommend if you travelling with children , Location was good
162930,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The rooms were clean at check in but the daily cleaning was very bad My coffee cup was left on the table for about 2 days and rubbish were not taken away , Great location

162934,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, the room is a shoebox the moment our luggage was inside we could hardly access the bed the shower is half open as it is so tiny guess to give the impression of space so the whole bathroom is wet, not much

162936,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Really quite disappointed with the room compact was an understatement The toilet and bathroom extractor fans were not working There wasn t a mirror on the wall in the bedroom so that you could dry your hair apply your makeup whilst the bathroom was being used On reflection I should have asked to be shown an alternative room , The staff were very friendly and helpful
162937,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Fair price for a good hotel , good location with lots of options for bars and restaurants Close to exhibition centre Budget accommodation and real value for money Would select it again

162941,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, nothing, Staff is EXCEPTIONAL especially at the front desk extremely friendly and helpful I would stay there again just to have that kind of service 
162942,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Phone ringer was the loudest I have ever heard That needs to be taken care of as soon as possible AC was little loud when it kicked in once every couple of minutes Also the distance to the metro station , The front desk staff are among the very best I had the pleasure of dealing with Fell in love with the neighborhood as it is mostly residential and is not far from the action

162947,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Furnishings in room could have been modernised and perhaps an ironing board and iron would have been handy but neither of these things were important , Staff were friendly and helpful Room very clean and comfortable Fridge in room was useful 
162948,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Breakfast Over priced and pretty ghastly to be honest We asked for a refund after first morning as it was not fresh and there was no variety Clearly this is the norm for food to be delivered to the hotel in the morning and there not to be a kitchen on site but for 14eu I d be looking elsewhere However this was a minor detail given the plus points of this hotel , Staff were amazing Friendly and accommodating Location was perfect for a central Parisian stay Quiet and well appointed hotel that we would visit again

162957,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The only thing I would say is that when we arrived there was complimentary tea and coffee also a bottle of water When we had finished the water we asked for it to be replaced along with some more milk they wanted to charge us 3 euros for a small bottle of water , The breakfast was good value The helpfulness of the staff The place was very clean with complimentary tea n coffee Apart from my report on the water I feel that the hotel is in a good position and definitely would recommend to anyone

162959,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, I only went to the Pool room once but there were towels all over the floors and chairs Maybe add a sign that tells guests where to put their towels when they are done swimming Or maybe a staff member can check the swim room every two hours , The service was really excellent The staff was incredibly helpful and comforting considering that I was traveling alone and it was my first time in Paris I really loved the decor of the hotel and the location Room 801 has a really amazing balcony that allows you to watch the beauty of Paris at all hours of the day You can even see the tip of the Eiffel Tower

162972,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, No hot water after the Marathon and then no water at all for almost 24 hrs We were in room 802 for the first 4 nights Elevator went up to the 7th floor max so we had to take the stairs from the 7th to the 8th floor The bed in room 802 was not good at all as we wike up with back pain daily When we changed to room 106 on the 5th and last night due to the elevator being out of order we slept like babies The bed was amazingly confortable We felt we were ripped off for the first 4 nights , Mahdi the receptionist Very helpful and nice guy 
162973,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Unfortunately whilst staying at the hotel the hotel experienced a flood and as such we had to reallocate to another room which was of a lesser standard small and crampt This also meant the lift was out of order the next day The hotel could benefit from soundproofing as the walls were quite thin, Fantastic friendly and helpful staff who exceeded in all expectations Lovely added bonus of a pool and sauna facility
162974,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Our room 106 was at the back of the hotel with it s window above the back exit On Sunday morning there was a steady stream of people going in and out with the back door banging all the while Not a great way to wake up on Marathon morning , Good Clean room with pleasant staff The location was great and the sauna and pool were a nice addition for our stay
162975,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, They opened breakfast extra early so we could all eat ahead of the marathon They kept us supplied with bottled water throughout the pool after the race made the next day so much less painful really lovely people and great value will be back next year for sure

162981,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The only downside was no English tea provided in the room that s just personal preference and probably could ve been rectified if we had contacted reception and some of the fixtures and fittings seemed to be loose not in a dangerous or depressing way mind , The welcome was perfect and the room just how we wanted it The swimming pool is on the small size but perfectly adequate for the size of the hotel Overall we loved the hotel and it s location We would strongly recommend it to couples families and professionals alike 
162982,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, If it wasn t considered a 4 hotel I wouldn t write perhaps the following points rooms very tiny nothing to say about the bathroom decrepit facilities although the lobby seems quite fresh quite poor breakfast rooms not soundproof from neighboring ones not able to prepare the breakfast to go even if asked a day in advance So I would rather consider it a good 3 hotel but then pay attention at the price And I know it s Paris and that s the case with most of the hotels but that should not be an excuse for ranking it properly , A quite area yet close to the Arc de Triomphe

162986,Westside Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Lots of noise at night coming from the interior courtyard but nothing too bad , Location location location this is what best describes this hotel Easy to access there is a direct bus line to the Tour Eiffel 5 stops and the Arque de Triomphe 2 stops with the Avenue of Champs d Elysee being at only a short walk from the hotel Rooms are of a decent size for Paris quite clean and we ve had a good breakfast There s also a pool which we didn t get to try but looked spectacular
