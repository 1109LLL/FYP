103241,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail,No Negative, Staff very welcoming Supplied us with a UK plug adaptor as we had forgotten ours Breakfast very good lots of choice Location also great Very nice area of Paris to stay for young couple Lots of restaurants around and 2 metro very close by Vavin and Raspail 
103242,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Rooms are small even by Parisian standards AC didn t work the first night in 94 degree weather We were all drenched in sweat and didn t sleep my colleagues and I had 4 rooms in total More frustratingly the staff tried to insist to us that the AC was working appropriately and even when we showed them it wasn t they were pretty unhelpful There were at least 10 people trying to explain it to them that none of the AC was working throughout the hotel We finally demanded to move into a different room with working AC which they finally did but rather begrudgingly , Good location
103243,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, air condition broke with 100 degree weather Made no attempt to bring fans and when asked said they ran out Made no attempt to compensate When asked about changing hotels at 2pm when the a c still wasn t working they wanted to charge for that night as well Rooms are shoe box size shower is difficult to fit in , Location was good staff was friendly
103244,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The room was a little small but we hardly spent any time in the hotel and therefore not an issue , Easy to get from the airport to the hotel 55 fixed rate approximatly 40mins traffic dependant The hotel was very pretty and ideal for our needs We had never stayed with Mercure before and had no idea what to expect we were however delighted with what we got and the value for money was excellent Walking distance from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower was not far picturesque easy and very pleasent with lots of little bars and restuarants to stop in the walk was around 45mins slow walk and the approximate cost of a taxi was 15 however we went when it was 31 degress and wanted to enjoy the weather only getting taxis in the evening We did not eat here but did use the bar prices reasonable service good Overall we were very happy with this hotel the room facilities staff and location 
103245,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The website we got off at Gare Parnesse which the hotel website said it was close to and it was actually closer to another less well known Metro stop which meant a longer walk with luggage Getting a double bed when we booked a twin , The staff were helpful 
103246,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The WiFi wasn t great connection coming and going which was very annoying since it was a work trip There was a smell of smoke through the ventilation in the room at night like cigarettes The room was very small for a 4 star hotel Breakfast for 17 that s the reason I never had breakfast in the hotel , Friendly staff some of them speaking 3 languages and all of them were able to speak English 
103247,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Website description close to Vavin metro station would have been more helpful than citing its closeness to Paris Montparnesse we walked with 30kg of luggage from Paris Montparnesse whereas otherwise we would have bought metro tickets to Vavin or paid for a taxi it was 13 Euro for the return trip from the hotel to Paris Montaparnesse the next morning Mostly what we didn t like was that we booked to stay here for two nights Friday Sunday but only ended up staying for one Sunday because the hotel was expecting us Saturday and Sunday not what our Booking com reservation said and was booked out on arrival so we ended up staying in a different Mercure Bercy rather later than expected and having to get up earlier for an early morning trip to Rennes We had to share a double bed instead of having a twin room because the Mercure Bercy had only one room left , The hotel took responsibility for getting our booking wrong it had overbooked and tried its best to put us in a similar situation to that we would have been in had it got the booking right It paid for transfers to and from a different hotel of similar quality rather than leaving us to find alternative accommodation ourselves 
103248,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, I wish there was someway for those of us who comeback again to receive some sort of a benefit perhaps a free breakfast one morning or a price reduction for a stay , I have stayed here over five times I love the location the room with the balcony and the staff is so very nice I hope to come again 
103249,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Room was small Need more counter space for two people and their luggage , Very easy to get to from RER line B coming into Paris metros and close enough to Gare Montparnasse Staff helpful Around the corner from those historical cafes and creperies 
103250,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The breakfast prices were ridiculously expensive We used a local bakery and saved a lot of money Breakfast is 17 00 pp per day Local crossiants were 2, Very modern and very clean The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble The reception staff helped us with our map to get to different locations and also advised us which form of transportation to use The location was perfect We had easy access to the RER metro and bus 
103251,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, to have internet 2E hour otherwise very poor and stop every 5mn impossible to stop in car to take off the luggage we have to find a public parking not too far and come back to carrying our luggage laundry loose some clothe, location
103252,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The shower screen was a bit small and there was a slight leak so the bathroom floor got quite wet when we used the shower The room service menu has a very limited selection We would have liked to order something like a sandwich when we arrived but it was not available The breakfast area was a little small when everyone was trying to serve themselves at the buffet On our last day we noticed that one man had to take his breakfast out to the bar area as there was no space in the breakfast room , The staff were very friendly and responded very positively to our attempts to speak French The selection of foods on the breakfast buffet was generally excellent and kept being replenished by the staff throughout breakfast time The croissants were lovely The location is good and there were several metro stations and bus stops within easy walking distance so no need for a car There was also a great selection of restaurants locally we were a bit spoilt for choice 
103253,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Nothing , Fantastic room upgrade Nice touch with the free drinks in the fridge and the robe and slippers Proximity to metro and the montparnasse area was excellent Extremely clean Great shower 
103254,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The room was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate , Good location Friendly helpful staff Clean comfortable room with juliette balcony Good breakfast Fridge in room 
103255,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Internet logs you off after every 6 hours and speed is only fair Room is on the small side It s ok if you are a solo traveller but a couple might find it too small Shower water keeps leaking onto the bathroom floor poor design , Location is excellent 2 minute walk to Vavin metro or a 5 min walk to Raspail metro Hotel is very clean 
103256,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The lack of descent toiletries in the bathroom and the empty mini bar were the disappointing points of our stay , An excellent place for a passage from Paris or even a weekend in the heart of Montparnasse Very clean with friendly staff and a more than descent breakfast
103257,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Showers are somewhat Small I m not a big person but I struggled with the shower in my room Also given that we booked this last year disappointed that we didn t get a room as requested i e a quiet room not on the main road , Helpfulness of the reception staff and the quality of the breakfast buffet 
103258,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, In the shower room access to the towels could be lower if your short it s a stretch or can t reach at all , Breakfast was varied for choice scrambled eggs perfect Lovely warm croissants unlimited 
103259,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The key cards got demagnetized often but there was always a staff member to assist us , The location was excellent near metro stations The staff was very helpfull and friendly Very clean 
103260,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Room space Although space was constricted for the locality in Paris this is considered normal , Cleanliness locality available features in the room like fridge 
103261,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, One of the receptionist who encouraged us to take hotels cab to Orly airport which he claimed was much cheaper than the regular cabs We ended up paying 50 euros whereas we the amount we paid on our arrival to the regular can to take us to the hotel was 26 euros Very much disappointed as he lied We also paid 7 euros for a bottle of water at the hotel Terrible , Cleaniness
103262,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The only gripe was at breakfast No sign to say that you had to boil your own eggs nor timings of boiling in their machine , Helpful and very reassuring Nothing was too much trouble We were there the weekend of the recent attacks and they put on extra security 
103263,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The bathroom is extremelly small The hotel maybe is not 4 stars because it does not have the size and facilities Only breakfast available Very bad TV channels , It was very convenient The location was great Plenty of restaurants around The metro station is very close The attention from the staff was great 
103264,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Rooms are slightly small but they all tend to be in Paris , Really nice modern clean hotel Staff were great and very accommodating Location 45 seconds walk to Vavin metro station
103265,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, The room was really small although the bath was ok , Very convenient location 2 from Vavin Metro station and 5 from Raspail station The room was shiny and had a front view of Montparnasse Tower 
103266,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, While free the wifi was very inconsistant sometimes even in the lobby The rooms are small but servicable If an American sized shower is important you may need to explore another option, We loved the location and the staff was very eager to help There are many restaurants and patisseries close by The Metro is less than a block away 
103267,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Small room Very expensive breakfast Quite expensive for the small rooms, Very good location Two metro stations very close to the hotel Renovated rooms with nice design Very nice and safe heighborhood with many cafe restaurants Wifi free with good speeds Luggage service
103268,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, One minor disadvantage was quiet short bed I think it is 1 80 in length , Hotel was very good Location great 40 minutes walking to Eifel tower 15 minutes by No 6 tube tube is 5 minutes walking from hotel 25 minutes walking to Notre Dame de Paris or 15 minutes with tube No 4 tube is outside hotel on crossroad Breakfast was very delicious French style Clean quiet hotel Lots of places to eat near hotel 
103269,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail,No Negative, Small but clean and functional rooms in a great location Great links to metro and rail making all parts of Paris accessible Breakfast was good but perhaps hard to compete with all the local food options close by Overall I would certainly reccomend this hotel 
103270,Mercure Paris Montparnasse Raspail, Room was very small with two large travel suitcases it required moving cases around each day There was barely enough floor space to open a case on the floor You get what you pay for but if you re travelling with someone ensure you upgrade or be prepared for some minor fuss , Excellent staff clean rooms quality finishings Great location close to historic bistros
