483451,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Nothing, Beautiful hotel with excellent and helpful staff Breakfast was good self service so you can eat as much or as little as you like Served on the 8th floor nice view Rooms are excellent and plenty storage space This was my favourite hotel in my little stay in Italy Good public transport in Milan and this hotel is only a short walk to the Yellow Line Metro Underground 
483452,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The building is not soundproof and we could hear all our neighbors Was unable to check in until 2 30 PM and had to wait for more than one hour The view was not good we could only see some apartment buildings nearby from the 4th floor, Room was spacious Breakfast was nice Hotel is close to two metro stations and you can quickly get to the City Center using the metro system
483453,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The bed was quite comfy but it was actually 2 beds made in one huge one so it was a hole in a middle And the smell of chemicals in the room when we first got in was really strong , The room was actually bigger than I booked it had a kitchen But no plates or pots which made it unuseful But everything else was good it was clean the towels were changed every day The breakfast was really awesome I add one extra point for an out of charge printer in the hall where we printed our tickets To sum up it s a nice place It s located pretty far away from the certer but metro station is really close so for us it wasn t a problem And Lidl store is close by which was good 
483454,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, It is undeniable that the hotel is built on one of the major arteries leading to the largest A E dept and Hospital in Milan the number of ambulances and sirens during day and night may affect the customers opinion of this hotel , 1 The helpfulness of reception staff and their determination to help 2 The ample accommodation 3 The position of the hotel within easy reach of public transport 
483455,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, old and scratched bath missing any equipment in kitchen glass knife etc poor breakfast in 4 hotel, spacy room balcony very large bed
483456,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, It was cold in the room and we asked them to turn the heat more but they just give us a blanket The bed is formed by two beds that move when you sleep When I made the booking I specified to be a king size bed and it was confirmed but when I got there the said they don t have room like that , Good hotel relatively near a metro station It was clean
483457,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Check in time took an hour and a half I was given a room where the beds were still unmade and towels were lying on the floor Didn t clean the room after the previous people moved out, Breakfast was good
483458,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Filthy room as a whole Breakfast not included when should have been Very disappointed for a 4 star No balcony furniture Nothing to cook with in kitchen, Shower
483459,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, There is kitchen with stove microwave oven sink but 0 cutlery crockery , The hotel is easy to reach by Metro The area is quiet The room bathroom are spacious you get a large terrace and there is a gym on the 9th floor should you have surplus calories to burn after a busy day in town The views from the restaurant 8th floor and from the gym are pretty impressive There are two supermarkets very close 
483460,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, I cant t recommed this hotel becauce the air conditioning was turned off in the middle of the night so it was so hot there in the room We thought at first it was broken but it wasn t They just said now it s working and it did work cause they didn t turn it off anymore But it was old it didn t cool the air enough We felt like in prison and like they woudn t appreciate at all your stayin at a hotel Moreover there were dozens of tiny little ants especially in the bathroom but they moved across the room The bathtub was just awful it needed to replase to new one The bath s faucets were so old that you needed to shower lots of water there were one for warm and one for cold water We almost pulled the stiring in the bathroom only in case of emergency The furniture needs to updating I wanted to get an axe and redecorate the room This hotel is only a three star hotel not four The price was too much for this room , The staff was friendly and they gave us plates and cups electric kettle and pots so if you want to make food you need to ask kitchen utensill yourself The bed was nice big enough and mattress was comfortable so it was ok to sleep when the air conditioning was working We had big balcon but it would have been nice to have there also chairs The room was clean Good location near metro Wifi functioned well 
483461,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, During my whole stay Air conditioning which was centrally controlled was switched off at midnight I reported this fact to staff and they reassured me that problem will be fixed but the issue was not resolved I think it would nice if management can provide tea and coffee facilities in the rooms Customers will really appreciate this small but very important facility , Excellent location and good size clean rooms Good value for money Looking forward to visit again in future 
483462,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Paid 4 star prices for what felt like a 3 star business hotel Breakfast was basic and the hotel was lacking facilities you would expect of a 4 star hotel Its also in a pretty dead part of town , Large clean room albeit very dated look Convenient for Milan city centre but not really walkable plenty of public transport nearby though 
483463,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Nothing , Bed is very comfortable room is big with kitchen fridge freezer We rented studio room Wifi is good you also can gond free parking around 
483464,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Room space is not as big as described Air conditioning is a disaster very noisy and not cooling at all just fell like sleep on the train with quite aloud skirr Only two bottles of distill water are provided for the first day stay no fill up anymore for the following days at all which is not 4 star hotel should do No kettle no tea no coffee are provided they even charge for borrowing forks and spoons I have never seen such a 4 star hotel Location is not good on very busy road even have traffic jam at 9pm not easy to go the city centre Have to book Taxi with reception taxi arrives in 7 10 minutes but the drivers asked extra money for booking and coming to pick you up , Staff was kind and helpful although they always show a cold face Room is very quiet and clean bed is comfortable internet is fast 
483465,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda,No Negative, Super nice staff Claudio was especially helpful and very friendly He lead us to a great restaurant near by We will definitely be staying here again next time 
483466,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Location a bit down town and a bit of a walk in the hot sun to the underground Toilet flush jammed on last morning there , Beautiful luxurious hotel suite with excellent facilities Delicious breakfast 
483467,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Quite far out of city centre but the metro stop was nearby so getting about was easy enough and the tram stop was beside the metro for a more scenic trip into town A bar for a night cap would have been nice , Spacious room free water and good breakfast 
483468,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The breakfast is a little bit disappointing In the kitchen there re no dishes for cooking , The hotel is good Nearby metro only 3 station aprx 10 minutes to Garibaldi Very large clean room The bathroom was also OK We had a kitchen in our room 
483469,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, There is a paid private parking 10 to 15 mins drive from city center on car , one bed apartment was great at the price paid nice washroom shower bed were comfortable ac was cool Room had a big balcony which was nice Staff was helpful Location was good Carrefoure shopping center was very close on car 
483470,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Of course there s allways place for better I liked everything , Excellent hotel Large modern and tooled room Large balcony aprox 9 10 sq m Excellent bathroom Many sockets and lights bulbs Tooled Kitchen Excellent bed and mattresses Hotel maid changed the towels and sheets and cleaned the room every single day Friendly staff Permanent lobby wire Internet desktop Wireless in room 
483471,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The fruit juices at the breakfast too sweet artificial Small and super irrelevant detail in an otherwise completely fine hotel , Appartment rooms with kitchen living room type of space and windows which open to a balcony made this a perfect place to stay Exellent and friendly staff Plus incredibly affordable 6 stars for value for money No this is not the most tastefully done boutique hotel But to me it ticked all boxes space to work good bed windows which can open clean quiet completely comfortable 
483472,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Location No pins in the room only in the bathroom I have ordered two beds room the beds are not separated it s like one bed , Internet connection 
483473,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, D coration of the room is a bit old compared to the outside of the hotel but it s a matter of taste Regarding breakfast I didn t really like the ham and salami quality seemed not the best, Very nice stay room is spacious and clean staff is very nice and helpful Breakfast was very good
483474,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Wonder how this hotel motel is more closer got 4 stars as hotel level Everything reminds africa youthhostel , I need to pay more for parking lot even booking com says parking is free Per day 13 eur Room bathroom was dirty old and breakfast was really bad Even low price I would tn book again And you can hear all sounds from next room 
483475,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Bed was a bit hard and the AC was so loud I had to turn it off at bedtime Breakfast was just ok , Great service very friendly staff The rooms were big and airy Very close to the Metro and tram stops 
483476,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Kitchen in the room could have done with a kettle and a mug Microwaving my teabags was not a great cup of tea , Quite a spacious room and easy temperature controls Bathroom also excellent facilities and standard 
483477,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, There were some hair in the bathroom floor when we entered and some more in the bathtub The ceiling cover in the bathroom needs imrovement but it wasn t very disturbing The rooms do not offer soundproof and the plumbing could be noisy when someone was in there and on our departure morning early around 6 o clock in the morning for about an hour there was a lot of noise underneath our balcony probably from suppliers Some more napkins on the breakfast table would be nice , The breakfast buffet was great the beds and pillows are comfortable the room and closets were bigger than we expected the internet service wifi efficient and fast We enjoyed the gym as it was well equipped and the view from the 9th floor fantastic The reception desc was very helpful especially upon arrival 
483478,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, It is not a hotel but an apartment with reception No amenities in the room such as electric kettle cups tea coffee sachets luggage rack safe bath slippers robe etc Only 2 pillows Dated Property Some of the staff are not at all courteous Not much options in the breakfast Small kitchenette but without any dishes utensils etc No in room service or restaurant on property Far from the City Centre Duomo ,No Positive
483479,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The bed was so hard it hurt mine and the wifes back Me and the wife ended up sleeping on the sofa which was a lot more comfortable The lack of a restaurant ment we had no tea as we were delayed and had no time to stop on route , The staff were friendly and the room and hotel were very clean 
483480,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda,No Negative, Great location 5 mins walk to metro station that reached central Milan within 20 mins Lovely room great size comfortable room nicely decorated loved the breakfast loved the bakery and Italian restaurant across the road Would book this hotel again 
483481,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Needs renovation badly evrth is obsolete and feels aged and dirty so you don t even want to touch , The rooms are big and with large balconies the location is convenient
483482,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Very low water pressure for the shower uncomfortable bed and the staff was less than pleasant Stayed on the 8th floor and heard the use of the treadmill throughout the day , The room was clean with the exception of much dust accumulated on the bathroom ceiling The room was a large size and large size balcony Had a good gym facility 
483483,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, When I checked in I was expecting some mail to be delivered at the hotel and I had even called the hotel prior to my arrival to make sure they would put it aside for me They ended up returning the first letters that arrived before my check in date and so I was missing work documents for my trip It wasn t the end of the world but did annoy me a little bit since I had previously called to make sure this wouldn t happen , Close to a metro station so very easy to get around Also the metro station is only 10 15 mins away from the city center The staff was nice and friendly very helpful They informed me of this very good typical Italian restaurant right across the street from the hotel where you could eat well at a good price I ended up going there every night it was delicious 
483484,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Ability to see or be seen via key hole in case of rooms that are connected with shared doors Unable to fully switch btw shower and tab in bath tub, personnel cleanness
483485,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, we get connecting door room and that s dirtubing due to no soundproof, nice hotel and close to 2 metro stations we meet one particularly staff who could talk our language
483486,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Far from sentral location or other public attraction like the Expo so we have to spend more money for transportation It s very expensive for using taxi so just use train or bus but you have to walk to reach the station , Pretty good for the price great wifi clean comfortable room and helpfull staff Mainly because of the price 
483487,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Almost all personnel is black people and for underground parking they ask for 30 Euros day If you don t agree then you must park in the street Not mentioned in the offer and we especially asked for free parking , Big apartment with big balcony with many facilities as a space for cooking freezer and big fridge fantastic bed and quite location 
483488,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, I didn t like the location as it is quite a distance from the city centre if you don t have a car The station is not a far walk but one has to catch a train to city centre , Only one night here this is a super hotel and is excellent value for money lovely spacious room lovely decor and great breakfast with excellent cappuccino
483489,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Bathroom was dirty never cleaned properly Breakfast the same every day for the 5 days we were there Some staff rather rude Air conditioner didn t work properly reported but not repaired Lots of mosquitos Paid internet didn t work on one side of bedroom Weak TV satellite signal , Bath towels were a good size although a bit hard Checking out procedure was quick and efficient 
483490,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, from outside the building looks ugly a bit old fashioned hotel inside but definitely offers a great value for money , Very quiet very clean public transportation is close wide rooms some of them with a big balcony good breakfast with a significant choice the bill was ready in the morning for a fast check out
483491,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, The surrounding seems to be a little bit dangerous at night , The staff help us a lot by keeping our luggages for more than 10 days during our trip to the south

483493,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, Bad smell of towels and room toilet was rusty bad location no extra pillow pillows are very low and our neck injured in 21st century and in this hotel uou have to pay for internet it is an old hotel, View room was big
483494,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, AC was not working properly and was making lot of noise location is bit awkward and far from metro station essentials like water etc were very costly , Bed and room size
483495,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, WiFi was a joke Not just it looks terribly wrong to charge separately but once you pay for it doesn t work , Superior room was very spacious and well presented 
483496,Atahotel Contessa Jolanda, 6 euro for 1 day for Wi Fi Are we living in 2015 The quality of a 6 euro Wi Fi is awful couldn t check my email for 15 minutes When after a day long walk we came to the hotel and asked for a cup of tea we were sent to the vending machine Was it really difficult to organize this kind of service Air conditioning system system stopped working at 1 A M It was truly disappointing that it happened the night before our check out and flight home we really wanted to relax and wake up rested , Really comfortable bed Spacious room Good enough breakfast
