137449,Hotel Le Squara, First day no hot water and the lady on reception could only say it would get hot in an hour I had a full day I didn t want to wait around Quite a small room for the money , Very central and easy to get around 
137450,Hotel Le Squara, That they took the money for my stay upfront and that I then had to pay again for the water used and get another invoice not professional and annoying as the do have the facilities to block the credit card Short sighted and unprofessional , Location and friendly easy going staff all very caring 
137451,Hotel Le Squara, The hotel says it has parking however the car park is not linked to the hotel and is about a 5 minute walk away It s about 23 euros to park your car there overnight so if you are thinking of driving to and leaving your car there it could end up being quite costly There is on street parking but maximum stay is 2 hours and costs 4 80 euros It is free to park from 20 00 to 09 00 overnight on street parking If you are looking for somewhere quiet then be warned there are bars below and it is very lively at night we were on the top floor and although not extremely noisy you can hear people cars outside this didn t bother us as we were so tired after such a long day anyway If you have a lot of hair bring your own hair dryer as the one s provided aren t the most powerful usual hotel travel dryers , The rooms were well decorated and the lady on reception in the day time was very friendly and helpful and was knowledgeable about the area The hotel is compact but charming the rooms a comfortable size we stayed in a double deluxe with a nice size bathroom the room was clean and cozy and had the usual shampoo soap shower gel towels etc included Nice big windows also to let in light well air conditioned as it was quite warm so was nice to come back to a cool room It s right next to the Moulin Rouge and bars and restaurants it s also very close to the Metro so easy to get around 
137452,Hotel Le Squara, Was given a coffee from the breakfast area but no facilities in room Rooms very small but not an issue on this type of break, Location Price Parisian
137453,Hotel Le Squara, I would prefere a bit bigger room that was the smallest room in my life specially for 4star hotel, Perfect location next to Moulin Rouge 50 mtrs from metro station Blanche 50 mtrs from Starbuck 80 mtrs from O Sulivans irish pub safe area
137454,Hotel Le Squara,No Negative, I loved it the staff were very pleasant both the one for the day shift and the night shift The room was spacious and clean and the location was unbeatable 
137455,Hotel Le Squara, Very small room small elevetor small breakfast room a small and narrow Hotel in general Breakfast with not many choices Rumorous neighborhood, Very clean room Nice and polite staff Good location near Metro and Monmarte
137456,Hotel Le Squara, Hotel is rated as 4 star but it does not deserve even 2 stars 1 tiny elevator where a medium size bag can be bared pushed in 2 air conditioning was not operating Every day the staff promised to fix it but nothing happened Finally upon check out they revealed that it is a policy of the hotel during this season not to use air conditioning 3 Without air conditioning it is impossible to stay in room windows should be opened but this is a very noisy neighbourhood of Montmartre Moulin Rouge is aroud the corner So all night long you can hear screems shouts songs etc from the street Not easy to fall asleep 4 Room was so tiny two midsize bags could not be opened simulatneously No space for anything One should be careful for toes not to crash them against bag or the bad or the door 5 Bathroom was tiny although two showers were for some reason a mixer for the flexible shower did not work only cold water was flowing 6 Double bed was so small that despite my gf and I are very sportive persons and do not need much space we were almost at the edge all the time 7 corridors were stuffy, Only location nothing more 
137457,Hotel Le Squara, Nothing pops to mind to complain about , The location is convenient a few steps to the Metro station and to a Hop On Hop off bus stop Easy walking distance to restaurants cafes entertainment Room was quite quiet Room was not overly large but this is to be expected in much of Europe It was clean and stylish and well maintained 
137458,Hotel Le Squara, No AC room too hot No kettle with coffee tea Said Superior room had it included Bath panel was broken fell off Staff didnt replace dirty towels Poor light in the room View from window 3 walls ,No Positive
137459,Hotel Le Squara, Hotel is ranked 4 with a local ranking system Room is small , Location was perfect Bars and restaurants were abundant Metro line is just across the hotel Bed is really confortable and hotel is clean 
137460,Hotel Le Squara, The room was too little and the bed as well was quite short for a normal size person , The location is perfect to discover Paris and there are lots of bars and restaurants all around 
137461,Hotel Le Squara, Nothing negative to say , Very pleasant hotel Charming in every sense Decors are smart and the space which is a very parisian issue everywhere is properly used I asked for a quiet room and I got it Still this hotel is right in the heart of the move in Paris so I guess other rooms could be less quiet Rue Lepic and Montmartre are right there enough to make your trip to Paris Metro Blanche is a one minute walk Ideal choice I would say 
137462,Hotel Le Squara, Very small room 12sqm very little choices in breakfast no restaurant no room service very small elevator payment for your stay in advance breakfast hours 7 to 10, Warm room and hot water
137463,Hotel Le Squara, Everything was great , Amazing location near Montmartre and subways rooms are absolutely beautiful stylish neat and new Was happy about bathroom as well new and clean Would return to this hotel again 
137464,Hotel Le Squara, The lack of breakfast choice, Breakfast wasn t the best for 15 and no tea making facilities in the rooms But on a plus the staff were helpful and the hotel was very nice 
137465,Hotel Le Squara, Minor comment it might have been useful to have a notice on how to work the room temperature dial I found the room too hot and the easiest way to cool it down was to open the window and let in the freezing air That did sort out the room but just seems a waste of energy , Perfect location in a vibrant part of Paris excellent restaurant choices be prepared to walk up the hill to access some of them Loved the vibrant colours of the decor 
137466,Hotel Le Squara, For a 4 star hotel the paper inside the room says it is a 3 star the room is super tiny About 30cm of space around the bed Hard to get to the bathroom For 15 euros breakfast is extremely poor ,No Positive
137467,Hotel Le Squara, Room was rather small but very clean and good comfy bed Breakfast rather pricey however many other options nearby , Excellent location for metro with a stop just outside the door 
137468,Hotel Le Squara, The room was very small Almost to store the luggage , Nice interior different to all the Marriotts and other standard hotels However the rooms are very small If you are on a private trip and you want to enjoy nightlife probably a good choice The room was quiet although you have been staying in the middle of the city 
137469,Hotel Le Squara,No Negative, Fantastic location in Montmartre and seconds from the tube and Moulin Rouge Very nice room decorated with style We had a superior room with volume up and view to the sky

137472,Hotel Le Squara, Two single beds together when it stated a king size was noticable once horizontal Knees were to close to the window when one was taking a crap hardly any space for wipage All first world problems really considering it is Paris , Very chic with stylish decor Lovely staff Shower was bob on Blanche Metro line 2 was a spit away with Pigalle Abbesses and Place de Clichy two minutes either side for connecting lines 12 and 13 respectively Chilled little local straight across the road Chez Julien Montmartre on the doorstep One would reside again 
137473,Hotel Le Squara, WiFi breaks often, Very warm welcome and a wonderful room under the roof over 4m heigh Great location close to Blanche metro station with quick access to Paris and la Defense Breakfast is very good 
137474,Hotel Le Squara, The receptionist was very unpleasant I paid for my breakfast in a room but it never arrived Instead I was almost thrown out of the room by staff as was taking 10 min too long at the check out Rooms are tiny and they don t look like on pictures , Good location 
137475,Hotel Le Squara, Only thing I didn t like about the breakfast was that it was an additional 15 on top of the room rate Bit steep for a continental breakfast Room is a little teeny but by Paris standards the bathroom was a good size and we had a large bed so it really didn t bother us too much We recommend staying here , Overall the hotel was fantastic Great decor clean and such friendly staff We enjoyed our stay The gentleman in charge of breakfast was so helpful and they had cereal meats cheeses yoghurts eggs coffee tea
137476,Hotel Le Squara, We did not take breakfast as 15 Euros pp seemed a bit much even by Parisian standard Lots of cafes nearby though , Brilliant location cosy and classy decor wonderful shower comfortable bed very quiet indoors with windows shut the street itself is quite lively day and night 
137477,Hotel Le Squara, I would describe the room as cosy but it was adequate No tea or coffee facilities , Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was nicely decorated and bed was comfortable Nice bathroom and good shower Room was quiet although we were on 5th floor Location is excellent being close to Montmartre Gare du Nord and easy access to Champs Elysee Continental breakfast was good Good value for money hotel in an expensive city Would stay there again 
137478,Hotel Le Squara, Everything is very small from the entrance to the elevator to the room and bathroom and breakfast room But that is the signature of the hotel so you just need to fit , Very good location next to the Moulin Rouge and metro station Very clean and confortable modern Very sympathetic staff 
137479,Hotel Le Squara, I don t like that it s nearly perfect there s no con for this hotel in my opinion , The room was small but good enough for the value I got a good view of Place Blanche too room 502 He staffs were so kind and helpful The bathroom is clean and well supplied of toiletteries See you again guys
