70551,H tel Raphael, We specifically asked for a 12 noon book in Confirmed by Booking com We arrived at noon and were told we could not book until 3pm They blamed Booking com Who is to blame , Decent room
70552,H tel Raphael, Our dining experience was a disaster Our goal of a fine French dining experience in the one night we were there was ruined by an appalling experience of food and service which we did not get to finish The waiting staff advised something was wrong in the kitchen really unacceptable for this level of hotel , The location the rooms we had its a nice hotel
70553,H tel Raphael,No Negative, The Hotel Raphael is a an exquisite gem My family and I appreciate beauty and therefore had a Superb experience during our stay Thank you Diego Sotgiu Zanda
70554,H tel Raphael, Make sure you get a room without an interconnecting door unless you specifically want one if the people next door are noisy as they were when we stayed you won t get a good night s sleep Rooms are also very warm as air conditioning not great Have stayed here before but think it s got a bit tired and needs a bit of a refurb , Good location lovely little bar Lovely roof top terrace
70555,H tel Raphael, The massive terrace needed a bit of attention , In a lifetime of staying in magnificent hotels this is amongst the most memorable it is simply stunning in the greatest of Parisian styles 
70556,H tel Raphael, Nothing , I think this is the Top 10 hotel in the world The hotel and restaurant are extremely Luxury beautiful and elegant I highly recommend it Thomas the receptionist is the best staff and he was very patient to fulfill my room request Thank you all very much I had a wonderful 2 nights stay 
70557,H tel Raphael, Terrible bathroom for a 5 star hotel toilet seat was chipped which isn t nice it was quite dated When we used all the tissues the box wasn t replaced When room service arrived it was cold there were only 2 red wines available from room service despite having a lengthy wine list , The size cleanliness of the room very friendly staff couldn t have helped more Good location for the main sightseeing spots
70558,H tel Raphael, No aircondition in the room and difficult to have the window open for the traffic sound The nights were warm The prices for food and beverage 25 for an omelett is not ok I also think 20 day for a small dog is senseless , The breakfast Not too much but nothing missing A tastful mix for everybody and beautifully presented The service at the breakfast was excellent and and not stiff as you sometimes find in 5 stars hotel Warm smiles and interest in you as a customer Delicious scrambled eggs and excellent coffee Metro outside and Champs Elysee 5 min away 
70559,H tel Raphael, We waited 45 minutes to check in because the room was not ready they gave us free drinks while waiting but the service was slow and no one attended to us for 10 mins , Location is great classic bedroom was big room service breakfast was great Would recommend 
70560,H tel Raphael, Only thing is that we had to keep ordering bottles of waters daily because they were never replaced, The hotel is very elegant and lovely the room was specious and felt luxurious Concierge and reception staff and the doormen were super friendly and helpful Location is very convenient next to the arc of triumph and next to a metro station
70561,H tel Raphael,No Negative, Bed was comfy room was roomy and we loved the garden roof top for drinks The concierge was very helpful and made reservations We definitely would stay with you again and tell others about your hotel Gary Carol Peters Bend Oregon USA
70562,H tel Raphael, The room although big had absolutely nothing to do with the ones on the photos On the top of that it faced an inner yard and we could hear the guests on the room above us , Very nice and helpful staff good location beautiful ground floor 
70563,H tel Raphael, Nothing I always try to stay at the Raphael when I go to Paris Quiet end of town, The extra large rooms beautiful public areas great art and most of all the wonderful feel of a smaller more boutique and intimate hotel The interior design is absolutely old world beautiful with no two rooms I have stayed in alike Staff are attentive professional and friendly without being smothering Bars and restaurant are quiet and intimate The champagne bar on the roof top is a must to impress your partner or Parisian visitors Position position position Convenient access to iconic Champs Elysees and a good easy walk to most of Paris s many and major attractions The metro is at the doorstep to get further afield or when you ve achieved your walking objectives for the day I thought twice about this recommendation as I would rather Raphael be a secret gem known by a discerning few 
70564,H tel Raphael, staff were not pleasant and not very helpful including the concierge The staff at the breakfast greeted us with a frown daily and were very noisy during breakfast, location was good and the beds were comfortable
70565,H tel Raphael, There was a strange sounds coming from the AC vent and it kept me up at night, The room was very spacious and clean The staff were very helpful and cheerful 
70566,H tel Raphael,No Negative, Very elegant hotel with the best terrace view The room was quite spacious for a European hotel And the staff were very attentive Appreciated the fact that when my son felt cold while having dinner at the terrace they offered a comfy blanket How thoughtful 
70567,H tel Raphael, The prices in the bar downstairs were fairly spicy 25 EUR for a Cocktail if I remember On the flipside a bottle of beer from the minibar in the room was 5 EUR which I thought was very fair , Our room 514 was beautiful with a terrace and a view of the Eiffel Tower The breakfast in the room was opulent We just loved the whole stay 
70568,H tel Raphael, The hotel is beautiful with a perfect location Our room had no view and was small the bathroom was outdated and not very clean Evrybody in the hotel is correct buth not very spontenous or friendly , We celebrated our anniversary in hotel George A bottle of champagne was waiting for us in our room a great surprise 
70569,H tel Raphael, The WiFi works very badly it s ridiculous the guest has to renew hs log in every 24 hrs , The staff service particulary the Deputy Manager Mr To The beauty style of the hotel it s cleanliness the Terrace on the 7 is unique should be put to use Bar Caf even in winter with a glass coupole 
70570,H tel Raphael, The bed was not very comfortable and the room service needs improvement Bathroom needs to be improved, The staff is amazing and there is an old Parisian charm to this hotel My room reminded me of a Parisian Apartment and was very quiet The location is excellent
70571,H tel Raphael,No Negative, Amazing boutique hotel so close to all the sights The hotel has an air and charm reminiscent of times gone by and at the same time is modern and relevant The rooms are so amazing and chique Best of all if you want a room with a view well there is nowhere else in Paris where you can get such a birds eye view of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacr C ur together We spent a wonderful weekend there and would definitely return oh and did I mentiion the roof terrace where they serve the most amazing cocktails and champagne whilst you admire Paris at it s best
70572,H tel Raphael, the room was not quite as excellent as we expected as seen in pictures and the room service is quite slow, concerige was very supportive and helpful when they asisted us in booking some tickets

70576,H tel Raphael, the neighborhood is not very buzzing but residential which is nice too , great service wonderful romantic room as we requested in the upper floors and quiet Lots of space 
70577,H tel Raphael,No Negative, It s a five star so it s hard to knock it for much except cost An amazing hotel in an amazing location in Paris just 3 5 min walk from the Arc Du Triomph The staff is suburb and very friendly and food was very good Make sure you book a reservation for the roof top bar well in advance or you won t get a seat The food within the hotel is very expensive but there are plenty of food options within walking distance The rooms are very well maintained and the wifi was perfect If it s good enough for Audrey Hepburn and George Clooney it s good enough for you treat yourself an unforgettable experience in Paris 
70578,H tel Raphael, The rooftop restaurant is worth a miss 95eu a head and overpriced wine for a very limited and uninspired menu The views were limited too much foliage up there and there were slugs crawling on to the table The staff were not terribly helpful or attentive , Hotel was beautiful very 19th century parisian
70579,H tel Raphael, Very expensive but again Paris in general is expensive WIFI is terrible and does not work 80 of the times I made a complaint to the hotel but they did not fix the issue , Amazing decor we had a deluxe suite Great service and attention to details Will definitely go back again 
70580,H tel Raphael,No Negative, The large private terrace with an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower Really friendly staff especially in the English bar room service It was our 25th wedding anniversary room decorated with heart shaped petals on bed we were given a cake which was a lovely gesture
