390999,Ham Yard Hotel, Everything priced on the high end , Loved the luxury room quiet fine and spacious Location that you can t beat amazing design clean and new Great Gym Would love to return if price is right 
391000,Ham Yard Hotel, Nothing , This was our third time here as we just love the place Wouldn t stay anywhere else It has it all divine rooms fantastic public areas and top notch location 
391001,Ham Yard Hotel, The very ordinary overpriced breakfast I also would like a kettle in the room to make a cup of tea , Very friendly staff fabulous location and quirky interior design 
391002,Ham Yard Hotel, No coffee machine in the room Hotel with lots of non guests in the bars etc Don t understand why lifts are opened to everybody Guests should have a differentiated treatment , Big room confortable beds roof garden 
391003,Ham Yard Hotel, The manger delt with an issue we faced in a bad way as he was stiffed when talking to us He treated us as criminal for water and coffee stains that my less than two year daughter spilled on their ugly carpet he told us he will check our calls and with his staff to make sure we were not lying as we informed immediately for the room service He billed us a huge amount of money for these carpet stains that we argue not to pay What a shame I ve never faced any of my hotels experience as bad as this one Also they refused to extend our check out till 1 o clock even though I m a genus in booking so we were wondering in the city for along time till our flight time which was 6 Also they didn t brought the welcome drinks , The design only and the location is not that good as it was located in small smelly neighborhood 
391004,Ham Yard Hotel, Nothing just perfect, Really cool very best of service standards staff well trained and picked rooms really nice much better than the pictures new photographer required

391006,Ham Yard Hotel, My ONLY disappointment was being denied an egg breakfast dish after check out in the restaurant at 12 noon when on the room menu you can get breakfast 24 hours Made no sense to me that they wouldn t make an exception especially considering I had been a guest for several days and even brought 5 people in for dinner in their restaurant the night before This place seems to have service that goes above and beyond except if you want something on one menu but not on another I would definitely return here but maybe next time order what I want in the room Also to note I m a genius on Booking com and was under the assumption I was getting early check in and late check out When I arrived early I was told that only applies if a room is ready makes sense and I had requested a specific type of room so made even more sense What surprised me was day of check out I called and mentioned my late check out and there was no note for it They said had to be requested day of The Booking app makes one feel like they are doing it for you Wasn t the case here Wasn t a problem they extended me an hour but just something to know when you book thru this app , This is a spectacular hotel Beautiful decor lovely linens exceptional staff Everything about this hotel is luxurious I loved it and will return to Ham yard or another one of their hotels 
391007,Ham Yard Hotel, There seemed to be a little LESS attention to detail this time for us WE have stayed at ham yard several times in the past and we were somewhat disappointed at the service on this stay , It is always pleasant to be at Ham Yard The decor is still a great feature of the hotel that keeps us coming back

391012,Ham Yard Hotel, We asked about an event on the rooftop and this was never followed up by the staff Breakfast was extremely overpriced and not very good at all There are much better breakfast venues local to the hotel , Bed was really comfortable welcoming staff very good and gave a good overview and tour 
391013,Ham Yard Hotel, Nothing, For a 5 Central London Hotel it was never going to be cheap so putting that aside the staff were friendly attentive and knowledgeable The Hotel is a delight bright colourful vibrant and so different from many other hotels in its class From the roof top bar to the bowling alley in the basement the hotel is beautifully decorated and visually amazing The location couldn t have been better for our visit to the theatre and from now on this is most definately my London Hotel of choice a comfortable relaxing and friendly environment We loved it 
391014,Ham Yard Hotel, Nothing, Friendly and exceptional staff I advised the hotel it was my husband s birthday and they went the extra to make his day with a surprise cake and complimentary champagne at the bar Our room was superb breakfast was faultless and we can t wait to go back

391028,Ham Yard Hotel, Not much, chorizo breakfast the best eggs benedict not so good great room and quiet Daniele the best server at breakfast everyone at front desk helpful 
391029,Ham Yard Hotel, I chose this hotel because it was in Soho and close to the Piccadilly station While the area immediately adjacent to the hotel is peaceful Piccadilly is a zoo And initially when I would return to the hotel the 1st day or two finding my way back to the hotel from the tube was very confusing So many diagonal streets look alike But a Doorman told me the trick and that really helped Nice Bar but almost too lively a Bar Scene , This hotel is absolutely gorgeous The room was very spacious and the bed linens were the best I had ever encountered I asked for top sheet to be added which they did immediately The bathroom was amazing with a great stall shower with great water pressure and a magnificent tub The d cor throughout the hotel is beautiful There is a beautiful large patio for outside dining

391035,Ham Yard Hotel, The only thing i do not like is the price for the hotel room It is relatively expensive however for the service one recieves it deserves to have such a price , I stayed at the ham yard before and i find it is the best hotel in london The staff is great and everything is clean The food is also very good I really enjoy my stays at the ham yard

391037,Ham Yard Hotel, The hotel bar and restaurants was always busy with people out from the hotel that made it difficult to find reservation on short notice, The staff were super especially the duty manager on our checking in day
391038,Ham Yard Hotel, The public areas are really busy with limited facilities for exclusive resident use The roof top garden which is beautiful and only open to residents or private functions had a function on while we were there so disappointingly was unavailable for our use , The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout with amazing eclectic style and attention to detail

391047,Ham Yard Hotel, It s generally a pretty expensive place already my room cost around 400 a night and I know hotels hold money for security purposes but at the Ham Yard they held 300 PER NIGHT I was there for a week and they casually took 2100 from my account like it was totally normal to take such a high amount for security I stay in a lot of hotels and I ve never had to pay this much before I didn t like this and yes I got the money back but it was such a big amount unexpected I m not sure if I d do his again , Pretty much everything Services the place it s a very nice place to stay
