483263,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco,No Negative, Awesome deal with booking com Good location because it s right next to the metro station The staff is super nice and parking for your cars for a fee 
483264,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, The place is great Booking directly on their website would have saved me 30 , 1 min from Lotto M1 Metro Esselungo supermarket nearby 5 min walk from a local Gelato shop 
483265,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, We had a room at the topfloor to which we needed to take stairs although being a single mum with a child The room was split in two by a very low beam The room should better be let only as a single room , Closeby San Siro 15 min walk Next to the metro to the city centre 
483266,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, ice cold rooms unclear shady communication smelly sheets cigarette smell all over the place even in our room , close to the metro stop
483267,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, we arrived on a game night The hotel was extremely disappointing It started with the parking was full although their website specifically states that guest do not need to reserve parking in advance and finding a place outside was stressful as one need to be lucky to find parking outside on game night The room was the smallest we ever got in Italy for 3 persons and it had a bad smell of smoking although we asked for nonsmoking The service was surprisingly poor staff were simply indifferent to any request we ve had including assistance with departing early next morning we arrived 5 min early for breakfast and they made us wait although everything was ready and we needed to depart to catch a flight The only one who really tried his best was the bellhop who assisted us with taking the luggage to our room the elevator didn t work that night and did his best to get the bad smell out of the room as the people in the counter couldn t or were not willing to to move us to a different room , Good location for people who like to get to San Siro Stadium
483268,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, room 88 located at front of hotel on ground floor could hear trains rumbling underground see comment re Metro till late also front door opening closing, Very handy 50m from Milan metro stop Lotto A few stops from Duomo centre of Milan Nothing much else in area 
483269,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, If you plan on studying the reliability of the Milan Metro this is the hotel for you Each train passing underground will rumble your bed Make sure you get a ground floor room though , Close to the metro 
483270,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, Decor outdated dark wood and printed fabric TV arial was broken but was promptly fixed on request The surrounding area is not very nice so good as a base to get to Milan , Great location just a few stops from central Milan and opposite a metro station Staff were friendly and room was clean 
483271,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, The air conditioning went out of order at the whole hotel during my stay I couldn t sleep the whole night cause it was too hot But it was fixed the next morning , Wi fi connection works very good in rooms and public areas Clean rooms fast check in nice personnel the hotel entrance is right next to the metro station 
483272,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, The staff is extremely rude especially this guy Fabia who is doing most of the check ins After Fabia comes a fat guy and he is even more rude It was scary to be in that hotel all alone Plus rooms are quite shady In short if you are going to stay there alone I would not recommend it , The location was the only good thing for me because i had to go to the malpensa airport the other day and it was quite convenient 
483273,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, The receptionists were very rude the tall man and the one with glasses too Their attitude was like they were doing us a favor by talking to us There was really cold inside the room even though there were 17degrees outside When we asked them to turn on the heat they looked annoyed Even though i made a reservation without breakfast and we didn t eat there when we made the check out they told us that we have to pay 18 euros extra for the breakfast because we were downstairs to eat That was not true so i got angry and asked him to explain how was that possible how can he the one with glasses prove that and he told me that one of the maids saw us eating That was ridiculous In the end after i got into a fight with him he printed another bill without the breakfast but no apology no nothing Also there was no wi fi , Indeed it was clean and another great thing near the metro station But that was it Never go back there

483275,Mokinba Hotels Montebianco, I like the woman at reception desk at 06 01 2016 at 14 00 pm she is very nice But after I checked in my friends came to the hotel at that night very very very unhappy experience for me 06 01 2016 at 21 30 pm The reception desk man looks tall and fact Firstly he asked my friend for the passport and she started to find it in her wallet maybe just let him to wait 10 second long then he long breath through this nose it gives my feeling that he is impatient After my friend checkin in he gave us the room card one of my friend was busying Organizing her staff and another one was taping message on her phone I try to took the room card for her but the man did not give to me I think the really know we are friend and the two girls were in the reception desk very close to me I just want to help them for the card but So is that the rule of the hotel Plus the wifi in the room never can connect But the room is clean others but that man are really nice , Clean
