385557,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The maintenance ppl should check the room before the customer checks in We checked in and stayed at the room for one night with an AC problem although we shared this with the maintenance guy on the first day but he didnt fix it on the next day the hotel moved us to a new room , The decoration the history of this hotel and how it is been reinnovated the reception and customer relations staff were very helpful We looved the breakfast part and how the staff in the breakfast section were very friendly and keen to serve us especially the smily man who really took care of us i think he is the supervisor chief or the place supervisor Not sure We had really wonderful breakfast everyday of our stay in this hotel 
385558,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Beautiful view of canal from our room Staff especially Guido were wonderful Room was bright clean and comfortable We Loved It Wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed the breakfast room We had too early of a flight home 
385559,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, First of all Booking com should remove the smoking option as the hotel is smoke free apparently so that was the first welcome note Entered the room and found 3 4 bugs on the bed with another 2 3 around the windows we didn t find this pleasant either AC was okay during the day but always hot at night no one bothered to fix it Breakfast selection is very limited and takes them ages to deliver your omelet and or pancakes from the kitchen although it was almost empty i must admit that the pancakes are worth the wait though The capacity at the breakfast area is limited so expect to be welcomed with a you can wait a while for a table which was the first time i experience such a thing at any hotel i have ever visited they normally seat you immediately and they should have at least offered us to sit in the bar seating area which is right next to the breakfast area All in all found the hotel decent but over priced for sure and i m not sure what s the hype in the reviews about the location as we didn t see anything special about it Would we stay here again Nop , It s an okay hotel room size was decent and the bed was very comfy Friendly and welcoming staff with professional concierge 
385560,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, I loved this hotel beautifully decorated The staff were brilliant especially the young man who checked us in on Tuesday 18th I think his name was Simon Also Guydo who was fantastic Only criticism would be there is no where to put your suitcase except on the bed in order to unpack 
385561,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, I loved this hotel and would recommend anytime Lots of good restaurants close by , The room was very spacious with a lovely view of the canal Great comfortable bed with crispy white linen The staff were very kind and helpful Service was good 
385562,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The family in the room next door had small children who woke up early and then made a lot of noise, The staff were all very helpful and keen to suggest things to do and places to go The location was great within easy walking distance of all the main attractions but not too noisy Paying the extra for a room with a view over the canal is well worthwhile 
385563,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, the buliding is not isolated well u can hear the street noise in the room the good thing is it was in a quit district, the stuff was the kindest evvvvver 3 location is just perfect
385564,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Very Noisey till early morning hours stuffy rooms misleading information that they have A C available it s only a climate control system Housekeeping lacks effort or diligence heavily stained carpets in otherwise new rooms dirty bathrooms with faulty fixtures , Most lovely staff breakfast was in a beautiful setting with brilliant staff ready to meet any requests you may have Best part of the hotel was their staff 
385565,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The standard double rooms are quite small but newly renovated and clean Hotel lobby missed more chairs for waiting guests , Hotel has a very good location in centre of Amsterdam Friendly staff clean hotel Good breakfests Can recommend to the others for nice stay in the old town 
385566,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Room arrangement was very well thought out The interior is modern yet it doesn t create that typical hotel feeling it was just very comfortable to be in The bathroom arrangement waa perfect hair dryer positioned nicely there everything I needed was placed well And the view for breakfast was beautiful The croissant and the coffee wasn t like a hotel tasteless coffee 
385567,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The concierge was lacking in providing information on sight seeing restaurants etc , Breakfast service in the restaurant was excellent Even though the breakfast time starts at 7 am on Monday as we had early morning flight to catch staff took extra care to serve us full breakfast as early as 6 am 
385568,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing, The staff were welcoming and friendly and had good knowledge of the city which they were happy to share the breakfast room had a lovely view over a canal and the service in the cosy bar was excellent with good recommendations The location is very good and brings all touristic sites within easy and pleasant walking distance Cooked to order food at breakfast and great buffet with attentive service 
385569,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, the room was very small, The staff was very eager to please the breakfast room and offerings on the menu as well as the buffet were absolutely wonderful
385570,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Was all good, The breakfast menu said extraordinary and it lived up to it Was so well presented high quality and tasty The front office staff helped us with booking museum tours and excursions and suggestions of what to do and where to eat We were not sure which NH can collection hotel to book but after walking around and comparing with the other properties we were so happy we chose this one 
385571,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, there were some minors problems when i did the check out cause the system was not working but I hope everything will be fine soon, everything was really nice
385572,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Beautiful Hotel and very friendly staff We were welcome from as soon as we got in the hotel Rooms are not very big but very clean and the decor was very nice We loved having breakfast in their amazing restaurant by the Amstel River 
385573,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Size of room is relatively small Shower is leaking from the door Makes the floor wet , The location is central to the attractions restaurant and shopping areas We even have time to go back in the hotel to rest and take a nap at mid afternoon 
385574,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The only thing that caught my attention was the a c in the room wasn t too strong but a window open helped keep the room cool , Beautiful building great location amazing staff 
385575,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The breakfast has to be offered as any other many places around and be advertized accordingly To charge 30Eu per person for breakfast included is making a bad impression and is not pro marketing The hotel has to offer a business corner that customers may get access free of charge to a computer and use it in a private way 2 3 computer stations may be sufficient ,No Positive
385576,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, The ultimate white room ever Loved the airy light and bright atmosphere of the room Openable windows overlooking the canal gives fresh air It is clean neat calming I also loved the rainshower All the staff from the front desk to the guest relations to the concierge were really really helpful Took their recommendations for restaurants and never disappointed 
385577,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Claim to fame for this hotel is that Sisi stayed there Well today she will not be able to move in the room because her skirts will be too big I pity the staff who has to work for NH No airconditioning on the ground floor When I arrived it was hot outside inside it was almost unbearable The airconditioning in the rooms are also totally useless At night there is so much noise from the street no fault of the hotel Noisy travellers that one had to close the window and it was not comfortable I took the duvet out of the cover and slept under that I did as for a single top sheet for the rest of my stay but they do not seem to have any My bed was made with another duvet cover But Main complaint the room I was allocated was call de lux or whatever but there was nowhere to put a suitcase I placed it under the window and then fell over it every time I passed it About 40cm on one side of the bed about 5o cm at the end of the bed and a bit more on the other side where there was a little desk with a television in line with the headboard of the bed So one has to sit at the foot of the bed to see the TV screen Sit either on an office chair or a horrible little pink pouffe at the end of the bed , Gillian Dolmans must be the staff member of the year She listened and then sorted out the problem I had in a very friendly and understanding manner 
385578,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Shockingly small rooms big prices Management dealt with it after issue was raised with comment our hotel is old we have small rooms , Breakfast
385579,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room was a Superior Double with View it is poor value for money for the room is quite small just enough room to walk past the end of the bed the room badly needs more drawer space two very small drawers under the dresser just enough for toiletries and one other drawer under the safe Not enough drawer space for four nights The bathroom is very modern and clean , All of the staff were attentive polite helpful and made our stay a real pleasure The breakfast was very good a great choice of fruit juices cereal meats cheeses and a selection of freshly cooked options such as omelettes eggs benedict etc at no extra cost The hotel is in an excellent central location which makes it very easy to walk to all of the attractions
385580,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The hotel is not very affordable But you pay for a five star hotel and get a five star experience , The hotel is in an excellent location The room was big and very comfortable Each staff member we met was super nice and helpful We used the concierge service for dinner recommendations and reservations Every place they recommended was great 
385581,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Staff were extremely helpful the room was very comfortable and the location was excellent Shower was amazing possibly the best I have ever used I want one of these showers in my home Nespresso coffee machine in room was a nice touch 
385582,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing really , NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen was a historical hotel recently refurbished It is located in Amsterdam Centrum in a safe area next to a beautiful canal and at less than 10 min walk from the Dam There are plenty of public transportation options at walking distance from the hotel The room was small but well furnished very comfortable bed perfect shower I enjoyed breakfast and the friendly service I loved their Dutch pancakes and one night I had a business dinner at the restaurant quiet great food and nice view next to the canal Personnel were friendly are eager to help I would stay there again in a future trip 
385583,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, One big thing windows are non existent The biggest issue is noise You hear everything that is on the street from junks swearing at 1am to rubbish trucks tossing glass bottles at 6am Expressed the concern at checkout and the management said they are planning to install double windows Rooms facing the canal may be slightly better but the opposite street is rather busy too and has bars Rooms could be bigger One of the rooms we got was so small so that the bathroom sink was taken to the entree Not really 5 size , Location very central but not too close to the Red Light district If you want to walk around it is perfect Staff service very helpful polite and professional Breakfast was very good A la carte items are delicious Good high speed internet all over the hotel and connectivity was good 
385584,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Bathroom Ammenities were not there and i had to ask for them Last day we had electricity Only Light outage in the room, Breakfast Supervisor and guest relations representatives were super amazing 
385585,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing everything was wonderful , Everything there was nothing we could fault the hotel was excellent the staff couldn t have been more helpful the location was spot on i would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends Thank you for a wonderful stay in Amsterdam Peter 
385586,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The first room they showed us was tiny There was nowhere to put your suitcase and the sink was in the bedroom and not the bathroom There were a couple of practical things missing from the room we actually stayed in which was much nicer and bigger than the first one and they were a soap dish there was nowhere to put the handsoap next to the sink and a luggage rack , The team particularly the porter and Michael one of the breakfast team who were so helpful and full of great suggestions for things to do while we were in Amsterdam and the breakfast which was great fresh juices cooked to order pancakes eggs benedict 
385587,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Shower was a bit disappointing drainage poor but I guess that is expected in a canal city , Staff were excellent Local restaurants and recommendations were superb 
385588,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, I loved everything, Absolutely fantastic Amazing old building in perfect conditions with super modern rooms The staff is trained with a very high bar and they all are warm and friendly 
385589,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Street noise had to request move from the street side to the canal side in fairness this was dealt with promptly and efficiently Service in the bar was poor we gave up , Nice central location within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see

385594,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, I stay in many 5 hotels and this one was disappointment The room was grubby and small It was our wedding anniversary and I did ask for a nice room There was no bath and the room was not cleaned for us on the Saturday I would have preferred to stay in bedroom at home Than this room Very noisy , Location and the building from outside
385595,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, room s a relative small at this price rate, Location can t be better Easy access to nearly everywhere you d like to explore Amsterdam View towards canal As beautiful as a painting when sunrise Cleanness WiFi is very good
385596,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, the fact you have to give a 150 deposit on top of the payment Hotel orangised a taxi at a fixed rate for us which was not true I ended up paying for a chocolate bar off the min bar in the room in which we did not eat or even know there was chocolate bars in the room The hotel said they would not charge for this but still did and took 10 for it Restaurant did not have steak knifes which is really poor when they have steak on the menu Breakfast is 29 99 per morning per person which is a rip off One of the staff behind the main desk was really pushy about paying more money for upgrades and add ons which made me feel uncomfortable , The rooms are lovely The bed is really comfortable and the shower facilities were excellent Location is amazing and is in walking distance for everything We could not have asked for better location 
385597,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, The staff were very well accommodating even supplied us with fruit and cake on arrival as it was our 1st year anniversary The room was very comfortable especially the hundreds of pillows 
385598,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The rooms were very small The staff were not overly helpful Our room was on the second floor and the building was on a busy street We could not sleep from the noise of weekend revelers ,No Positive
385599,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Breakfast a little pricey But range is quite good especially they include the ala carte in the buffet , Staff were very polite friendly and helpful Special mention Martin at the bar and Omar at the reception have been very accommodating and helpful Location is excellent and easily accessible to shops tourist attractions and trams 
385600,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The tea coffee cups in the room are tiny We ended up asking for alternative cups which we got , The hotel is in a good location We were lucky to have a room with a canal view so the fact it is was quite small was offset by this The breakfast is quite costly at 26 Euro but totally worth it Treated ourselves on day one but went to nearby caf the next day where you can pick up full breakfast for 12 euros 
385601,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Room tiny , The food was amazing staff brillant so helpful and friendly Location is great Only small thing was size of the room so tiny Would recommend even people not staying here to eat in the restaurant 
385602,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Polite professional and very good at their jobs However didn t feel friendly or caring You got what YOU ASKED for that was it Room service menu very limited, Beautifully appointed
385603,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The wi fi works great but we have to log in every day , Staff is great and the rooms are really comfortable The restaurant Switch is fantastic if you are staying at this hotel got to eat there The room service is flawless

385610,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Room slightly cramped but then the building is an odd shape, Beautifully restored rooms and decoration sympathetic to age of building Restaurant Swych served a fantastic mainly vegetarian meal Very well done that even non vegetarians could appreciate Compliments to the chef Breakfast was fantastic too
385611,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, We couldn t get on wifi from our room but then again we didn t notify the staff of the issue I believe the wifi caps at 100 MB every 12 hours It was a minor inconvenience since we relied on our cell data plan bought locally If you like a quiet night for sleeping on the weekend only then you should ask for a room facing the city and not the canal that faces the entertainment district , The breakfast was great and would recommend it for the extra cost Friendly staff and great location All the points of interest are walkable Central Station being the furthest would be about 20 min walk 
385612,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Except that the size of the room superior double room is really small you don t have the place to open your luggage no complains , Staff and location are perfect 
385613,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room for the price was very small and although overlooking the canal was very noisy at night, The staff in all areas were very helpful and excellent 
385614,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Couldn t fault it , Service was excellent staff are all super friendly and helpful and really make you feel at home Loved the central location the view over the rooftops of Amsterdam from our window and the freshly squeezed juices at breakfast 
385615,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room was on the 5th floor and was a little small but adequate for a short stay , Location was excellent Staff were very friendly the hotel was spotless bright and warm 
385616,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Very thin old windows which don t prevent any noise from street to come into the room Horrific loud and impossible to sleep on the night because of first floor street located room Should do something about install a modern windows , Great clean rooms get a free upgrade because the TV in the booked room was not working and they was not able to fix it Good color choice great location friendly and helpful staff 
385617,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Staying longer , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly They were very knowledgeable about the local area and facilities The room was very well equipped Breakfast overlooking the canal in the sunshine was delicious 
385618,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Very very noisy both street noise and from rooms Breakfast on second day chaotic maybe under staffed , Staff were fabulous Room was spotless and comfortable Great coffee machine lovely big shower and good toiletries 
385619,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing was wrong In love with the place its area , EVERYTHING it s just the right place to stay in Amsterdam Very classy clean They take care of their customers very well Food is fantastic I would definitely come again
385620,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, We had to ask for a price adjustment as they could only provide one room with a view if we hadn t we would have been charged for two rooms with a view The larger room which was over the Nieuwe Doelenstraat was perfect apart from the fact that in the recent refurb NH had not thought to put in double glazing the air con was good but even with the windows closed the street noise was somewhat disturbing On our last night the hotel received deliveries of linen at 02 00 which lasted for 30mins and sounded like someone was throwing steel crates around having got back to sleep we were woken again at 0530 by a delivery of consumables for the hotel again which went on for over 30 mins I rang reception and was told this was normal for the hotel to receive deliveries overnight I asked if they could stop the delivery but was told no On checking out we mentioned this again to be told that our and other complaints had been passed to management but no mention if management would do anything I suggested perhaps getting daytime deliveries or double glazing The noise problem for rooms with no view is something you should be aware of especially if you are a light sleeper as the road outside is rarely quiet , The hotel has been recently and expensively refurbished and the interior of the rooms ad the hotel is perfect and matched by the price to stay Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable of Amsterdam We booked two superior rooms with a view but apparently because we had asked for the rooms to be close to each other we were given one room with a view and another over the main street The room with a view overlooked the Amstel river and was very good if a little on the small side only about 15 18ins room between foot of the bed and the wall The bathrooms in both rooms were excellent the housekeeping was a bit hit and miss we ended up new towels every day The restaurant is a new concept it s basically a vegetarian restaurant with meat as a side dish if you want it We tried it despite by avowed carnivore tendencies and I was surprisingly pleased bith with the food and the service which was exceptional the vegetarian Shushi is a real surprise Breakfast was excellent both range and quality of food nd of the service at breakfast as was the service throughout the hotel 
385621,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, For the price I would like to have breakfast included , Excellent location very kind staff nice room with comfortable bed They were offering us bottles of water every day nice fresh cakes and sweets at reception every morning Everything at walking distance 
385622,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Windows not double glazed so can hear antics of revellers during the night , We were upgraded and treated as extraordinary guests which meant we had a free drink and brownie s fruit waiting in our room on the first night of our stay 
385623,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Little noisy but only to be expected given the location Sunday check in was very late due to their lazy Sunday policy so didn t get into the room until 4 30pm arrive at 10 30am should make this clear on booking, Location staff and the room
385624,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, VERY SMALL ROOM, WONDERFUL VIEW CLOSE TO ANYTHING STAF VERY POLITE ESPECIALLY TOM AT THE BREAKFAST AND ADAM FROM POLAND AT THE ROOM SERVICE IT IS THE PLACE THAT REMBRAND S NIGHT S WATCH WAS PAINTED
385625,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, We loved staying at your hotel Your facilities are great your staff is very friendly and helpful We would certainly stay in your hotel if we come back to Amsterdam your location is great too We loved walking around and we would certainly give your references to other people visiting this beautiful city Thank you 
385626,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Bit unfortunate original windows are not much soundproof so you can hear the lively atmosphere of Amsterdam streets till early morning , Suites has great view straight from the bed overlooking the canal
385627,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room was of a high quality But Rather small I WAS told this is standard for Amsterdam, I travel a lot These were the best and friendliest staff ever especially Luke and Nicky and Shannon The breakfast and lunch was was of a high quality The check in was easy and quick When we checked out they explained the bill in detail The best location in Amsterdam Close to everything 
385628,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent exceptional service Great dining room Nice freshly made egg benedict Sparkling wine for breakfast which was also a nice surprise May not come back only for the small room but breakfast surely left an impression and made us consider coming back
385629,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Rooms are too small a lot smaller than advertised on booking com Literally not enough space to move around the double bed , Excellent location in the heart of the city centre Everything is a walking distance away 
385630,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Not quite five star service was expecting that bit extra from the staff nothing to complain though Morning breakfast would have been very expensive so we opted to not try it , Central location and beautiful views to the canals from the windows Clean and comfortable room everything worked smoothly 
385631,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, We were 2 couples travelling Our friends reported it to be very noisy from their 2 floor bedroom all through the night However we were on the top floor and had no issues with noise , Great location nice newly done up rooms the rooms were comfortable the bed very good great ensuite Nice view from the top floor bedrooms 
385632,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Mini bar kettle coffee maker didn t work as there was no power despite asking for a repair No car park at the hotel Valet parking was expensive , Location comfortable bed and room 
385633,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Restaurant was closed and they didn t informed me when I did the reservation Due to the fact that good food in Amsterdam is a issue it was a problem that restaurant was closed No facilities as spa gym etc , Good location Nice and clean room Breakfast has menu it s a different concept Breakfast area and employees in breakfast were friendly and polite Coffee and tea in the room 
385634,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Took the city a few days to clean up from the festival so the sea gulls were very noisy in the morning Took a very long time to figure out a mistake on my bill , The staff was super friendly and couldn t do enough for you Location and room we had was spectacular Restaurant was great too 
385635,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, In short very poor service and it s a pity Two examples in less than 24 hours 1 After asking for an alternative to valet parking staff directed me to a parking location which charges the same price 2 I asked another staff member to book me a place in a restaurant and call me on my mobile to confirm the reservation was done Apparently this 5 star hotel is unable to dial an international number ,No Positive
385636,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Wonderful position right in the middle of everything Great view The staff were fantastic especially the bar and kitchen staff Thankyou for looking after us so well Would definitely recommend 
385637,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, We would recommend to install new windows to reduce the surrounding noise , Great location closed to Waterloo plein Flower Market and Dam Square Friendly staff very professional Room very comfortable but windows were not really noise reduction would recommend to improve the isolation system Breakfast was out of scale one of the best we ve ever tried in sny European city 
385638,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The hotel listed airconditioning as part of their room offerings upon arrival when the room didnt cool enough I was informed that what they have is more of a climate control system and not airconditioning So the room was a bit too warm for my liking this was however rectified as they provided a few fans for us to place around the room Also we were told by the restaurant staff that breakfast was included in our stay which is why we ate at the hotel later on at checkout we were informed that this wasn t the case and that we would have to pay However when we informed them of the scenario they waived off the charges so where they stumbled they were willing to rectify which is a very good thing , The location was AMAZING most of the staff were very accomodating and helped us with everything The room was a little small but that was completely negated by the fact that the windows opened over the canal looking out to rembrandt square The hotel building was a beautiful heritage building with a lot of history and the breakfast spread was lavish and delicious 1 member of the party arrived early in the morning and they made room available to her and gave us free early check in which was great because she had just come off a 10 hour flight 
385639,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, nothing , Excellent Location every member of staff was friendly and helpful I left an item in the Hotel and they were also very efficient in assisting me with that 
385640,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Missing a soap dish and that is about all, Fantastic location with extreemly friendly staff Clean and high tech rooms Very clean Great value gor money
385641,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Great location easy access to variety of things to do but just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the main square Had a lovely spacious room with a great view over the canal Such a lovely city 
385642,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, We were really happy with the room overall the whole place was spotless The bed was huge and comfy and there was ample room in the wardrobe with hangers
385643,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, A pity that we were not able to open the windows in the room, the late check out at 5PM on Sunday free of charge really appreciated Service in the breakfast area very pleasant staff 
385644,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The hotel had no gym facilities I had to schlep a mile to a sister NH facility to get into the gym there This was after going through three levels of employees Not worthy of top of the line facility , Excellent location We could walk to almost every attraction around Very good Breakfast recommend pre paying for it 
385645,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, I got upgraded to a room with a view because it was my birthday The staff also helped my boyfriend pull off an amazing birthday surprise Rooms were beautiful and made you feel pampered Excellent location 
385646,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room was very small like a shoe box size, The location of the hotel is prefect in the heart of Amestetdam The bed was extra comfy the room was clean and the staff were very helpful 
385647,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Need to bring baby chairs to the restaurant and a ramp for easy access to the lobby , The staff and service is the best I ve ever experienced I ve stayed many times in my life in 5 star hotels and none had the amazing staff that doelen had The installations are very beatiful and the room was more than I expected Great breakfast served by the amazing British manager there and also the concierge bellboy and everyone went avobe and beyond to accommodate us and our twin babies 
385648,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The aircon was very hot their solution was only to give us a fan and said its a climate control The phone is broken and they couldnt fix it The remote has no batterry and they didnt renew the water At the end after we couldnt handle the heat in the room we did another complain about the aircon also the phone and i gave them the solution to move us to the another room and finally agreed , Clean and great location It should have been the best in everything 
385649,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The rooms are extremely small for a supposedly 5 star hotel Half of the staff was helpful the other half totally indifferent to guests, The rooms have been recently renovated
385650,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Staff service leaves something to be desired polite yes but informative no In light of the price charged for the breakfast the value of it can be improved by making sure that the cooked components stay hot The eggs were lukewarm borderline cold The pastries and other Continental components of the breakfast were of a high standard however You may find noise from the street to be an issue during certain times of the year It did not bother me too much , Location was excellent Good view 
385651,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, No air conditioning cooling I know this is not often required but three nights at this hotel without cooling during the summer was most uncomfortable Will stay elsewhere next time if weather will be warm , Very central location 
385652,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Rooms very small so small the sink isn t even in the bathroom but in room But it IS Amsterdam so forgivable The staff is very stiff never smiling and more worried about doing their job and directing their colleagues rather than setting a peaceful welcoming environment The lady whos clearly head of the breakfast room is absolutely odious to guests and her coworkers and it ruined the who experience of waking up tranquilly and having a lovely breakfast along the water , Clean simple and the location you can t beat 
385653,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, ROOF LEAK On the second night we were watching TV in the evening and heard what sounded like the shower going by itself I walked into the hall and saw that the roof was leaking it was literally pouring out like a shower head The water was not leaking in one place neither it was leaking all over the place in what looked like a pipe style configuration all around the outside and in the 3 lines horizontally I called the duty manager who came to have a look and he said they would try and find us another room We told him we didn t want to move as it was late The following day we didn t hear from the manager or receive an apology despite being told he would get back to us which was disappointing on the customer services part see photos for roof leak evidence The roof continued to drip and bubble the roof over the course of our stay and started to look like it might fall in by the time we checked out CHECK OUT Upon checking out were told we had to pay another E87 50 for the room upgrade which actually really annoyed me as we were told that the room was upgraded for free So I piped up pulled out our receipt and told the chap that we were given the upgrade for free and despite this we also had been given a room with water leaking through the roof To be honest I thought they should have offered a discount because of this as we had not created a fuss but instead they tried to charge us more I really couldn t believe it and was not happy about this at all No apology given and now they are trying to overcharge us The guy spoke in Dutch to another staff member so I didn t know what they were saying They took off the overcharge and then charged us E37 50 for city tax which was also very annoying because there was no mention of this when checking in AND because we were under the impression we paid in full when checking in , I booked this Hotel for a short break in Amsterdam for 3 nights ARRIVAL Upon arrival we were told that were given a free upgrade to a room No 502 with a nice view The guest relations people were nice and friendly and the hotel looked quite up market We had to pay upfront for the whole cost of the room and pay a Euro100 deposit for the mini bar LOCATION The hotel is quite well located and near most of the attractions although its a little trek on foot from the train station ROOM The room was of average size and to be honest I thought it would be a little larger It has one decent sized wardrobe with a safe tea and coffee facilities for free a shower a large HD TV which was nice a couple of bed side tables and a couple of chairs and a large mirror The view wasn t too bad but I m sure the canal side views were better and I certainly wouldn t have paid extra for the view we had see photo for room view BREAKFAST The food was lovely and the service was good No complaints here There is a buffet or you can ask at the table and the water will bring it for you Not sure of the waiters name but he was very good We didn t have dinner here so can t comment but I m sure it would be equally as good 
385654,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The room service Cheese Platter was very poor value for money 12 euros for three small pieces of cheese The other room service meals were very good value so it was very strange , It was immaculate and clean 
385655,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, We had a room with a view and it was so nice and comfortable Even if the room was a little smaller it was still comfortable and very clean and well equipped The staff also was very nice and polite no matter where you met in the hotel Everything can easily be reached from the hotel within only few walking minutes and the area is so beautiful Restaurants and Caf s are all around 
385656,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Advice on purchasing museum tickets Late cleaning of rooms I attention to detail no tissues in box bread left on table in communal area for 36 hours Some indifference from staff ,No Positive
385657,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, BAD SERVICE QUALITY Anybody interest with you You are not like a customer in this hotel don t expect from this hotel you can find better hotel at this location And also room is new but doors is old No sound isolation doors and window I never suggest , NOTHING 
385658,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Did not make my stay less enjoyable however with the hotel being in the centre on Friday and Saturday nights it did get a little noisy outside and sound carried to the room Perhaps different windows would solve this problem , The location was excellent in the centre of the city close to central station tram and metro Very clean rooms comfy bed
385659,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Lovely room with canal view wanted to drop our cases in morning and check in later but they let us check in early as room was ready Staff were very friendly and helpful Great location 
385660,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, at the time the aircon was not working at all This was not repaired in the 5 days i was there , renovated hotel that just opened at the time Nice room good bed and a balcony in the sun 
385661,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The breakfast is really over priced , The ladies staff were excellent Bed very comfortable and the view to the river very nice The renovation has been successful it has given a youthful air to this old hotel 
385662,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing really The hotel was excellent but in terms of transport it is a bit of a walk to the nearest tram stop but actually it is within reasonable walking distance of the station 25mins once you know where it is When you don t know where it is and neither does the taxi driver then it costs 20 Euros from the station as some of the short cuts are pedestrian only after 8pm , All the staff were very friendly and helpful and gave you individual attention Beakfast was perfectly acceptable although quite expensive Because of eggs etc cooked individually which itself was excellent one did have to allow additional time when on a tight business schedule Also Found a very good cafe opposite at which I received equally good attention I will certainly go back to that hotel if I am in Amsterdam again 
385663,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Could not relax in the bar lounge with a drink after 11pm as bar service closes Room very small and air con not working , Staff were absolutely 5 star 
385664,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, More space for luggage , Newly reconditioned with excellent beds and bathrooom fittings Staff were friendly and very helpful Location in the centre meant you could walkto all the sights 
385665,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Room was a bit small but for only 3 nights totally fine more luggage would have been a problem to store Breakfast is expensive especially since a decent one is offered for much less just next door , Fantastic location Couldn t be more central close to the boat tours the shopping areas the flower market the museum area everything reachable by foot Tram stop just a minute away from the hotel All the staff is super friendly and always keen to help and assist with anything you need restaurant recommendation by concierge was absolutely fantastic premises are very clean and bright Breakfast was very nice tasty and everything super fresh beds are very comfortable we had a great sleep I would chose this hotel anytime again 
385666,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, perfect, Lovely hotel in the centre of Amsterdam location could not have been more ideal Everything was clean fresh and staff were very helpful The hotel restaurant Swych is exceptional It is not your typical hotel dinning room the food is some of the best we have ever eaten and the concept behind the menu is fresh and well developed There will be a star here soon Would highly recommend having breakfast included Fresh smoothies super juices cooked buffet and continental Fine fine quality spread 
385667,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, We arrived late due to Easyjet delaying the flight for three hours They guy on the reception desk said that he had no booking for us but eventually found it noone to help with luggage or show us to our room Our room was very noisy the first night due to nearby restaurants and bars Also our windows were covered by polythene due to some renovations so we had absolutely no view of anything We did get a slight reduction on the room rate but it still spoiled our stay and we felt they should not have been using the affected rooms Our complaint seemed to come as a complete surprise to the staff Really , It was a nice hotel and the breakfast was very good 
385668,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, What a beautiful and charming historic hotel Located right in the center of the city it is a perfect hotel for a luxurious getaway to Amsterdam We felt like king and queen there 
385669,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Some noise at night from people walking across canal could have better soundproofing Also there was a scaffold on the edge of my window which I was not informed of ahead of time didn t obstruct my view so didn t really matter no work noise , Bed amazing shower one of best I have ever had in my life room small but clean canal view Good wifi worked in pub across canal Location amazing Central to everything but still not on a super busy tourist street could walk or bike everywhere 
385670,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The first room I was given was really good but it was at the first floor on the street side so I could hear people partying until 4am and cars and motorbikes passing by I asked if a room was available at the upper floors but the room I was given was absolutely not a 5 star hotel room It was like the luxurious version of A Little Princess attic The sink was inside the room I could barely walk between the window and the bed the wardrobe didn t even have drawers the mini bar didn t even have snacks I didn t even know where to put my suitcase The bathroom didn t have heating which was ok because it wasn t too cold outside but I can t imagine during the winter I entered the room got undressed and after five minutes a guy came in without even knocking he left without apologizing and didn t explain the reason why he came in I was quite speechless about a room I was paying more than 300 a night They didn t give me a discount or even offered breakfast My overall experience was not satisfying at all , The location was good as it s in the heart of Amsterdam The staff was friendly and tried to be helpful The room was decorated to a very good standard even considering how small it was and very clean Nice view at the 5th floor 
385671,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing, The room was decorated to an excellent standard very clean and wonderful view we got a free upgrade as we were on holiday for a special occasion
385672,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Excellent location Very comfortable and clean rooms Service on high level Nice breakfast with fresh food REAL 5 hotel Special thanks to Leon for very helpful advises for local cuisine and sights to visit Will come back for sure 
385673,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen,No Negative, Lovely hotel excellent position in one of the best parts of town Our room was newly refurbished to a high standard and was bright airy and fresh Nearest tram stop 2 minutes away Easy to walk virtually everywhere of interest from here 
385674,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Despite being sympathetic to the nice young team of personnel the service was BAD They delayed my cleaning for a whole extra day did not refill my minibar And as for breakfast one morning I came at 7 am sharply and nobody paid attention to me for 10 15 mins They started doing things at 7 15 actually The other morning I came at the hot time and during the hot time they forgot my orders To be sure they did not charge me for the minibar and the cleaning this of course was a nice and proper thing But should not the team better work on the quality of service instead of loosing the money , Location it s right between all the main areas of interest but at the same time in the quite area I heard the birds singing every morning I also liked the old building 
385675,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Nothing at all, I cannot recommend this hotel enough Our stay was amazing in every way A very special mention of Ben and Ryan they were amazingly helpful 
385676,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Five star facilities is weak No spa Very expensive parking fees Shortage of staff no one helped with our bages because there is one guy only, Location good Staff friendly and helpful
385677,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Trainee staff have no knowledge of tourist things to do or scheduling Concierge desk didn t even know where hop on hop off bus tour was And no information pamphlets kept Not acceptable for such a lavish hotel , Location is absolute best Many sites were within short walking distance Staff were friendly and polite 
385678,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Maybe a more personal less corporate approach I also thought the bathroom could have been designed better to create space , A balcony with great views over the canal Nice spacious room 
385679,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, They have very small rooms for a 5 star hotel Price of room was very expensive and wasn t value for money as room was so small and didn t include breakfast , The location was good as its in the heart of Amsterdam 
385680,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Breakfast was too expensive 29 i like the breakfast buffet concept instead of a men that i have to choose and wait I was there for business and i had to wait a bit instead of being able to pick up what i considered despite the brakfast was great as well , This is a boutique Hotel with the high standards from a big chain as NH Hotels Everything is just perfect Location is imposible to be better Food was just delicious staff were too nice and the rooms are incredible Ask for a canal view room u ll be delighted

385685,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Once the restaurant is fully open great place , Lovely hotel staff in a great location I would love to stay there again if I return to Amsterdam 
385686,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Our room was not cleaned up to 4pm and we had specially request clean service and wait outside 40 minutes this is as more strange as somebody managed to grab tips from our room which we left for clean service There were only decaffeinated coffee pods for Nespresso machine distributed every day Hopefully there are few very good cafes at Rembrandt square so we just walked there The window in the shower room is not isolated at all there is 5 10mm gap between the window and the cant through which you can clearly see the channel That is why it was very cold in shower room We had to put big bath towel for thermal isolation onto the window Probably this would not be an issue during the summer time , Very good location Close 5 7 min walking time to city center and to Rembrandt and museum squares the same time Perfect view on the channel Renovated facilities big rooms on the first floor but looks like rooms are much smaller on the upper floors Nespresso coffee machine in the room Very comfortable big bed big and renovated shower room Staff is friendly and helpful 
385687,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Very small room Windows were not very insulated so you could hear people partying outside until 3am Seemed very expensive for just a small room especially without breakfast or anything additional included Difficult to get ahold of front desk staff at times the phone would just give a busy signal , Friendly staff Location was great center of Amsterdam Free espresso coffee in room Great hairdryer Nice canal view

385689,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, There were only 2 members of staff serving at breakfast which meant we had to wait for 10 mins for service and many of the cold dishes needed replenishing Not good enough for a hotel of this cost and quality , The hotel location was first class and the location perfect The rooms were well dressed and modern and the decor made us feel comfortable 
385690,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Our booking was canceled when we arrived fortunately they had room for us I assume technical issues because of recent opening Housekeeping needs improvement , Really good breakfast brand new hotel as major refurbishment is just completed

385693,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, Hotel was still under construction when it reopened The floor was dirty the restaurant was not open for anything other than breakfast and there were ceiling panels missing in the room Staff were nice and tried to be helpful but seems like management waited until after the reopening to train them up , Rooms were nice and finished to a high standard
385694,NH Collection Amsterdam Doelen, The hotel just reopened and we had numerous problems with the infrastructure The most serious one was the shower which had either only cold or hot boiling water Additionally the water system made intense noise The TV was also not working Would have appreciated a discount as many things were not up to the standard a 4 star hotel should have , The hotel is in a beautiful building and great location rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable
