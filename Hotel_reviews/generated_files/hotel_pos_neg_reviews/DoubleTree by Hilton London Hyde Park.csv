56246,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, , The otel is located opposite Hyde Park You can go every where by lovely red buses Rooms are really comfortable and clean Breakfast could be better but it is enough would prefer to stay there at the second time 
56247,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Room was awful tiny sink the size of a A4 sheet of paper with no plug a brick wall for a view not what you would expect for 275 per night Very dissatisfied , Location
56248,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Beds were comfiest i ve ever slept in location was great straight across from Hyde Park close to Notting Hill Portobello Market Knightsbridge Harrods and about 12 uber ride into Soho Staff were great very helpful Rooms had everything you could need 
56249,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, We were assigned to a room on the ground floor next to the entrance and it was quite noisy , Delicious warm welcome cookie upon arrival Welcoming and helpful staff Great location 
56250,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, A little more tea and coffee left in your room would be nice , The room was comfortable clean and fresh Location to 3 train stations great Breakfast is the best the feel service and outlook from the Urban Meadow restaurant is fantastic 3 quiet pubs in Moscow rd a bonus especially the Phoenix to top it off for an extended stay there is a helpful laundrette in moscow rd as well 
56251,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, When we arrived in reception at 1 15 we asked if our room was available and if it would be possible to check in a little earlier than 3pm We had travelled a long way and it was very hot The girl on the desk I didn t get her name she had a foreign accent and wasn t working later on was exceptionally rude She answered very abruptly that the room wasn t ready and we almost got told off for asking the question Such a shame as the rest of the staff were nice She was really snooty and not friendly at all Her attitude was basically how dare you ask to check in early and why are you bothering me Queen rooms are tiny fine but tiny ,No Positive
56252,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, As I try to check into my room the lady customer service was eating a cookie while putting me on hold then licked her finger and asked for my personal identification I booked my room in advance since I have couple of client in the area I need to cater to But unfortunately I was given another room because the room I originally booked wasn t available , The location was great easy access to the famous Hyde park 
56253,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent place to stay with excellent transport links via the Tube With Bayswater station and Queensway station within walking distance giving you three different subway lines you can easily get to any part of London Easy and safe to come back to after a late musical at West End The road Queensway B411 is a nice area with a few really good chinese restaurants Gold Mine and Four Seasons Walk in the opposite direction from DoubleTree and you can walk to Portobello Market in about 20 mins What a wonderful bustling market Beds were comfy Cookie given was delicious Loved it Morning breakfast was ok sufficient But gets a bit boring after a few days as the same food is served all the time stayed for 5 nights Standard hot English breakfast also with cereals muffins breads and pastries Overall highly recommended I ll certainly stay there again 
56254,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, 1 room windows curtains looked worn not really up to 3 star standard let alone the fact that this was a 4 star hotel 2 room never cleaned throughout my stay 3 no morning tea sachets etc left after check in date 4 noisy air conditioning rattling all night long 5 room quite small for a twin bed layout 6 I have stayed in 4 stars where bath robe slippers etc have been provided this was very basic by comparison 7 definitely not worth 243 per night , 1 excellent breakfast great variety very efficient staff spacious breakfast area 2 bed comfortable clean linen 3 close to tube stations 3 all within 3 to 6 minutes walk away and therefore short journey to central London fantastic 
56255,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The booking in was cumbersome tiring and unnecessarilly time consuming especially after a long journey The admissions desk was tucked away and very small when more than 3 visitors visitors were there at once We were asked for our passports emails etc even though we were obviously UK citizens and it was clear they already had all this information via Booking com A number of the staff we encountered had a problem with English which was difficult at times The restaurant was just a caf really not what we would have expected for a hotel of this status , It was comfortable and well located for our business appointment 
56256,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Staff were average expected them to be a little more friendly and accommodating at a 4 star hotel But I would go back , Location was awesome Right next to the park and walking distance to great shopping streets 
56257,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Twin beds we expected a double bed No coffee with the kettle which was tucked away in the wardrobe Not everybody likes the specialist coffees and the room was quite small , Lovely clean with air conditioning as it was extremely hot outside 
56258,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, waited 30 mins to have an order taken for coffee The room was small and dark One window which over looked a back lane The toilet had water leaking all night which made for a poor nights sleep The bath plug was broken and having a shower just lead the bath filling up No complementary water in the fridge 
56259,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Air con was poor Inefficient and loud Tiny room for the money Ready made stewed tea for breakfast And tinned peaches that had gone fizzy , Location is great
56260,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Terrible small handbasin in bathroom that made hand shaving very difficult , Great frontline staff good sized bedroom with comfortable bed Good coffee in room Great location with 3 Underground stations close by 
56261,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Left a phone charger in the room by accident Unable to talk to someone that would help passed between departments and still waiting the call to give me update , Good hotel clean and well equipped 
56262,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, We felt that the staff were a little sombre and unfriendly when we arrived around 1pm at the hotel we were told our check in was at 3pm and we weren t able to go up to our rooms even though our online confirmation stated that our check in time was at 1 2pm We waited about a half an hour until we asked a different person at the front desk and were then able to go up to our room Also the toilet in our room produced a very foul unpleasant stench like sewage which permeated the room and made it difficult to sleep This continued throughout our stay , We liked that the bus stop for London tours was right outside the hotel and the hotel was very close to Paddington station The concierge was very helpful with booking taxis and answering questions about London tours The beds were very comfortable and overall the room was very good 
56263,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The air conditioning was extremely noisy and wasn t possible to get it right until the second night of our stay so for the first night I was either boiling or hot or wide awake listening to a noisy air conditioning unit, beds were very comfy and bedding was nice 
56264,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Nothing to dislike , All staff where friendly and helpful One staff member in particular was extremely helpful My husband left his credit card in the taxi that just dropped us at the hotel Amare phoned the taxi company and within half an hour the card was returned to the hotel and Amare then returned the card to my husband in our room We thank him very much for the extra care and attention 
56265,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Reception staff were extremely helpful and dealt very professionally with some abusive and impatient guests from overseas who demanded priority in making their rooms ready 
56266,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, air conditioning didn t work as well as it could Weather very hot and so difficult to sleep , great location room small but adequate staff great Very good breakfast 
56267,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The mandatory charge on my card of 50 over and above the room fee just in case we used any facility etc this was refunded at check out , The room was to hot and it took an age for the ac to lower the temperature 
56268,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Left an item in the room and had to pay for it to be posted back to us in the same country Procedure long winded and had to fill in forms when I would have been happy to authorise over the phone , Doubletree Hilton always provide a warm cookie at check in They are to die for Nespresso machine in room 
56269,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Bathroom facilities looks being compressed but acceptable Only one bottled water but enough to make two cups of coffee No choices of sparkling water , Good location Nespresso coffee Nice view from Level 7 Quite 
56270,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The Wifi was intermittent in and out, I liked the pillows when staying in Doubletree hotels previously I find the cushions far too soft These were great and I had a fab night sleep The breakfast was great fantastic choice and if I had another hour I would have had more The staff were super friendly and helpful thank you to you all 
56271,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The staff was a bit mechanical and could have have been more dedicated There are no extra facilities such a nice lounge gym etc The safety box did not work , Excellent location with easy access from Heathrow via Paddington station Rooms were nicely decorated with well designed lightning and comfortable beds that gave good sleeping quality The windows are well insulated from road noise Ok breakfast 
56272,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Room is quite smal but comfortable It would be great to have a safe in the room , Easy access to good Asian restaurants in Queensway as well as Queensway tube station Right across from Kensington Gardens Hotel is comfortable and room overlooks Bayswater Road 
56273,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, They really need to buck up with the restaurant 1 One evening at 8 30pm 26 05 I invited 2 people for a drink The waiter I tried to signal to just nodded He passed by again and saw me looking at him He never came up to me But I found out from overhearing what he said to a table of customers who arrived after me that they were not serving any more as they had no personnel He didn t even have the decency to inform me Meanwhile one of his colleagues had the time to come out and take a photo of some other guests So what was that about And might this waiter with the sour face be reminded that he works in the SERVICE INDUSTRY And that PAYING GUESTS are not to be ignored 2 Another evening I went there for a drink with 2 guests We ordered 3 drinks listed on the menu The waitress returned to say that the beer we wanted wasn t available Then she brought 2 bottles of the fruit drinks that we HAD NOT ordered When we pointed this out to her she said the fruit drinks we ordered from the menu were not available But that the ginger beer she brought NOT on the menu was So why do you bother having a menu 3 On the last morning at breakfast I asked for coffee and was served a cappuccino Which brings me to communication In all areas especially the restaurant your personnel could do with a few lessons in English You ARE in England after all , It s location Cleanliness Good front desk 
56274,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, No many restaurants and shops are nearby The room was very tiny the quality of cleanliness was not good restaurant was disappointing , The location of the hotel was great Two underground stations are nearby plus very nice public parks 
56275,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Only thing we could say is that the choices behind the bar were rather limited , Very relaxed atmosphere great location friendly and professional staff Room comfortable and clean Food good 
56276,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, No problems Booking com There is not a category to mark for simply adult family members traveling together I have to mark Family traveling with children under 18 which is only partially correct in that for us it was Family traveling together no children no partner My adult son treated me to this trip Which category should I mark Thank you , Great location near Hyde Park walking distance to Notting Hill Professional friendly helpful reception staff Very good popular restaurant on site Comfortable room Pleasant three day stay 
56277,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Breakfast was okay but it never changed would be nice to have a bit of variety , Fantastic location opposite Kensington Gardens and very handy to tube or bus Room comfortable and has everything you need staff also very helpful Would recommend 
56278,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Nothing at all , The location is perfect It is within just a few minutes walk of three underground stations with all the ways you walk along being lively streets There are many restaurants and traditional pubs in the immediate surrounding and many local shops retail chain stores as well Even the shopping centre Whiteleys is around 7 10 minutes walk from the hotel Just opposite the Hotel is the famous Kensington Gardens As for the inside it is indeed perfectly clean which is a big plus Comfortable room including even a Nespresso machine and capsules Staff is friendly and helpful I do recommend this hotel 
56279,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Room was a little small price a little high but it s London after all , Very comfortable room large window well equipped room overall good positive experience 
56280,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Bed was uncomfortable Pillows were very uncomfortable No decaf coffee in the room Glass used on day one was not changed washed during 4 day stay Cup used for coffee remained in room unwashed over 24 hrs Question cleaning of shower when container dropped in shower was still there after room was cleaned, Staff at check in out were pleasant
56281,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Shower over bath might be tricky if you have any mobility issues as the bath is quite high , Super comfy bed block out curtains for a good nights sleep coffee pod machine was handy shower over bath so you had a choice excellent restaurant and only a very short 2 minute walk to the nearest tube at Queensway Lots of buses to choose from on Bayswater Rd and the Hop on Hop off tour bus stops right out the front 
56282,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Price was high but I guess this is due to location , A comfortable room good bed general amenities with a smallish bathroom but had everything you actually needed Location is just great I arrived on a bus from Oxford and walked from Notting Hill Gate to the hotel The largest park in London right in front of the hotel and very good public transport to everywhere else 
56283,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, I didn t think that the public seating areas were sufficiently large There is a restaurant open all day and a seating are with tables and chairs but no other public lounge at least not one that I found Otherwise we both enjoyed our weekend and were comfortable in the hotel Just be aware that there is a Hilton Hotel at Queensway 200 yards down the road and taxi drivers can be confused unless you specify Hilton DoubleTree on the the corner of Bayswater Road and St Petersburgh Place , The hotel is modern clean and easily accessible Staff were efficient and friendly I reported a plumbing problem which was fixed very promptly Hyde Park is very close as is Portobello Road Market We walked into the West End through the park without difficulty South Kensington is similarly accessible and has Shops Museums and of course The Albert Hall The Bayswater Road is a main route and is well served by bus tube and taxis Euston is about 20 minutes by taxi I liked the fact that each bedroom has a Nespresso Machine I was only sad to find a small number of coffee capsules 3 Possibly more would have been available for the asking It certainly led me to the Nespresso Boutique in Regent Street so the product placement was effective in my case 
56284,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Breakfast wasnt quite as nice as when we have stayed before but they could have just had an off day Had to request tea coffee three times before they brought some and tea should always be brought in a pot not served from a big jug as it tastes dreadful and stewed , Rooms small but very stylish Comfy beds and large walk in shower Proximity to Kensington Gardens a plus for a good walk and only a short taxi ride from Oxford street although you can walk there in 30 minutes
56285,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, I hated this hotel location staff attitude room interior not even clean they charged me more than my rate and didn t get any refund yet and they said I better book through them not booking com, I hated this hotel location staff attitude room interior not even clean they charged me more than my rate and didn t get any refund yet and they said I better book through them not booking com

56287,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The price I agreed on when originally booking was not honored when we arrived Stayed at two other places of lodging while in the UK and prices agreed upon when booking we re honored To me this is bad business and very dishonest , Very clean 
56288,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, We arrived back to the hotel about midnight after returing from wembley where we watched the boxing We sat in the hotel reception area looking at our phones looking for somewhere to eat I approached the night reception gentleman and asked if he could recommend anywhere near by that may still be open for food he was very un heloful and said no He then sent another man over to us to ask if we wanted a room at the hotel We felt very intimidated We walked on the high street and found a nexican restaurant ourselves Very suspicious staff whi obviously thought we were intruders , The location was very good Cleanliness was superb
56289,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The shower curtain was far too long and was dangerous It sat on the bottom of the bath I slipped on this one day We had cocktails at night outside but staff locked the door so we had to walk round into the hotel entrance for the toilet or to order another drink This happened every evening at 11pm , The breakfast was lovely cocktails at the bar were good Room was cleaned to a good standard Staff were nice and helpful and the location is great 
56290,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Couldn t open window I hate air conditioning only rooms , Well appointed room with fridge and all the usual Spotlessly clean Only bad point air conditioning only as no windows open Quiet location on excellent bus routes A bit far out than I personally would have liked but in itself highly recommended

56294,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Blocked shower and tiny rooms I upgraded my stay to a deluxe though Room also was dark House keeper or someone else of the hotel staff entered the room while we were asleep and that was extremely disturbing and inappropriate Definitely not in my future list , The staff were helpful and very friendly

56552,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, No comment , This Hotel is great for a short stay in London if you re after a great Hotel in a fab location choose this We chose King size room which although not an overly large room was perfect for what we needed The room was very comfy and clean the heating air conditioning was very useful and free WiFi was a bonus and strong The staff are very helpful and always have a smile on arrival they present you with their own warm cookies I declined mine due to nuts but gave my partner two anyway The location of the Hotel was perfect for us as was situated a short walk in both directions to local tube stations and if you crossed the road you were immediately in Hyde Park which was great We even walked from the hotel to Marble Arch and Oxford Street although if you re not one for walking I would not suggest this 30 40 min walk The bus stops were right outside the hotel which also made getting around really easy We would recommend The Champion pub which serves lovely cooked food and atmosphere which is a couple of minutes walk towards Notting Hill Gate station The hotel does have an on site Gym and Restaurant Cafe however we did not use these so cannot comment Overall fantastic stay and will possibly be returning in a couple of months 
56553,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, very tiny room not much facilities in the room for a hilton I was disappointed no slippers or bathrobe the hotel is expensive compared to what it offers this is more like a three stars hotel , the bed the hotel is close to the tube Hyde park is in front of the hotel free wifi but not strong 
56554,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Very loud air con shower was unclean bathroom was very very small room was cramped too especially for the amount being charged , The staff were amazing Very helpful and attentive 
56555,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The address of the hotel in the website is incorrect and misleading and the hotel cannot be seen from the main street I ended up going back and forward on the street until I made an educated guess to look for the hotel in a side street where it is effectively located the main entrance Either the hotel should correct its address or provide more information to the guests on how to find it , Good size room for London recently furnished modern comfortable bed quiet located centrally and good hygiene products 
56556,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location breakfast good room size good Unusually the staff at check in acknowledged our request for a room on upper floor and away from lift and acted on it Our room was quiet and perfectly located

56563,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, As always a wonderful stay at the doubletree Location is ideal for exploring Hyde Park and surrounding areas and the beds are still mind blowingly comfortable We opted for a balcony this stay and I would say the views aren t great as this is on the mezzanine floor 1st floor essentially so may not book that again but I would still give this hotel 10 10 That free cookie on check in never gets old either
56564,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, All was good staff lovely and helpful but would have liked nicer bar for drinks unfortunately which looked a little sad and wasn t that appealing, Room was lovely and cosy overlooking Hyde Park could walk to Knightsbridge and was v close to underground 
56565,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park,No Negative, As this hotel is across the road from Kensington Gardens we enjoyed taking an early morning run through the gardens all the way around through to Hyde Park It is conveniently situated and we found getting around London from here to be a breeze Will definitely stay here again when next in London with the family 
56566,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, The hotels Urban Meadow restaurant Good for breakfast but managed by a rude Australian who ensured that it was empty each evening See photo You can walk 100 yards to a restaurant of your choice where the food is better and not overpriced The staff will welcome you , Great location with easy tube access to the West End and all major attractions A short stroll to Notting Hill and shops and restaurants on yourdoorstep Very clean and with one noteable exception the staff were excellent

56570,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Basic levels of English spoken by staff not a big issue but a little improvement or training in grammar the hardest part of the English language wouldn t do any harm just to help make sure everything is clearly understood between both parties involved , Warm cookies on arrival were a pleasant touch 
56571,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, When checking in I had to wait 4 5 mins for a female staff to arrive When processing my checking in she was not friendly at all on the other hand I felt she was bossy and not respectful I have no intention to complain if so I would have taken her name Unfortunately that s sad , Restaurant staff are excellent

56584,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, No relaxing lounge with comfy armchairs settees no where to chill out in comfort have a little peace quiet Pretty clueless reception staff Overcrowded slow service Bar Restaurant more like a noisy staff canteen with ridiculously overpriced drinks even by London standards Poor value poor quality breakfast Located right on a busy noisy main road with poor sound insulation, Nothing much really I have stayed in better Travel Lodges If this is a typical model of a Double Tree Hilton then they need to go back to the drawing board
56585,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Staff at the desk wasn t helpful and I have to remind them to do some simple paperwork But generally they are professional and good at what they are doing , Hotel favilities are new and in good condition It is just 5 minutes walk to a tube station

56620,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Breakfast on the Sunday morning was poor with long queues and very poor service The food was not of a good quality and not regularly replenished Juices ran out as did fruit and to get a tea or coffee was virtually impossible In addition the waiting staff on the rare occasions that they were seen were inefficient and in some instances simply rude , Location is excellent

56633,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, Was booked into accessible room by accident via booking com Later found this to mean disabled facilities or invalid room Very confusing as to a stranger accessible means able to gain access to As a result my partner and I had to endure a washbasin ridiculously low to the ground and a seat being in the shower The room could not be changed due to non availability of a normal room It should be clear on the booking form what accessible room means ie disabled handicapped facilities preferred Additionally due to being allocated this kind of room we were placed on the ground floor at the back of the hotel and had no chance despite prebooking of a higher floor with a park view , Food location open terrace of bar restraunt
56634,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, firstly breakfast advertised at 12 not the case hidden in the small print is you have to book breakfast in advance to get it at this price and it states this no where on the booking not impressed at all otherwise you are ripped off at 17 50 for one breakfast booked on second morning and got at a price 12 50 not the advertised price on booking website at 12 which is added to your hotel room debit or credit card which again they don t tell you felt pressured to finish breakfast by member of staff maybe felt i was eating too much but at 17 50 i was going to eat as much as possible Also not consistant was not asked if I would like tea or coffee on first morning but was asked on second morning secondly on 2 occasions our bedroom door was opened one by housekeeping when their was no tag outside the door to come in and secondly without any warning heard our door opened and closed again not feeling too safe with this happening , cleanest hotel I ve ever stayed in nice touch with the mini fridge and safe in room bed very comfy and air con was brilliant you can put on and off and left the room lovely and cool if you wanted buffet breakfast was lovely and good choice to eat as much as you like

56640,DoubleTree by Hilton London Hyde Park, We booked a King size room bed but stil both the room and the bed were quite small The bathroom was absolutely tiny You could just about get in the door and close it behind you and had to squeeze past the small sink in the corner and carefully try to manouver 180 degrees to sit down on the toilet which was wedged behind the shower cubicle I am average size but a bigger person would never have been able to use this bathroom or shower Also the doors to the rooms are very poorly insulated you could hear everything outside as if the door was open including a lengthy and loud conversation between cleaning staff very early in the morning , Very friendly staff lovely location across the road from Kensington Gardens
