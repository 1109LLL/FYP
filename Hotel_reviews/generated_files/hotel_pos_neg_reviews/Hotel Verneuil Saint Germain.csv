250399,Hotel Verneuil Saint Germain, Very poor value for money the rooms are tiny I know it is Paris but for less than what I paid I had a room in another lovely hotel in the area last week that was twice the size and more beautifully decorated with working a c music and a nespresso maker in the room My a c did not work properly The photos on booking com don t demonstrate just how small the room I had was I couldn t open my medium size suitcase except on the bed only my carry on I don t know how 2 people would fit in the room The hotel charged 5 euro for a nespresso I think that is correct where as everywhere I have stayed in Europe including airbnbs in the last 2 weeks had nespresso makers with complementary coffee , Excellent location good staff lovely bathroom soaps etc good wifi
