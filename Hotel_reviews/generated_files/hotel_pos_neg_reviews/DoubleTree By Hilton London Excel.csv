321350,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No complaints , I liked the location of the hotel For example on a Dockland footpath All in a relaxed area I liked the little things as well like the Earl Grey tea in the rooms The view of the Docklands water outside from the restaurant Good food Free parking and no hassle with the car is fantastic Didn t see any ticket wardens or receive any fines Nice bar area for a pint of beer Lovely rooms with a view Nice staff at reception Brilliant hotel for the meeting in the Excel
321351,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Cleanliness was poor the complimentary bottles of water were empty when reception were told they did nothing Dirty underwear left in our room from previous guest and used towels on towel rail, The location to the DLR for access to the city and Geenwich 
321352,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, My daughter was with me and she managed to leave a jumper in the wardrobe of room 531 As it was an expensive one she rang the hotel when she got home to ask if they could locate it They promised to check and ring her back She did not have a response so rang again and this time the receptionist was quite rude and abrupt with her and didn t appear that helpful needless to say she did not ring back so my daughter then gave up Not good really and based on this issue we would not return back and in future would use the Premiere Inn next door, Hotel overall was excellent only let down by the comment below
321353,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Free parking on site and only a short walk to the nearest Docklands Light Rail station called Prince Regent and this links into the Underground network Right next door to the Excel centre where we had to register for Ride London

321357,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Car park security could be improved for motorcycles An area was provided but had no securing rail to chain a vehicle to and no cctv specifically for that area , The staff were all incredibly attentive and helpful
321358,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Firstly when we arrived at hotel l asked was the room ready by any chance and the receptionist just said no so l told her l did ask for early check in if possible because we had to be somewhere at two she was so rude with a firm answer no smiles what so ever she saidthat Saturday is a very busy day The thing is l only asked a question and when we finally got in our room the smoke alarm was covered so we phoned down to reception straight away to have the plastic removed and we had to ask for key to balcony which l thought was strange, The room was nice bed comfortable bathroom
321359,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Vey noisy fan that disturbed sleep particularly first night of stay Lack of draw space for clothing Toilet button a bit temperamental Remote control for television not fully operational Wasn t expecting to pay a service charge when ordering food and drink from the bar , Comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff Cleanliness of room and how room was tidied by staff Excellent breakfast Very accommodating to allow us bring our bikes into the room

321363,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Didn t have the room I booked superior with sofa bed months in advance When I told reception they just said they didn t have one They did find one when I insisted should not have been put in that position, Staff in restaurant
321364,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The air conditioning wouldn t turn off the room was however at an ideal temperature but the unit was quite noisy which was annoying ps I didn t report this as an issue i m sure it would have been fixed if I did , Was welcomed with a warm cookie The staff were fantastic and the hotel was ideally situated for the excel centre and olympic park by bike The views from the hotel were pleasant and it was a quiet area with hardly any road noise 
321365,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Room was very poor and basic expected more for the price Also booked a family room but the sofa bed wasn t made up so had to request this not a problem but no extra towels etc given for the 3rd person , Good position of the hotel
321366,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, two full size bed for three or more adults family with teenager Also a list with good recommended restaurant in neighbourhood , Breakfast selection great
321367,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Contact with the hotel prior to arrival was poor I arrived late at night and paid for my room on arrival I was shocked to see that I was being charged 450 deposit which I had not been informed about I was then charged another 50 deposit for a key to the balcony door I asked for a receipt for a bar purchase and it took 3 staff members before someone was found who actually knew how to print one off by this time it was 00 45 , Large room with queen sized bed double shower in bathroom and a nice balcony with good views Safe and tea and coffee facilities Also iron and ironing board which was useful One of the cleanest rooms I have stayed in for a long time a credit to the housekeeping team Apart from initial issues with reception and the bar I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel 
321368,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Stayed for 2 nights while running around London 5 minute walk to the station and easy access to all of London from there Emirates cable car experience system is close by and you can even take a stroll there along the lake front The hotel booked me in early 11am to be exact as they had rooms open even if rooms are not open yet they have an excellent luggage storing facility even once i had checked out the looked after my bags till it was time to go to the airport Great friendly staff that were very helpful and super efficient the staff greet you and make you feel at home The breakfast was a super range and variety making sure you did not go hungry Even Dinner at the hotel was excellent have a great menu and decent prices The rooms are spacious and clean with good aircon systems so even with the heat wave in London the room was cool and comfy a large TV and good shower make it a home away from home Even though you are only a short distance from the London City Airport you can not hear the plane taking off from the rooms super quiet Will definitely be staying there again 
321369,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Took a long time to get served at the bar , Really comfortable bed and it was incredibly soundproof Couldn t hear anything even though it s right next to the airport The warm cookie on arrival was a nice touch 
321370,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The payment process where you pre pay and make the final pay on the morning on check out My experience on the morning where the queue was long so I use the express service to drop the Key card left and had to go back next day to finish the payment presently with my card Wish someone said something about it , The Room size and simplicity also the View is amazing 
321371,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Air conditioning very noisy could not switch off Surrounding area very untidy litter bottles never cleared over our stay Does not give a very good impression , Room good Breakfast good
321372,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Breakfast wasn t great compared to other hotels Room had nowhere to hang stuff and there was no water provided compared to other hotels of similar rating, Location was perfect Staff were great
321373,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No trouser press essential for a disabled person The room was just about suitable for a disabled person though I had to get staff to move one bed just to get in I then needed someone to close the curtains The high tech radio alarm did not work , Restaurant staff extremely helpful to me I am disabled 
321374,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing it was perfect for me , Great hotel with very friendly staff Check in was a breeze Room was spotless The room I had was on the 3rd floor overlooking the airport but you still can t hear any aircraft noise The tripple glazing definitely works Breakfast was fabulous spoilt for choice The bar staff were great and the bar area itself was very relaxing The bar menu also had a good choice of meals and the food I had was very tasty Location was perfect for the Excel Center 5 minute walk along the waterfront Would definitely stay there if attending the Excel again Highly recommended 
321375,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, When looking on the map I thought the hotel would be closer to where I was going Next time I would pick a different location for my needs due to proximity DLR train is within walking distance though Even though the rooms had A C room felt stuffy Room was checked by maintenance and was working appropriately Didn t like the pillows I am particular on pillows , Nice clean hotel Staff were very nice and helpful on all shifts Breakfast buffet was great Ate once in hotel bar and food was good Mattress on bed was comfortable 
321376,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Cannot fault this hotel , Location is perfect for attending conference at ExCel Managed to get one of the free parking spaces so no additional parking costs Room on top floor Hilton Honours floors were top 2 floors and amazed at how quiet my room was considering we are next to city airport Air conditioning was good and with temperatures outside reaching 30 degrees it was much appreciated The freshly baked cookies at reception were a nice touch Comfy bed good free Wi Fi clean and functional bathroom room faultless cleaned each day 
321377,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff were rude room inadequate offers not fulfilled no toilet paper one day overall very disappointed, This is never a 4 hotel the only good thing about it was the location
321378,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Check in is a bit too early When eating in the restaurant one member of staff was rushing us to make a decision on what to order , Bed very comfortable Cookies upon arrival was a nice touch 
321379,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, The bed was amazing the pillows a dream all very comfortable and clean facilities All of the staff are very helpful I thoroughly enjoyed my stay I liked everything about the Hotel 
321380,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Overpriced restaurant and bar Poor breakfast There are not many restaurants around and the closest supermarket is about 20 minutes away Walls are not soundproof Carpet everywhere therefore not ideal for people who are allergic Staff was not very attentive and seemed rude , Great location especially for business travellers Close to the ExCel Canary Wharf Stratford and London City Airport Direct connection to Central London without changing trains Fully air conditioned Refurbished bathroom
321381,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, This was not the hotel I was led to believe I had booked very confusing I upgraded to a room with a queen bed but the room we were put in had a double and air con the didn t work took 2 hours to sort out by that time the 50pound of food I had ordered was warm and took my husband to go mad before it was changed , When we were finally moved to the right room with air con other than the fact we has no fridge the room was lovely
321382,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Lack of information from front desk Did not receive complimentary cookies Lack of control over AC , Bed was comfortably and the view accross the airport amazing
321383,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There is nothing I didn t like about my stay if I had to state something the t v was slightly temperamental but it wasn t worrying me in the slightest , The staff as soon as we arrived was extremely helpful by taking our bags as we arrived way before check in The staff also managed to get us into our room hours before hand very chatty and pleasant Questions which we asked was never a problem and they did anything they could to help us
321384,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing, The room was very clean same with the bathroom plenty of towels and shower gell etc tea coffee in the room bottled spring water first class would definitely recommend n
321385,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Very pleasant welcome and within a short walk to the DLR line Surprisingly quiet in spite of the proximity with the London City airport The staff responded well when a challenging situation occurred 
321386,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Size of bed we booked a queen suite and yes We read the bed was a double however an English double is not sufficient for 2 people to sleep in and unfortunately left a lasting impression our view was of the car park only 2 pillows were supplied no spares there was free wifi but no one at reception proffered the password nor was it provided in the room so we had to walk back down to reception to get it it said there was a free shuttle bus Being so close to the airport we assumed it was to the airport but no it was to canary wharf overall we felt a little misled To top that off we had Hilton honours membership but later read all Hilton Honours members were located on a higher level floor than we were , Size of room and location to airport
321387,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We had water bottles and drinks which kept getting warm because of the weather therefore it would have been nice to have a little fridge in the room which we could use to store drinks , I loved the comfort of the bed and the fact that the walls were sound proof so we couldn t hear the noise of the airport next door to us The AC was a great help because of the heat as well as the amazing curtains which blocked out any sunlight we didn t want in the room The reception staff were also very helpful the complimentary cookies were such an amazing touch Definitely a hotel I will be booking again when we come back to London
321388,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent choice for beakfast items Bar menu very good and the food was delicious 5 Minutes walking distance to DLR and O2 accessible via Emirates cable car 
321389,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, See above The location is excellent for those travelling to and from London City Airport , The bed and air conditioning were both good so I slept well The food was expensive for what I chose from the menu for dinner and the breakfast was good value only if you were very hungry and had plenty of time to spend over it 
321390,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The hotel is a 15 minute walk to the airport An airport shuttle even at a fee would have been a nice touch, Being served warm cookies upon arrival after an overnight flight put a smile on my face
321391,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Our only regret is that we didn t stay longer , The hotel was easy to find from the DLR station and for the duration of our stay all of the staff were friendly and helpful we received a room upgrade on arrival as they did not have the twin room we booked The room we were allocated was great very clean and spacious and with perfect weather we made the most of our stay in the area and walked by the river and took ride on the Emirates Air Line to take in the views We definately enjoyed our stay here and will definately be back 
321392,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, When we arrived back in the evening the reception staff were surly and made us feel uncomfortable and worried as they questioned if we had a room booked even though we had checked in earlier that same day I think they had mis typed my surname but even so they could have been a little more polite and friendly Breakfast was over priced for a self service facility Location not brilliant if you are looking to do touristy things in the centre of London there is not far to walk 5 mins to DLR station but then about 30 mins train ride to get to Tower Gate and underground system , The staff when we had checked in early and left bags were cheerful and helpful and the welcome cookies were indeed very welcome The room was a good size and the room and the shower were clean Hotel is in good position near river there were nice views from our window and from the windows in the stair lift wells Great location if you are going to ExCel Greenwich Olympic village or anything in that area 
321393,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, My partner and myself had checked into another hotel just down the road from Doubletree and it was awful it was cramped the bathroom was tiny and the toilet wouldn t flush The walls were so paper thin you could hear people talking in the next room as if there was no wall there at all As it was obvious we weren t going to be able to get any sleep there we went online and reserved a room at the Doubletree We had been there less than 30 minutes but they wouldn t refund any of the 360 We had paid So by the time we reached the Doubletree we were very stressed out and upset but the staff at Doubletree were very welcoming and friendly and the cookies we got when we checked in were lovely Breakfast was delicious and set us up for each day sightseeing around London There was no noise from neighbouring rooms the only sound you could hear was the occasional door slamming The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Prince Regent DLR station for connections to the underground You can also take the cable cars across to the 02 arena The hotel had beautiful views of the river and we would definitely stay here again 
321394,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We were using London City Airport so booked there for convenience but not a good location for sightseeing , We were upgraded to a suite Very nice room Breakfast catered for all diets Staff very helpful and friendly The cookies on leaving is a nice touch 
321395,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Air conditioning unit in room had very little power We asked for a fan it didn t arrive When receptionist asked if all had been ok the next day when we were checking out we said the fan didn t turn up she then informed us that they don t have any When my Daughter went back up to the room as we checked out because she thought she had left the car keys on the bed room service was already in the room My Daughter said the lady she asked about the keys was very abrupt and frankly rude to her And didn t answer the question as to whether or not she had found any keys , Beautiful Hotel We spent very little time in there but what time we were there was quiet and relaxing Immaculately clean in every area we went to We would go again It was nice to be near the river and to have lovely clean fresh air To be right away from the hustle and bustle of the City but merely a short taxi ride into the City 
321396,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The shower area in our accessable room would overflow all over the bathroom floor making it very poor to walk on for my disabled wife in case of a slip Also the air conditioning unit in the main room was very noisy throughout the night which had to be on because of the heat and no opening windows , Superb helpful staff both at reception and in the resteraunt and bar Excellent selection of food both in the main dining resteraunt and the morning breakfast dining 
321397,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There was only one hook in the bathroom which for a double room was a bit silly Nowhere to hang towels although plenty of space on the wall for towel rails Also all the lights were operated by one switch on only one side of the bed which was very annoying It would be much better if each person had control of their own side light The other annoying thing was that I would like to have been able to buy a decent coffee in the morning without having to take breakfast I asked at reception but that option wasn t available With no shops or restaurants in the area I thought this a bit remiss As ever the instant coffee available in the bedroom has no flavour same in any hotel , It was clean and the staff were helpful It was great that we were able to park there at no extra charge
321398,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No communication before arriving advising room was not ready due to apparent pipe leak Bath mat filthy See pic Duvet cover dirty Did not get what we requested at time of booking , Breakfast was nice 
321399,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The breakfast was poor quality and not the usual options usually available in Hilton hotels This is a budget Hilton in style Lunch service was very slow however staff were fabulous and very helpful and the food when delivered was worth the wait Terrible location If i stayed jete again a car is a must due to personal safety fears returning late at night on public transport , The staff are as one expects from Hilton staff friendly professional and helpful Nothing is too much trouble The beds are extremely comfortable and the curtains ensure not a single seeping of light to disturb sleep 
321400,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The view from my room wasn t great but you can t have a great view from every room in the building , Rooms have everything you need perfect for over night trips business or to be close to the local airport Bar area is beautiful and serves food till late which was lovely and good quality View from my room wasn t great but from other points of the building were lovely over looking the river Breakfast is well worth the money it has such a large variety Staff were friendly and welcoming on arrival and check out Tube station is only 5 mins away with links to the underground to get all over London Airport near by so loads of planes taking off really good to watch and from inside you couldn t really hear much noise 
321401,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The rattly noisy inefficient room aircon , The location suited our social plans but might not suit everyone The staff were very professional and friendly I wanted to watch the Lions 2nd test on Saturday morning and they happily arranged to turn on the TVs in the closed bar Good sized room for London with comfortable bed The only criticism was that the room aircon was inefficient and unbelievably noisy blowing hard and rattling as if it was going to fall to pieces Breakfast was absolutely fine for a buffet Parking slots are available but they are in high demand We arrived at around 1145 easily found a slot and were checked in by a delightful receptionist 
321402,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No particular hang ups about the room or hotel but would have been good to have a mini bar or fridge available , Fantastic room very clean beds extremely comfortable Room service also very good Very close to London City Airport but no excess air traffic noise and close proximity to Prince Regent underground beside ExCel centre therefore great for travelling in and out of the City centre 
321403,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Good standard hotel easy to get in and out of London Clean rooms comfy bed and the hot cookies daily were amazing Easy to commute into the centre and even Wembley for the concert we were going to DLR to Canning Town then Jubilee Line Good helpful staff and the gym was a bonus Would definitely stay here again 
321404,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, When booking there was no mention of having to pay an additional 50 on arrival for any charges incurred during the stay This should have been made clear at booking stage , Cannot fault the staff Personally enjoyed the view of London City Airpirt out of our window 
321405,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, We got free upgrade for my daughters 21st b day Balloons decorated little cake on a plate with a card wishing her a happy Birthday was lovely Made it special for her Thank u very much
321406,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We had to wait nearly 10 minutes to be served at the lounge bar because the bar person left to collect a food order for a guest When she returned she was sullen with us and did not apologise to us or others for keeping us waiting so long , Breakfast was well organised and in a calm environment with lovely views outside The breakfast food was delicious and plentiful 
321407,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The was nothing that we didn t like , The staff on reception where really friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome We were given a lovely room on the Hilton HHonors floor which was a real treat The breakfast had a great selection and plenty of food available The hotel staff very kindly allowed us to watch the Lions Rugby match in the Bar on the Saturday morning and the fresh hot cookies and the best Very happy with our stay and how well we were looked after 
321408,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The air con in the room seemed to come on and go straight to being really cold It wouldnt turn off so had to turn it to hot before it eventually went off on its own Also the lights in the bathroom are a little dim Not great when you are trying to do your makeup but thats just me , Great comfy bed Spacious room great facilities easy check in loved the steam proof mirror in the bathroom Have stayed here before and was just as good as the first visit And free cookie at check in is a bonus 
321409,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The elevators are a bit small, The hotel rooms were a great size super clean and a good hotel all round The room service food was excellent and well priced
321410,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Could feel the bed springs through thin mattress but to be fair I didn t complain as we were only there one night They may have addressed this if I had complained , Friendly kind staff great location for access and the fee parking
321411,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Confusion over change in booking hotel didn t have updated request for change of requirements Hotel were able sort appropriate room to meet requirements , Room was good breakfast very good Service from staff very good 
321412,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Noisy air con Window looked onto other rooms so unable to open curtains Car parking unclear which spaces are owned by the hotel or pay and display, Staff very helpful
321413,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Beds were really comfy best I have slept in from a hotel ideal location for o2 no noise lovely view staff very friendly and helpful I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again
321414,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Free parking spaces are limited around 20 but plenty of parking available at 12 00 a day , Clean modern good transport links close by for getting into the city perfect for a weekend city break 
321415,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only thing that could have been slightly better was that the cleaning staff didn t change the bed and there was a stain on it and they tried to hide it , I was running the London Marathon the staff were pleasant enthusiastic and bent over backwards to help me 
321416,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, All ok, It was just a stop for the night really so we did just put bags in room the left to see guns N roses did not get back till very late so shower cup tea bed but bed was comfortable shower good as well did not go in restaurant so can not comment on that but was in good place to get tube if it was running but we had to go on replacement bus not fun getting back but I would use it again if I was going to the same venues
321417,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Parking is advertised as free but there are limited spaces Most people have to pay and display , Warm cookie per person on arrival Good quality key card entry system Front desk always manned by two people Two lifts so no waiting around Amazing bar area for relaxing with great decor Food presentation wonderful Breakfast had a massive selection of items all tasty and cooked or displayed nicely We finished ours with coffee and mini pastries No charge for a toothbrush and paste kit either This hotel is easy to access by car and not noisy Right on the river Links for bus and DLR are very close I asked for a room with a view and they assigned us to an honours room on the top floor which was great 
321418,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff Bar staff were awful and no smiles from reception staff, Location is great normally the dlr is good but this visit there was engineering works so travel was difficult Bed was very comfortable and bathroom shower was great Breakfast was very good 
321419,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The bacon was slightly over done , Despite the airport it was surprisingly quiet and far enough out of the chaos of london The staff where very helpful and nothing was too much to ask Breakfast was a good buffet set up and sorted us out for the morning Will use them again 
321420,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, We arrived late after a concert and got to the room and appeared to only have a single bed I made call to reception and no hassle got upgraded to a suite room 
321421,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The disabled car parking bays were taken up by cars with no blue badges staff did not care and would not ask guests to live from these bays very disappointed, Nice size room
321422,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Deposit required on top of your room payment Feels like in dogy car rental company never experienced hotel deposits in europe Awful food Awful coffee taste English breakfast was tasteless disaster Smoked salmon salad for lunch was tasteless rocket tasted like plastic No craft beers even in bottles Aging rooms shower felt like cheapest equipment from argos towels had holes, Brilliant staff saves this place
321423,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Attentiveness of staff management had to constantly repeat requests from the front desk to restaurant , Bedroom and bathroom both clean and tidy Working air con and in room kettle with tea coffee 
321424,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Breakfast for 12 50 was rather expensive The signal on the television was quite poor and it kept freezing and cutting out , The room was a very good size and was quiet even with the planes overhead they were infrequent The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was pleasant 
321425,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, the only thing we could be critical off is customers using the restaurant as a corridor, The room was great and very comfortable the staff were really helpful and very friendly The breakfast was outstanding 
321426,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Hotel was a little remote at present, The hotel was very clean and comfortable with a very good selection at breakfast also all the staff were friendly and helpful In a few years time the location will be very accommodating as the regeneration in the area is clear to see thank you
321427,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Location is a little out it s ideal for London ExCeL but a bit of a walk to cross the river If you re not in any rush as such it s fine but you have to add in an extra 20 30mins to cross the river and walk to the hotel from the O2 area , Good high spec hotel
321428,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Lack of staff at bar after returning from gig in evening and fact they said they would email me invoice from fast check out which they did not until I called and chased , Stayed as seeing Depeche Mode gig close by Hotel was great staff friendly room great However after gig the bar was full of fans returning from gig one few staff serving in bar took at least 20 mins to get drink but it was late about 11 30pm Overall great hotel Only complaint I had is we opted for fast track check out they asked you to put your email address on key card which I did they said they would send you invoice They never did have had to chase them 3 times 
321429,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Maybe a bit more of a selection for breakfast for people on a strict Gluten free diet Although gluten free bread was available it would have been nice to have had gluten free sausages hash browns and black pudding All these are easily and readily available from most food retail outlets and could be frozen So if someone has an intolerance to Gluten they could let reception know to tell the chef to get out of the freezer the night before It was an expensive Bacon egg beans and tomato only for me , We liked this hotel during our one night stay It was convenient for the DLR with connections to the centre of London The staff were all friendly and very welcoming The bar stayed open late into the early hours of the morning after our evening out at a concert We were all very happy with our hotel choice and would consider coming back here should we ever be staying in London again 
321430,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, only issue was that they had no record of my booking on the system so had to find paperwork relating to booking com to confirm it had been made, would have liked to enjoy the hotel m ore but time was limited Great bar and social area and a warm cookie on arrival was a great touch
321431,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Too many people parking in Disabled spaces who should not have been parking there This parking is important for people like my wife who have a blue badge It needs to be enforced more , Easy to get to good reception staff breakfast was good choice and quantity quality 
321432,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Could of had more bar staff on at night as it was busy also more staff on reception when checking out in the morning , The staff would cater for everything you asked for And very polite too Very clean rooms and a massively comfy bed walk in shower instead of a shower over a bath was a bonus Iron and ironing board and hair dryer in the room helps 
321433,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There could have been a sea view to over look from the room There could have been shops near by to walk to and a grocery store for snacks the location was a bit in the middle of no where , I enjoyed the welcome with the delicious warm cookies and the staf were amazing to help with everything
321434,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Free parking is very limited only 30 spaces at the front of the hotel , The breakfast was first class the bar well stocked Room was large and the bed was very comfy 
321435,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Free parking advertised and yes between 5 30pm and 9 30am it is free but we arrived at 2pm and as there were no free spaces at the front of the hotel there is 16 in total we had to pay and display for 10 as the 5 option only gave 2 hours and we needed to cover ourselves for 3 5 hours Lots of people in reception moaning about the so called free parking too and others sat in their car waiting for a free space to appear when someone left not a great way to spend your leisure time ,No Positive
321436,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, They only received the booking for two adults although I had booked for two adults AND a child Had to change our room and make up a sofa bed for us ALSO although I specified breakfast on my booking this didn t get to the hotel they did not have breakfast already on their records ALSO both of these thing happened last year when we booked through Bookings com for the same hotel , Convenient for where we wanted to go in the evening
321437,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I couldn t sleep the first night because the aircon was very noisy and the thermostat don t seem to be that effective No fridge in the room What annoyed me the most was that I could have chosen the nearby Aloft hotel which was a pound cheaper for my stay it was closer to the train station and also it is a much better more modern hotel with better facilities ,No Positive
321438,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Air conditioning was a bit weak and we couldn t open the window to let any air in at all , Limited free parking complimentary cookies on arrival and very close to the Excel centre Large bed with 4 thick pillows free and easy Wifi 
321439,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Some form of direction to the nearest rail system Albeit the staff did explain how to get there when asked , We were very surprised with the size and furnishing of the rooms We were given a studio apartment type of accommodation which exceeded our expectations hugely The area around the dock was very pleasant with lots going on 
321440,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I didn t like that when I went to the hotel the staff told me that I was needed a deposit of 50 which I didn t know anything about because the information wasn t on the website ,No Positive
321441,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, room service was quite poor we were left waiting an hour and 20 minutes for our food However in saying that we did get the drinks and one of the deserts on the house though we probably should have got the whole thing on the house but oh well One of the beds was also quite dusty , quick check in and out friendly staff comfy beds 
321442,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It s minor but the shower did not have much pressure Maybe a bit pricey for the location but we were there during a busy weekend , The delicious cookies offered on arrival The room was clean and comfortable Easy to access on foot from the Prince Regent DLR station Loved the Crabtree Evelyn shower products And most importantly the staff was absolutely lovely at any hour of the day whether it was at the reception area at the restaurant for breakfast or at the bar for a late night dinner 
321443,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The tap ring fell off while it was still functional it was a bit unnerving The hair dyer was also cracked still functional but unnerving They also charged us a little more than on the booking com website , It was incredibly close to the venue we were attending which is a complete bonus The bathroom and bed were clean and comfortable the pillows were extra soft and the staff were so accommodating 
321444,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Mini fridge in the room would be good Did not like having to pay an additional 50 for services I MIGHT use which is thrn refunded back to me I do think this is a very cheeky policy and could tell the receptionist was embarrassed to ask me to do it , Good sized room friendly staff great breakfast buffet
321445,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It s a shame you have to pay to park at the hotel although for our 3 day stay it only cost 34 so we can t complain really Also our room faced onto the car park but had a tree outside the window so didn t have a view of anything , The staff at reception were exceptionally friendly and helpful supplying us with free warm cookies on arrival Rooms were very quiet considering it s location being so close to the city airport Rooms were spotless couldn t fault them The bar area was very inviting with tv s and sofas and drinks were not badly priced either 
321446,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only reason I didn t give a 10 10 is that for the price I d expect a breakfast to be included not 17 extra a person Also their is only parking for around 30 cars , The bed in the queen room was heaven and the staff at the reception were some of the most amazing friendly people I ve met
321447,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Parking is very limited Some confusion over the bill when paying by debit card Will pay cash next time , Really loved this hotel The check in was smooth and we were greeted by friendly staff and a free warm cookie The facilities were great The room actually had a plug socket next to the bed which is logical but mostly unheard of in other hotels Location was excellent no pun intended but right next to the Excel Centre for our weekend at Comic Con Over all a fab hotel 
321448,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Having only one window that was double glazed but I understand the need to keep the noise of the airport at bay , Nice room and view of the river and the city airport 
321449,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, The staff were absolutely fantastic on arrival the female receptionist couldn t have been more helpful she was extremely proactive at getting someone up to set up the sofa bed in the room on departure the male staff member at reception was very helpful polite giving us information to get into London via tube allowed us to leave car in car park for the rest of the day while we explored London
321450,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The fact I had only booked one night I wish I d booked two , We arrived at roughly 10am and our room was ready to check in which was brilliant so we could get unpacked showered and changed Complimentary cookies on arrival and when we checked out we cheekily asked for more and the staff were more than happy to oblige The car park is right outside and free although there are limited spaces Check out time is midday which is brilliant but when I enquired about this the receptionist pushed it back to 1 30 
321451,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, For a really expensive room 380 there was not so much as a bottle of water or fridge with drinks OK so there was a kettle and tea and coffee but nothing else I took two clients to the restaurant ordered and after about 45 minutes enquired about the delay in service They has actually LOST the order and we waited another 1 2 hour In fact we arrived at 8 00pm and we were finally served at 9 30pm and this has the Hilton name Service was so bad the manager of the restaurant didn t charge us but I was VERY embarrassed , Room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom 
321452,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, The room was bright airy and very clean Plenty of towels and shower gels etc in the bathroom Air conditioning in the room made it a very comfortable nights sleep as I don t like a warm room Food in the restaurant and also room service was excellent and very keenly priced Staff were very friendly and never walked past you without acknowledging you 
321453,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Clean comfortable rooms friendly helpful staff Great breakfast our grandchildren loved the selection Very convenient location for us even when we had a trip into the centre of London having the DLR on the doorstep made the trip easy Will definitely use again 
321454,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Missing maintenance I notice some broken fixtures in the bathroom not anything serious but for a 4 star hotel I don t think it is acceptable Some of the pillows didn t seem well cleaned and there were some magazines in the bed side cabinet that I believed were from the previous guest also unacceptable , The room was comfortable and large and the staff was friendly 
321455,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Not knowing of this hotel before, Everything went way beyond my expectation friendlieness of staff cleanliness of hotel times food could be ordered free parking
321456,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Location not particularly nice area and few options for food and drinks etc Hotel more for business than pleasure , The room was good and managed to get a free parking space Easy to drive to as well 
321457,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Price of breakfast, Staff ok wasn t impressed that I had to do a 50 deposit as well as room price I wasn t told this before which I was not happy with
321458,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing everything was excellent , The staff were so accommodating and very friendly A quaint hotel with a lot a charm very welcoming feel I travel a lot for work and this has been by far the best hotel I ve stayed in 
321459,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Only hiccup I paid for my breakfast with cash gave the waitress our room details but upon departure it shows a balance o s The staff even gave my daughter another free cookie upon departure I have every confidence this will be sorted , With a fussy daughter the hotel and staff more than exceeded our expectation Nothing was too much trouble for anyone cleanliness staff food bed location close to the o2 arena Hoping to return in the school holidays for our sight seeing of London Thank you from Sherri and Grace
321460,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Wonderful hotel very friendly caring and attentive staff Unfortunately I ended up in the hospital for two days during our five night stay Each day the staff inquired about my health and asked if we needed anything When we were checking out we were informed that there would be no charge because our holiday had been disrupted by my illness We were speechless We had never experienced such caring and generosity We are eternally grateful to the management and staff of this fine hotel 
321461,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, N a, Top hotel Our honeymoon so we was upgraded to a room looking out with a beautiful view Staff extremely friendly and meal at night was delicious 
321462,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Disappointingly expensive for what we received Booked a 3 person room Only set up for 2 had to wait for bedding for 3rd then re call for more pillows No cups teaspoons tea milk for 3 Went to the bar couldn t make the most basic of cocktails as we don t have the ingredients Breakfast food was OK but nothing special above the ordinary Just shy of 250 was grossly overpriced for the facilities provided , There wasn t much to like really
321463,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There was nothing I didn t like , The whole stay was great friendly staff lovely breakfast warm temperature throughout the room and very comfortable It was within close proximity of the venues we were visiting Ideal for couples to get away and relax I would stay again

321465,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Only thing I didn t like was that we were only there for two nights , We booked our room so that we had somewhere to stay on our wedding night for two nights When we arrived at 2am we were still able to check in and the staff were amazing We were given warm cookies and to top it off they upgraded us to a suite free of charge as a wedding gift The suite was awesome clean and very comfortable I had to remind myself that we were only there for two nights Would definitely come back here to stay
321466,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Bed was a bit hard for my liking Also the a c never quite got cool enough and a swimming pool would have been nice for the asking price however it s not a bad point as we knew there wasn t one when we booked , Free WiFi food was great in bar very friendly staff and very quiet considering there was an airport right outside the window 
321467,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, not really a negative but seems staff at the front desk English wasn t their first language so was a struggle sometimes understanding them , good location to the 02 which is why we stated there 
321468,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Restaurant overly expensive Hilton s policy of randomly blocking Freeview TV channels is a regular bone of contention Here channels as popular as E4 E4 1 and Dave were not available And when I queried this with the desk staff most of whom were not very fluent in English they claimed to have never heard of any of the above and asked if they were satellite channels , Spacious room and bathroom No ethical issues re wi fi privacy Walking distance of DLR station 
321469,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, We thought the location would be nearer the Excell than it was We wanted to eat at the Victoria Docks and it was a good 20 minute walk which we did not expect
321470,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The room service was very bad we requested bathrobes and slippers it took around an hour or so for it to be delivered and when the lady arrived she was pushing the items with force towards me and trying to step inside the room when I asked her not to She wasn t communicating and was very angry for some reason Second thing we ordered bed and breakfast everything we got was dry hard and the eggs undercooked So we decided to try the pastries when we found a black piece of hair attacked to the chocolate croissant It seemed like all the food was a collection of previous servings to other rooms as nothing was fresh or clean When we were checking out I was explaining this to the receptionist who didn t take note and ignored my concerns That s Why I m writing a review here I m very shocked about such service As doubletree used to be my number one pick , I like the location
321471,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We were very disappointed that there was no bottled still water in the room when we got there We looked for a mini bar but there wasn t one of those either When we arrived the receptionist gave us a complimentary warm cookie but we would have preferred a complimentary bottle of water as we had travelled for quite a few hours and went straight to our room and would have liked a drink of water Also I d forgotten a nail file and most hotels have a complimentary nail file in the bathroom but the water was the most disappointing All rooms should have bottled water we think and most do We stay at a lot of hotels all over the country , The bathroom and shower was lovely bedroom very well laid out with a sofa Breakfast was also very nice 
321472,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The shower power wasn t as great as it could have been , Staff we met checking in and out were all very nice Nice spacious room with good air conditioning and a comfortable bed 
321473,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I was unaware of the 50 security deposit I didn t buy or purchase anything at the hotel during my stay once I left I only noticed that they didn t refund me back my deposit The staff at the hotel was not helpful and it took quite a while till they decided they wanted to refund my money Terrible service ,No Positive
321474,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There was hair in the shower and dirt when we first arrived in our room and bathroom light was broken asked reception to sort it out and a maitence man came up fixed the mirror but just got a towel and cleaned the shower and said don t worry about it We then ordered room service and I had sassuages and mash and my partner had the Halloumi salad all seemed well until I started eating the mash and there was a very long hair in it as you can guess not impressed and spoke to management imedeitley the Breakfast was a lot better in the morning , Cookies on arrival

321482,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I didn t like the fact that there was no shops close by they was all around 15 20 mins walking distance which wasn t very good for me Also the fact that I paid so much money and the room didn t look any thing like the pictures and the bath room looked damaged which wasn t very appealing I tried to call down to order food but nobody picked up the phone for around 20 mins , I like the spaciousness of the room The staff there was very nice especially the young Black lady didn t get a name Upon check in she was so welcoming and nice she even gave me a cookie which made me feel that much more better and even when I asked for more sugar and an extra sheet she was more then happy to help me with those things she made me and my boyfriend very welcome

321491,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, I stayed the night before after the London Marathon They put on a special marathon buffet dinner and an early breakfast They offered free warm cookies and little things like a sign saying congratulations to all runners made the trip a bit more special Excellent location and above all really friendly staff 
321492,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Bed was too bouncy and noisy creaked when we moved Shower head seemed to shoot more water out of the door than over my wife The switch for the bedside lights turned on all the lights couldn t isolate it to use the excellent reading light without lighting up the whole room Had booked inclusive breakfast but the Maitre d didn t know and wasn t keen to let us in On checking out the desk staff tried to charge the cost of the breakfast to my card without explaining what she was charging for when I finally worked out what she was doing I then had to show her the booking confirmation to prove that the meals were pre paid , There was a great selection for Breakfast

321498,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Noisy vents couldn t sleep in room 433 Had to complain twice and the engineer was useless to try and get the noise down I did ask for a quiet room to begin with so reception staff at check in could ve been more vigilant , The cookie and staff did try to be helpful 
321499,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, For a good quality hotel the choice of coffee in the room is poor Bed was too firm and lack of mini fridge in room was disappointing , Good location lovely staff warm welcome

321504,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There isn t much in the surrounding area so it s really just a base for the night rather than a destination in itself Ideal for the excel arena though , Breakfast was very good and varied Staff were very helpful 
321505,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, everything was great, We couldn t fault this hotel it was perfect The staff were wonderful helpful caring and super friendly The little extra special touches like a warm cookie on arrival were very much appreciated 
321506,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I was under impression that car parking was free at the venue this is why I booked but was told on arrival that limited spaces only and that if no spaces available then you would have to pay and display , staff in restaurant were very helpful and food at dinner breakfast good in quality and value
321507,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The fact there was no bottled water in the rooms we were told to purchase them My husband had the money taken from him bank on arrival when they said it was just on hold Drinks were more expensive at the bar than the room menu Which I found annoying , Cookies on arrival

321510,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, If you are attending a conference at Excel you cannot do better than this hotel as it is literally across the road Also very useful if you are flying into City Airport as it is only 5 minutes walk down Great rooms service good bar and a workout room 
321511,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I didn t like the idea of having to put deposit on top of room payment upon arrival as this didn t state on booking so it was a shock , Looks like it is targeted for business people and less for family Having said that it was nice to have peace and quiet Nice size TV though limited channels Complimentary cookies were given upon arrival and we enjoyed it 
321512,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The standard of the hotel didn t reflect the contents of the room Simply put there was no fridge in the room and the television channels were limited, The property is centrally position easy to commute to other part of london Also i like the gym simple and user friendly 
321513,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No real problems pillows were too firm but that s about it , Clean spacious relaxing room Nice toiletries tea supplies Very quiet Friendly staff Great views Good location for Excel Canary Wharf and o2 Arena Would stay again 
321514,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Not a good choice of food in the bar restaurant so we only ate in the hotel for one night out of 4, Friendly helpful staff Nice room Free car parking

321517,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, A hook to hang towels in the bathroom would have been a nice detail , Our twin room was probably the largest hotel room I have stayed in outside of Asia Great location and a great discovery 
321518,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The fact that Breakfast was 12 each if you ordered the night before or 17 95 if you didn t decide until the morning That s a hefty price increase We were out all day and evening so were not in a position to make a decision that quickly I don t think it warrants a price increase Breakfast was only 10 50 at the Premier Inn across the road and there was no difference if you booked in advance or not We had friends staying over there ,No Positive
321519,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We unfortunately were not told that we would not get our Hilton Honours points when booking thru booking com so will most definitely book direct next time probably our fault for not double checking I would recommend a small sign adjacent on the wall to the air conditioning heating system to instruct how to stop this very loud noise and to how long it takes for this to turn itself off We ended up calling down to reception just before 1am to ask , It was in a prime place for us attending the Excel and the reception staff check in was good especially with the lovely warm cookies on arrival The meal in the restaurant in the evening was Very Good and we were attended by Monica who was lovely and polite 
321520,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Sofa bed was uncomfortable No wine glasses flutes No key for balcony had to ring down Poor kitchen facilities, Lack of free car parking pay display could be covered by hotel Balcony but no furniture to use out there

321526,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, there wasn t much to the room just a bed a bathroom and a tv poor value for money the hotel isn t near any shops or anything just the tube station very overpriced, bed was comfy very quiet location 
321527,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It s a shame when very small car park is full guests have to pay full price for parking I feel a contribution towards the cost from the hotel would be good as it doesn t seem fair that some guests get this free Also not keen on having to walk through dining room with cases amongst the diners , Very rooms suite Good quality breakfast nice bar area Dining area very nice and light too 
321528,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Lovely hotel perfect if you are visiting Excel as it is a 2min walk Room was very clean and comfortable Nice bathroom Good selection at breakfast and warm cookie on arrival is a nice bonus Staff were all very friendly helpful and professional

321530,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I stayed at the Hilton as it was convenient and within close proximity to the O2 arena I had booked a X1 night stay with my husband to watch a boxing match After the fight my husband and I spent the remainder of the evening in the hotel bar it had a lovely ambience Not long after our arrival a man arrived with friends and ordered a drink I did not know the gentleman myself but My husband and I spent the evening chatting to him I witnessed a very stereotypical attitude from one male bartender I thought he was rude and judgmental towards Liverpudlians I myself was offended by the bartenders attitude as he assumed the gentleman was drunk when in fact he was not Yes he was a little loud and honest in tone but not at all drunk The bartender later apologised aside to my husband I wonder if the bartender would have had the same attitude had The Beatles walked in hmmm Sad really,No Positive
321531,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Ordered a taxi at reception when we came to wait for it to arrive it was clear that nothing had been ordered We heard other guests being asked for room numbers on order We weren t asked Taxi didn t appear , Ease of checkout clean room nice comfortable bar
321532,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Pillows were so small and slim Ordered room service and after an hour decided to cancel that , Nice sized bathroom and room was big enough for the 3 of us 
321533,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Quilt was too thin had to fiddle with the heating to get warm not enough t bags and milk not everyone drinks coffee , Big spacious room lovely hot shower clean and tidy cookies on arrival delicious breakfast 
321534,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The room we stayed in had a soil pipe in the corner by the wardrobe which was very noisy , Room very pleasant Food was very nice The breakfast service was second to none Staff were all very polite and very helpful 
321535,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff were the most unhelpful Reception did anything to not help We waited an hour for the food menu in the restaurant Rooms were not worth the money at all Food was not of usual Hilton standard at all and we have stayed in many , Location was good fro the Excel where we was working
321536,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The cooked breakfast was a good standard but unfortunately the hot plates weren t very efficient as the food was cold Also the staff didn t clear tables at the end of breakfast you were surrounded by dirty dishes Don t know why staff were not trained to clear tables as there were plenty of staff and in the main they were just replenishing stocks of crockery and cutlery , Staff were all very pleasant and the location of the hotel was great for us as we went to Excel Breakfast was good value if you pre book as it was only 12 50 
321537,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing, It was next to the Excel Centre that we were going to visit Bar was excellent and served really good food Breakfast was also very good plenty to choose from Staff throughout the hotel were very pleasant and helpful 
321538,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Good things were good this looks like a long list of horrors because I want to explain RUBBISH WIFI Hilton should be ashamed We re not Honors members so had to access the regular free wifi not possible to work with it as it dropped out consistently Aircon didn t work in our room so no temperature control they knew this before allocating the room we met the maintenance guy leaving our room and it wasn t mentioned We were there for three nights and had a radiator provided This worked fine and we did get a discount on the room as well as an offer for an upgrade but we had unpacked and had little time It would be nice to have a friendly face at breakfast there was no one cheery Staff in general tried hard but got it mostly wrong Just little things but inefficient Parking was free in places so get in early The receptionist told us we couldn t pay for the ticket until 9 30am when payment started w e were already in the exhibition It was also rubbish So frustrating , Brilliant location for ExCel Nice little gym Comfortable rooms and well appointed Good food in the restaurant Good breakfast One or two good reception team staff no apparent native English speakers some Fawlty Towers moments 
321539,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Hard bed and location not great for needing central London No biscuits in the room and only 2 tiny pots of milk for 2 cups of tea , Free cookie on arrival modern and clean

321543,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Restaurant staff very slow and in some cases rude food was bellow standard Save your money and eat elsewhere breakfast was poor as well Comunal areas seem a bit dated, Helpfull reception staff good parking 
321544,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff were a bit of an issue on our stay this time After being in our room half an hour later a maintenance guy walked in the room assuming no one was in there we ordered some drinks to our room and the bottles came with no opener so luckily we had one and the phone rang around 12 30am asking if our TV was fixed no idea what that was about Also would recommend having more staff on reception at checking out time there was one staff member and we waiting about 10 minutes just to hand our key card back , Having stayed before we knew exactly what we were getting great facilities including hair dryer and love that you get a good selection of sized towels as some other hotels aren t so accommodating Complimentary cookie is always a bonus 
321545,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The queen size beds are a little compact for two but in fairness we knew this when we booked , The property cleanliness was very good the staff extremely friendly and the overall experience very enjoyable 
321546,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I don t like how an extra amount of money is held over suspended from my account I don t agree with this type of transaction, Everything was great and free parking attracted me to book When staying at a hotel I don t want to pay extra for that so many hotels do that now 
321547,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Little windows little natural light but could have just been the room I was in Small negative at end of the day and wouldn t stop me staying here again , Staff were lovely and very helpful Location was really convenient Hotel was good value breakfast and room service great

321556,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The noise from the air conditioning in the corridor was unbearable also bathroom Had to turn off electric to sleep I was an old woman on a cold wet January evening trying to find the hotel it was a nightmare The hotel is too remote from tourist attractions ,No Positive
321557,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Brilliant location we went to a concert at the o2 and used the Emirates Sky car which is only a 10 minute walk from the Hotel All staff friendly and helpful Free parking is a massive bonus
321558,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I can t think of anything I didn t like , The bed was amazing the service was very good and staff were vet kind and flexible on our check out time 
321559,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Inadequate aircon to cope with heat magnified by the window wall which very pleasantly faced the water but it was impossible to open the curtains to enjoy the view because the heat was unbearable The food served from the 24hour menu was very poor chicken not reheated properly causing a night of severe stomach upset, The hotel had clearly been recently refurbished and the room was nice with ironing facilities and a good hairdryer Front of house staff lovely very helpful and dealt with issues concerning our bad experience with food quickly and efficiently and were very apologetic Free car park
321560,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, okay well there is always something but im extra picky the air con was a bit noisy so I turned it off but it did not affect my stay in any way , its not often you can stay in a hotel and really be happy with your stay but seriouls this was a 10 10 experience for me if you are ever in the area this is the Hotel of choice 
321561,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I booked a queen room and was provided with a twin disabled accessible room Not impressed I raised it with staff when I arrived and was told I was unable to move and raised it again at checkout and was simply told they were sorry Not what I expect from a supposed 4 star hotel , The location was convenient for a meeting in East London but wouldn t be particularly convenient for the city 
321562,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I wasnt happy as i had to pay to park my car as the hotel does not have a big enough car park The cost of parking my car for 2 days came to 30 As a hotel they dont have permits to give guest for the pay display car park which i wasnt happy with They need to invest in a bigger car park for guest or supply with a parking permit for the pay display car park , The hotel was clean the room was super clean and comfey the view was amazing Overall a very nice hotel 
321563,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Can be a bit noisy depending on what side of the hotel you are on but you close to an airport and the DLR passes right by the hotel so, Great location for excel London city airport Breakfast was very good 
321564,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No negative comments perfect for our trip , Great location to London City Airport Excel and the Gondala ride over the Thames to the o2 arena Francesca on reception was very helpful and pleasant 
321565,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, its quite far from central London though accessible thru dlr, Good food friendly staff relaxing ambience of the area and a short walk to the excel and Emirates cable line
321566,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The bed was small for a double the misses hogs the bed alot i could not sleep at night without her rolling over and pushing me off the bed, The staff were amazing and soo welcoming The location is perfect a few steps away towards the view of the river thames and the parking is free 
321567,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, the only thing I could pick them up on was to clearly state breakfast was a charge of 12 50 which was not value for money for a yoghurt and a small cup of coffee unless you are going full english I d get your breakfast elsewhere But this is my fault for not checking the price will definitely come back when working in Canary Wharf , lovely clean modern hotel really nice rooms and added bonus of a fitness studio which you often dont get with my room rate in London Evening Meal good value for money and the steak and chips was lovely though it always puzzles me why it comes on a chopping board not a plate I guess Im old fashioned great food and service all staff were polite and friendly 
321568,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only downside was the walk across a car park to the DLR station which I wouldn t want to do alone at night and even as a couple it was a little creepy Also we had read in many recent reviews on here that there was a water taxi right outside the hotel which we thought would be very useful but when we asked we were told there wasn t one so it appears to be no more , The staff were all brilliant and couldn t do enough to help When the receptionist found out we were honeymooners he upgraded us to a suite which was wonderful particularly as I was ill in bed for 2 days while we were there so my husband was able to spend time watching TV in our lounge without disturbing me The breakfasts were brilliant with a fabulous wide choice The cookies on check in were the best ever 
321569,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only thing I didn t like was where the hotel was located due to the tube strike Don t get me wrong the tube is 5 minutes walk away from the hotel and we had to get the tube so far and then walk 1 hour to Kings cross as the traffic was really bad If it weren t for the tube strike then it s okay to get from that hotel to wherever you need to be but u do need to make a few train changes I understand the hotel can t control the tube strikes so if there isnt any all is great however if there is a tube strike it s not good for where the hotel is located , Staff were very friendly we got upgraded to the Honours Suite and the room was amazing It was very clean modern spacious and the bed was big and comfortable and we had a sea view too look out at Overall I highly recommend this hotel and staff 
321570,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Hard to fault anything , All the staff were so friendly and attentive Warm cookie on arrival was very much appreciated Excellent breakfast and enjoyed the strawberry smoothie 
321571,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The bar area is good but the bar stools are poor , Very comfortable beds with good linen and pillows which isn t a lways the case in hotels Nice breakfast well worth it 
321572,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Only close to excel and o2, I must say I am a big critic when it comes to hotels and not easily pleased specially in London Hotel service and quality was one of the best I have come across Absolutely amazing 1 Amazing rooms with balcony 2 Great Cookie on arrival 3 amazing views 4 great staff 5 Great breakfast 6 Easy Parkin Close to o2 and Excel
321573,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Brilliant staff great experience It was easy to find but a bit of a way out from the centre would be great if they had a pool health centre facilities

321575,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Hotel staff were very friendly professional and helpful Our room was fairly small but absolutely fine as we were out all day The room was very clean The location was great We used the Dockland Light Railway a lot 5 minute walk from the hotel We rented a car at one point and had a 15 minute walk to London City Airport to collect and drop off so easy Would definitely stay there again

321577,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, hotel was lovely very happy staff given it was new year s eve was happy letting us take food into our hotel room ideal for being outside of the business of london but still close enough to everything would definatly recommended to anyone looking to stay
321578,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The local pub The Fox at Connaught was terrible bright lighting loud piped music and they shut at 11pm on a Friday evening , Nice view over the water albeit onto industrial areas there is not much else around London City airport Breakfast was expensive but offered everything you could want and the majority was very tasty 
321579,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Was a little out of the city but train service was 7 minutes walking distance so was ok , Good selection of breakfast service was also excellent in the restaurant staff were helpful at all times 
321580,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, hotel was and is modern and clean well laid out rooms are big enough to cater for what you need breakfasts are very good with a selection for all tastes but it all comes at a price 
321581,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only thing I didn t like is that you have to walk through the restaurant to the lift that takes to to any floors past 3rd as the lift in the main entrance only takes you to the 3rd floor then you have a long walk round to the other lift for other floors , Lovely clean hotel with very helpful and friendly staff Food was lovely Would definately stay again 
321582,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only thing I didn t like was we only had one pillow each but I m sure if I had asked fir more they would happily obliged, The hotel was only a 10 minute tube ride to the 02 arena where we were going so good location The staff were very friendly and always smiling
321583,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Didn t like nothing, The beds and pillows were extra comfy decor and hotel itself was like a 4star hotel Everything s was nice and good value for money Really happy with my stay

321585,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Everything was really lovely the breakfast was fab was really surprised to see they had soya milk as my daughter can t have any other apart from this so that was a bonus will definatly stay again 
321586,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, In case there is no public service for what reason e g Christmas Day London Town becomes impossible to reach The nearest Santander city bike is 3 miles walking away taxi costs a fortune and walking to the center is no option A few bikes from the hotel would be a perfect solution as there are roads for bikes next to the hotel to the center of London On the other hand If you want to visit the ExCel you re probably in the perfect hotel , Breakfast was good restaurant is cosy and has a nice few over the Thames Very kind sfatt everywhere and a nice bar for the evening hours with reasonable prices 
321587,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No water view from the room would be nice to have this as a choice but nice water view seating area at the end of the hallway outside the room , Nearby Shopping 
321588,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only problem i had was the bed was a little hard for my back but this was a personal gripe of mine, The Hotel staff were very polite very friendly and happy to help the hotel its self was very clean and a warmly feel about the place great comfort no children running around and only a short hop on the train to the big city The location was great too over looking the docks and at night it was so peaceful plenty of places to eat but the hotels own restaurant was excellent with a good section of food available 5 stars
321589,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Difficult to access by car I am a Hilton Honors member but was not offered a Hilton honors room No direct train to central London , Room was clean and spacious Safe parking
321590,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Tried to contact hotel several times during the day of my arrival to let them know I would be arriving late The phone was unanswered and no messaging service When I mentioned it on check in the receptionist seemed unconcerned , Convenience for proximinity to London City Airport 
321591,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Very modern hotel with free parking that was like moving into a new home Friendly welcome from Anna at reception Great location and only 30 minutes from Central London by DLR and tube 
321592,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Air con was noisy but called reception who were v helpful Slightly further away from airport than I had thought but still walkable tho not if you were elderly or with a lot of bags Wouldn t have walked from the Dlr station at night More information on location could have been included on the website , Spacious room comfortable bed and bedding Quiet location Had a good night s sleep A good price compared to city centre hotels allowed me to get a taxi from Euston station 
321593,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff bell boy was a bit rude when I asked the reception about blue badge Peking people did park there without displaying the blue badge That s against the law I guess but oh well ,No Positive
321594,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Unfortunately our dining experience was not so perfect with a bungled dinner order but they were very apologetic about it , A lovely room and most charming reception staff 
321595,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Breakfast room was a bit manic but food fine Bizarrely on arrival into one of our two rooms it smelt of cigarette smoke for a few hours , Polite reception staff on arrival and a free upgrade Got the last free car parking space Good location 
321596,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Markings in the car park , Thoroughly enjoyed the stay Staff were excellent and everything was handled smoothly Parking facility was good and brilliant location 
321597,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing all good The whole hotel was well run even though it was late at night I was impressed , Very convenient to City Airport A short walk to the check in Arrived late at night great welcome and friendly staff The rooms were very good and the rate I achieved made it excellent value for money for the one night stay 
321598,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only strange thing was some of the rooms including our rooms access was through the restaraunt, Great location near city airport Train outside the door We hadd a lovely room on the top floor with a great view
321599,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It s a shame you can t get any fresh air in the bedroom At home we always sleep with a window open regardless of noise or weather so woke up with heavy heads nothing to do with alcohol ,No Positive
321600,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I was happy with everything, Super fast check in Excellent customer service everyone has a smile on their face and nothing was too much trouble Breakfast was super and thank you Roger for the cappuccinos
321601,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I requested check in between 1 2 and this wasn t available a little disappointing as I had been travelling all morning and I had wanted to freashen up before leaving as I had to be somewhere at 14 30 Also when booking a delux queen size room the write up said that there would be bath robes slippers and mineral water None of these were available There was no fridge why would a 4 stair reputable hotel chain not have a fridge in the room , The restaurant reception seating area and bar area are very beautiful 
321602,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, nothing at all, Visiting O2 location was good loved the warm cookies on arrival Were upgraded to lovely suite overlooking the river Breakfast was very good plenty of selection would stay there again
321603,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Messed around with the price of the hotel due to issues with card that wasn t my fault Staff upon reception we re rude and not at all helpful No toilet roll simply half a roll left that had already been used no hair dryer no spare pillows absolutes abysmal for the price , Not much
321604,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Parking was an issue as the customer designated car park was only suitable for approximately 30 40 cars which considering the hotel would house hundreds of guests presented itself as an issue Additional parking was available but came at a cost of 12 per day which on a smaller budget can affect your experience A deposit on arrival of 50 was also compulsory which I was not made aware of when booking ,No Positive
321605,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Not enough milk things for more than one cup of tea picky I know but still Pillows didn t keep their shape leaving me waking up frequently to a now flat pillow and the TV signal kept going off , Bathroom was beautiful and the welcome cookie was nice Short walk to the DLR for ease of access to all day train tickets and trains into London 
321606,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The bed and pillows could have been more comfortable , The food in the restaurant was excellent as was the bar food also Breakfast was good although a little overcrowded on the Sunday morning
321607,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Better ventilation in the bedroom, It did the trick we had an early flight from City Airport and as we live 40 miles away we we wanted to travel in the night before We arrived at approx 8pm dumped our cases in the room and went down to the restaurant for dinner My husband had the pulled lamb shepherds pie and was very disappointed I had the grilled salmon and it was decent The room itself was averagely comfortable My only gripe was that there was little air in the room The window only opened a crack and the a c system is set not cool at this time of the year according to the front desk when I phoned them in desperation at 2AM All in all it was an ok stay might try another hotel next time but would rule out a return visit 
321608,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Hanging space in double room was inadequate Toilet seat not soft close Mirrors above urinals in public toilet Lighting in restaurant was too dim Unlit area above tea coffee making facility No fridge in room as standard Enjoyable, Friendliness of staff Comfortable bed Decor
321609,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The location is far in my reckoning from the central area requiring at least one or two transfers to bet down town There also is no residential area close by so the area feels isolated , Easily the strength of this hotel is the staff I had the occasion to interact with the manager and assistant managers on multiple times All staff in all locations of the hotel echoed these standards They were professional very courteous and helpful and reliably went the extra distance 
321610,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There needs to be more car park spaces available as its always full and you can waste a lot of time sitting in the car waiting for the next available space , The staff were 10 10 The view was great The bed very comfy Spacious room 2 min walk to the tube
321611,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, besides the hotel being near the excel centre theres not to much around sure you could get the DLR around London but still also the dinner prices were a bit expensive but thats London prices i guess, being next to the excel centre very good for any convention as long as your not in uncomfy boots like i was then it seams like a much longer walk 
321612,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Staff some doesnt speak any English And during my many visits I have felt being ignored not on purpose i hope i e no one came to take my order in the restaurant for a good 20minutes before i had to excuse them Drink menu being snatched away n only given back after confirming i was a guest Cant find info about my loyalty card on the system , Very quiet and room is at right temperature and moisture for a good night sleep 
321613,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, When arriving an hour up to end of car parking feel there should be a concessionary free hour , Every member of staff was friendly welcoming and extremely helpful The car parking facilities were good Easy to find

321619,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The constant noise from bathroom extractor Hated the smell of the shower liquid soap Hotel reception too warm Only one pub bar close by had to walk over to the other end of Excel to find others Distant from London center buy hey ideal for a business trip at the Excel , Nice lavish breakfast in a super setting The restaurant is fantastic a very nice way to start the day overlooking the waters Best comfy bed ever Very clean 
321620,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There could be more tea and coffee supplied in the room , Lovely hotel with great transport links Friendly staff and nice and quiet despite being near London airport

321622,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The restaurant staff were incompetent serving me a meal that was overcooked and then serving a second meal that had been sitting on the side for 5 minutes, room very comfortable
321623,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Only issue I had was the wifi wasnt working however this just meant more time focusing on my partner lol Also the breakfast was very expensive , Everything about this hotel was great Stafg were attentive and welcoming room was clean and the free cookie on arrival was the cherry on top Tasted delicious 
321624,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Didn t realise how far away it was from restaurants and entertainment in other parts of London Took quite a time to get anywhere decent but that was my fault for not doing research beforehand , The hotel was great Lovely room very clean and comfortable Breakfast was included which was good Lots of choice and not too busty We went to an exhibition at the Excel and didn t realise it was within walking distance Great location to visit the Excel

321626,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Would be good to have a bit more parking, The hotel overall was lovely nice surprises such as the cookies on arrival Staff were helpful room service was great and the food in the restaurant was amazing
321627,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Often ended up queuing for a Breakfast table Staff made me aware the hotel can only host 100 people for breakfast at one time A little poor when the breakfast is actually quite expensive Scratched graffiti on the inside of the lift doors lowers the tone a bit Parking is first come first served but people tend to find a space and leave the car for days I ended up paying 36 for parking for 3 days , Staff were great Room was nice and clean Facilities in room were good Location is obviously ideal for Excel Dinner was good along with room service Room service dinner was quicker than expected and pretty decent 
321628,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing, Came down for MCM Comicon and had an amazing time at doubletree All the staff were friendly and helpful Had a slight mess up with our bookings but was put right immediately and respectfully My partner has a nut allergy and is gluten intolerant and the chefs dealt with it brilliantly If the comi con is in Excel again will be coming back and recommend anyone else coming down to stay there

321684,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It is too far from the downtown tourist stuff You get tired and are better off staying downtown to go rest in the middle of the day and go back out it is a 30 minute ride to the sightseeing and 30 back and since on the east side of town an hour and a half to Heathrow airport When I booked it did not realize the distance back to Heathrow Remember the subways are loud and impossible with luggage during rush hour The above ground trains are quieter and decent sightseeing same ticket Always see if your hotel has the fancy coach bus express to London Heathrow or stay near Paddington and take the 15 minute express train to the airport with reserved seat Always buy an Oyster card to get around in London it is capped at the daily rate of 6 5 pounds a bargain and starts over not till 0430 the next morning subways stop between 11pm and one am and you are left with night busses so be careful , It is great to the subway above ground train portion Fantastic price for a Doubletree warmed fresh chocolate chip cookie and all Great hotel and breakfast just on the west side of the London City airport you have to go up two stations on the above ground subway train and double back to the airport It is two stops from the cable car over the river and the Olympics are on the south side of the river When you go to London the departure tax built into your plane ticket is up to 250 dollars in a business class ticket About 125 in a coach ticket You might explore staying in paris and ride the one hour chunnel train to London and stay a few days in a hotel and go back to paris to sightsee and go home Channel train is cheap if booked well in advance Indian restaurants are great and so is fish and chips all between 10 and 20 dollars After doing it I recommend the hop on hop off tour bus because it takes you where you need to go instead of figuring out which subway stop and includes a boat ride on the Thames and is cheap to extend once you buy the initial two days 
321685,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Only one working lift for all residents breakfast high in price 16 Room could be cleaner cotton buds in corners and dust etc , Comfy rooms and quiet even though next to Airport Free Parking Good WiFi

321835,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, That I couldn t stay longer, The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very friendly I left some belongings behind and the staff very kindly offered to mail the goods back on the next working day Would definitely recommend to all of my friends
321836,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Parking spots are very very limited I d honestly rather pay a daily fee for parking and be guaranteed a spot than struggle to find a parking space on a daily basis Most of the staff were very unfriendly in my opinion especially the ones that were at the front desk Not welcoming at all and so after a couple of days I thought it best to avoid them altogether I didn t like the fact that one has to walk through a packed restaurant to get in and out of the gym The gym is actually really really tiny Only about five or six equipment if I can remember correctly , I liked the location very close to the DLR station The rooms are tastefully done Parking is free of you manage to get a spot 
321837,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, There was no Complimentary bottle water There was not enough parking space Paying for parking , The breakfast was well presented value for money at 10 The room was very neat Bed was very comfortable Nice view from our room

321841,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The air conditioning in the room was very loud and couldn t sleep through it and without it the room was very warm , Staff VERY friendly and professional 
321842,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The parking facilities were very limited For free parking they have perhaps 30 spaces of you don t get one of those which is unlikely then you have to pay and display The pay and display is 5 for 2 hours which proves to be rather expensive when the pay and display hours are 9 30am to 17 30pm Unfortunately the showers weren t great neither Beautiful decor and comfortable however the heat from the shower was very moderate ,No Positive
321843,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing in particular just the issue of no fridge and I did call nothing was done , Stayed in comfort though I think all rooms should have the essential things like fridge There was none in the room that I slept 
321844,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Girl at reception didn t fully understand what we were asking whilst checking out but didn t spoil our stay, Amazing complimentary warm cookies on check in Good spread at Breakfast and the bar area is bang up to date decor wise

321847,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Receptionist needs to smile and greet better for a Hilton group hotel Bring misinformed about the parking otherwise we would have stayed at premierinn barking with free parking Attitude of receptionist towards me questioning price of room when she was wrong , Receptionist needs to smile more and have a better greeting at hotel could not understand her sometimes very difficult to understand she tended to mumble She also tried to charge me full price of 157 we booked on special offer of 109 90 She seemed a bit put out when I questioned price good job really I saw it Not a good start to be honest I was told there was loads of spaces for free parking by reception when I rang day before no chance we had to pay over 20 for parking as amount of spaces free you have is a ridiculous amount for the number of rooms In hotel Would not consider staying again whilst in London as not good value and would never recommend this hotel to anyone Have stayed in doubletree hiltons before but not like this one Overall clean room beds harder than normal
321848,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I didn t like my view of the car park but I other rooms had a lovely view of the O2 arena and the excel centre, I was there for London marathon and breakfast was served from 5am so that was great for eating at the right time before the marathon

321855,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I booked a Queen Guest Room which was advertised as 226sqft The room was tiny and incredibly cramped The view from the window was of air conditioning units and industrial piping And to complete the truly awful experience my room was next to the main door to the corridor I have stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms and this was in the top 10 of my worst experiences ,No Positive
321856,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing , I ve never slept better in a Hotel apart from the time I stayed at the DoubleTree in San Jose I was only there for sleeping as I was at the WWE Raw event at The O2 however everything was great Room was clean amazing marble bathroom plentiful coffee and tea supplies and breakfast was very good in the morning Will certainly look to stay again

321860,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Having stayed at Double Tree in Dublin and other locations I found the size of the room in London smaller by comparison and not to the same standard for the price charged Also the bathroom was in need of a re fit the shower screen was rusty along the line of the bath , free parking close to excel breakfast was ecellent 
321861,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Room had balcony and double doors but couldn t be unlocked because we hadn t paid for a suite room Why have the option of a balcony if you can t use it , Fantastic Breakfast Great Reception Staff River View Room as requested Very clean Huge Shower

321875,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, More car parking spaces For the size of the hotel the amount of space available is extremely poor Also it wasn t obvious where to obtain toast from at breakfast It was on a separate bar away from the buffet area It would be a good idea for staff to point it out when they show guests to their table , Great stay Good location Staff very welcoming Breakfast very tasty 
321876,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, did not look appealing at first glance on walking from train station Was concerned however it was great and staff were lovely , Was great value for money clean comfortable we had a great nights sleep staff were fabulous

321883,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, So the problem with this hotel was that there wasn t a chance to open window and get fresh air in room this is reason I won t recommend anyone to stay there, Emm nothing much I was pretty disappointed
321884,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Didn t fancy expensive breakfast for four so we went for a little walk across the bridge to a little cafe Luckily weather was good Executive room with lounge suite was basic hard wood floor was functional rather than comfortable never mind luxurious , DLR nearb as long as it s not raining not too many stops from Kings Cross Convenient for Velodrome and Westcliffe

321889,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, TV doesn t work properly too slow to operate window curtains didn t function properly one seemed to be stuck at its place double tree needs to refurbish their rooms now it is definitely not 4 stars hotel as we have seen better 4 stars hotel, view from the window and easy access from DLR and free parking space for our car
321890,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, That the waiter woke us up at 2am knocking the door saying we had ordered wine when we hadn t and the fact we had to get our own coffee at breakfast as the waiters were not around , I liked the easy access to the room nothing was too much trouble We asked for extra milk and coffee for the room and they bought it straight up A cookie on arrival was most appreciated Partner liked the breakfast I thought it was okay but could have been better

321897,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Food was nothing to rave about had better stays in a premier inn outside property shabby not good value for money disappointed, Location on river
321898,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Air conditioning was really loud and didnt actually cool down the stuffy room had to get someone up to turn off at mains Window wouldn t open and curtain wouldn t close fully which meant we were hit with sunlight from 6am , Location perfect as well as cleanliness of the room Bathroom lovely layout Wifi worked throughout 
321899,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We had to trawl quite a long way to our room due to building works which would of been fine if the lifts were a little more speedy The bed was like sleeping on a board and with no extra bedding to sleep on the sofa so got virtually no sleep and spent the following day with backache No hairdryer in room Was most definitely not worth the extra money over a Premier Inn for 1 nights stay , Location for Excel and parking
321900,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, According to the Web page the distance from the O2 was very small it didn t say however that it was the other side of the water , The room and hotel facilities were excellent We were disappointed with the meal we had at the hotel the quality and taste of the rib eye steak was poor and not worth the money The breakfast however was lovely Staff were friendly and helpful
321901,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Two problems i had with this hotel one minor the air con kept switching itself on all night i was freezing and had to get out of bed every half hour to switch it off So no sleep the lady gave me 10 off my bill at checkout But what wasnt ecplained is that they take a 50 deposit when u check in This would have been ok if this was explained to me and to be told three after i checked out i looked at my bank statment to see an extra 130 is pending to the hotel My room rate was 80 which is fab good price minus the 10 discount 70 i have been charged thats fine but they was meant to deducted from the 130 they froze on my card the deposit i wasnt told about so i should be owed 60 still This isnt the case a seperate 130 is still owing and still hasnt be returned to me i phoned twice an been told different things an that i now have to wait till next weekend to have it back Disgraceful service will not be booking again , Lovely hotel location is ok right near the dlr for traveling It is right near the airport although i didnt hear any planes which was good

321907,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, couldn t find teaspoons at breakfast sounds trivial but annoying for tea yoghurt in narrow glass pots very hot in room as window wouldn t open safety I guess checking in staff member very abrupt when I tried to use my wrong card simple mistake as they all look the same but her response was rather rude did stay with me was looking forward to river taxi but this wasn t running despite it being very calm on the river so had to take the trains , Good breakfast lots of choice
321908,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I was given the wrong rooms keys and charged more than what I was supposed to have been but these were rectified , The hotel is in a good location Plenty of parking if you are driving and walking distance if you are taking the DLR Staff are very friendly Room was very spacious massive bed and sofa in the room Bathroom was also big and spacious 
321909,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Disability Parking was taken up by non disabled residents Security did not prevent this , The hotel staff all treated us as if it was their own business We have found this quality rare on othet places 
321910,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, No water machines vending machines for drinking water Was told to go down to bar which was busy with only 1 harassed member of staff and sold an expensive smaller than usual glass bottle of water for 2 35 , Super decor especially luxuriant bathroom

321913,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Breakfast on Friday a bit chaotic however did improve the other 2 days, Really nice hotel well placed for the o2 and travel connections Asked about taxis Late at night was given an excellent contact which meant we were not left on the street in the early hours of the morning
321914,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Cleanliness in the bathroom in particular was a bit lacking, Excellent location and excellent staff able to park on site for no charge and the warm cookie on arrival was a particular high point Bar area spacious and comfortable 
321915,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We were not aware that parking spaces were so limited and that the overflow car park was quite expensive Bed was very hard and pillows not great , Good location easy to get to the O2
321916,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Broken tap in bathroom Staff at breakfast shout accross room to each other We were sat at a dirty table for breakfast and noone came to clean it, Loved the cookie on arrival and staff on desk very helpful Breakfast was lovely Free parking Room was beautiful as usual Easy access to O2
321917,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The first morning the breakfast service was not very good at all we had to wait for over 30 mins for a table they were not being cleared efficiently and things ran out like milk orange juice eggs etc But the 2nd day things improved completely,No Positive
321918,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The only thing that I did not like was that some guests thought it was acceptable to come down to the dining room for breakfast in pyjamas and I was a little surprised that this was allowed If I was in charge I would not have allowed them entry until appropriately dressed , Hotel very nice and very clean staff very personable and helpful Would recommend 
321919,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Can t moan about a thing , Fantastic locations friendly staff VERY comfy beds clean and the variety of food and level of service at breakfast was excellent 
321920,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Tiny negative was the noise of the aircon but you soon get used to it and learn to live with it , Greeted at checkin with a nice warm cookie Room was newly refurbished spacious room and very comfortable bed Sofa in the room was also comfortable Cannot fault this place
321921,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Not enough milk in the room to make drinks Want to order 2 cappuccinos to come to our room but because it came to less than 10 were would have been charged a tray fee which I think is ridiculous Also no one told us that if we pre booked breakfast it would only cost 10 each but because we hadn t they would charge us 18 each ,No Positive
321922,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Six of us travelled for business purposes due to this purpose we booked 3 Twin Guest rooms However 2 of the rooms were actually double rooms On complaining of this one room was switched to a double room which was fine however our room we went downstairs to amend our room and were given our new keys hauling our suitcases with us The set of keys we were given were incorrect so we had to go back to reception and get another set again hauling suitcases around The gentleman behind reception didn t apologise and blamed the computer We then went to our new room with two twin beds The room was a disabled room so we had red string hanging everywhere and a seat in the shower with a very unappealing grimy shower curtain It was very inappropriate giving us a disabled room on a business trip especially when the twin rooms were booked well in advance Later that evening we ordered some beer and a pizza to celebrate the closing of our business deal I specifically asked the gentleman who took my order to bring the beers straight up I even rang again to remind him as it was taking so long He then brought the pizza which was very undercooked and looked like a child had put it together which wasn t eaten due to the poor cooking and the beers that we no longer really wanted because we had waited so long On going down the breakfast in the morning at around 10 05 breakfast was absolutely freezing Paying 15 for a breakfast that is ice cold was ridiculous also on getting a glass of apple juice I noticed that my glass had lots of dirt floating around in the bottom So 15 was paid for basically a bite of bacon Really really unhappy and absolutely furious at the overall experience I usually enjoy my stays at the Hilton but definitely not this time We were not even asked if we could have any sort of discount the staff really just did not care , Couldn t hear anything from outside which was good Also the cookie on arrival was nice 
321923,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I think the room setting was a little bland I ve visited this hotel many times when it use to go by the name ramada and preferred the furniture to how it is currently Oh and maybe some bottled water would be great too , The staff were lovely Very polite and ready to help We ordered for room service a couple of times during the night and they always came with a smile and lots of energy Thankyou for making us feel very welcome xx

321927,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Key card room entry would not work despite going to reception on several occasions I happened across a maintenance man who by the way was very helpful especially after reception staff didn t offer to help by calling someone to sort the door out No offer to change room Basic View over carpark Twin room No bedside or main light switch beside the bed near the window Room had inadequate lighting It was quite dark Air con would not adjust No operating instructions in room Reception were informed but on my return several hours later room temp was the same It was hot No opening windows Disabled access room although there was no room for a wheelchair to move around the beds Colleague stayed at the Aloft Excel which had much better modern room s design , Bed was comfortable Enough pillows Clean Breakfast choice was surprisingly good

321936,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The room was hermetically sealed and smelt of other people s sleepy breath It was stuffy and smelly There was no view except over a covered courtyard There were no tissues in the bathroom or proper soap The bed was not made in the morning , The bed was comfortable and breakfast was excellent 
321937,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Parking I booked this because of the complimentary parking his was very important to us They had only a handful of free parking spaces and the rest were pay and display We spent an extra 15 00 on parking something we hadn t budgeted for and I would like this to be refunded to me Room service we called and called and no answer Called reception and they said it was busy with no apology We had to go down to order It came but the bottles we ordered were not open and so we had to call for a bottle opener this took around 20mins to come by which time we had eaten our food and weren t really that bothered about the drink Again no apology The pillows were very uncomfortable With 2 it was very uncomfortable with 1 it was too low Couldn t get comfortable Bed was also too hard The radiator in the bathroom was hanging off the wall , Room was clean and quiet
321938,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Waited an extra hour to check in as there was no rooms available When I went back into check in one hour later waited another 30 mins in the lobby Also they took a deposit of 200 pounds which they still haven t paid back ,No Positive
321939,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Overpriced inexperienced staff especially at breakfast time long queues for a table which were still in need of clearing , The location was good as we were there to meet friends 
321940,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The noise in the rooms of fan motors from toilets and a c could not be stopped Aircraft noise from London city wasn t bad at all even though the aircraft were flying over head , Ideal location to Excel and London City airport 
321941,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Room that I had booked was a room with a view but as soon as we got in the room we noticed that the toilet seat had blood or something else on it we then got moved to a room without a view that was full of dust and with a rubbish bed the hotel still charged us the same which I think is wrong not even an apology, Breakfast was really good
321942,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The restaurant didn t seem very well organised The staff were good but there didn t seem to be a system i e drinks delivered to wrong table and staff looking to find were to take food to Shower gel not replenished on second day , The beds were comfortable The views over the river were lovely Closeness of Excel venue

321945,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Temperature in the room too high Given the time of the year air conditioner was shutdown unfortunately, Interior was completely renovated in a very nice style Friendliness of staff Good restaurant
321946,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, If we had been offered a cheaper breakfast rate as my colleagues staying in another room were would have meant we had breakfast The window in our room was not one that could be opened so not able to allow fresh air in , Right next to the Excel for where I needed to be for work on the Sunday Warm cookie given to you on check in Polite staff Nice decor throughout hotel including relaxing bar area

321949,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, I requested a room overlooking the River Thames although I booked my stay at least 2 months in advance this request was not honoured It was slightly disappointing because it was for a special occasion , The friendly staff and ease of check in No delays everything done promptly 
321950,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, We were at the Excel Centre Location is very convenient for visiting that Next day we went over to Greenwich Very convenient to get to via air rail and ferry 
321951,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, It is undergoing a refurbishment Workmen and vans around but doesn t seem to be impacting running of hotel Bit of a treck if carrying luggage from nearest DLR station , Staff very helpful Food excellent Very close to DLR train line but sound proofing excellent you wouldn t know it was there if you couldn t see it 
321952,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, We did not know that the hotel had changed hands Also due to the change there was some issues while checking in , Clean hotel and the food was very nice 
321953,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Nothing apart from the price of the bar being very expensive, The views to the London City Airport was great my girlfriend spent most of the time watching the planes instead of speaking to me the spec quality of the furniture and decor was amazing When we stayed they were refurbishing the hotel this didn t effect our stay and it shows that the hotel is looking to improve and keep the customers happy in the way their hotel looks
321954,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel,No Negative, Nothing to like booked for three nights as I was visiting friends Room was basic but that s all I needed as I was only sleeping there and planned on spending most of my time sightseeing Bed was comfortable nothing special bathroom very basic but not the cleanest with mould on the bath tub but a quick shower was sufficient Unfortunately the only problem was the fact that unknown to me a deposit of a large amount of money had been taken from account even though I had been reassured that my card had only been swiped for room service if I chose to use it This only came to my attention when shopping and my card declined which was hugely embarrassing as I knew I had sufficient funds to cover payment Having contacted the bank I was told that the money had been taken by Ramada Returned to the hotel to enquire why this had happened only to be confronted by a very rude receptionist who said it was standard procedure and that I must have authorised it When I argued this and asked to see the manager who was called Naveed I was horrified at his attitude as it was worse than hers The fact that he couldn t speak English and had problems understanding basic English made matters worse to the point another guest who had overheard even tried explaining but even he was shocked that he was the manager yet couldn t speak basic English I asked to see the notice regarding the card being swiped and it stated 50 which is fair enough So why was my card swiped for a much larger amount They didn t know but all he could say was that the money would be refunded Into my account in the next few days So I was stuck in London with whatever cash I had in pocket and ended up relying on my friends to cover the meals out etc The only good thing that came out of my stay was the lovely staff in the morning who were preparing breakfast Great little team who couldn t do enough and always greeted you with a smile and the breakfast was delicious 
321955,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, The staff on reception are damn right rude the worst manager I have ever come across Naveen Extremely rude and struggled to communicate due to the fact his English wasn t good and didn t understand why he had taken a lump sum of money from our account when we were reassured it wouldn t be physically taken out and it the card was swiped just to reassure them the funds were there and for any room service if we chose to use it Have stayed there for over four years and chose Ramada Docklands because the kids and myself loved the views from the rooms overlooking the dockland If language and communication was improved and maybe some basic training in customer service wouldn t don t go amiss , Even though the staff at reception are always grumpy and rude the staff located in the kitchen especially the chefs are fantastic Always make an effort with the children weather it s about the hot chocolate or if they are enjoying their holiday they always have a smile and are very pleasant Shame about everyone else who works there 
321956,DoubleTree By Hilton London Excel, Due to the amount of work being carried out it was quite a walk to get to our room But understandable, wonderful particularly the manager who was there on the day Couldn t have done more
