382727,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, There was only one person at the reception she couldn t even show us the room no Porter breakfast is ok but it was 10 45and we were still eating that the staff started to take the food for themselves and turn off the lights while we were still sitting sink drain was closed staff were not helpful and couldn t speak English location was not close to the center but the metro station was close to it didn t change the bedsheets in 4 nights
382728,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, Staff were very hospitable hotel cleanliness was great and rooms were always being cleaned Air con was a little loud but that s probably only negative to report 
382729,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Staff a little unhelpful, On the final day one of our party left his coat when we left early am for our flight they said wouldn t send it back though he offered to pay He has to arrange a courier to collect it now which comes at quite a expense yet others who have been there and left things behind said they didn t have to do it this long winded way And had there items returned with out the faff Took the shine off a nice break P s only one iron and ironing board for hotel so try not to crease your clothes lol as no guarantee you will get the iron and iron board 
382730,Catalonia Barcelona 505, I was offered to pay city tax twice I kindly had to decline paying a second time , I arrived late from the airport The friendly guy at the reception explained me the functioning of the hotel while he was doing the check in I was put on the 5th floor in a surprisingly nice room The room was wide with an entry having the desk The bathroom was really big There was a bath and a separate shower From the bed you have the TV right in front of you with all channels you can imagine This is a very good value for money hotel most like the other hotels in the same chain I always do my best to stay in Catalonia hotels when in Barcelona They never disappoint 
382731,Catalonia Barcelona 505, the cleaner was clean the room so bad she clean the cups of the tea on toilet and she dry it by our towel bath , room was not bad the staff was friendly and helpful 
382732,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Although the hotel is fairly far from downtown Barcelona and the beachfront it is only a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station that goes direct into central Barcelona , Friendly and helpful staff very competent in English The room and hotel facilities were excellent The selection at breakfast was really great Highly recommend this hotel 
382733,Catalonia Barcelona 505, We didn t like the location Still a bit far from the major attractions Also the fridge weren t working properly So we couldn t have cold water And the noise We couldn t rest at all Night till about 2am And mornings were early for us because of the housekeeping working next door , It was very clean Rooms are very big Staff was helpful I have to say very helpful and sweet 
382734,Catalonia Barcelona 505, only managed to get an iron 1 night out of the 4 which was pretty annoying as hate going out with creased clothes , enjoyed the swimming pool was never too busy and 100 needed it in the blistering heat the prices at the bar were also pretty reasonable
382735,Catalonia Barcelona 505, While the breakfast buffet had lots of choices the hot food was cold lukewarm, The hotel was excellent location for what I needed and it was a short metro journey into the city centre and 30 minutes by taxi to the airport
382736,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Nothing , The rooms were very large clean and modern and the bed was comfortable The pool was refreshing and relaxing and there was a big variety of food for breakfast 
382737,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Nothing , The beds were extremely comfortable which is something as usually hotel beds give me a sore back The pool terrace was lovely especially on those warmer days when you just wanted to relax Although some relaxing music would have made it better The restaurant was also great and very good value for money Overall a fantastic stay and would definitely come back 
382738,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Location was fair although if there for tourism I would suggest something closer to central There are not that many good restaurants close by The restaurant was not good Portion size was way too small I asked three times to not have potatoes but vegetables instead yet the food came without vegetables but with potatoes Presentation of food was poor Taste was bland , Was upgraded to junior suite Very nice room There is a very good gym close by 
382739,Catalonia Barcelona 505, There was nothing to give shade on the terrasse The refrigeator couldn t cool anything The bed was too soft and there was a lot of noise from especially the big street Too much perfume in the soap and other things from the bathroom , The breakfast was good Many things to choose among but the price is too high The balcony was nice and big The staff was friendly and helpfull The bathroom had all the eqiuipment we needed 
382740,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, There was a mix up between booking com and the hotel the rate through booking was a lot lower than the hotel s system we simply showed the email to the staff and they didn t hesitate in complying with booking com s rate I know that s the right thing to do but I ve been in that situation before and the staff is usually not helpful but the complete opposite Staff at Catalonia Barcelona 505 were exceedingly polite 
382741,Catalonia Barcelona 505, staff however were not very friendly or particularly helpful No tea or coffee in the rooms although there was a kettle when we asked for milk etc staff reluctantly handed over the milk sugar etc minor point but I ve never stayed in a 4 star hotel were you couldn t make a drink in your room Breakfast was 17 euros there was an El Fornet on the corner 1 minute away serves breakfast for 5 euros , Hotel was clean and comfortable Staff however were not very friendly or particularly helpful No tea and coffee in rooms although there was a kettle when we asked for milk etc staff reluctantly handed over the milk sugar etc minor point but never stayed in a 4 star were you couldn t make a drink of tea in your room Breakfast was 17 euros there was an El fornet on the corner 1 minute away serves great breakfast for 5 euros
382742,Catalonia Barcelona 505, the hotel is on the big street so it is very noisy at night also very noisy neighbors and no sound insulation whatsoever hotel is quite old, good location helpful staff
382743,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, Very good and varied breakfast we had a junior suite which was a very spacious quiet room Very warm helpful staff at reception We decided not to rent a car since the hotel is only 300m from El putxet metro which connects you in minutes to all over Barcelona Room always very clean and towels changed everyday We had a great stay 
382744,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Bad personal especially the boss They think too much about money Access to the pool only 2 hours a day and only after negociation it s not a joke I don t recommend , Nothing
382745,Catalonia Barcelona 505, They need to test their rooms Room 901 was not great and I didn t sleep well here The air con was broken There was a flashing firealarm blinking above me every 10 seconds Clunking lifts are very noisy Lights from the hallway is very bright all night long , Staff are helpful and friendly particularly for the restaurant
382746,Catalonia Barcelona 505, the one evening myself and my family wanted room service for a celebration but was told at short notice the restaurant was closed and there was no room service this was very disappointing particularly as we had 2 young children with us , i am medically required to have a gluten free diet the hotel catered exceptionally for me which included a hot gluten free baguette at every meal I loved the terrace attached to my room it was large and private the only thing missing was an umbrella 
382747,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The time outs of the wi fi A 4 star hotel should place at least 1 painting or other type of art into each standard room in Catalonia Barcelona there is an absence of such in all two rooms I was accommodated during my stay The curtains were dusty in one of the rooms One of the rooms had a rest chair the other one didn t have such The USB plugs had a sign indicating the Volts but they didn t have one indicating the Amperes which can damage the mobile device battery seriously , The bed sheets are first class as well as the variety of the pillows The switches are finished in inbox which is giving additional value to the place in general 
382748,Catalonia Barcelona 505, I would have liked to make a cup of tea in my room there was only a coffee machine Small problem though and staff solved by providing a pot of tea for me , Staff very polite and helpful The bed was exceptionally comfortable and double glazing made room quiet Location felt safe and local not touristy which I liked Lovely bakery nearby 
382749,Catalonia Barcelona 505, It is a bit out of town but the metro is 5 minutes away and only 10 mins from the centre Bathroom looking decidedly tired, the staff were very pleasant and prepared to do that little bit extra for you The reception and bar area was very bright and welcoming 
382750,Catalonia Barcelona 505, rude reception at check in kept calling me mister no change for 50 asked to go to a cab driver room OK but not great very noisy even double glazing of no use area is sad not even a decent coffee shop around Rude staff at check out as well arguing about refunding the room rent which they had changed me twice ,No Positive
382751,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Room a bit noisy at front of hotel Improved glazing would make huge difference , Good breakfast comfortable rooms small pool terrace but nicely done Easy access to city centre 
382752,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, The room was beautiful and fully stocked with wonderful perks like a mini bar complimentary water chocolates The bed was very comfortable and huge Breakfast was great Facilities were great The staff spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful and friendly 
382753,Catalonia Barcelona 505, We asked like three times for iron and iron board and every time would be like I m sorry we gave it to guests call us in two hours Last time tho we asked to put us in a list so once they got it back we d use it It was done and in like one hour we finally got it, Good location 5 min walk from metro very good breakfast cleaning room every day
382754,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Car park very tight if you have a big car Pool is crowded if more than two people in it Jacuzzi was not working in our suite , Staff were very helpful and friendly Location is good Food is basic but cheap 
382755,Catalonia Barcelona 505, First off I have no idea how this hotel is 4 stars it felt more 2 3 I was extremely disappointed in my room as you can hear everything It sounded like I was sleeping outside because the windows and walls are poorly insulated for sound You can hear everyone checking in if you are in the 100 s for rooms I could only sleep with my noise canceling headphones and music playing due to the terrible insulation If you get stuck with the 100 s rooms you are doomed I kept hearing how there werent many rooms available so I avoided changing my rooms and going through more stress The traffic is loud and the staff can be aloof I asked for help with something and the girl at the front desk was cold and brushed me off I really should have changed hotels and regret booking Catalonia Barcelona 505 hotel last minute , The cleaning service was nice 
382756,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, Lovely hotel The employees are pleasant and very helpful And the swimming pool is very much appreciated after a day of visiting and walking around the city 
382757,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The pool was closed There were several groups of kids in the hotel so it felt like a scouts camp , A very nice hotel Extremely helpful staff A great location close to a subway stop and away from all the tourist crowds 
382758,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The whole thing is a cheap business hotel The bed slid around on the floor at the slightest movement of your body so I had to push it back into position several times every night The shower glass doors were apart so the floor of the bathroom was swimming in water after every shower The wall paper was peeling The building itself is ugly ugy ugly The Hotel faces a busy street so as soon as you open the windows the room will fill up with exhaust fumes Sickening Breakfast is expensive The staff at the reception was primitive and offensive , The cleaners were nice and they did a good job The pool is OK except is opens late 10 am and closes early 6 pm so people with a work schedule can forget about it But no one in their right mind would take a vacation at this Hotel so it is always empty this is the nice part The AC worked although it was bestially loud 
382759,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Everything was perfect , Our room was perfect Comfortable and with a jakuzi inside The staff was so polite and helpful We had a great time and happy memories 
382760,Catalonia Barcelona 505, If you go for the buffet it will cost you 16 euros each But order room service for an alternative priced solution , Room was excellent with large bathroom that included a shower on on side a jacuzzi tub with a shower on the other side of the room Bed was comfortable with lots of pillows We were on the eighth floor so we even had a deck with furniture TV has wide range of stations even CNN and BBC World 
382761,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, Amazing staff Super friendly helpful and going the extra mile They even gifted us a bottle of cava when they learnt we were just married Highly recommend 
382762,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The hot water for the jacuzzi bathtub was regulated Was not able to have a steamy bath Yet the shower was plenty hot , Friendly front desk staff Room was more then I expected
382763,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, It s our third time in the hotel Do I need to say more Good location far from touristic center which can be easily reached by public transport Ltd of good restaurants and cafes near by 
382764,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Only thing I didn t enjoy much was a surprise shower while still dressed and running a bath the water suddenly switched itself to the overhead shower unit for some reason Bath plug doesn t seat properly either , Nice lobby Friendly and helpful reception staff and chambermaids Good size room with comfortable big bed and big terrace Good size bathroom with bath and separate shower Good range of toiletries nice to get a chocolate The TV worked well Room was quiet Short walk to El Putxet metro Great bakery close by Would stay again if we get the chance 
382765,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Maybe give a map of the barrio on arrival with information on buses trains local restaurants , Receptionists were very pleasant accommodating and helpful When we requested a room change they upgraded us Very happy with our stay Room was always left clean for us each day 
382766,Catalonia Barcelona 505, It is not a complain It would be better if the restaurant and meeting room were on the ground floor not basement , Room is big enough for one and clean Helpful staff and good service And it is easy to get a taxi 
382767,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Only extra missing was airport shuttle service, Night manager was most welcoming and made the French air traffic controller strike situation easier on our delayed stay in Barcelona In a great neighborhood with real people and restaurants 
382768,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Parking area is a complete nightmare extremely narrow and to less space No elevator from the garage to the reception Staff friendly and helpful but not well enough educated for 4 star hotel Balcony door is not close enough so the nights are very loud Breakfast horrible I did it just once the other days I bought a nice breakfast around the corner I would never ever book again this hotel of disaster , Rooms are nice and big 
382769,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Room located near to the floor with a lot of noises till late in the night A staff member woke us up as he delivered a room service in our room instead of the correct one , The kindness of the staff Valentin The quality of the breakfast 
382770,Catalonia Barcelona 505, Air conditioning There should be a provision of setting temperature because sometimes it gets very hot and for people coming from tropical countries it is bit unbearable , Size of the room and terrace view Excellent value for money 
382771,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The up graded room contains jacgoozi but a couple of water noses did not work , These free items are provided a large bottle water hot water maker A week later we came back up graded room was provided 
382772,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, We have been upgraded in a junior suite and it was great The king size bed was very comfortable and the large bathroom very clean We enjoyed our stay
382773,Catalonia Barcelona 505, The hotel is definitely not 4 star I would suggest only 3 stars at the most Everything felt a little bit dirty Room was next to door for pool access room at top of staircase so was very noisy Could hear water running in other rooms so I knew each time someone has used the toilet Bath would not drain had to use a knife to release the plug Staff in breakfast room did not behave in a way that made you feel welcome their priority was getting things packed up by close of service time rather than creating a comfortable environment I checked out one day early as I was not thrilled with the hotel and I had to ask 4 times if I could receive a partial refund 4 times I was told the manager wasn t available This is somewhat understandable but as I couldn t be given a straight answer I was unable to book the next leg of my trip In the end I was given a refund for one night which was good I d rate the hotel 5 out of 10 I ve stayed in worse but if I went back to Barcelona I would not stay here again , The hotel was not outstanding in any way I checked out one day early and received a refund for one night as I had paid in full upon check in Metro station is a 5 10 minute walk away

382775,Catalonia Barcelona 505, TV English channels did not work in 802 breakfast buffet had only one coffee machine so the cue was up to 10 minutes in peak time to get a cup of tea or coffee , stayed twice 802 and 803 rooms are great terrace has a lovely view in 802 and 803 has a wonderful spa Both rooms are very large and airy and nice and quiet 
382776,Catalonia Barcelona 505, I paid for an extra bed but the room was too small so my friend had to sleep on the floor Yet we paid full price for an extra bed , The bed was comfortable 
382777,Catalonia Barcelona 505,No Negative, Proximity to train which brings you to cataluna in 5 min So you are not living in super crowded touristic centre in cozy area but 5 min from center at the same time Perfect combination Lots of good authentic restaurants very close by 
382778,Catalonia Barcelona 505, I always prefer 2 single beds to a double bed Location could be better for the price Had to deposit Euro 50 to get a key to use the room safe , Great breakfast and clean room Friendly and helpful staff
382779,Catalonia Barcelona 505, No wi fi Too far from the center Too nosy Impossible to open the windows and it s impossible not to open them because it s too stuffy If you need smth from the personal you need to wait for long time The worst is parking it s a space in the cellar where the only normal places are busy by stuff Several places for guests don t have normal way out you will need to creep mm by mm to park in and park out because of the passage is too narrow to do it without any risk for your car ,No Positive
