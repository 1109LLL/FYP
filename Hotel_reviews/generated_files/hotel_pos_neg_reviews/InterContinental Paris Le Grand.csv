91019,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, The restaurant service and food at the breakfast and when we had a late lunch were below average The room had no charm or character It smelled like mold There was the metro noise that was heard all the time The wifi coverage was bad and kept on getting cut The A C did not work and they had to send someone to fix it twice The carpets are ugly in stairs and corridors of the hotel The bathroom is really old and of cheap quality The hotel is large and impersonal It is a three star hotel in a building that once hosted a grand hotel No coffee in the room No extra amenities or personal touch , The bed was good Size of the room Concierge was helpful
91020,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Facilities are old and shabby AC was not working well in the room and for two nights technicians could not fix it , Staff are professional and helpful 
91021,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, The hotel is a heritage Excellent room service Scrumptious breakfast but not cheap Helpful and attentive concierge They helped me book a restaurant and helped me send postcards Complimentary bottled water available Spacious room Cafe de Prix one of their restaurans serves wonderful french cuisine 
91022,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Closet area was rather small and had to ask for rolling rack with additional hangers but we did a huge amount of shopping King bed took up most of the room but not unlike any other hotel Rooms could be updated a bit better HOWEVER Bookings com really screwed up We extended our stay Bookings com said they made the airline changes and they BILLED us but never made changes with the airline Hours before flight we had to contact airline directly and on the phone for 1 1 2 hours Bookings com wouldn t take care of the problem expeditiously Had to repay for premier class seats with the airline but we did get reimbursed later Bookings com has a lot to learn about customer service in an urgent situation , The hotel is elegant staff great bathroom quite large for Paris bed was nice and firm great bed linens location excellent for public transportation walking etc two blocks to best dept stores in Paris Planning on staying there for Christmas 
91023,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Reception blocked 200 euro more on credit card while checking in in case you will use room service , Perfect location good breakfast big room and bathroom which is very rare for Paris 
91024,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Nothing, Beautiful hotel with a peaceful ambience Perfect to relax in after a days sightseeing The location is ideal for the main sights of Paris Beds are the best I have slept in in a hotel We didn t have breakfast but ate on the Terrasse a couple of times and were not disappointed It s a great place for people s watching Onion soup is delicious best in Paris
91025,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Room was a bit small Room was over heated and couldn t adjust the temperature sufficiently with the in room thermostat Needed to open the windows to cool the room down , Wonderful hotel Great breakfast 
91026,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, An up close balcony room with a view of the Paris opera house Palais Garnier was a visual extravaganza It truly took our breath away We ordered a sunset dinner in just to savor it a little longer 
91027,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Bath was very badly designed with taps in a very awkward position Initial room offered was very cramped with no view but was changed with no fuss , Room Breakfast Spa
91028,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Price per night is very high Toiletries could be better Minibar is computerised it means that if you will take some drink out he will stay automatically added to your bill information about it is on the door of refrigerator and it is hard to see her at first , The hotel has excellent location near Place Vandome Louvre boutiques on Saint Honore Street Opera Garnier or Printemps and Lafayette Breakfasts are very very good the bed is extremaly comfortable lobby is stylish staff friendly and competent 
91029,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Room was too hot on arrival but that was no problem whatsoever Main switch for lights as you enter the room is red which is not immediately obvious We are used to putting a card into a central reader to switch on lights etc This is a Fantastic hotel, To channels available and good wifi
91030,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, The service was baddest which I have been to the hotel I just want one bottle of drink water take2day get one bottel And no refill the coffee pag As well,No Positive
91031,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, The only thing that I felt was a little overrated was the restaurant downstairs Cafe de la Paix I ordered a medium steak and it came our tough and still purple and it came with a brick of the driest potato au gratin ever It was awful There are many amazing places to eat in the area I recommend walking through this restaurant but saving your money and eating somewhere else , We had a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony and it was like a DREAM When it sparkles at night it is so surreal and beautiful The staff sent up a bottle of champagne for my birthday and I felt like a movie star standing out there looking at the stars and the tower and the crescent moon Everything was beyond my expectations The bed was so soft the pillows were so fluffy the toiletries smelled like heaven the bathtub All exquisite Go downstairs and see the Opera Salon It is breathtaking in its beauty Take lots of pictures 
91032,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Staff was little uptight Was given a lower category room even though the reservation was for a room with balcony Had to get it changed after reminding them To which we were told it s not guranteed , Perfect location great food 
91033,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, The building was built in the 1880 s and it is well maintained the metro is extremely close however I believe that being an Intercontinental Hotel there is no harm in combining the existing nice old architecture with some modern amenities To be more specific the rooms are spacious but they need some modernisation For example the doors and windows should be changed In the bathroom the shower should be also replaced with some modern mixer taps The water pressure in the shower is very poor the hot cold water mixing isn t functioning properly The vanity unit is poor The toilette is spacious but there are no bidets As for the cabinet inside the room during our stay one of the cabinet doors fell down Luckily my elder son 16 years was opening it and not my younger 5 years old son Anyway we called the reception and they strongly apologised and fixed it we even received an apology letter from the Guest Relations and also a complementary basket of fruits But again it could have been dangerous Anyway as i rated the staff earlier in general they are extremely friendly and very helpful Hence I hope that the management of the hotel takes my constructive remarks into consideration because as I mentioned before the hotel has really a great location and very nice and helpful staff , Great location Great Staff Very Good Breakfast
91034,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful one of those places you would only find in Paris It is particularly special due to its close proximity to the Op ra House Paris is an amazing city and it s beauty translates into this exceptionally beautiful hotel The staff is also very attentive and professional I would stay there again and again 
91035,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, I found a piece of paper in my breakfast and after I gave the evidence to two waiters they disappeared without any word The other strage thing was during check in process This hotel wanted to debit my bankcard with an additional amount called caution money for a case of damading or missing room facilities It is totally unaccepptable from me because it is not part of the today s hotel business practise to debit in advance , The staff was awesome 
91036,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, We had the most wonderful time with VIP treatment The hotel is amazing and the staff is absolutely fantastic We booked a Double Room with Club Lounge access and it was unforgettable Location is perfect right across from Opera and close to Galeries Lafayette and metro station 
91037,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, This property should be a 5 star hotel compared to what s out there The building is large and beautiful it occupies a whole triangler plot right next to the beautiful historic Paris opera The lobby area is magnificent and it makes you feel like you are in palace from the 1800 s This hotel is really what you do expect from a 5 star intercontinental hotel The staff are well trained and polite 
91038,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Being made to move rooms for another guest to take ours alternative rooms offered not so nice but told we had no choice but to take one made to feel an inconvenience, Location
91039,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, if the spa opened later in evening even for sauna, The staff were very pleasant We booked the club lounge we loved it Food and drinks whenever required fab hotel
91040,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Nothing much except perhaps a smoking lounge for people occasionally enjoying a cigarette after dinner , Everything it is like home for us We love going back again and again

91044,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, I dont understand that an Intercontinental hotel in Paris can t serve a real espresso coffee all coffees in the hotel are made from an automatic machine Very unpleasant to deal with that ,No Positive
91045,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, The price is higher than a number of other available options in same area but not 5 star hotels so the higher price at Intercontinental is understandable given the level of the hotel Fortunately I came for business so my company covers everything , Room bed bathroom staff room services breakfast laundry and of course location All of that was truly at 5 star level I will have to specifically thank and mention Sebestian from the concierge desk who was very nice and of a great help in recommending venues for the activities I was looking for 
91046,InterContinental Paris Le Grand,No Negative, This is not my first time at Intercontinental le Grand and it sure won t be the last This hotel is extremely well located in Paris next to Auber station on RER A 3 min walk from Lafayette Galeries The breakfast at Caf de La Paix is very pleasant and varied The staff is helpful and very well trained It feels like a 5 stars hotel Even the classic room that is a bit small is very clean and comfortable and is very suitable for one person At the end of your trip you wonder who is directing this successful hotel well his name is Mr Christophe Laure and i guess he is an excellent CEO I hope he will keep on the good job

91052,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, At the breakfast area the quality of the server is not of the same good quality Some servers are very attentive and asked if you need more coffee Some servers did not even bother to clear the used plate from our table It is normal service to clear used plates from the table in any buffet breakfast , The reception is friendly and helpful There is one young man by the name of Morgan who helped us to check in and he was very helpful

91055,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, Caf de la Paix refused to accommodate us on Sunday 1 11 15 at 5pm because the staff had screened off one small section of the restaurant to serve and could not be bothered to serve the two of us hotel guests anywhere else in the huge premises They were very rude with the exception of the waiter I first asked for help who ran up and down asking his manager and those running the caf at the door for help Everyone let him down I had to walk off in the end I chose the hotel partly to try Caf de la Paix on the grounds that it was open all day and was very disappointed Reception gave us a billing room number after checkout time so we could settle our account in one go around 6pm but the waiter in the Wintergarden taking the bill would not listen to me and said this was not a room number I told him to check with reception but he was rude and did not apologise , My requests had been read for the room location and a lovely complementary cake had been provided with a birthday card for my mother Staff at reception and porters and most waiters were very charming The view was fantastic and the room spotless The beds were the comfiest we slept in on our entire trip The lounge menu food was limited but of a very high standard Would definitely return if in this area of Paris

91057,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, A hotel of this caliber and price yet they could not accommodate our request for additional pillows They said they were fully booked and therefore didn t have a single extra pillow That s absurd We also had quite a bit of noise in our room from both the street with windows closed as well as from the floor above , Beautiful building interior and exterior Very elegant and classy 
91058,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, everything was great, I have stayed in this hotel for more than 20 times and its an excellent place to stay I really like the breakfast the christmas brunch and the friendly and helpful hotel staff
91059,InterContinental Paris Le Grand, See above, We booked a junior suites with balcony On arrival we were advised that the reservation we had and although it stipulates a balcony as a must the hotel denied and declined that it s non contractual She asked to go to booking com We insisted on a balcony They insisted that nothing is available We insisted again After 3 hours we got room 1332 which is not a junior suites but had a 40 cm wide balcony on Scribe street The room overlooked the Goods entrance and garbage collection entrance Needless to tell you about the noise all night Therefore I am asking you to contact them and reimburse the difference in rates due to their negligence and non respect of the booking
