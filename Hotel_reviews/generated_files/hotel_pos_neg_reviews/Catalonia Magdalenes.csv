372994,Catalonia Magdalenes, Limited number of beds and seating at the roof top bar pool so you may be disappointed We were lucky enough to get some place to lounge in the sun , Wonderful hotel right in the heart of Barcelona Staff were exceptional Beautiful room with a HUGE bed Lovely pool area and roof top bar with free tapas throughout the day Surrounded by fantastic Gothic quiet streets with the buzz of La Ramblas only a few streets away They even gave us a free bottle of Cava on arrival Will definitely return 
372995,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Great roof terrace Complimentary snacks and drinks were much appreciated Staff very friendly and helpful Great location Away from the noisy traffic but very near to places of interest 
372996,Catalonia Magdalenes, There was a bit of construction going on around the hotel that started early in the morning , The staff were great Pool was very small but the whole hotel had a really great relaxing feel to it 
372997,Catalonia Magdalenes, The pool is a bit smaller than I imagined and there are limited sunbeds loungers so late risers didn t get much of a look in Didn t make too much difference as there was so much to explore outside the hotel but might have if we wanted to just chill out by the pool However there were always some seating or bar stools to perch on instead It is a little on the higher side of what I would usually pay but I felt that the price was fair and reflective considering the condition service comfort and location , The hotel was immaculate and staff very friendly and helpful Great beds and good size room with excellent shower The location was perfect in the gothic quarter with lots of great bars shops and tapas restaurants for all budgets nearby Only 6 euros by taxi to get to the port so the beach bars and restaurants were very close by too Would definitely recommend if you prefer a smaller more intimate hotel 
372998,Catalonia Magdalenes, Bathroom inside of room walls would be better, Excellent Service everyone was keen to help at any time great buffet at rooftop pool everything modern and clean best location in Barca
372999,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, The breakfasts were amazing with a wide variety of choices All delicious We appreciated the snacks available on the deck all day Our room was spacious and the bed was really comfortable We loved the location The staff was always very pleasant and helpful 
373000,Catalonia Magdalenes, The rooftop bar very quiet A more lively scene can be fun But certainly not a reason to stay elsewhere Just a personal prefence so as to not have to leave hotel , The location the staff Both excellent The decor very nice Good value The staff could not have been any nicer or more accommodating Loved William And the free snacks and waters are very nice 
373001,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Spectacular rainfall shower in the bathroom and the rooftop pool deck is fabulous Don t miss the manager s free snacks at the pool deck every afternoon 
373002,Catalonia Magdalenes, Breakfast expensive at 20 euros per person , Great location clean and comfortable friendly staff and beautiful roof terrace with small pool and free buffet every day Easy 5mins walk to Las rambla and very close to metro Blackout blinds in rooms were great and well sound proofed Staff allowed us to store luggage and use the roof terrace on last day even after we had checked out 
373003,Catalonia Magdalenes, The bed could be larger and of better quality It was quite short , The location is great less than 5min from the cathedral At breakfast they offer a large choice The hotel also offers a free buffet in the afternoon on the rooftop which is great when you come back from sightseeing and want to relax a bit at the pool Catering staff was very friendly

373005,Catalonia Magdalenes, Our Superior room had only a small window and was very dark Our friends booked a standard room also through Booking com which was much brighter and had French doors opening onto a little Juliet balcony The standard room also came with a complimentary bottle of Cava When I asked at reception for a different room I was told all superior rooms are the same Also no Cava for us and no real explanation as to why not It wasn t a big deal but strange to include it with one room and not the other So I would suggest booking a standard room and requesting a big window balcony The superior rooms albeit bigger are not worth the extra money Breakfast was good but served in the basement with no windows There is an inner courtyard atrium but this was closed off when we were there At 20 per person you can get much better value and more pleasant surroundings in one of the many Placas close to the hotel , Loved the rooftop pool area perfect for chilling out after a day s sightseeing The complimentary afternoon snacks are a nice touch The rooms are modern comfortable and very clean The location is perfect on a quiet street close to many sights and to a hop on hop off tourist bus stop Taxis are plentiful

373011,Catalonia Magdalenes, The hotel is nestled in a narrow street in the old town and very difficult to find The taxi dropped us in the Main Street and we were walking with our suitcase for 30 minutes trying to find the hotel Make sure if you take a taxi to be dropped off outside hotel door A more conspicuous sign might help or a more detailed description on your website for travellers arriving by other modes of transport Street behind the police station might be a good start , Great location when we eventually found it spacious clean room with very comfortable bed and pillows Complimentary snacks and soft drinks very welcome after a late evening arrival All staff very polite and helpful 
373012,Catalonia Magdalenes, Roof top bar deck very small and therefore crowded with not enough seating , Location location New hotel light clean and very quiet Really comfortable bed in good size rooms Best shower Room had tea and coffee making facilities which was fabulous Free tapas and soft drinks on deck every afternoon Staff are pleasant and helpful

373020,Catalonia Magdalenes, For such a certainly not cheap hotel I am sure the property owners can afford to put a toilette brush and a box of tissues in the bathroom When staying with a partner you can imagine how uncomfortable it is when one goes to the toilette and there is no toilette brush Also the blankets should have full covers bags and not just a small sheet we know blankets are not regularly washed so no one wants to find themselves covered directly by the blanket without the bed sheet in the middle of the night , The hotel is new and modern The interior of the hotel and the rooms is very modern nice and fresh The location is fantastic Walking distance to shopping streets bars restaurants La Rambla main train station etc Great rooftop bar great gym

373022,Catalonia Magdalenes, Not sure the room toilet with its opaque screen door will be to everyones taste but not a problem , Staff from the off were excellent Very friendly very informative The roof top garden with the free tapas was a great place to relax after all the sightseeing much of which is within easy walking distance of the hotel 
373023,Catalonia Magdalenes, We only had breakfast and thought it was overpriced I think it should be broken down into different price ranges My husband only has cereal and a drink so it was too much to pay for that , The free tapas was a lovely touch and the bed was extremely comfortable 
373024,Catalonia Magdalenes, Room service menu is very poor Need to add more items Club sandwich was not good Beef burger was good However room service was efficient and quick , Very comfy bed Housekeeping staff excellent and very efficient Breakfast items are many and varied and very fresh Fab breakfast and quick service Concierge and reception staff very polite and helpful Everyone speaks good English 
373025,Catalonia Magdalenes, The staff is very nice but there is no real concierge service For those who love bathroom privacy the frosted glass door separating the bathroom from the bedroom may be an issue , The hotel is well appointed beds are comfortable and the windows insulate from the noise outside They offer some treats in the afternoon as well
373026,Catalonia Magdalenes, Strange location of toilet in the room lack of privacy, Newly renovated nice place veeeery good location free snack in afternoons heated pool on the roof 
373027,Catalonia Magdalenes, Odd small swimming pool on sunroof which has a glass side, The location was just off the main roads and very convenient for access to most of the old town sights and within easy walking distance from the harbour The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with a particular mention for Eduardo who assisted in booking tickets and a daily weather forecast As we don t like a large breakfast we did not eat in the hotel but they did provide guests with a free buffet of various snacks available during the afternoon We would be happy to return next time we are in Barcelona 
373028,Catalonia Magdalenes, The hotel entrance is a bit inconspicuous and it is easy to miss it , Perfect attentive service rooms spottless clean Central location but very calm Excellent breakfast exceeding every expectation Complimentary snacks coffee and drinks available from 1pm to 11pm in the lobby Complimentary bottles of water in the room every day A good night chocolate every evening Plenty of good restaurants nearby 
373029,Catalonia Magdalenes, If you want me to be very picky rooms near the elevator can get some occasional hallway noise But this still rates a 10 in my book for value , I could find no fault New clean professional and friendly staff nice lobby snacks and drinks afternoons and evenings on arrival night quite tired we turned it into a light dinner excellent location Great value I thought Would absolutely return 
373030,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Excellent location great staff very flexible when checking in arrived in the morning and they let us to the room early attention from staff welcome champagne Nice design in the room restaurant lobby Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of food and drinks 
373031,Catalonia Magdalenes, They could have a general TippBox , We feel really welcome the personal was so helpful Long long time we don t feel so good in one hotel like we feel on this hotel Please don t change I think we loved Barcelona because we was in this wonderful hotel it s a normal very clean hotel with a nice breakfast near from everywhere and everything but the management is brilliant the staff makes the difference 
373032,Catalonia Magdalenes, I think it would have been really nice if the hotel could play some light music in the reception area while enjoying the delicious free buffet they had on offer not just the television , Couldn t fault the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel Perfect location for us quiet and relaxing On our welcome we were surprised with cava and little messages during our stay that was a bonus

373034,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable room nice decor fantastic location The free tapas in the afternoon and evening was a nice touch Since I was sharing a room with a friend having the shower and toilet separate was useful

373036,Catalonia Magdalenes, Wifi was a bit slow but that is not the end of the world , We stayed here whilst taking part in Barcelona half marathon was located very close and was the ideal place to stay pre and post run They provide free drinks snacks from 2pm 11pm each day and the staff were very courteous and helpful They even moved the breakfast timetable to earlier than usual to accommodate those competing in the race 
373037,Catalonia Magdalenes, nothing, Staff were excellent very friendly english excellent Rooms comfortable Location excellent close to a lot of sites The food from 2pm to 11pm was very special 
373038,Catalonia Magdalenes, We were unaware that the pool wouldn t be open and it was the main reason we booked this hotel The spa area was too small for the level of guests using it F, Fantastic central position Afternoon food and drinks were very welcome The staff were very friendly and helpful with good English

373042,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, The location and size of the hotel is perfect for a long weekend in Barcelona the staff very friendly and helpful We liked the modern but cosy design of the facilities and the ease and comfort of the terrace Last but not least the cleanliness standard of the hotel is outstanding

373044,Catalonia Magdalenes, The door to the toilet was frosted glass with a gap of about an inch all the way around This meant that sounds and smells travelled into the bedroom The wash hand basin was in the bedroom not enclosed , Lovely clean hotel in a great location Staff friendly and very helpful Free daily tapas in main area was plentiful and delicious Lovely bottle of Cava awaited us in our room on arrival

373049,Catalonia Magdalenes, We were told by a front desk staffer that we could only buy HOHO tickets where the bus started in Plaza Catalonia This was incorrect They can be purchased anywhere along the line We bought ours at the cathedral stop , The hotel was stunning Our room was so stylish that I might use some features in our bedroom at home We also loved the free snacks We arrived too late for dinner on the first night and we re thrilled to have something to eat The central location was perfect too being about 4 blocks from the HOHO bus in front of the cathedral 
373050,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, The hotel is just a few steps away from the shopping area of Barcelona After a day of shopping it s great to snack from the complimentary tapas the hotel offers and just take an hour to relax in the mini spa before exploring the nightlife of Barcelona 
373051,Catalonia Magdalenes, The really only thing I can think of that was not so positive was that there was a bit of a low noise from something like a pump possibly from the pool or so in the room Didn t bother us though Otherwise the hotel was extremely well isolated and quiet , So where to start with what we liked Short version everything perfect location friendly staff relaxing small pool great breakfast comfy room nice Spanish and Catalan restaurants very nearby and free snack bar in the hotel Long version Really unbeatable is the location It is only 5min by foot from Placa Catalunya one of the central spots in town from where you can start for tours or go shopping or walk down to the ocean My daughter and I were super happy to always have just a quick walk back to the hotel to get rid of bags or grab a coat or so There are also many very nice little Tapas bars and restaurants just around the corner of the hotel so we could choose a new one every evening within a 5min walk Try Can Pescallunes Catalan only open Thu Sat if you get a chance and fancy a real Catalan experience It is operated by a Catalan family with Catalan dishes The hotel staff was very friendly spoke Spanish English French and even some German and made us feel welcome always The room was spacious comfy and very clean Breakfast was maybe a little pricey at 20 per person but had a very wide selection We also had breakfast twice in a cafe nearby called 365 on Via Laietana 2min walk which was also very nice cheaper of course but with less to choose from The pool was not very large but warm and with a lot of massage jets Super relaxing with a steam sauna Roof top pool was not open while we were there in Jan but we could take a drink up there and enjoy the sun in the lounge chairs with some music playing in the background Probably most amazing to us was the free snack bar in the hotel lobby From 13 30 23 00 you could grab a snack whenever you wanted And that included soup wraps pasta salad salad chips pastry and coffee tea soft drinks 
373052,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Recently stayed as a couple over the New Year for 4 nights the staff were very helpful showing nearby recommendations etc Also loved the offer of a free spread from 2pm 11pm as it s that awkward time of feeling peckish A fruit bowl and drink filled it Lovely decor found our bed very comfortable and loved the indoor steam room Jacuzzi as it was out of season to use the outside pool Overall a fab stay would highly recommend location is perfect near enough to walk pretty much anywhere including the beach if not the tour bus stop isn t too far away either

373070,Catalonia Magdalenes, The hotel has a very contemporary design which we quite liked But people should be aware that the toilet and shower aren t separated in a private room like the typical hotel room but are located in glass stalls open to the bedroom , Everything about this hotel was just wonderful The location is perfect right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter two blocks from La Ramblas and two blocks in the other direction to the Cathedral And although the hotel is just a block off of a busy street the windows cut out all the noise critical for a good night s sleep The staff were friendly and attentive and helped us to get oriented to the city by providing a map directions and recommendations for restaurants and things to do The room was clean and well appointed and the bed was the most comfortable one we ve ever had in a hotel The rooftop pool area is a great place to unwind at the end of the day and having outdoor space at a hotel is a real bonus

373080,Catalonia Magdalenes, Only downside was the room configuration within the hotel No view as rooms faced inward so very little natural light and overlooked other rooms, Very comfy bed Spotlessly clean Lovely helpful staff Computers in reception to book your trips Advice on restaurants and getting about Would return
373081,Catalonia Magdalenes, Bar closed at 11 00pm prompt unable to get drink at 11 02 even to take to room no flexibility for guests who would like to sit a little longer before retiring, Complimentary snacks at hotel in afternoon and evening a nice touch Hotel had a lovely fragrance

373086,Catalonia Magdalenes, The logo has a major error it should be 2 adjectives or 2 nouns for consistency eg Happy and healthy or happiness and health, Lovely and helpful reception staff Jamie the bellboy was exceptionally helpful We would also commend the service of Yuri the bar buffet manager
373087,Catalonia Magdalenes, Nothing Everything was great , The afternoon snacks on the top floor with the pool were fantastic Great to come back to the hotel after a day of exploring for a bite to eat and a dip in the pool Great way to relax before heading out into the city again 
373088,Catalonia Magdalenes, Price is a little high when you take into account lack of facilities no restaurant or bar and twice we tried to go to the roof top but there was no space so gave , Friendly staff and great location and breakfast was very good 
373089,Catalonia Magdalenes, They play the same music every day I did mention this to them And they didn t have any English channels but it s not a big deal Other than that it was perfect and so worth it , I loved everything about this place I chilled a lot on the roof top by the pool My room and bath shower was perfect 
373090,Catalonia Magdalenes, may be on the high price room a bit small but what do you expect in center Barcelona, Ideal location friendly staff cool atmosphere nice deco of the rooms
373091,Catalonia Magdalenes, Bathroom set up for friends lacked privacy No wash clothes Had to request change to temperature setting for ac but they did quickly adjust it , Beds and breakfast were great Location is really great but need a better map to re locate when walking 
373092,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Fabulous central location yet rooms very quiet beautiful decoration and styling Lovely roof top terrace Great choice of complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the afternoon Friendly and helpful staff 
373093,Catalonia Magdalenes, Considering the price I expected breakfast to be included Expensive at 19 euros Pool was more a plunge pool than swimming pool, Great location Staff very friendly 
373094,Catalonia Magdalenes, The pool could be bigger A bit more privacy in the bathroom area would be nice as would larger teacups The teacups should be washed daily , We had 2 breakfasts one in the market and one at the airport Sorry that should be in question 2 Clean and tidy with pleasant staff 
373095,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, staff was always willing to answer any questions you had and Ruth could nt do enough for you at breakfast would recommend this hotel a very pleasant 5 day stay would stay here again if we went back to Barcelona also need to say a big thank you for the cake and bottle of bubbly on my special birthday 
373096,Catalonia Magdalenes, Nothing , For those who do not want to read a full review here s a summary fantastic hotel location staff what more do you need We arrived late on the Monday evening tired from a long flight The staff instantly made us feel welcome and check in was a breeze The room was immaculate and this was maintained by housekeeping throughout our stay The little touches such as the walk in shower are modern The second day we went out to explore gorgeous Barcelona and found that we were in an ideal spot seconds from the main shopping streets and public transport yet out of the way enough to not be bothered by noise There s amazing restaurants and bars within a one minute walk whether you want a light tapas 3 course meal or just a drink The third day we decided to stay around the hotel and make use of the rooftop terrace pool bar The pool is amazing and they ve done wonderfully well with a city centre rooftop Free food fruit soft drinks are available from the bar on the terrace with alcoholic drinks also very reasonably priced By Friday our final day we didn t want to leave this amazing hotel or city We had an evening flight and mentioned this to the reception staff They were only too happy to store our cases encourage us to make use of the facilities all day and even shower and get changed after checking out Nothing was too much trouble I couldn t recommend this hotel highly enough and we will certainly be staying again 
373097,Catalonia Magdalenes, The price was a bit high, I liked the placement of hotel down a back road away from the Main Street but close enough for walking approximately 1 5 miles to the Sagrada Familia and even closer to Gaudi s Casa Batll and Casa Mil All which are must sees in Barcelona The hotel was just fully remodeled a coulee of months ago and one can still see and smell the newness We did not try their breakfast as we are not breakfast people and prefer to try the local restaurants and tapa bars 
373098,Catalonia Magdalenes, A few times it was not an easy for taxis to find hotel , Dream staff team extremely helpful Nice new hotel stylish inspirational Amazing complimentary refreshment service on roof terrace Kids enjoyed a lot

373102,Catalonia Magdalenes,No Negative, Great hotel very central location with all the main attractions within walking distance and the best staff I have ever come across For me it was Raquel and her team that made it a special trip We went there with our two little kids and they took care of all our needs be it planning a trip in or out of the city upgrading to a bigger room or booking an appointment with a beauty parlour all taken care of in the most friendly and professional manner Raquel even called a taxi firm to complain on our behalf when the taxi driver seemed to over charge us The free snacks were a real plus especially when you are travelling with young kids and feel a bit peckish late at night The room was really good for a 4 and the bed very comfortable All in all very pleased and highly recommended

373108,Catalonia Magdalenes, Upon arrival we were charged extra as the attendant said that I booked two rooms for two people vs two rooms for 4 she was not very helpful with any recommendations and was not what I would expect with the cost associated with this hotel only one staff member on our last day greeted us and provided recommendations as to what I d expect, Location was great pool area was very relaxing and it was a nice space overall rooms were nice and a good size
