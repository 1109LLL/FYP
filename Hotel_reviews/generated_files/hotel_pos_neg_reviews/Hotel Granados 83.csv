319067,Hotel Granados 83, The pool is really small I think the picture on the website is misleading Rooftop bar nice shame you have to phone to get a drink and then wait a while for someone to actually get your order , Staff really friendly and helpful Really good location out of the way of main tourist area and surrounded by some lovely restaurants and bars 
319068,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The staff were very professional and friendly The rooms very stylish and the whole hotel had a great ambience and chic vibe I d definitely stay again Added bonus that the breakfast has both a buffet and a la Carte menu with great table service 
319069,Hotel Granados 83, There was a lady serving breakfast the 21st of June that was extremely rude towards me and other guests ruining what should be a great start of a day to everybody The 22nd of June I hesitated to have breakfast because of a terrible experience but she wasn t there and service was great The fitness center is a tiny hot room with an elliptical and a stationary cycling next to each other, Overall the staff is really friendly and the hotel is in a great location
319070,Hotel Granados 83, The shower and lights needed some mastering instructions would have been helpful and a price list for mini bar , A very modern and stylish hotel with helpful staff and spotless rooms a public spaces Good location 15 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya 
319071,Hotel Granados 83, Fitness room had one cross fit and one exercise bike only Wasn t open if you had an early start to the day , Helpful staff with great recommendations for places to eat Lots of excellent restaurants and bars close by Short walk to shopping Gaudi sights and nearest metro 
319072,Hotel Granados 83, Very expensive breakfast Only small pool open Two other pools not open Very expensive poolbar Small bathroom Noise from street throug window, Good bed Frontdesk OK 
319073,Hotel Granados 83, Everything was outstanding, What a sensational hotel The best hotel I have ever stayed in We absolutely loved its style the attention to detail and the team were nothing short of amazing We can t thank you enough for everything and we certainly intend on coming back X
319074,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The first 2 nights at Granados were booked through a travel agent as we were travelling on a tour but I booked the extra night at Booking com We could walk to most locations or get a taxi at the corner Lots of little Cafes around Room had a balcony which was lovely to sit out on It took us a few minutes to get used to the automatic doors on each floor
319075,Hotel Granados 83, I would have loved to have less humidity in the room or the possibility to open the window since these were closed due to security reasons , The overall ambiance attention to detail design and comfort is incredible The staff was very friendly and helpful during the entire stay They provided us with maps and great advise regarding insider places to eat and what to visit The rooftop terrace is a serene chillout place in the middle of a vibrant city and on sunny days the pool provides a nice refreshment 
319076,Hotel Granados 83, There was zero sound proofing so you could hear absolutely everything in the hallways Too noisy Room was also claustrophobic with no sunlight Noisy plus claustrophobic Not good Another thing I don t understand is the bedding something I ve seen at other hotels too where the bottom sheet is just slapped on top of the mattress and can t be tucked in at all so after you ve been in bed a few minutes the bottom sheet starts unraveling and crumpling up until you re literally sleeping on top of a messy tangle of linen I hate that , It was modern and the Asian design touches were nice Location was perfect with a plethora of interesting restaurants nearby 
319077,Hotel Granados 83, Restaurant menu seemed limited for evening meals , The rooms were very comfortable and well appointed The staff were very helpful both with information about Barcelona and also with regard to any small problems we had regarding the room The rooms were initially warm but a member of staff responded very promptly to our request for help with the air con Excellent breakfast too 
319078,Hotel Granados 83, The rooftop terrace was closed to guests for the whole day Saturday as it had been let to a private group There is no view from the rooftop terrace We booked 7no rooms One friend couldn t make it We were still charged the late cancellation fee , The rooms were as you would expect for a four star 
319079,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable but some more pillow options would be helpful The bathroom amenities were excellent and it was great to have a bath tub It is also very quiet 
319080,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, Fantastic location staff were really helpful and drew us a nice map of all the best things to see and places to eat The lobby is really elegant and the rooms are nicely air conditioned Very happy with the blinds that blackout the room completely 
319081,Hotel Granados 83, The rooms didn t had tea and coffee making facilities and was first time in my life that i acctually needed one breakfast has a la carte eggs few options and expensive , The hotel is very beatifull in a good central position Rooms are quite and very nice decorated I enjoyed my stay here 
319082,Hotel Granados 83, Underground parking was a little awkward but the valet was an absolute pro at directing cars into tight spots A crying shame both the pool and rooftop bar are closed until May as it was a reason for choosing the hotel originally with a group of friends , Very comfortable room and bed absolutely loved the electric black out blind very helpful and friendly staff 
319083,Hotel Granados 83, Lack of natural light There were two glass frosted panels in the bathroom that let in substantial light from the lobby and elevator shaft The bathroom had clear glass doors so there was no way to block the light I slept with an eye mask Also there was a ceiling speaker outside of my room that played music that came into the room It was annoying and needless , The hotel was very centrally located close to major attractions and many restaurants and high end shopping My room was very small with no window which was a bit off putting The room was nicely decorated and the toiletries were top notch including lavender linen spray I felt that the restaurant was overpriced so did not use it The staff was helpful and courteous 
319084,Hotel Granados 83, Bar area is limited in size , Quiet yet central location Quirky industrial d cor Good breakfast when discounted to 12pp full price is rather lumpy 
319085,Hotel Granados 83, I didn t experience anything bad Even the doorman was nice , It has good locations Not very far from Passeig de Gracias and the other main streets The front desks personnel were welcoming and cordial The lanky blond guy i don t know his name was charming and very helpful I will highly recommend this place 
319086,Hotel Granados 83, Hotel standard rooms need bringing up to the same standard as rest of hotel, The staff are excellent Had to move at 0130 due to noise from faulty aircon next door No problems Had to move again New year s eve water coming through the ceiling offered smoking room rejected offered exec room very nice Complimentary Champaign Thank you Offered complimentary breakfast which we had on day of departure Great service from excellent staff 
319087,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The beautiful design of the building and rooms made it truly exceptional alongside the tailored service to adjust to each customer It doesn t feel like a hotel at all but rather a home in Barcelona Best area in town with wonderful restaurants and cafes and shopping nearby Best hotel in Barcelona 
319088,Hotel Granados 83, The room was very small and the batroom was out of date reception staff was not very helpful tired maybe , the person taking careof the car was a great man who did the little extra
319089,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, Great hotel everything is so discreet it feels like you are at home Quiet a great night s sleep yet in a vibrant area you will want to explore Well worth it 
319090,Hotel Granados 83, The hotel is a great place to stay for the solo business or young couple I wouldn t recommend the property for those traveling with young children , Location and proximity to metro station Quieter area compared to las ramblas pl Garcia or port Olimpic but still lively at night 
319091,Hotel Granados 83, Breakfast was average Crowded with business travellers at times and staff overwhelmed Two story duplex not very functional spent 95 of time on main floor , Staff nice location excellent room clean new modern 
319092,Hotel Granados 83, Tha lack of basics like a Cofee machine and also the gym was really cramped without basic equipment , The location was excellent and the staff was very helpful and courteous 
319093,Hotel Granados 83, room was small but o k it was high season so as usual the prices were very high and it s barcelona , staff was very very helpful and friendly trying to solve any kind of problem location is fine you can reach most of the things within walking distance 
319094,Hotel Granados 83, Found the bed to be a little too firm for me Our room faced the street which proved to be rather noisy on the weekend Windows didn t seem particularly sound proof Didn t enjoy being woken up at 2 00 AM Recommend a room on the back of the building Didn t find there to be enough lighting in the bedroom , Did not eat any meals at the hotel but did take advantage of the roof top bar very pleasant Sharp looking hotel and really good location Awesome doorman Staff very pleasant Walking distance to some great restaurants
319095,Hotel Granados 83, No Gym and Pool was not a pool , The staff was extremely friendly Very helpful The location was perfect Shall again stay there If I ever visit Barcelona 
319096,Hotel Granados 83, We were sad that our stay was too short , the ambiance of the hotel was very warm and welcoming the staff were very hospitable and helpful Cleanliness was spot on 
319097,Hotel Granados 83, Pool was a bit smaller than expected and the gym consisted of 2 machines , Staff were so kind my friend unexpectedly cancelled due to a family emergency and they were very understanding and offered a reduced rate despite having a non refundable room Rooms were so clean and great lighting 
319098,Hotel Granados 83, Only thing was the air conditioning Barcelona is too warm to be living in a warm room The temperature of the room does not get lower than 23 degrees When we asked the front desk they said to assist in getting in colder for us but nothing happened All the times we asked nothing changed The location of the hotel is not exactly convenient but there was a taxi stand 1 minute away and we managed to get taxis whenever we were out of the hotel , We booked the suite and was treated to an expected surprise Our own private pool Really like the fact that they try to include different services for the guests A stalk of rose in our room on the first night We had coffee and tea every morning and also room service with champagne by our private pool It was such a pleasant stay 
319099,Hotel Granados 83, There was no iron available in the room and when we requested for one they said we could only use the laundry service which was far too expensive , We stayed in a duplex suite we loved the rooftop pool balcony 
319100,Hotel Granados 83, One Iron to cater to the entire hotel is in my opinion a disgrace On top of this trying to charge me and my fellow work colleague for laundry services just topped off my experience I won t be staying again on business but for Personel travel yes ,No Positive
319101,Hotel Granados 83, Would have liked the air conditioning to be a little bit cooler , Breakfast was delicious Staff incredibly helpful with recommendations and tips on sights to see as well as calling cabs and making bookings for us 
319102,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with an exceptional staff I love the receptionist Jose He was great and very helpful Our room was comparable to five star US hotels and the location was perfect I love Barcelona and this hotel made me love it even more I would come back here in a heartbeat 
319103,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, amazing design perfect bit of luxury to come home to after full days in the city we were not there to sit by the pool we were there to experience the city complimentary champagne for us on the first night turn down service with fluffy robes and slippers you can t beat it especially for the money 
319104,Hotel Granados 83, Misleading information about gym and pool Gym was a bike and cross trainer only Though they offered free use of sister gym Pool was more of a long pond feature Bathroom basin ywas awkward and weird shape , Fantastic location staff so helpful and room was clean 
319105,Hotel Granados 83, Noise from the AC made sleep difficult It was difficult to set the temperature correctly and to turn it off completely I had to phone reception The bed was very hard and the pillows were not great All in all I did not sleep very good Breakfast was quite poor and I would recommend going for breakfast outside , The location of the hotel is excellent 
319106,Hotel Granados 83, I was placed in a very small room with a window facing the inside of the hotel No light coming in at all Make sure you ask for window facing outside No bell service to help with luggage on your way out ,No Positive
319107,Hotel Granados 83, Very noisy room you could hear restaurant starting shift at 7am every morning even though we complained about noise levels nothing changed over the four days Marbled interior was nice but all noise carried Roof terrace pool was dirty and we paid for a duplex Do not stay on the ground floor , The staff were very helpful and friendly location outstanding decor and sculpture art was lovely All extra comforts were great fluffy slippers White Company free toiletries Nespresso machine no decaf etc
319108,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The hotel is well located away from the tourist area but not too far It is stylish and there are lots of great bars and restaurantes nearby The hotel is really comfortable and quiet There were clearly lots of other people staying at the hotel as it was full but we never heard anyone In the same way the room was extremely clean but we never saw or heard any cleaning staff A great place to stay in a great city 
319109,Hotel Granados 83, Ask room that does not look to the street Not because of noice Because for security reasons they say the window can not be open You can try to adjust the aircondition but it still will blow straight to your head And you can neither turn it off nor turn it on For both you must call the reception , location breakfast
319110,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, The breakfast was great And the staff was just awesome and very helpful Hotel located near everything Room little small but never needed to be there that much 
319111,Hotel Granados 83, There was music playing in the bathroom which we couldn t work out how to turn off There were multiple switches but no instructions The bottle of water provided at the outset was not replaced when finished which would have been a nice touch , The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom was an excellent size The shutters were great at blocking out the light and would be very helpful in the hotter months The location of the hotel was good A nice distance away from the main tourist sights but very convenient for accessing the city
319112,Hotel Granados 83, We couldn t stay longer , The hotel is very well situated for access to buses trains and the metro to see all the Barcelona sights The staff were all very friendly and put our comfort and enjoyment above all else 
319113,Hotel Granados 83, Bed could be more comfortable , Location is good almost everything is in walking distance Room service food is delicious and reasonable prices Helpful front desk staff I got chocolates and fresh rose upon arrival 
319114,Hotel Granados 83, A little more shelf space in the bathroom for personal toiletries bags , Great room very clean and modern Very friendly staff with good english skills Lots of places to eat nearby The Metro is 1 5 blocks away and one stop to the Gothic quarter I would stay here again I did not eat at the restaurant as we wanted to get out of the hotel but I would expect the hotel restaurant to be at least good and probably quite nice 
319115,Hotel Granados 83, A bit noisy with the school out the back if you want to lie in during the week and there was a bit of noise from other rooms , Very nice rooms in a great area with loads of great local restaurants and the staff were very friendly and helpful Would definitely recommend and hope to stay again 
319116,Hotel Granados 83, Mosquito in the room and no possibility to open the window Very small fitness room, Nice location Friendly staff Cool interior design of the hotel Really good resturants nearby
319117,Hotel Granados 83, I overlooked the quiet room option and I found it a bit too noisy during the night but it was my fault of choice and weekend so totally understanding , relaxed vibe and friendliness
319118,Hotel Granados 83, Terrace bar was closed the gym isn t a gym It s a small cupboard room with a cycle machine and the breakfast was below par, Staff were amazing my room flooded from above and they upgraded and changed my room immediately and gave me free breakfast and bottle of wine
319119,Hotel Granados 83, Our room was on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel and the noise at night from the bars and restaurants was very loud and made sleeping difficult even though I had asked for a quiet room in the booking application Breakfast is adequate but could be better , Room was very nice and design of the hotel was impressive The staff on reception were very helpful and polite and went out of their way to help with local area enquiries 
319120,Hotel Granados 83, There wasn t anything we didn t like However the aroma as you walked into reception was a bit overwhelming on the nose Smelt like cheap aftershave perfume had a chemical undertone which was sickly Also the wood veneer flooring in the room was very squeeky , The hotel was smart and comfortable The service was excellent 
319121,Hotel Granados 83, My room had very little light It was well organized and comfortable though , Very sleek design minimal Close to the airport bus Universitat stop Good bath Best hotel slippers ever 
319122,Hotel Granados 83, More style than substance Rooftop closed for private party so not access at all to bar or pool A shame when hotel was supposed to be a treat , Stylish comfortable beds
319123,Hotel Granados 83, Had a bit of trouble with room safe which seemed mor complicated than necessary , Location was excellent in the Eixample District close to Metro and easy walk to Passeig de Gracia to see Pedrera Casa Batilo Casa Amatlier etc and not a long walk further to the Rambla s Staff very helpful 
319124,Hotel Granados 83, The wifi is very frustrating and I ended up relying on free wifi in local bars and cafes If I was in Barcelona on business rather than fun the wifi is so poor it would make me consider a different hotel which would be a shame as I really enjoyed my stay , Very well located walking distances easy and also metro very close comfortable room and bed nice outdoor space very helpful and friendly staff Lots of very good cafes bars and restaurants nearby 
319125,Hotel Granados 83, Air conditioning and lighting systems were a bit complicated My single room was very dark as the window looked out on to a narrow passageway Due to insufficient lighting by the doorway I was not able to read the instructions on how to use the safe The breakfast was fine but there could have been a greater choice of cereals and bread This however was more than compensated by the attentiveness of the pretty and hard working waitress These comments are made however for the benefit of hotel management and not to deter f ture guests , All members of staff were very courteous and helpful 
319126,Hotel Granados 83, Room service and food in general was so basic and we even felt a bit offended for the money we paid for the food , The doorman was so kind The female receptionist all the help and advice great knowledge and recommendations Location was in the upper side of Barcelona away from La Rambla about a 15min walk down the posher extension With fabulous local more authentic eateries around Cava and a rose upon arrival 
319127,Hotel Granados 83,No Negative, Very convenient location and neighborhood Hotel is very chic and the rooms are quiet Staff was friendly and the room amenities were great No complaints whatsoever

319133,Hotel Granados 83, There was not a great deal of variety with the food served Also the pillows in the rooms were too soft , The hotel decor was great
