174335,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The location is too far out of Paris major point of interest Although the hotel is close to the Subway Metro the surrounding area is not the safest , Very clean rooms and very modern

174342,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The breakfast was quite frugal and I felt it was nt value for money The breakfast area has limited seating capacity and becomes quite a challenge to find a place to sit , The location is fantastic just above the metro station the tram station is only 50 meters away The place is absolutely safe and in a nice residential neighborhood There are several super markets convenience stores pharmacies around the property The rooms are comfortable equipped with a microwave coffee maker etc overall we had a memorable stay

174346,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Wasn t as close to the attractions as I d hoped Also parking is horrible Either you pay less and park at a hospital which closes your car in at 8 pm or you pay more and walk fifteen minutes, Staff and breakfast were great The hotel was clean and directly next to the metro Eifel tower a fifteen minute ride on the metro
174347,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Parking was not easily accessible and not very safe The seating area near elevators was littered with used plates and bottles , Comfortable bed and room with A C Nespresso machine in room was great Staff was helpful with directions to various Paris sights Breakfast selection was good Metro directly out front door of hotel 
174348,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Rooms can be slightly bigger specially for the family The photos on the website give that impression Some utensils for heating up stuff in microwave will be great , Location is great for transport as well as food options nearby Staff is friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good 
174349,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, nothing, We did not have a good experience with Holiday Inn last time we stayed in Paris so we decided we would book a hotel with nicer and comfortable room We browsed booking com and found this Novotel closer to where i had to attend a conference and the pictures of the rooms looked really good When we reached there the actual room surpassed our expectations It was very spacious and very clean pretty much comparable to a 4star The shower and bath was very clean and spacious and the drainage system was really good which is often not good in hotels They cleaned the room everyday and topped up the tea bar too the ambience of the lobby and hotel rooms is very nice we stayed with two kids and even though there was extra bed for kids there was ample space Metro is just outside and it takes you directly to champs lys es connects you to other lines that take you directly to Musee du louvre or Notre Dame and other attractions so you do not spend a lot of time travelling Staff is very helpful and friendly they even kept our luggage after checkout while our flight was late and we needed to hover around without carrying heavy luggage with us I would definitely give it a 5 star an d stay with them again there are enough cheap restaurants near the hotel and really good bakery right in front of it 
174350,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Sometimes there was not enough tables bring breakfast time Scrambled eggs were not tasty while all the rest was pretty good They should be canceled from menu or replaced by natural eggs , Perfect location in front of metro exit New hotel with clean rooms Very clever design of hotel and room interiors Good breakfast like in France Very king and helpful personnel 
174351,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, we didnt stay longer, A few steps from the main entrance you had access to the metro and could be anywhere in the city in 10 20mins Was close to Orly airport if your coming via this airport The rooms were big and very clean maybe even huge for Paris standards we stayed in a similar rated hotel during our stay and was very small compared to here Some people complained about the metro tram we were on level 1 and despite some noise and vibrations this had no effect on my sleep and i m a light sleeper at the best of times A few shops over the road were handy for supplies and a really nice bakery if your not having breakfast in the hotel Staff were always friendly and helpful Would come back here again if we visited Paris
174352,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The rattle of the entire building every time a train goes past , Impeccably clean well equipped rooms Shops and lovely bakery right opposite Decent location with Metro station right outside Just 12 15 minute Metro ride into the middle of Paris

174378,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, It was not a 4 star as described on the web site It is more like a low 3 star by Irish or English standards The room was not a sweet it was a normal size room with a double and two single beds crammed into it , The price was good for a family of 4 
174379,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, No negative points really, This hotel was absolutely fantastic I will stay again and again We can ear the train vibrations but the settings make you forget about it Kudos 
174380,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Dirty room Pictures were a lie Discourteous staff Very very expensive Not worth of money Please stay away from this property hopeless breakfast , Subway station next to hotel
174381,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Poor Service at breakfast could not meet the demands i e Cutlery food etc Extra sofa bed and pillows were hard uncomfortable although near transport be warned if your ligh sleeper the tram noise may keep you awake , Large room compared to most hotels in Paris modern and clean and cheap Breakfast food was good
174382,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, room wasn t cleaned once, why pay hefty latin quarter rates for a mediocre botique hotelwhen you can be there in 10 min and get a world class hotel treatment
174383,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Lower bed of the sofa is quite small narrow good until year 8 Sometimes you can hear the sound of metro RER As we were on the 5th floor it was not disturbing , Delicious plenty breakfast Room is good for family with two kids Underground station is right before the hotel easy to reach the center Very good accommodation 
174384,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, You are not in the centre of Paris and don t really get the real Paris feel when you walk out the door Not many restaurants or patisseries nearby But easy to get everywhere by the metro There is no crockery or cutlery in the rooms we had to ask for china cups plates and spoons to make coffee and breakfast etc , The staff were lovely and very helpful The beds were very comfortable and rooms were spotlessly clean There is a safe in the room the metro entrance is right outside the door and there is a Carrefour supermarket about a 5 minute walk away Nespresso cofffee machine and microwave and fridge in the room

174387,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, I was very upset with Booking com because I searched and did a booking for 5 persons in the same room with 3 weeks in advance 24 hours before my arrival Bookings com sent me an email informing me that we could only be 4 in the room and that I would have to pay for another room for the 5th person Not even a call just an email ,No Positive
174388,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The first room we were given hadn t had any of the bins emptied and there were suspicious hairs in the bath This was resolved quickly as we were immediately moved rooms and the receptionist was very apologetic The room had a coffee machine fridge kettle and microwave but no cutlery plates bowls cups etc Brought food back one night and had to go down to reception to ask for all these items The room had two huge TVs One on a stand and one wall mounted seemed pointless really Also the remote annoying would operate both TVs so you had to be very careful how you changed channel or you could accidentally switch on the other to Wall mounted shower gel body wash but no shampoo conditioner etc supplied which was disappointing Small table next to kitchen area in the room was handy but only had one chair not enough for a family of four , Check in was quick and children were very pleased with their complimentary cuddly toy key ring Hotel was modern and rooms were big Beds were comfy and the nearby metro was very handy to get into central Paris Area seemed nice Ate at a gorgeous cafe bar on the first night after a recommendation from reception Supermarkets near by and lovely restaurants etc about a 10 15 minute walk away Lovely shower and bath Breakfast continental style was plentiful and good quality Constantly restocked and a good variety Staff friendly and helpful when asked

174391,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The location is too far from the downtown Also the breakfast place is too tight There is no ironing stuff in the yet there is one tiny ironing room with one ironing table for the whole guests in the 10th floor , The Cleanliness of the hotel is great The staff were very friendly and helpful 
174392,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, located directly above a metro station so every time a train passes by the room vibrates the sound is heard through breakfast also basic could be better As i was on the first floor felt the train even more , Room was nice comfortable staff polite helpful area is nice 
174393,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, nothing, Very nice hotel wide room and very clean nice staff in the reception very helpful in the breakfast breakfast is fresh and healthy wide variety and very nice for kids room service is very nice quiet hotel the metro station is by the hotel wall it is very very near

174395,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Sometime we hear noise of metro but not loud, The Hotel is in very good location having metro just at the door step rooms are big enough and very comfortable and the cleaning in the hotel is super To add the hotel is having strong WiFi connection which is very much required
174396,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, It would have a lot more comfortable if the Dining Area was more spacious , The room service is excellent and the bed is really comfortable Also the metro station is just outside the main entrance on the line that takes directly to the Champs Elysees

174404,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Breakfast is good but not enough space so we had to wait for a table to be cleaned every day It is somewhat remote so you need to take the metro to go to the more lively neighborhoods , Excellent value for money new clean very close to metro station I can definitely recommend this hotel 
174405,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Everything was fine , I was in this hotel with my family between August 20 28 2016 Hotel is 10 meters away from metro station Porte de Vanves In France especially in Paris staying at a hotel near a metro station is very important We had no problem of transportation There are 4 5 stops from Porte de Vanves to Montparnesse which is one of the most central stations of Paris and 8 9 stops to Champ Elysees Each and every staff was always smiling and helpful They both helped us about hotel issues and answered all our questions about places and transportation They were really sincere They also speak English fluently this is important for non French speakers to make the communication easier The rooms were very clean Althugh the hotel is located very near to train and metro stations there is no problem of noise The size of the room was enough for us 2 adults one 12 year old child There is an uninterrupted and free wi fi connection both in the rooms and lobby area The check out hour was twelve and our return flight was in the evening We asked them to keep our luggages after check out for a few hours and they accepted this in a very friendly manner To sum up if I go to Paris again I would prefer this hotel again 
174406,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, No Windows Toilets have no sink so though they look clean hygene is very questionable Much smaller rooms than the other Suite Novotels I have been to, Comfortable Bed
174407,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Bathroom door was slightly broken awkwardly designed Hit lamp or desk every time entering or exiting it , Clean Saw top of Eiffel Tower from our room Shower facilities were pretty good 
174408,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The refrigerator had food and drinks from previous guest not very clean The cleaning staff kept leaving stuff at our room one day it was a mop the other day there were detergents in the shower Breakfast is not included and costs 15 euros much cheaper to eat outside , The staff was great very nice and helpful The room was spacious The metro is at the entrance of the hotel The hotel facilities are new and modern Good WiFi reception in the room Overall the staff made the difference They were helped with everything we needed If we come back it is mainly thanks to them

174410,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Breakfast area during weekend was over crowded Too many guests were trying to eat at the same time and the service was not prepared for quick cleaning It took us almost 10 minutes before we find the free table and the same amount of time to have the table ready , Rooms are comfortable and very clean You could not expect more from the room Metro station is just few meters from the hotel 
174411,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff brought extra blankets without problems Brand new hotel extremely clean and very nice Great that two kids under 16 stay for free Excellent noise isolation one doesn t hear the nearby railway or car traffic at all Location on top of a metro station Relatively cheap underground parking available but 10 minutes away on foot 
174412,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, They charged us with city taxes which was already included in our booking and paid They also charged us for extra 20 in addition to the price asked by our reservation at the time of booking 3 weeks before the reservation No place to park your car and unload your luggage to hotel , It was clean A metro station 13 is in front of the hotel

174414,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, There was no parking at the hotel but we didn t need one , The location was ok I thought it would be closer to the center of Paris There were traintracks next to the hotel Sometimes I heard the trains but it didn t bother me My son loves trains so he was extremely happy about it When we went into the center we could take tram or metro We once took a taxi and it wasn t expensive We bought 3 day pass to the metro trams 
174415,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The matras of the bedsofa was hard The room was good but could have been an little bit bigger 3 persons , The hotel was overall good Friendly and helpfull staff Breakfast was good The coffee machine was excellent Everything refilled on time 
174416,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, There is no elevator to go down to the subway station so it requires some physical exercises to carry up and down luggage , I love the contemporary design of the property the facility of the bathroom is super The location of the hotel is right beside the entrance of the subway It s not trouble to transfer to main point of interests by subway I feel safe about the locked front gate of hotel when we came back late and you only can enter with your own card 
174417,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, We don t recommend this hotel to no one traveling from USA, Nothing to like about this hotel bad aircondtion small room nothing to eat during breakfast elevator does not work at night and you need to take the stirs to third floor Expensive for nothing comparing to other surrounding hotels in the same area 
174418,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Children was hoping to have a playroom but it was not a big deal , Very clean hotel with a good language skills stuff Breakfast was amazing and they are even giving most of the food organic Quality hotel

174421,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Housekeeping was great except that they sometimes seem to use old cleaning rags So the floor sometimes gets smelly , Everything was fabulous The location which is two steps from Porte de Vanvas metro station the friendly staff the beautiful modern design of the hotel the cosy bedrooms 
174422,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Although the windows in the hotel are soundproof you can hear the metro which runs every 5 minutes from 5 30 a m we had a room on the second floor We got a room where a toilet was a single room without a sink to wash hands we had to go to the bathrooom Some of the tables are situated in front of the reception desk so it may happen that you eat your breakfast near the lobby , New hotel big and comfortable beds in the room clean room breakfast with a plenty of choice time for breakfast is from 6 a m to 11 a m nice staff they are ready to help you at any time multimedia table for the children in the lobby they may play while you check in or check out 
174423,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, nothing, the location was very near to the metro station and since the hotel is new the room was also very good even the staff was very helpful both at the breakfast and at the reception
174424,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Late night the noise not too bad but the noise from the subway passing You have a very helpful staff The best , The staff the bed the shower and great water pressure 
174425,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, I stayed for a total of 8 nights in the hotel There are 2 soap dispensers in the bathroom One at the bath tub and one at the standing shower area When I reached on my 1st day I noticed that there was very little soap left in the shower dispenser and it was not a full bottle I had thought the housekeeper would notice it and replenish by 2nd day But it was not done till the 7th day which was really disappointing Meanwhile I simply squeezed soap out into a cup from the dispenser at the bath tub for my use This is an example of a small detail that is important to the customer but overlooked I also disliked the fact that a senior employee at the hotel is unfriendly to guests I assumed he is someone ranked manager as I saw him on more than a few mornings mingling with staff He doesn t make eye contact with guests or greets them , I loved that the family room was spacious and the fact it was so near to a metro exit Even though it is abit further away from the city centre it is still not too bad It is in a quiet but relatively safe area And the Chinese Vietnamese restaurant nearby was a surprise bonus The staff at the reception were good and especially one male staff who went the extra mile to get ice for my husband on a few nights for our soft drinks in the room He even provided an ice bucket 
174426,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, , Even if the train passes right by the hotel the rooms are well isolated and therefore very quiet The design of the room is nice and I specifically liked the idea of the moving TV as well as the air conditioner not being oriented towards the bed as in most of the hotels Staff was nice breakfast ok Easy access to the city center by subway 
174427,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Kitchen utility is worst If one Microwave and tiny fidge can be designated as Kitchen No Bowl No Plates not even spoon Cooking place is very small This place should enlisted under Hotel in Booking com not in Apartments with Kitchen facility If you want stay for couple of days with your family and wish to prepare your food by yourself this is worst choice Another thing you have to pay full charge during check in before entering the room So you do not have any choice after Only facility location is just near the Metro station ,No Positive
174428,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The location is not the greatest when you have kids You cannot walk around the area at night during the day we were comfortable , The facility was clean and comfortable The staff was fantastic The location is nicely located next to a Metro so it was very easy to get to the tourist areas 
174429,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Room was crampy Basic facilities provided without any luxury My credit card debited without my approval unexpectedly before my arrival I intended to pay using another card so had to get refund on my booking card I am not sure when the amount will be credited back , All the facilities were satisfactory 
174430,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The toilet is separate to the bathroom which was odd and there was no extra sink with the toilet so had to go to the bathroom to wash hands every time Also ironing facilities are on another floor , The location was excellent on the doorstep of the metro station Large spacious bedroom and very clean and modern 
174431,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, No restaurant bars in the vicinity No restaurant in the hotel Railway noise in the early morning on the third floor not sure how high you need to go to reduce this , Large well equipped room very clean with a metro station on the doorstep

174434,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, I know some people might be put off with noise from metro but it didnt bother us as we re used to city noise The only slight negative about the hotel was level of cleanliness Altough clean there were scuff marks on doors and bath I personally like to walk into a hotel room and feel like i m the first person to use it Having said that i do believe that the general standard of cleaning has gone down over the last few years in all hotels , I was with my husband and 8 year old and had the superior suite which was perfect for our needs Metro was just outside the hotel so access to travel around was perfect Pedro at reception was very friendly and super helpful 
174435,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, The food available in the hotel was very pricey but it was literally the only drawback , The room we had was fab Clean spacious and modern The room had a comfy bed bright bathroom with a great shower and the room was huge with a sofa area with an additional TV The location of the hotel is perfect with a metro stop right outside the door One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in

174439,Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Pretty Far from gare de l est where I arrived maybe should think about offering a transortation service for guests but as metro is 10 meters from the Hotel not in the center but still zone 1 so reaching the multiple attractions in the city was not really a problem , Very Big an modern rooms with big flatscreen Nespresso machine only three capsules I guess you can get more if you ask fridge micro wave clean hotel very close to metro and tram station polite an comptetent staff
