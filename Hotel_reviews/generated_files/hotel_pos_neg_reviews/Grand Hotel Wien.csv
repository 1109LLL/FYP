353024,Grand Hotel Wien, Honestly nothing Maybe would have been great that the sound in the bathroom would have worked but honestly this is a minor point And we managed it with the radio from the TV, Excellent and central location Gorgeous buffet breakfast An incredible wide range of choice of everything you can even not imagine Japanese miso soup Arabic humus etc home made mortadella freshly pressed juices cheeses fruits good Stauds jams nuts grains pastries and dishes they can prepare fresh benedict eggs we came for our wedding anniversary and they offered us a bootle of Sekt which is very keen room was very comfortable we slept very well quiet and dark Grand Hotel is one of the most beautiful classical hotels of Vienna especially good price quality relation Others might be nicer but much more expensive You might feel missing space in the corridors but you should have enough in your room 4m ceiling height

353028,Grand Hotel Wien, The minibar was loud at night The bathtub did not drain very well The breakfast is not impressive and does not justify the price, The hotel has an old Viennese charm and tradition that not many other hotels have The location is ideal The restaurants are very good especially Le Ciel
353029,Grand Hotel Wien, ragged robes many years staying in this hotels this Godot is just a disappointment Double double without one of the gown up and old rags, I like this hotel 
353030,Grand Hotel Wien, There was no breakfast included in the price , Junior Suite was spacious Surprised large walk in closet and very large bathroom Welcome snacks and sweets specially for children welcome drinks Nice room service twice a day and chocolates on the pillow Surprisingly quiet hotel no sounds neither from outside nor hallway 
353031,Grand Hotel Wien, Service of the hotel and primarily the front desk staff service at the reception Hotel also has a serious problem with their card keys to access the lifts and rooms these cards can hardly work which was a very serious issue and front desk at the reception would help or cooperate unless you go to complain Staff are not friendly So basically front desk service is 0, Location of the hotel ad well as the building
353032,Grand Hotel Wien, 1 Resturant Unkai mistake food tasty but service unprofessional it is necessary long to wait mistakes in orders 2 The view from the windows in Junior Suites should be beautiful and on the city according to the description on the website of booking com The view in both Junior Suites 317 and 318 was on closest distance app 10 12 m buildings 3 Mistakes during check out explained and successfully finished 2 bills from others rooms added to our bill bill for one Junior Suite 2 times higher then for second Junior Suite we understand that perhaps the staff was tired but it is hotel 5 and such mistakes should not take place , Hotel has excellent location a few steps from K rntner Stra e Opera Hofburg and St Stephan Church Hotel has beautiful design is very clean and comfortable Both Junior Suites were comfortable had big bathrooms two or three wardrobes we booked 2 Junior Suites in one was 2 wardrobes and in second 3 wardrobes the beds were extremaly comfortable Breakfasts were tasty and diverse The breakfast s service was polite fast and professional WiFi good and fast Restaurant Grand Brasserie very good service and food Austrian kitchen Room service and consierge always be helpful Generally we are very satisfied and we are going to stay in Grand Hotel Wien during next our visit in Vienna Thank you very much 
353033,Grand Hotel Wien, Our only issue during the visit was that on one night we got back to the room to discover that housekeeping had left the door on the latch during the evening turn down so unfortunately our room was open for several hours front desk did apologise though , Helpful staff nice bar lovely rooms and the basket of Easter eggs and chocolate rabbit on Easter Sunday were a nice touch Would definitely stay again
353034,Grand Hotel Wien, Unfortunately numerous small items Superior room was small with disappointing view The hotel permits smoking and the odour is noticeable in various non smoking areas The room had a delightful selection of teas but no kettle to brew them We asked but none arrived , The breakfast was the best I ve ever had Truly superb The staff were also wonderful 
353035,Grand Hotel Wien, Too expensive Low value for money They Could not find my booking made by booking com they claimed booking cancelled it Later they found and agreed after talking to booking Very embarrassing to me Very awkward , Large rooms very comfy bed
353036,Grand Hotel Wien, You have to be careful getting I and out of the bath but there are two supports, The hotel is excellent in every respect The location is perfect for walking to all central districts For an old hotel the facilities are very modern and it has been refurbished to a very high standard The breakfast is quite exceptional
353037,Grand Hotel Wien, Not there fault more to do with the culture but the smell of smoke coming from the smoking bar to the reception area was not pleasant when you entered the hotel , We were served in the bar by an extremely friendly and pleasant bar man Simon Marech who made us feel very welcome 
353038,Grand Hotel Wien, The Kavalier bar was totally dominated by the very strong smell of cigarette cigar smoke The evening we attempted to have drinks there we could literally see a haze of smoke all over the room plus there is the smell that accompanies this and the knowledge that had we stayed it would have been transferred to our clothes Even walking into the hotel from the street into the reception area there is the smell of stale cigarette smoke Coming from a country where smoking is viewed differently in detracted from what was a very enjoyable holiday However the lobby bar staff more than made up for the missed opportunity by providing a first class drinks service in a smoke free area , The purpose of our holiday was my wife s birthday and the complimentary bottle of wine in our room immediately put us in a good mood The staff and in particular the concierge were always helpful and provided that little extra service that makes the difference 
353039,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, Excellent in every way especially the location for transport and walking to all sights Very helpful staff and excellent facilities within the hotel 
353040,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, This was a perfect treat for my mother s 70th birthday Staff were wonderful and there was champagne and Guglhopf to greet us in our room on arrival Comfortable room fantastic staff delicious food and lots of places to relax all in a fabulous building and amazing location Thank you very much for a wonderful memorable stay 
353041,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, That was an awesome weekend And I would like to thank Grand Hotel for excellent service Sure next time in Vienna I will make the same choice for hotel 
353042,Grand Hotel Wien, the room was overheated didn t go lower 25C despite climate control the mattress was very uncomfortable , the michelin star restaurant Le Ciel is amazing
353043,Grand Hotel Wien, Needs furniture space to unpack otherwise will live out of the suitcase The hotel has a smoking area so the smoke smell waifs to the ground floor and hallways Didn t visit the lounge due to small space and cigarette smell , The bathroom was a nice size with a separate toilet room The spa was very nice however it is small and has a limited staff Need to make an appointment in advance

353045,Grand Hotel Wien, there is a valet parking in the hotel I prefer to park my car myself, A really nice luxury hotel in the city centre with great facilities and friendly staff
353046,Grand Hotel Wien, It smelted not very fresh in the toilet part of the barthroom Bellboy offered us a car to the airport which was 15 Euro mor expensive than a regular taxi I do believe that room upgrade if offered by hotel should not cost anything for the guest , Pleasant hotel with excellent location Very good service

353051,Grand Hotel Wien, Felt like we were nickel and dimed only one bottle of water was complimentary during our whole 3 day stay We stayed over Christmas and nothing really special was offered to guests to make this a special day in the hotel Disappointed that they would not let us extend our check out for even one hour And unfortunately our last impression was fairly negative The Grand Hotel Wien Bellhop along with a taxi driver that hotel called for us were both trying hard to convince us that a taxi ride to the Vienna Airport was same price as the S7 Train 40 Euro When we asked them why they were trying to exploit us as we knew we could get S7 Train tickets at 4 80 Euro for 2 persons 4 times less the cost They said it was not true and then the taxi driver complained the whole way to Train station and he drove a route twice as long as he needed to and charged us for the extra distance on his meter Then he dropped us and our many bags far from train station saying he couldn t get any nearer not true as other taxis were dropping clients at station And it was raining Our 3rd trip to Vienna and always in other hotels the staff have always protected us and taken care of us better , We liked the beauty of hotel Christmas tree in lobby Front desk hospitality staff helpful When room not ready for us they quickly sent two different parties to prepare room for our stay Room Service was nice just expensive Location good 
353052,Grand Hotel Wien, Patronize this hotel for 12 years I have always been pleased with the service cost quality diligence team This time I m really disappointed ranging from accommodation through the disrespectful attitude in the restaurant during breakfast and horrible room that they gave me The bed was gutting pillows soft and uncomfortable Well nothing will continue to try other hotels in Vienna Farewell Grand Hotel Wien I had a pleasant emotions here but obviously every relationship has a shelf life ,No Positive

353058,Grand Hotel Wien, Breakfast was expensive Having to swipe my credit card without charge every time we opened closed the safe , Great central location 15min walk from Wien Mitte the rail station used to from the airport only a few minutes from the Staatsoper and Musikverein theatres Despite being on a major thoroughfare the room was quiet thanks to secondary double glazing The room was very spacious Breakfast buffet with ample choice 
353059,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, Lovely understated luxury with classically pretty bedrooms The brasserie restaurant was great for breakfast We had dinner out as the Ciel Restsurant was fully booked over the duration of our stay 
353060,Grand Hotel Wien, This historical hotel is loosing their glorious days 450 Euro per night is too expensive judging from the total level of services Breakfast restaurant concierge and porters need more execellence ,No Positive

353063,Grand Hotel Wien, few bugs between the 2 windows in the rooms the comforter was too thin for my taste usually in luxury hotels the bedding makes you feel like you are sleeping in Wonderland i didn t like it and the sheets were not in good condition disappointing but it is the only negative point that i could experience , superb location beautiful place the room was just perfect the personnel is very nice nothing to say except that it is a great value for the price

353067,Grand Hotel Wien, Wish I could have timed my turn down service better I was always in the room at the time It s such a nice little added thing that makes you feel a special guest , Food was phenomenal in the Grand Brassiere Buffet selection far beyond any I ve ever seen Loved it Decor overall was just what I hoped for staying in Vienna And the location was just perfect for everything I wanted to experience 
353068,Grand Hotel Wien, I didn t appreciate finding out that upgrades were available to guests who book directly Our first bedroom bath were very small the bath had a deep tub which was difficult to climb into but not a separate walk in shower , Good location Walking distance to the opera house in one direction the famous Cafe Schwarzenberg in the other and basically in the center of things Helpful staff they were very cooperative when we requested a room change My companion had a massage at the Spa and gives it a good review Concierge staff were excellent This property was a premiere hotel in turn of the century Vienna and there are still traces of its glamorous past It was interesting to imagine what life was like back then Breakfast included an interesting variety of Asian Arabic and Western dishes 
353069,Grand Hotel Wien, I had reserved 3 rooms with same condition but they delivered two different types and three different values , Location is very good and room is very clean
353070,Grand Hotel Wien, The value of money is too high The intrnet is not free whice I think is not fare bcz all 5 stars hotel is free al around the world , Its a great hotel
353071,Grand Hotel Wien, 1 The only 5 star hotel in the world that does not provide complementary water in the rooms 2 For late check out until 5PM they request full payment for additional night 3 The Japanese restaurant in the lobby is terrible ,No Positive
353072,Grand Hotel Wien, Only a roof vue very bad Beds was very HARD Interior curtains and carpet not fresh Breakfast vas Bad Go to visit Clarion Hotell in Lule Sweden then you will see an excellent breakfast on top floor and a 3 4 star hotell I was very disappointed, centralt very nice staff beautiful entree Very good service 
353073,Grand Hotel Wien, took a very long time at check in we were showed room but none of them were the one what we wished for even if we told the front desk what we wished finally they showed us the 3rd room same category room But WHY can t show us this room at the beginning It is in same category but bigger than the first 2 rooms WE had to sit in the lobby for 30min at midnight If we were showed the right room at the beginning Wonder why this hotel only show the worst room first and kept the guests waiting at midnight NOT professional at all After we were in the room we were told to wait for the key to be delivered but no one came in another 30min this is after midnight we had to wait without being able to shower Finally I went downstairs myself to get the key but only one lady there and she was busy with other things and the front desk night manager who showed us the 3rd room was not there either so I had to wait in front the front desk again for the key this is a cold and lazy front desk , location
353074,Grand Hotel Wien, The carpets and linen smell really bad The room is too small Internet was extremely slow and disconnecting Blankets are small Drinking water was provided only for first night , Conceirge was really helpful Breakfast was good but expensive 
353075,Grand Hotel Wien, This is the first time in my whole life that happened to me when I requested from room service a plate with a knife and I was surprised with the answer from the room service staff of charging me a 5 euro for that It never happened to me eventhough in a 3 or 4 star hotels so what about a5 star hotel The other thing is that my booking was for a superior double or twin room and when I got to the hotel at the time of checking in the hotel front desk staff told me that my booking is for the standard room but I noticed that when I checked into the room so I didn t want to move and my family with my kids and my luggage to another room in different floors and the hotel had enough time to arrange that since the time of booking , Overall the hotel was nice
353076,Grand Hotel Wien, Literally nothing , Without exaggeration the nicest hotel we ve ever stayed in A timeless classic that avoids theme park phoniness or staid stuffiness Beautiful decor an impossible to beat location I can t praise it enough 
353077,Grand Hotel Wien, Service was very patchy and incompetent Wrong breakfast we asked for an ironing room in the room but it didn t turn up Brasserie closed even though we had specifically asked before arrival whether it would be open Miles below standard , Lovely big elegant rooms
353078,Grand Hotel Wien, One evening in the bar very disappointed with the attitude of the bar man I actually stated once I had signed the bar bill attitude not acceptable This was the only time we felt aggrieved So sad one person can spoil what was a lovely experience, The comfort and location Majority of staff were very accompdatong and professional especially with our two 30 something sons 
353079,Grand Hotel Wien, TV remote and TV didn t work properly one of the phone didn t work mini bar made huge sound we asked king side bed and got twin and we were told that s the best they can do Staff though was very friendly and helpful and we got the room earlier ,No Positive
353080,Grand Hotel Wien, This was my first trip to europ so i had hard time finding the entreance especialy the road looks like side walk to me , Just to make it simple you have to stay at this hotel
353081,Grand Hotel Wien, In fact we booked grand Ferdinand hotel first and moved into this hotel on the 21st May What was described in your website about this hotel was not what we saw Staff is unfriedly and not helpful at all The room in the first floor and was dark We asked for a different room as this room did not have the basic facilities Toilet was not different Tia communal toilet Shower is away from dressing table and toilet No drawers we decided to check out immediately and found grand hotel as a better choice It s like from hell to heaven, Breakfast is full of choices Rooms are clean Spacious Bathroom is excellent 
353082,Grand Hotel Wien, Nothing to not like A pool would have made it 10 out of 10 , Feeling of old Vienna luxury but with modern comforts Very comfortable bed Breakfast choice amazing and delicious Le Ciel restaurant was a real treat for a special lunch Smiling efficient staff unstuffy relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel Gift of ice bucket of bubbly left in our room on our anniversary with card signed by staff Location perfect for going to the opera 
353083,Grand Hotel Wien, Nothing really , The smoothest check in and check out I have ever had to do Amazing and very helpful staff Loved the fact that they clean the room more than once per day never had that experience before Overall excellent and satisfying experience 
353084,Grand Hotel Wien, Restaurant meal on first evening not particularly good They have a sign asking for no mobiles in the restaurant but we were plagued by people around us constantly making and taking calls and loudly Very inconsiderate and staff took no notice We had breakfast included but were still charged again for one of us having just porridge in the room when my wife was taken ill Thought this very unreasonable , Lovely hotel in excellent location Comfortable quiet room nice bathroom toiletries Staff good and friendly Very nice public rooms and lobby bar has pianist playing in evenings which is nice Concierge very helpful Shopping centre attached with good supermarket right by back door to hotel we found very useful Our room window overlooked the atrium to the shops 
353085,Grand Hotel Wien, I thought spa would be a bath with some jacuzzi ideally and a sauna steam room however there were no bath and only a sauna steam and some beauty treatments , All staff members were very kind and friendly It s recommended 
353086,Grand Hotel Wien, Room was SO hot we turned off the heating all together and opened the window which meant we heard a bit of street and pedestrian traffic at night Bathroom was too warm and we couldn t turn off the towel rail or underfloor heating so propped the door open which improved the air flow Fine for showering and washing a bit too hot to stand putting on make up It would have been helpful to be able to move the hairdryer from the hot bathroom to the bedroom , Staff friendly efficient attempted to practice my rusty German however everyone including the hotel waiting staff all spoke excellent English Location great right in District 1 5 mins walk from Opera public transport Food was good quality and not over expensive Rooms were spacious and well equipped The magnifying mirror was great in theory but see comments re hot bathroom 
353087,Grand Hotel Wien, They can t cook a decent English breakfast and lunch menu in the Brasserie is limited , Room was comfortable with good wardrobe space and good size bathroom But no view Perfect location and good facilities staff were very friendly 
353088,Grand Hotel Wien, The only negative of our stay was our room view which over looked the shopping centre and not the beautiful street outside However in a hotel of this style and comfort this was a small compromise , Amazing location with opera house at the end of the street tram and underground stations outside We particularly liked the piano music in the rosegarten bar from 5pm every evening Our room was comforting after a long day exploring the city with excellent service throughout our stay 
353089,Grand Hotel Wien, Nothing btw we did not try breakfast due to our schedule , Good location walking distance to city center restaurants cafes and touristic places Friendly and helpful staff Facilities were fantastic Even a hair dryer was really powerful for the size Free coffee and bottle of water in a room and chocolate 
353090,Grand Hotel Wien, We ate breakfast at different cafes instead of the hotel as the set breakfast was 35 euros , The bathroom was fabulous underfloor heating super clean everything you could need and Penhaligons toiletries to boot The Spa was lovely too well worth a visit All the staff were charming and helpful Tasteful decor quiet and perfect location One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in 
353091,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, this hotel gives you a very relaxed but at the same time very professional feeling which for us is a very good combination The location is great the rooms are very quiet and the staff is excellent 
353092,Grand Hotel Wien, Price of breakfast Far too expensive , The decor was beautiful the staff all very friendly and helpful Rooms were spotless Location fantastic My only criticism is the price of the breakfast We ate elsewhere 
353093,Grand Hotel Wien, It was a bit on the expensive side but as a special occasion was worth it , Very luxurious hotel Bed and bath were awesome Festive Christmas atmosphere in the beautiful foyer with a big tree and gingerbread house 
353094,Grand Hotel Wien, the room faced out to a courtyard which could ve been better maintained However the luxury red curtains and nets hid this so didn t cause an issue , Stunning hotel with exceptionally friendly staff especially concierge and room service staff Spa was quiet so felt like our personal spa Fantastic location walking distance to pretty much everywhere but tram outside
353095,Grand Hotel Wien, This is a really trivial comment in the context of a good stay with great service the service at breakfast time was slow fortunately we were not in any hurry, This hotel is in a great location to explore Vienna It is a high quality hotel the room was excellent especially the bathroom which was one of the best we have experienced in many hotel stays The staff were very friendly and helpful when next in Vienna we will stay here 
353096,Grand Hotel Wien, Poor quality of breakfast sadly did not justify the exorbitant price of 34 euros per person Alcohol prices are ridiculous, The Grand is a very comfortable hotel calm and relaxing great concierge
353097,Grand Hotel Wien, One of the room keys did not work but not a big problem, The staff were very attentive the furnishings were beautiful and the room service was very quick overall there was nothing to fault it was everything we hoped for
353098,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, The Hotel is Grand so the name suits it very well the room was comfortable with a big bathroom we stayed in number 639 which was right near the amazing spa if you want a bit of class while seeing the beautiful sights of Vienna this is the hotel for you
353099,Grand Hotel Wien, Breakfast at 34 Euros per day is pretty steep, Pleasant and helpful staff great location and comfortable bed Cleaning staff did a fantastic job everyday and the bathroom was spotless V2ery elegant decor ideal for a treat if you want to spoil yourself 
353100,Grand Hotel Wien, The check in process was appalling for a hotel of the standard After a significant delay our room was below the standard that we expected and was situated exactly where we asked not to be It took 5 hours to be allocated to the correct room and this ruined our first day , The location of the hotel is excellent The room was as we expected once we were reallocated 
353101,Grand Hotel Wien, The service at breakfast was very disappointing It was slow and unresponsive and we ended up leaving We went for breakfast outside the hotel the next day , Excellent location Good concierge he was really helpful 
353102,Grand Hotel Wien, Nothing bad to report , Friendly and very helpful staff Perfect English of course Always eager to assist Beautiful room Great location Bed was amazingly comfortable Room and bathroom always perfectly prepared and clean 
353103,Grand Hotel Wien, had to leave the upstairs bar because of cigar smoking menu of the two restaurants was limited breakfast menu excellent, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff cleaninless of the hotel
353104,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, This was my first visit to Vienna and my first impression was the Grand Hotel I was greeted with care and excellent service The room was ready and the check in was very efficient I ask for directions and the staff were so helpful The security system is excellent I will be returning to Vienna again to visit the sights that I would like to explor 
353105,Grand Hotel Wien, Quality of in room dining The first rissotto we ordered was not cooked well And the other meal was so salty , The location was close to the main attractions Also it is attached to a shopping mall The only room among other 4 hotels we stayed in Austria had a coffee machine 
353106,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, Perfect location walking distance to all attractions within Old City including State Opera Stephansplatz Mozart house Hofburg and Sisi Museum famous coffee houses even to Cafe Central Very professional and friendly staff Very nice room 
353107,Grand Hotel Wien, Lost it s charm last six years as rooms has been renovated from the 100 year old everlasting interior nothing left to something that is contemporary in style and therefore they will have to renovate again soon Overpriced 30 , Lobby Grand piano restaurants the Italian made food room and bathroom equipment and the Grand Shopping center 
353108,Grand Hotel Wien, too expensive for what it offers i expected more than this we were a couple for honeymoon and i booked a suite it was not big and small TV no view from the room it was an average hotel i will not stay there again , location
353109,Grand Hotel Wien, One complementary water bottle on arrival only limited cable channels a rather small gym Superb restaurant, The location is excellent spotless classic decor big rooms good bathroom amenities

353111,Grand Hotel Wien,No Negative, From the beginning to end of stay I could not fault this hotel All staff understood their job and carried out their duties in a pleasant manner Nothing was too much trouble Concierge had local knowledge at fingertips and came up with answers immediately Staff in restaurant remembered where I liked to sit and would lay the table even when others were ready Housekeeping efficient 
353112,Grand Hotel Wien, Were initially given a much smaller room next to the elevator i e let alone being upgraded we were sort of downgraded but the room was changed to a regular one after lots of discussions , Excellent location Very good housekeeping services In general helpful and courteous staff 
353113,Grand Hotel Wien, The lady in charge of the breakfast tables did not smile when we entered and was quite cold and when I requested to have a seat full of crumbs cleaned she totally ignored me thrice I finally requested a gentleman in charge and he looked into it immediately , Absolutely loved our suite the luxury of the hotel the fabulous breakfast the good staff and of course the superb location It was amazing to have stayed in the hotel and learning that Strauss had his 50th party there Took back a part of their tradition the Guglehupf for my Father s 80th was truly special
