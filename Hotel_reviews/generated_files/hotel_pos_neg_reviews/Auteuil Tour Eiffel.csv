246497,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Tricky parking very narrow entrance, This is our third stay at this hotel We like the location central close to public transport but in a quiet area service room size and private parking 
246498,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The wifi did not work half the time and when it did it was agonizingly slow Our air conditioning made a very loud squeaky noise for the 30 seconds it decided to actually turn on during our entire stay , The hotel was very close to bus stops and metro stops as well as some very nice restaurants 
246499,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Toilet flush didn t work we had to use the shower to flush air condition was as noizy as an average Boeing so impossible to use at night only 1 towel in a 2 person room, Large room
246500,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The air conditioners, Staff was excellent They were always kind and willing to help on anything we needed Our stay in Paris was during very hot days and the air conditioner was not working well as soon as we told them they provided us with a portable one that worked perfectly 
246501,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We booked three rooms but one of our assigned rooms was not yet cleaned It was a bit of a shock to open a door to a dirty room but the staff quickly assigned a new room and apologized We would have preferred to be all on the same floor as originally booked but the new room was on a different floor as no more rooms were available We however managed to make it work We had the buffet on the first morning It wasn t what we was used to in terms of variety of offerings so on the second morning we decided to have the continental We came down at 10 30 as it said on the notice board that it was from 10 30 to 12 00 Turns out what we had were the leftovers from the buffet as they did not put out anything for the continental the guy in charge of the restaurant was insisting that we pay for a buffet even though he knew there was nothing much there and he was removing the rest of it while we were eating The guy at the front desk was really nice about it and apologized which was really very nice of him The guest bathroom leaves a lot to be desired There was only one toilet to be used by anyone waiting in the lobby and it was located on the 1st floor Its the last impressions that have the greatest impact You want to make sure people leave on a positive note , The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful and even took the time to understand my limited french There was one in particular that I wish I could remember his name to mention him personally Great job to you The rooms were spacious enough and fresh the bathrooms are also spacious and comfortable The beds were comfortable and clean The location is close to restaurants and a supermarket 
246502,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Access to outside air from rooms is definitely an option that should be examined because it was just too hot when the air conditioning stopped working Also the carpets in the rooms were not clean The ones in the hallways looked quite clean , Unfortunately when we arrived it was extremely hot in Paris The air conditioning was not working and after the third day of it being more than 90 degrees F we asked to have a different room as the fans that they provided did nothing to cool the room as there was no access to outside air that definitely cooled down in the night The new room was fine as it was on the North side of the Hotel and didn t get much daytime sun It was just great 
246503,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The rooms are clean but I think it s time for a refresh because they are a bit dated If you come with a car the parking garage is quite tight so bring a small car , I like the location because it s in a neighborhood and away from lot s of tourists There is easy access to the subway 2 blocks away and you can walk to the Eiffel Tower along the Seine The staff is always friendly and the breakfast is simple but fresh 
246504,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Location is poor Eiffel Tower 30 minute walk but Metro is only 10 minute walk which was great and a must for getting around Paris , Reasonable value for money Clean room Good breakfast Pleasant staff
246505,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The room everything about it was bad from sheets to the carpet on the floor , We got to the hotel my wife and I we went up to the room on 3rd floor it is horrible bedsheets were dirty the room was supposed to be non smoking but the smell of cigarette was everywhere the carpet in the room had dirty marks everywhere Then I went down to speak to the guy at the reception he then changed my room to another room on 1st floor the experience was the same except for the cigarette smell I tried tried to call booking com to reimburse my money or change hotels but I could not hold for too long on the phone since I was on roaming I told the hotel reception that I was not happy and I will give them a negative review since I could not change the hotel I took pictures of my room please email me directly if you would like to see the pictures I REGRET USING THIS HOTEL SO GREATLY 
246506,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The hotel is no way near to be called a 4 star The room was very small the staff is very rude Wifi is dead slow and to make it even worst the room air condition started to make sound It was scary and when I reported to the staff they just asked me to turn off the air con and keep saying that it is the only solution The smallest of hotels have a good wifi but this one supposedly a 4 star hotel has one of the crap wifi It s really a bad situation to be We booked expensive hotel hoping that it will be good but they cheated us by not maintaining minimum standards In the lift I spoke to couple of other guests they were telling the same If you re looking for a decent hotel this is definitely a NO I would never go to this hotel again I really wonder how it has got such good reviews Maybe a fake ones I guess , The restaurant staff in the evenings was a good lady She was polite 
246507,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The bed was not that comfy i could manage it but my friend complained it hurt her hips You had to pay for breakfast , The location was close to restaurants and bars A walking distance to shopping malls and the Eiffel Tower The staff were nice and welcoming 
246508,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Beware pedestrian crossing can be leathal as when it shows safe to cross cars still drive at you, It was close to the Seine and an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower best and safest walk is to take the bridge then walk down the middle of the River Seine beautiful city 
246509,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The parking was too small and difficult to access and get out , It was very near to the Eiffel Tower The RER station was also close by for easy transportation 
246510,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Multiple dark stains on the carpet of our rooms A parent let her kids scream and run down the hall for approximately an hour which caused a lot of noise , The bathroom The hotel will hold luggage before and after check in which helped a lot 
246511,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The receptionist was rude and not helpful They let us pay extra room and we did not use it because we have babies They did not try to find a better solution We were very tired and no sense of need to get into room , The location is near Eiffel tower
246512,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The bedroom was a bit tired needs decorated and a new carpet We were a bit unlucky with noise from behind A rather noisy all night party but that s not the hotel s fault , Location is handy for tourist sites but in a quiet French area unless the neighbours are having a BIG party Staff are very helpful We thought it was good value The bedroom was larger than expected for Paris 
246513,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Room was a bit shabby and there was no small table as shown on publicity , Friendly staff and room cleaned daily despite being on Genus rates Shower was excellent 
246514,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Possibly to have the breakfast already included in the room price , Very good location very comfortable room and friendly service I ll go there again my first option in Paris for the time being 
246515,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The lack of a second easy chair in the bedroom it would be no problem to fit a second one in the space in the room The lack of a small proper chest of drawers we mentioned this to the reception and the hotel member of staff said that the hotel was going to be refurbished in the near future and proper chests of drawers were on the agenda for inclusion There is plenty of space in the room for one Currently there are only two small drawers in the bedside cabinets However they were enough for our three night stay on this occasion , Room was large and faced out over gardens at the back of the hotel and so was very quiet Quietest room I have had in Paris and I have visited Paris many many times for both business and leisure Bathroom had excellent towels plus robes and an excellent Grohe shower Double bed was very large and very comfortable as were the pillows Lighting in the room was much better than one usually finds in a leisure hotel one could actually read in the evening Wardrobes were fine and spacious enough Everything worked fine security safe tv kettle etc Location is very good in elegant Arrondissement 16 near the bars and restaurants of Mirabeau and Eglise d Auteuil and it s an easy walk to cross one of the bridges to walk up to Champ de Mars Three easy to walk to Metro stations nearby two for line 10 Mirabeau for going out eastbound and Eglise d Auteuil for the return westbound and one for line 9 Jasmin plus a Carrefour City at the bottom of the street about 250 metres away where one can get pretty much any foods including fresh croissants baguettes pains au chocolat etc Did not take any meals in the hotel and did not use the bar so cannot comment on those facilities 
246516,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The shower head was really low i m 6 5 and the head of the shower barely went up to my shoulder, The location was very close to attractions and easy to find restaurants were very close to the hotel
246517,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Hotel needs to be refreshed by new painting new moquet is advisable , Position close to Tour Eiffel recheable by walking Few minutes from Passy district by walking Perfect for business and tourist trips
246518,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Customer service wasn t the best Asked for extra milk one night and was told to come down to get it second night around the same time another said e erything is closed to get extra milk and coffee , It s was quiet and bed was comfortable 
246519,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Staff on check in was very courteous and helpful Different story the following morning the individual on the desk was unhelpful and rude I had to deal with the manager of the hotel,No Positive
246520,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Getting to the hotel was not very easy first of all arrived there and was told that our reservation was cancelled by them with no warning after travelling from Lyon to Paris before we go back home to Ireland The front office personnel was not very accommodating made us feel that we do not belong to this hotel If this is the case why is this hotel on booking com We had to give 50 euros as a deposit in case we open the mini bar or make a phone call Why were we not informed of this beforehand We my wife and I are both in the hospitality business and never did we experience a so called 4 star hotel like this and same for the staff We felt so small and as soon as we got the room we were shocked to see the state of the carpets as soon as we opened the door to the room filthy and stained all over as can be seen in the photos we were expecting to see a glance of the Eiffel tower but to our surprise when opening the curtains was more dirt and cigarettes butts everywhere The bathroom Tiles and the grouts were below standards for a so called 4 star A little radiator on stand by 1 glass for 2 adults in the room 2 shampoos but no shower gel or soap thank goodness my wife brought a shower gel We have stayed in 4 star hotels before hand such as Hayfield Manor in Cork Ireland or even through booking com and have always been treated same as other guests with respect and was not looked down Very disappointing experience over all same for the breakfast which was 15e per head and no hot milk half of the toaster was broken not great value for money we have attached some photos to explain how disdain of the place We were also told that Booking com was supposed to let us know that our reservation was cancelled while we got an email from your site asking how was our reservation If you think of booking this hotel through booking com dont expect the room shown on the pictures , The bed was comfortable It was quiet
246521,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Wifi was a bit slow tv channel selection a bit limited, Good hotel big rooms for Paris standard perfect for work Staff was great and all went really well
246522,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, the car park is a nightmare not only the parking slot but also the path down to the car park too narrow dont try single bed is not single is two bed put together there is a slot between you and your wife girfriend , reception girl is nice and friendly 
246523,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, the process of checking out is very slow like snails so there are a lot of people at the reception in the morning the facilities is very old although the room is big enough ,No Positive
246524,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The queen bed was extremely uncomfortable and hard We ve also requested a single bed it was so small that you could not turn right or left and if you do you find yourself on the floor , only the location was good
246525,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The cleaning is bad actually it was a water mark in the floor carpet Breakfast is off little variety and not good quality Even I m takiing superir room but the furniture is in poor quality and old, Nothing
246526,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, When I got there the room is dirty there was hair in the bed and the bath still had water in it Told reception and they did nothing we then ask if we could upgrade and was told they had no rooms but we could buy a better room at full price This was my honeymoon We was told the mini bar was free but when we left they gave us a 60 bill for it And they said you could get snacks from 10am to 22 30pm but when I went down at 8pm I was told no it s shut there s a shop 10 mins walk away I would not recommend this to anyone and a basic room is less then basic, It was close to town
246527,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, This was not a 4 hotel more a 3 The air con was terrible it was either not maintained properly or not turned on to deal with the hot weather We were moved to another room but it was noisey and we didn t sleep well the whole 4 nights we were there , The location was great the staff were pleasant and friendly 
246528,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, No big deal but the TV in the room wasn t tuned in to receive anything on any channel , Second time we ve stayed here The staff are extremely helpful will go the extra mile 
246529,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Didn t like disabled bed in room tv did not work air con made a noise but no cool air you have to be under 5ft to get a decent shower d cor is dated carpet could do with a wash and if we had a superior room I would hate to think what a standard room looks like , I liked the idea of this place thinking its a 4 star hotel it made me laugh all weekend believe me it is not even a 3 star 
246530,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, When a double bed was requested all we received was two single beds pushed together that was an inconvenience , mattresses were very comfortable and maid service was great 
246531,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, staff are not that good when we first arrive we have to wait and stand near reception for quite a bit thou there was staff inside but no respond until we call them few time , Hotel location is close to Centre
246532,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We arrived at the room 514 which had not been vacuumed The manager offered other and we change to the 6th floor This day and the following we stay without wifi I went to the manager again because I needed to answer some emails for my job This time the manager was in the evening night time a young girl that didn t can to make decisions and the only option they give me was to pay 15 euros per hour using their computer She refused to call her superior and was not worried about my problem I booked a room with wi fi included so in my understanding if they dont give me the money back they cant not ask me to pay more For sure we are not going back to this hotel The hotel is good but far away to be a 4 start hotel ,No Positive
246533,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Wet toilet paper air conditioner was really old like from 20 s making a really bad noise only 1 small shower gel for 2 persons something like 20ml no slippers this is not a 4 hotel this is something like 2 or perhaps 2 and a half there were traces of previous guests in bathroom hair in shower cabin and toilet ,No Positive
246534,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Driving your car in and out the parking is a challenge Very narrow and steep Rooms pretty standard but ok Don t expect a view There is none , Just a nice hotel Nothing fancy and perfect for a two or three day visit to Paris About 2 kms away from the Eiffel tower and a nice path to walk to it Nice neighbourhood very quiet Carrefour at 50 meters Metro at 800 meters 
246535,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We have room for 3 people We came like a couple with mum Single bed it something horrible like hospital bed Conditions air conditioning very dusty all dust goes to the room ,No Positive
246536,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, They don t respect their clients When you pay for room they cancel it on booking com, Not kind and not proffesinal There are were only 2 kind recepcionist there Muhamed and one very tall woman 
246537,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Parking was expensive , Room was clean and comfortable Location was within walking distance of the Eiffel tower and close to bus transportation Good restaurants nearby 
246538,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The Air conditioner was broke during my stay in one of my rooms and they did not fix nor move me The hotel is not 4 star as claimed on Internet Too far from 1 star no staff to help u wt your laugage no iron and microwave in rooms , The staff are mostly rude snd the amenities is poor 
246539,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, If you are thinking of parking here the car park is underground and goes down 6 floors It is also very tight so consider parking elsewhere unless you drive a small car ,No Positive
246540,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Turning up on the day and being told there was a problem with our room and we had been moved no prior phone call or email spent all afternoon traveling across the city for nothing, Didn t end up staying there
246541,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Carpet was not clean dustbin was small family room was small and bed was not very comfortable , Bathroom was small but was very neat and clean Almost 1 km away from Eiffel tower but there is a bus service available bus 72 
246542,Auteuil Tour Eiffel,No Negative, It was close to the Eiffel tower I parked at the hotel It was a tiny garage for my car but the staff directed me out They did a great job Thanks 
246543,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Kettle in the room did not work lift down to the garage not working for some of the time but the staff were helpful about this problem , Buffet breakfast was good and so copious that it lasted us through the best part of a day at Roland Garros tennis Hotel was a bit further from the tennis stadium than we would have wished but the garage was useful and a reasonable price so if we need to stop off again in Paris with a car we would be happy to stay here 
246544,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The corridor was HOT the room as well The room had A C however it didn t work , The location was good Breakfast at 12EU person was mediocre Front desk staff were helpful friendly 
246545,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We did not have any complaints , We enjoyed having a tea tray in our room The room was made up and cleaned daily Bathroom was immaculate and I was relieved to have a bath and not just a shower as many hotels have Because of the weak rand we only had one breakfast which we enjoyed but there was a supermarket close and a patisserie where we bought fresh croissants and rolls etc 
246546,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, nothing, The Hotel was clean the staff were very helpful and very courteous very near to the Eiffel tower where we got the hop on hop off bus On the local bus route to the Eiffel tower and the Louvre it was near a supermarket where we could stock up on water cannot fault it both my niece and I had a really lovely time in Paris Well done France I would recommend the Hotel to my family and friends and I would certainly recommend Paris as a holiday destination 
246547,Auteuil Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Extremely helpful staff They gave you little accessories such as a map which was very helpful Amazing location 10 min walk away to the Eiffel tower The rooms were big and clean with a very comfy bed Hot shower bath was ideal after a long day More than we were expecting for the price we paid Recommend it to a friend wanting to stay in Paris 
246548,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Wine glasses in room even plastic Breakfast included even the first night for the price we paid for the room would have been wonderful , The location was good we loved having a balcony Window to look out over Paris and the staff were helpful Our room was comfortable and clean other than the kettle 
246549,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, when we went to the bar for a drink having been out all day we found it very quiet with no atmosphere The bar staff although pleasant were more interested in getting the area ready for breakfast next morning than passing the time of day with customers I suppose they had their jobs to do There is also a lack of tourist leaflets information around the reception area although staff were helpful when they were asked , good location within walking distance of many attractions and also Metro close by for those who don t want to walk 
246550,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The infrastructure was poor The room quality and cleanliness was bad Not satisfied with the experience Will not recommend to anyone , The staff was very helpful and the location was decent 
246551,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Hotel staff asked to use the toilet and was directed to the 1st floor and it was a room converted into a toilet , Location of the hotel 15mins from tower was spot on for tourist sites 
246552,Auteuil Tour Eiffel,No Negative, This hotel has a good location with access to the RER and has shops close by if needed The staff were very helpful and the hotel rooms are clean and a good size
246553,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Wi Fi was almost non existant it is not fare to sya thet you provide Wi Fi as it did not work most of the time, Th hotel has a change room with toilet and dusch facilities forthose who chacked out but might later need to change when picking up luggage 
246554,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Very little interaction with staff even at breakfast, It was extremely convenient that they had a car park on site so that we knew the car was safe during our stay 
246555,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Every time we went to the hotel bar it was closed and no it wasn t in unusual times it was during the day Sunday there was no cleaner I guess normal for a Sunday but we could have been reminded as it isn t the norm in all countries When checking out we were informed that we had to pay 2 48 per person per night surely that could have been sucked up on the price for the hotel The parking area below the hotel was slightly difficult accessibility wise if you have a slightly larger car coming into the parking area it was a spiral concrete walled access way we had an Audi Q5 and there were a lot of scrape makes on the walls from other vehicles getting too close , The hotel itself was clean the majority of the staff were helpful and polite A short walk away 100 meters and you could see the Eiffel Tower in all it s glory brilliant There were shops street cafes restaurants and both main line stations and the metro within easy walking distance as was the Eiffel Tower itself 
246556,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, Bad info re taxi prices led to a disagreement with an airport taxi driver Also I booked a triple room and was given two beds staff initially refused to change rooms even though they had availability I had to get arsey to get it sorted which was a shame It s a very basic hotel has the feel of a budget place but without the budget prices , Good location for Eiffel Tower quiet and nice neighbourhood Not much going on but very relaxed 
246557,Auteuil Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The reception person who assisted me was not very friendly He did not even greet upon seeing me I requested his assistance on a baggage claim as he understood french and i did not The airport gave him information that was vital and he gave me the incorrect information resulting in me wasting three hours travelling on a train and looking for a place that did not exist I was already exhausted and needed to go to see the Iffel tower with my family Due to his negligence we were late and were limited due the time contraints I would never recommend your hotel to any of my friendsand family Kind regards Brian Sauls

246560,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The room was really cold and even asking to the hotel to increase the temperature the answer was strongly negative without any alternative solution proposed , close to the office where I need to go for my job 
246561,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, I cannot say there was anything I didn t like just nothing about the hotel inspired I would return and use the hotel based on location and price , Parking was very reasonable for central Paris 15 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower 
246562,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We were sent to a room that hadn t been cleaned there was food and drink everywhere and it smelled like someone had missed the toilet They did offer us a different room The room was very basic decore the bed was 2 singles pushed together breakfast was 15euros for buffet it was at best a 3 star,No Positive

246564,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, We didn t take the breakfast seemed pretty expensive as there are a number of bakeries and bistros in the area, Eifel tower can be reached on foot Decent location for access to metro station
246565,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The bed could have been more comfu, The fact that it was walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and that it was very close to all of be tourist attractions

246568,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, It was a little tired but clean ie Cracked bath and stained carpets The wifi was poor so had to use the hotels wifi very expensive 5 euro p h , It was in easy walking distance of the tower and river walks IT was not on a main road so it was quite for Paris It had an excellent food wine shop within 100mts the room also had tea coffe very little so used the shop 
246569,Auteuil Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was good and a good choice but we had to ask for the hot water jugs to be topped up not enough tables laid bacon and sausages ran out and had to wait 20 minutes for some more Generally not enough attention to keep food and drinks topped up Also only had 4 coat hangers between 2 people and no drawers to put clothes , Good location Hotel clean
