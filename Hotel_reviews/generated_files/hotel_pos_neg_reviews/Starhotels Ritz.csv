490750,Starhotels Ritz, Nothing to complain about at all , We had a very comfortable 3 night stay in room 615 The room is not big but has every comfort needed and the staff are so friendly and helpful Comfy bed bath and shower good air con situated right behind one of the main shopping streets in Milan The food in Eatily restaurant was very good and we can also highly recommend Mamma Rosa for a special local dinner Wifi was also great 
490751,Starhotels Ritz, Breakfast was not very good Although there were a lot of choices the qualify of the food was pretty bad It bothered me a lot that the eggs were fake and there was mostly just sugary stuff to eat , Room was clean and fairly close to two metro stops Once you know the way its easy The hotel was clean and staff was friendly and helpful Lots of good shops and restaurants close by Bed was a bit hard and the large bed is actually two twins pushed together Not great for cuddling 
490752,Starhotels Ritz, Breakfast a bit limited especially the fruit , Very warm welcome very clean good location and great nights sleep on very comfy bed with excellent bedding 
490753,Starhotels Ritz, It took forever to get to our rooms after we checked in because the elevators didn t work very well and the rooms were a little small for the value , The bathroom and the shower were great The location was ok too
490754,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Ive stayed a couple of hotels in milano and italy but this one was the best modern and new decoration pretty good breakfast restaurants and shops just around the corner close to Lima station in red line and I wanted a upper story room they cared also they let us check out 1 hour late thank you for everything HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
490755,Starhotels Ritz, Had to ask for robes but they were supplied Also would have liked iron and ironing board to be in room although they were supplied on request and then taken away , Staff excellent Corsa Buenos Aires only round corner with all the shopping you could wish plus restaurants and bars Lovely park only 15 minute walk walk Air conditioning in hotel was quiet 
490756,Starhotels Ritz, Beware of prices They added 5 euro night in tax and 12 euro night for breakfast Should be clearly indicated not mentioned in small print if at all I had chosen other hotel if I had known , The room was OK though I was a little bothered by sounds from neighbouring bathrooms 
490757,Starhotels Ritz, The breakfast is modest and unsavoury At busy times the staff did not seem to cope well , The room was spacious modern elegant and very comfortable with good mattress room layout and furniture and a kettle The bathroom is comprehensive Checking in and out was fast and easy The hotel is 15 minute walk from the Duomo and Vittorio Emmanuel Galleria There is a Metro station nearby A taxi from Linate Airport took 20 minutes and cost 16 
490758,Starhotels Ritz, The lady on reception was rude and unhelpful from outset I booked two rooms under my name yet she demanded that the other guest an employee of mine pay for his own room with his own credit card , The room stank of raw sewage from the bathroom there was no kettle and the room 101 was generally filthy 
490759,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, location excellent lovely hotel very clean and comfortable lovely room with balcony good choice for breakfast Friendly and helpful staff would recommend this hotel 
490760,Starhotels Ritz, Big set of steps down to the main lobby so not really wheelchair or heavy bag friendly for those whom this pertains to it didn t bother me at all but was just surprising Rooms are very small which is very typical of most hotels in Italy , An old style hotel very clean property and convenient seeing as how it is a very short walk from Milano Centrale train station and metro tube stop s It is very close to the main shopping street Corso Buenos Aires Further to this the staff were very knowledgeable in recommending where to go and friendly 
490761,Starhotels Ritz, There was a problem with the electricity when we arrived and we had to wait about an hour to check in , The location is great and it is just 2 minutes walk to the main Street surrounded by many shops and restaurants The room is clean with comfortable beds and high speed internet The staff are very helpful and provided us with the required information when we had any question 
490762,Starhotels Ritz, Front desk staff can work on their friendliness skills , I usually stay at Starhotels Rosa Grand which is more pricey but lovely but had family staying nearby Starhotels Ritz so decided to try this property They also have a garage attached to the property and even though it was a hefty EU27 a night it was worth the convenience As with the Rosa Grand the breakfast is very good The location of this hotel is also better right off Corso Buenos Aires The room was extremely clean and had everything you need It s not as luxurious as the Rosa Grand but is certainly a very nice property for the price I d recommend it to friends 
490763,Starhotels Ritz, I was schocked when entering my room I saw the cleaning lady in the bathtub shoes on wiping the shower Unacceptable , Very good location of the hotel The rooms facing the gardens are quiet except for 5 am 7 am when it s very noisy as they pick up the laundry Very nice staff and good breakfast 
490764,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, The seafood in the restaurant was great as good or better as other fine seafood restaurants I have been in Milano Prepared perfectly and wide variety 
490765,Starhotels Ritz, N A, Great staff good restaurant within walking distance to main attractions lovely hotel comfy beds good selection of bathroom products would definitely recommend this hotel
490766,Starhotels Ritz, Location wasn t as central as we had expected in relation to Duomo etc but easy to jump on the metro and there were nice restaurants and bars within walking distance No iron in the room just a trouser press , Lovely outside bar restaurant bar area where you can also eat breakfast Friendly staff We were upgraded to a junior suite from a deluxe double with no extra charge Large comfy bed spacious bathroom with good shower and espresso machine 
490767,Starhotels Ritz, Nothing to dislike, Very clean spacious room with large bathroom with bath lovely to relax and soothe sore feet Great breakfast even supplied packed breakfast on day we had early excursion Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again 
490768,Starhotels Ritz, Eventhough I requested ahead to have the Invoice to the company through Booking upon checkout they did not have my information although it is all informed in my booking profile This made the checkout process very slow and unnable to provide me with the company invoice , facilities price
490769,Starhotels Ritz, The service during breakfast was overall too slow empty food trays were not being replaced in a timely manner some of the servers were not just slow but ignored our coffee orders a few times Our coffee was served when we were practically done eating breakfast ,No Positive
490770,Starhotels Ritz, If a hot breakfast is your thing the eggs bacon were only warm on both days we stayed though we experienced the same issue at another 4 star Milan hotel on this trip Simply need to use equipment to keep food hot which seemed lacking during our stay About 10 15 mins walk from Central Station which we didnt mind Other Starhotels are nearer the station , Offered upgrade to superior room on arrival with terrace extra cost involved but decided to treat ourselves Good breakfast with plenty of choice seemed to be kept well stocked Reception waiting staff very helpful welcoming to guests Fitness room small with tiny spa area which wasnt what we expected 
490771,Starhotels Ritz, Small rooms poor quality breakfast tiny lifts that trap you no clean water for the first few hours due to maintenance , Looked nice from the outside
490772,Starhotels Ritz, I have not found anything I did not like , Breakfast was great the bed was super comfortable and the service was splendid A true 4 star worthy hotel Great services like roomservice and breakfast in the room The location is also very nice A metro station is very nearby and there are lots of nice restaurants in the neighbourhood If I return to Milan I would book this hotel again 
490773,Starhotels Ritz, The breakfast it s Not that I SAW in Booking com the Coffe Cappuccino was cool the room smell a cigarret the Bed like a Mountainbike with two holes terrible ,No Positive
490774,Starhotels Ritz, The breakfast area was a bit of a zoo I got up from my table for 2 minutes to get a croissant and when I returned everything including my coffee had been cleared away , Very inexpensive room rate Friendly and helpful Front Deslt staff Jessica 
490775,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Great hotel clean comfortable in a good area especially if you need to stay near the train station I would strongly recommend this hotel Great value for money 
490776,Starhotels Ritz, Not very close to the center of the city 30ish mins We were a big group under one reservation and we had problems both with checking in and checking out , Very close 10 mins walking to the train station Milano Centrale from where there is transport to both Malpensa and Bergamo airports The croissants at breakfast were amazing
490777,Starhotels Ritz, Check in was a little slow but nothing to complain about , Close to metro line for easy travel around the city Just a few stops from Duomo Breakfast bag provided due to early departure French toasts jam fruit Main breakfast had good options Rooms were good size and was to nice standard
490778,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, gently frontdesk staves especialy Mr Piero Ms Valentina and others It was so much clean room and calm in the night Hope to come again next Ciao tutti
490779,Starhotels Ritz, Location was not the best Good restaurants were not close With a couple of exceptions the shopping street a block away was not that great , Room was huge Large bathroom and very good shower with great water pressure Front desk staff were professional and very helpful Breakfast was excellent as was the service 
490780,Starhotels Ritz, No bananas at breakfast, Good location only 10 min walk from Central Station Park close by for little children About 1 2 hour walk to main City centre Quiet in the hotel Good breakfast with plenty of selection of colds and a few hot options Loads of reasonable eating places within minutes walk of hotel Hotel happy and even offered without asking to keep bags on last day after checkout since we weren t leaving Milan till the evening 
490781,Starhotels Ritz, room service was rather slow and the soup was cold when it came I was sick and pretty much confined to bed so room service was the only option for me otherwise there s no reason for anyone to order room service when good italian food can be found around the area , location is not bad and staffs were friendly 
490782,Starhotels Ritz, We did not appreciate that the location was so far from the station Yes the standard time to walk is supposed to be 12 minutes For two seniors carrying heavy luggage in 25 this is a bit of an ask , Vey comfortable room and an excellent breakfast Checking out was a bit slow more a reflection of numbers rather than staff This is a very modern beautifully furnished hotel 
490783,Starhotels Ritz, The airconditioning was rather moody sometimes it worked perfectly sometimes it did not The ventilation in the bathroom could be better sometimes it gets rather humid and stuffy after showering, Excellent location a few steps from the metro station Spacious rooms with lots of storage space Bathroom with complimentary bath neccessities and a bidette Great breakfast selection to suit all tastes Friendly staff Fast WiFi
490784,Starhotels Ritz, Just information about garden area , Hotel was lovely But it would of been good to have been told about the garden area As it s a busy city and it would of been lovely to know there was somewhere to chill 
490785,Starhotels Ritz, Sometimes needed to keep balcony doors open to cool the room down but that wasn t a big problem for us The gym temperature could be set lower heat was probably coming from the sauna and on one of the days the drinking water had run out by the evening when I had my session , Staff at reception were welcoming friendly and answered all our questions fully with patience Cleaning staff were polite and efficient They always took care of the visual impact as well as cleanliness Restaurant staff were very responsive at breakfast Fruit cereal nuts grains and yoghurt were very good quality meaning vegetarians could get a good breakfast There was always a porter to hand to help with luggage Room was lovely with a balcony Large comfy bed with choice of pillows Location of hotel was great really near centre and very easy to get to tourist attractions like Il Duomo by metro We could actually have walked if we had chosen to We could go back and forth to hotel several times a day Many restaurants and cafes in the vicinity The gym was a bonus Unfortunately we only discovered the lovely sun loungers on the gym balcony near the end of our stay We had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel Good value for money 
490786,Starhotels Ritz, The matrasse was sunken on one side We smelled cigarette smoke in the bathroom in the morning in non smoking room Noise from the street in the morning we don t like air condition so we had the window open , We liked our room with a huge terrace and extremelly friendly and kind staff We really liked the spa and fitness room included in the price of the room mainly the steambath we really enjoyed and we were only people there after 9pm Breakfast was good only sausages were without taste we would appreciate more regional products big offer of sweets We asked for a cappuccino and it was much better then americano coffee from the thermos Very clean room Good access to public transport and the location is not so far from the central station Possibility of the storage for luggage after check out 
490787,Starhotels Ritz, Room got hot during the night maybe they turned off services in certain hours , Location friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast although small room was comfortable with all facilities etc
490788,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff I phoned the hotel in the evening after my departure regarding lost property The hotel s response was fast and efficient Excellent service
490789,Starhotels Ritz, Breakfast staff buffet could of been a little better Not many healthy vegetarian choices , We were given an upgrade by a lovely man on reception He explained us everything we needed to know in great detail and was very welcoming Our room was beautiful We had everything we could of possibly asked for and even more They have a fitness centre on the 8th floor which was small but very well equipped They also had a sauna and Turkish bath along with a roof top terrace overlooking beautiful Milan I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable luxury stay in Milan 
490790,Starhotels Ritz, They charged me Euro 10 extra as city tax which I felt was included in the booking site at the time of booking , It was located next to the market and very near to Lima metro station 
490791,Starhotels Ritz, The room is not so big actualy but all details you can find in description so everything fine, Hotel located right in center but on 2nd line so there is no noise from Buenos Aires av Nearby a lot of shops huge park It takes around 15 min to Duomo Breakfast are pretty good and staff was really helpfull 
490792,Starhotels Ritz, Staff not frindly attitude Prices very high , Site staff not very friendly The breakfast incredibly expansive 72 euros for 2 persons in 3 days but at arrival they told us the price is 4 euros person day A very sad experience 
490793,Starhotels Ritz, Our room was very hot We put the fan on and eventually it cooled down We could also open our window to cool down too , We had the most basic room and it was such a luxurious feeling room Despite being very close to the bustle of Buenos Aires street it was very quiet here 
490794,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, The wait staff in the restaurant were very accommodating My husband has a restricted diet and they went out of their way to give him a meal he could eat 
490795,Starhotels Ritz, The staff especially the girl at the reception was extremely rude Not only to us but to other customers too She would let you wait in front of her for 20 min for nothing Not giving you explanation and if you would dare to ask a question about check in or anything she would keep rolling her eyes This is not possible Luckily the guy carrying the luggage was telling her to be nicer The room is not as in photos The money asked for these rooms is too much They are extremely small and very noisy We checked in a lot later than expected because they had no rooms ready We did a long journey so we went to sleep but another customer with a key entered in our room because the girl at the reception gave them the same room 2 3 h after we checked in They took my money twice once before arrivale from my credit card and again I had to pay at the end of the staying telling me that the first money I ve paid they will transfer it back So far after one week there is no money in my account I m really curious if they will refund my money For me these hotel shouldn t exist It s no more than 2 stars it s far too expensive for what they provide and they should hire another people or do a proper customer training to them Very disappointed Shame on you , Nothing It was the worst experience we ve ever had 
490796,Starhotels Ritz, The smallest room we had stayed in whilst traveling round Europe The elevator is really small enough for two people and two cases no more There is no ramp as you come in and there is a considerable amount of stairs which can prove difficult if you case is heavy The breakfast isn t great , WiFi The area was OK the center wasn t to much of walk and there is plenty of local transport 
490797,Starhotels Ritz, Nothing Really we ve been in 3 more hotels in our trip and this is by far the best , Everything was perfect even tho the walk from the hotel to the duomo is about 30 minutes the hotel is located behind the main street of Milan and the best thing is that there s a Metro 4 minutes away from the hotel that leads to many locations including the duomo the walk is increddible since you have a lot of restaurants bars museums parks a lot of stores and incredibble buildings The room is beautiful Very clean and comfortable And the stuff is extraordinary 
490798,Starhotels Ritz, The breakfast buffet is pretty limited also an item of clothing that was forgotten after we checked out went missing even though we returned to pick it up a couple hours later Not too sure where it went off to , The location is pretty much perfect it s just off the main street with plenty of places to eat and shop think oxford circus and the Metro is nearby if you want to travel into the city centre The rooms are nothing special but the beds were very cosy 
490799,Starhotels Ritz, Slow and disinterested receptionists Had to have faulty key card changed on five occasions no apology Tiny double room with virtually no room to walk around the bed Shower flooded the bathroom every time it was used Breakfast included in room rate was just minimal and mediocre Little menu on the table offering items such as fried eggs and tomato juice at 4 extra No Italian coffee just nescafe in a big vat Hotel full of little extra charges for things Very irritsting when you ve paid a whack for it , An underwhelming hotel for the price Set up for business clients Very impersonal and aloof reception 
490800,Starhotels Ritz, The room type of the hotel showed me the additional money for unlimited WiFi access I choose the room type in order to use good quality WiFi It is total wrong information The reception said 256 Kbyte was unlimited WiFi internet speed When I checked the internet speed and quality with speed test app it showed very low speed Do not use the room type I made the stupid waste ,No Positive
490801,Starhotels Ritz, Lack of tea and coffee in the room Breakfast whilst it was adequate and i didn t starve poor selection for hot food coffee and tea were often luke warm , Location was great just off the main street so free from the hustle and bustle of Corso Buenos Airies Great little cafe next door to the hotel really good service and pricing Hotel is a nice walk to the Duomo takes about 30mins but plenty of metro stops just a few steps away if you want to take the metro Fridge in the room so nice to store small bottles of water in and some fresh milk which you can get from the supermarket 5mins walk away 
490802,Starhotels Ritz, can t think of anything, Great location very close distance to Metro station M1 and M2 walking distance to train station shops restaurants and central of Milan relatively quiet very clean absolutely thrilled having a kattle in the room extra blanket strongly recommend 
490803,Starhotels Ritz, The room provided to us the hotel authority called a jr suite but it was not really a jr suite class the room furnitures and surroundings wooden false wall look quite old and used need to change The bed was not comfortable at all the room service is quite long waiting The cleanliness is not a 4 class hotel quite disappointing , The location of the hotel
490804,Starhotels Ritz, I did not like that none of my preferences was taking care of No parking no queen size bed And if you are non smoker this place is not for you All night my room was under smoke from adjacent rooms In the middle of the night hearing sound of sexual actions in neighboring room is not pleasant ,No Positive
490805,Starhotels Ritz, Even though the rooms are labeled superior they are quite tiny Relaying on label I didn t check how many square meters fall into this category and was surprised when we arrived Please do check that to know what to expect , Nicely decorated rooms and public areas Generous breakfast compared to Italian standards with plenty of hot options Nice on site bruscetteria 
490806,Starhotels Ritz, Hot room ac did not work well one towel for two persons small room service at restaurant was terrible, Location reception staff very friendly and helpful comfortable bed
490807,Starhotels Ritz, The way the hotel hold the first nights rate from your credit debit card and do not release the funds until check out which then will not appear back in your bank account for 5 7 days Also had to give 15 per night deposit which I found strange also , Location close to main shopping street Comfy spacious modern rooms with good beds Lovely dining area 
490808,Starhotels Ritz, I have just 2 minor complaints One was that the elevators were extremely small They were just big enough for 2 or 3 people which means you had to wait for the next one to come if someone had their luggage with them since you would not fit in Also there was no taparello metal outdoor shutter for the bedroom window It is not necessary when you are on an upper floor but our room overlooked a flat roof which made our room accessible through the window I would have preferred to lower the taparello when we were out of the room for security reasons , The staff was nice enough to upgrade us to a suite as soon as we checked in which was great The room was very nice with a small sitting area and free wifi The location was great as it was right off Via Buenos Aires which is one of the main streets in the city loaded with people shops and places to eat In addition they included breakfast in the room charge which is a big plus If you cannot wait until the restaurant opens at 7 00 AM you can grab coffee and a roll in the lobby which worked perfect for us as we had to catch an early train There is also a bar caf right down the street so you can grab a drink in the evening with the locals if you like I stayed at a beautiful hotel on Via Buenos Aires the weekend before but I spent a lot more for a very small room and had to request to be moved to a larger room The room cost significantly more and did not include any breakfast so I will plan to stay at Starhotels Ritz next time as it is a better value and I liked the room much better 
490809,Starhotels Ritz, Receptionists are really nice and friendly but they gave us wrong information about the buses to the airport and didnt tell us that she is not sure how it is So better informated receptionists would be better This is not a hotel for stroller many stairs are to the reception, Staff were friendly everything is great Delicious breakfest Location near by the shops is cool Better than in the city center there are so many people 
490810,Starhotels Ritz, Cleaner rooms better coffee friendly and enthusiastic staff , The staff were a bit grumpy and the room looked a bit tired I wouldn t give breakfast 4 at all 
490811,Starhotels Ritz, The stairs into the lobby made it a little difficult to carry your luggage down Could use a ramp , The staff so helpful The room very nice and the bed very comfortable Great location Right between two different metro stations and right off the best shopping in Milan 
490812,Starhotels Ritz, A good price was only for 1 night For others it was rediculously high but we were explained that some event was up in Milan at that time , Excellent location just around the corner from Buenos Aires shopping street but very calm and about 15 20 min walking from Duomo Very good breakfast 
490813,Starhotels Ritz, Nothing, Breakfast fantastic due to cooked and continental plus lots of fruit and drinks Room spacious with lounge separate bedroom and bathroom all immaculate bed very comfy and large 
490814,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, The location was excellent Near shopping areas There was a restaurant nearby selling good paninis at great value The hotel room was clean modern and spacious 
490815,Starhotels Ritz, Coffee and milk was not replaced the following day The sauna and steam room were not switch on when I visited The lifts were very small and claustrophobic , The bed was large and very comfy The staff were pleasant 
490816,Starhotels Ritz, Check in out parking by the entrance was always full , Welcoming and helpful staff The hotel located 15 min walk to the center and shopping Great breakfast 
490817,Starhotels Ritz, The superior room was small and the furniture is outdated The photos in booking were for bigger rooms , The location was very convenient it is only a short ride with the metro to the center The metro station is close and there is also a bus stop near and the buses running to the central train station Also we really enjoyed the breakfast 
490818,Starhotels Ritz, Breakfast was not what we expected from the reviews Everything was always cold eggs and sausages And the bowls for cereal were a joke I thought they were ashtrays There was also an intense cigarette smell in the room , The location was quite convenient a 15 min walk to the heart of the city 
490819,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Breakfast was nice and the staff was very helpful We had a day tour in the city on the day we were checking out and they allowed us to leave our baggage there all day without any issue 
490820,Starhotels Ritz, The room was a bit underwhelming and small compared to the pictures but very clean , Breakfast was delicious location good and staff very attentive room very clean WIFI good and fast 
490821,Starhotels Ritz, One of lifts was not working the whole of our stay The lifts are really small so a party of 4 we had to go in stages Small problem , The bed was really comfy and room was very clean Didn t hear any other guests was so quiet Breakfast was lovely and lots of choice Close by to metro stations so easy to get around on foot or metro 
490822,Starhotels Ritz, Apparently a common problem are the bursts of sewage stench coming through bathroom had to shut every opening and open the window for half hour Stench was not there in the morning Walls need re painting, Great friendly staff Very good location Comfy bed Rather new Quiet
490823,Starhotels Ritz, We misunderstood the location information in the ad thinking it was closer to the train station than it was as we were walking , The food was outstanding probably our favorite dinner meal during our 2 week stay 
490824,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Excellent location and service Impeccably clean rooms and very comfortable bed Breakfast was hearty and great selection of meals Staff was kind and helpful Thanks to Alberto 
490825,Starhotels Ritz, Room shouldve been prepared according to number of people staying in it we had to separately request towels etc for second person , The bathroom was spacious breakfast was ok and service very nice 
490826,Starhotels Ritz, The room did not smell very nice We think it may have been because the carpet appeared to be quite dirty and old It really was not nice at all If we had not been so tired we would have asked for a change of room , We arrived after 15 hours journey and we had been driving around Milan in the evening for over an hour looking for the hotel After being told there was no space in their car park we were obviously frustrated However the member of staff on the desk was extremely nice and arranged a space for us The breakfast was very good again the staff were excellent When we left the desk staff helped us by printing directions to get out of the city 
490827,Starhotels Ritz, The room was small superior double and a bit dated The mattres was old and not very comfortable The booking was for two people but room was set up only for one The breakfast selection was very small and poor quality bread hard tomatoes gone off No traditional produce available Very disappointing ,No Positive
490828,Starhotels Ritz, Bad smell coming from the bathroom Maybe it was only in our room if that is the case better do not give that room or similar rooms to other clients To be fare we could have asked for another room But when you are there only for a weekend it is not the most convenient thing to change rooms Would prefer faster cleanliness of the breakfast area e g tables when it is busy Breakfast is not kept warm e g scrambled eggs , Location Room and size of bed Reception staff Value for money Variety at breakfast 
490829,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, An excellently situated hotel just outside of Milan proper a 10 15 minute walk but on an equally as busy main shopping street A very good selection for breakfast every morning Comfortable clean hotel Friendly staff Would definitely recommend and stay again 
490830,Starhotels Ritz, Room was very poor and was different from the one on pictures Quality like in 3 Room was dirty piece of wall was lying in the bathroom Eleveator was doistant but you still could hear it, Location is good especially if you travel by car and breakfast was fine
490831,Starhotels Ritz, We had a room situated on the first floor and in the mornings when the providers came to the hotel we could hear a lot of noise generated by loading unloading the trucks Also there was a conference in the hotel and the staff made a lot of noise in the morning when arranging the room Best to ask for a room at a upper level , Very friendly staff very nice and clean room good breakfast close to train and metro station very well situated 1 5 km to city center 
490832,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Good location easy access to city center Breakfast was ok but nothing special Staff is so so Could be more helpfull There were 3 receptionists when I arrived to check in to the hotel One receptionist was busy with a client and the other two were starring on their minitor I found it as non customerfocused behaviour I checked in when the gentleman finished conversation with their client 
490833,Starhotels Ritz, 1 The pillows need changing 2 No iron ironing board Housekeeping ironing service times are too rigid very inconvenient 3 Housekeeping service not consistent Sometimes chocs bottle of water given sometimes not 4 Breakfast spread is boring quite tasteless , Centrally located 
490834,Starhotels Ritz, No wi fi actually and small and too heated room but it was ok at the end , The real italian spirit on the staff polite well dressed smiling instantly puts a smile on my face too 
490835,Starhotels Ritz, Check in is allways slow in this hotel for some reason the Booking reservations are not updated correctly There is allways problems when you choose twin beds or single beds and it takes for ever to check in and find the correct booked room ,No Positive
490836,Starhotels Ritz, This time I had a room with a view on another building directly adjacent Last time I stayed here I had a balcony , Pleasant rooms helpful staff Good breakfast Also lunch menu is very decent even if few guests recommend both 
490837,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, This location was PRIME to dining shopping and was a short walk to the metro The hotel was clean and we loved the shower Would definitely stay here again 
490838,Starhotels Ritz, It would have been nice to have a more welcoming reception area somewhere to sit in the evening with a drink perhaps without having to sit in the restaurant area Not all of the equipment in the fitness suite was working worth someone checking this on a daily basis Finally as a tea drinking Brit bigger tea cups ie mugs are essential , The location of this hotel was excellent about a 10 15 walk from the train station and a 2 minute walk from the nearest metro station The local supermarket was 5 minutes away for drinks and snacks I especially liked the little fitness suite with its steam room and sauna excellent use of space in the hotel and the staff were very friendly The breakfast included was a good bonus lots of variety and everything appeared to be fresh lovely The bed was very comfortable and the ensuite shower had good water pressure very important no one wants to have a shower under a drip I would also like to add that as our return flight was not until the evening we asked if we could have a late checkout and the hotel very kindly did not charge us for this what superb customer service Oh yes the daily complimentary chocolate was lovely 
490839,Starhotels Ritz, We were disappointed there was no ink cartridge in the computer printer to enable us to print off our boarding passes for the airline return journey A TV programme station guide in the room would have been a help , The staff were extremely helpful on more than occasion with any queries we had 
490840,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Room comfort 5 and a very good breakfast Hotel s staff always pleasant and polite Nice location just 4 subway stations 10min from the Milan Cathedral There is an awesome pizza restaurant near the hotel 160m and a couple of ice cream shops The hotel is close to Corso Buenos Aires where you can go shopping 
490841,Starhotels Ritz, The pillows were too soft and not comfortable at all There were very limited television channels on TV so it gets very repetitive and boring after a while , The bathroom was very modern and clean The strong water pressure makes our showers very satisfying The beds were comfortable 
490842,Starhotels Ritz, Lift was tiny Made mistake of room service breakfast rather than eating in dining room Hadn t realised this was an option Room Service very very expensive for what we had , Bed and shower were awesome 
490843,Starhotels Ritz, Beds were a little hard , Amazing luxury hotel great spacious room with great bathroom Good location between 2 stations and a street behind one of the main shopping streets 
490844,Starhotels Ritz, Couldn t turn the heating down in our room Some of the staff need to learn to smile Had to ask at the Buffett breakfast for Espresso just wrong in an Italian hotel , Great central hotel near the metro city railway and city centre 
490845,Starhotels Ritz, Everything was good until January 10th We went back hotel and found our door was open We are shocked and immediately ask the reception what did happen But the altitude of the Stuff is awful He was impatient and even didn t want to solve the problem I was shocked Really disgusting, Everything was good until January 10th We went back hotel and found our door was open We are shocked and immediately ask the reception what did happen But the altitude of the Stuff is awful He was impatient and even didn t want to solve the problem I was shocked Really disgusting

490890,Starhotels Ritz, Only one small point I know I checked in late but I needed to eat something as I was starving after a long train journey The receptionist said the restaurant was still open for another 10 15 minutes so if I ordered quickly I could eat there So that s what I did However when I asked nicely if I could have a quick bite to eat the waitress only very reluctantly agreed to accommodate me and I found her service to be distinctly cold She served me a glass of wine that had obviously gone off it was undrinkable and the food wasn t that great as if it had been thrown together I know it was near the end of service and the staff probably just wanted to go home but even still I wasn t impressed by this sloppy service and wish now I had just eaten on the train instead of wasting my money in the restaurant , Great location 10 minute walk from Milano Centrale station a comfortable room air conditioning good wifi and especially the private terrace with my room

490954,Starhotels Ritz, No ironing board in room policy have to get clothes pressed for a fee could take a day but in fairness they ironed my shirts as a priority so no problem Pillows are awful Breakfast is nothing special although if you order fresh cooked items the situation improves Overall hotel is decent and location perfect for me but the small details become more important when you are charged 650 per night for a standard room just because it s Exhibition week , The location was perfect for my purposes have stayed here for the last 5 years
490955,Starhotels Ritz, There were constant issues during the breakfast either the eggs were missing or the coffe or the milk There were two hotel staff guys at the entrance and I had to take both mine and my fiancee s suitcase down the 20 stairs to the hotel reception because they pretended they don t see us Not the behavior you expect at 4 star hotel View from the windows is not existent the next buildings are 30 40 meters away and you see just neighboring windows , Overall it s an ok hotel with quite good location The rooms were clean and not too dated The wifi is free for entire stay even though it tries to deceive you saying it s only 24 hours You just have to re login with room number every day Location is quite ok close to the metro station there are shops nearby and its 3 stops to city center However if you arrive from central station it is 20 minute walk with suitcases or a 2 metro lines journey with wagon switch Not that convenient Perhaps a taxi is a better option 
490956,Starhotels Ritz, At times a little noisy but nothing major , The hotel was lovely the staff are very helpful and very welcoming The staff are very attentive The food in the evening was lovely the rib steak was delicious The breakfast buffet is great value and has a great selection The room was of a very good standard and the bed was very comfy Great hotel We enjoyed are stay 
490957,Starhotels Ritz, This hotel is terrible All the hotel will change the date when there is some problem with the system but this one will not And the guys in the reception is so sucked They even don t know how the tax cost goes The rooms are very noise and old It is completely different from the pictures on show , Nothing

490960,Starhotels Ritz, No milk for tea or coffee available in room rang reception and got charged 6 euros for some milk , Friendly staff from the moment we checked in nothing was too much trouble great location clean good breakfast
490961,Starhotels Ritz, Surprisingly enough the breakfast wasn t so great I was hoping for a fine Italian coffee and it was anything but There was little alternative if you didn t want pastries for breakfast everything was decent but not wow Another irk was the size of the steam sauna After walking about 10 km every day we were hoping to relax for a 15 minute steam and sauna but the sauna didn t work and the steam room was tiny mind you when we tried to enter two people were lying down inside taking up the whole space and didn t even attempt to move over , Close to everything you need in Milan Clean room nice staff

490969,Starhotels Ritz, On arrival the staff had said they had updgraded us to an executive suite as were celebrating our anniversary which we thought was great initially but on enetering the room was basically just a double room Definitely the smallest suite i ve ever been in I had paid for a deluxe double room which differs from a normal room in that you have unlimited wifi yet you had to pay extra when looging in if you wanted to stream movies etc so that was an extra cost The wifi itself kept cutting out also in certain parts of the hotel and had to move around in room sometimes to get a signal Having paid for ulimited wifi in the price of my room already I felt this was very sneaky on the hotels behalf This was very disappointing especially being charged twice for it Its 8 euro a night for the business wifi so I initially paid for 2 nights at 16 but because my partner had looged in too they charged 32 and instead of just removing the duplicate they lied and said that the wifif charge is per person which i ve never heard of in other hotels They advertise as having a gym and spa but its basically just a room on the 8th floor with a tiny sauna and steam room and a few weights and a treadmill and stepper Definitely not a spa by any stretch of the imagination If we d have known it was so disappinting we d have chosen the Mercure which has a better location and and is cheaper , The room was nice and clean Location is very close to shopping street for H M Zara etc 
490970,Starhotels Ritz, I had a single room and the size was just OK for 1 person or even a couple In comparison with the European single room size it is good , The location of this hotel is in very calm area and it is just 50 meters from Corso Buenos Aires which is famous for shopping and where you can find several restaurants and a 5 minutes walk from 2 Metro station The room didn t have a kettle but I asked them for one and they said that they would check if there is available and they supply a set with set of tea coffee and cappuccino every day which was very nice from them There are 3 lifts in quite a small size which is OK The room is exactly as the photos show in the site 
490971,Starhotels Ritz, The staff at the reception was rude I was with my 12 years old daughter She refused to give us a standard room with or even without a extra bed Had to pay Euro 70 upcharge for the child , Great Location Great Hotel 
490972,Starhotels Ritz, Receptions attitude They didnt wanted to check us in cause 1 of 3 person in the room wasnt 18 he turned 18 next week even if the other 2 person was 19 They didnt wanted to help us find a solution If not an italian friend of us that spoke to a policeman and he admitted that we can check in because It s 15 years old limit we would be forced to live under a bridge Very bad attitude of the hotel reception, Rooms breakfast localization

490978,Starhotels Ritz,No Negative, Close to Central Station and walking distance to the main shopping strip I you are like us mature couple and don t want the hassell of using the metro we caught taxi s everywhere for only EUR7 to 10 each trip Breakfast was of a good standard
490979,Starhotels Ritz, Hotel temperature in corridors and general areas was far too hot The hotel should take a stand and not allow smoking including in the crowded area outside the front door , Very comfortable and luxurious accomodation

490982,Starhotels Ritz, I guess it was the last Since the previous winter the overall service got significantly worse No hotels greetings food range was narrowed and quality of food deteriorated no apples at gim less bathroom facilities And even more the welcome drink was added to the bill during dinner without notification , We stayed in Starhotels Ritz 7 times during our visits to Milan

490986,Starhotels Ritz, Upon arrival I ve paid up the full amount of my staying and my credit card was double charged the previously blocked deposit of around 100 Euro Reception staff had promised to unblock the second payment but only the next day The next day they pretend to do so but the sum was again blocked in the evening I ve called to my bank and they said the return was done incorrectly by the Hotel Thanks God I ve found out before any shopping otherwise could be humiliated in one of Milano boutiques This is not to mention the broken shower in my room had to change the room Fitness room tiny and stuffy as hell And even it s a 4star Hotel be ready to pay additional cost at the breakfast if you want a real coffee made by the machine or fresh omlette Extremely dissapointing ,No Positive

491005,Starhotels Ritz, The service in the out door section of the restaurant was poor Some of that was due to a smoking couple from Germany next to us The waiter was more interested in talking and serving a couple of young females rather than us The wine did not come at all , The sevice in the interior restaurant was excellent The older gentleman waiter or manager was fantastic The young man at the bar was also very helpful and efficient The breakfasts were excellent
