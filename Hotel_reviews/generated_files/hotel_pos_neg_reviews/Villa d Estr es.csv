71594,Villa d Estr es, Well it is a tad close to to an Irish Pub the noise factor was a bit annoying especially when it closed The bed is also one of the very hard type Not my favorite but my husband loved it there was no ac available at this time not sure what that meant we had called down to figure out the thermostat they don t turn it on until June just heat first day we needed the AC but the windows are operable however the noise issue , The location in the city was very fun We had stayed in the seventh a week before so it was nice to have a different experience It is very close to almost everything easy access to the metro and walking distance to all of the restaurants I had chosen Breakfast was perfect for us in the lobby very cute and just what we like to eat coffee croissants yogurt juice Im sure if you wanted something more it would have been maybe 50 feet away Anyway it was a fun stay in a cute boutique hotel
