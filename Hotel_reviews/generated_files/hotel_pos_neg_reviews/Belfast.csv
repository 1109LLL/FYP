17720,Belfast,No Negative, Everything at this hotel is very good metro is near a halal restaurant is opposite to the hotel but more quality at rooms is needed the big cabinets could be removed as they take a good place at the room and we didn t use them at all
17721,Belfast, Toilet paper Towels , Location very close to Arc de Triump perfect for shopping gallure close to everything shop restaurant Arc de triump Eiffel Tower champ elysees lovre museum Location perfect Room is okey and the hotel ok the staff very friendly accomodating The breakfast is too simple for me So i eat outside Location of the hotel perfect 
17722,Belfast, Internet speed was very poor Breakfast was very so so and no one at the breakfast place speaks or understands English , Amazing location easy to reach single rooms quite comfortable knowing that the hotel is inside an old building 
17723,Belfast, The price of the room is quite high , The rooms have a splendid but somewhat weary Louis 16th style Bathrooms are updated And the location is superb One of the best regions to stay in Paris 
17724,Belfast, The cleaning does not include filling up the mini bar or taking away used glasses Towels and sheets are always changed clean and nice but sometimes lacking both soap and toilet paper at one occasion they seem to be in some kind of a rush Kindness of staff in the reception area is super though , The Staff was excellent very nice and helpful 24 hours service at the reception area helped to arrange drycleaning or reserve a taxi answer questions and so forth Because we were getting married I asked for a room with a view so they upgraded us to a very nice room 3 of the days the weekend we where getting married with no extra charge 3
17725,Belfast, The hotel is worn out and facilities are not up to date For instance bronze keys are required to open the door and security locks from the inside are not available which makes me feel unsafe I simply failed to open the door and the hotel staff helped me to do so who is a friendly guy , Location is excellent
17726,Belfast,No Negative, I requested a high floor room with a balcony and I received it With a spectacular view to Eiffel tower and arc du triumph Bed was comfy bathroom is newly renovated everything was clean Breakfast was moderate included fresh croissant cafe du lait and yogurt also cornflakes cheese eggs milk juice and jam Wifi speed was good Staff were very nice Felt like home Location is perfect 5 mins walk to champs elysees street metro easily accessible restaurants nearby couldn t ask for more 
17727,Belfast, WiFi was not the secured type I couldn t use it for some sensitive inputs Because the building is old footstep noise from upper floor may bother some travelers , Location Very close to the bus stop Though it is an old building I liked the atmosphere of the room And the bathroom was renovated

17729,Belfast, The elevator is a bit dubious but otherwise it s a quaint quirky and typically French , Fantastic location and super friendly staff on the front desk My room was only small but perfectly comfortable Breakfast was simple but perfect Local restaurants a great particularly the Caesar next door great pizza and pasta and l Arc down the hill try the home made rum 
17730,Belfast, The room was too small but I guess that is in most of Paris hotels, 2 minutes walking distance to arc de triumph Charles de Gaulle m tro station just downstairs the airport bus service 100 meters away the hotel stuff were very welcoming security after midnight a very good place to stay in heart of Paris
17731,Belfast, There was tea and coffee in the room but not enough to last two people a day and there was no milk but the reception were more than happy to provide a small pot of fresh milk , This hotel is perfectly situated near a metro station and also the air france bus stop is only 50 metres away The hotel rooms are small but it s Paris so I wasn t expecting a large room The bathrooms were spacious and shower etc worked great Check in was easy

17734,Belfast, Our room was very small The fridge didn t work so we were unable to keep milk cold to make a cup of tea Reported it to reception but still hot Had lots of trouble with getting enough hot water Reported it also 2 staff tried to help but language barriers make dealing with staff difficult All in all we had a fridge that was hot and hot water that was cold , The location is very good Only short walk to restaurants and attractions Breakfast was good and staff in breakfast room very pleasant 
17735,Belfast, Small rooms , Excellent location staff was very sweet and helpful rooms are clean but small although typically for Paris For the price you can t ask for much more 
17736,Belfast, The room was kind ve small European style But i guess i shared it with 2 other girls Be prepared to be intimate with your friends in the small space , The hotel is in a great location pretty central in paris its right out of a metro line 1 A B 6 There are not amendities like gym or spa but it did the job Daily cleaning was good and helped make the room feel new and clean everyday
