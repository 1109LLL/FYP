330024,Avenida Palace, To be honest we loved this accommodation we traveled as a family of 4 mum dad 12 year old son and 18 year old daughter and we had to havre 2 suites which was abit of a shame , Amazing location clean tidy suites nice large bathrooms comfy beds Great breakfast Our son loved the roof top pool Would definately return to this hotel 
330025,Avenida Palace, The only negative comment was the matter of only 2 elevators in a hotel with many rooms We opted to walk down the 8 flights rather than wait for the slow elevators This isn t a big deal but could be if you were in a particular hurry , The ambiance of this rather grand looking place was very welcoming and the location for exploring Barcelona was excellent The options for restaurants and tapa bars near by were great The roof top pool and bar service were nice although we didn t use it except to enjoy the views of the city Our room had a good sized bathroom with double sinks almost unheard of in a hotel 
330026,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Very well located in diwntown Barcelona Nice hotel with very good restaurant Staff was very good and helped us with great ideas and info on what to do in Barcelona
330027,Avenida Palace, There was no coffee tea facility in the room which you can easily find in any other hotel Noisy corridors in the morning not only the residents the cleaning staff keep chatting loudly they did great job tidying up though and very quick , I didn t include breakfast with my booking but there was 50 discount offer for breakfast which was great value for money 
330028,Avenida Palace, The central facing rooms have no view at all and being on the first floor meant we had no natural sunlight AT ALL We woke up one morning and thought it was still the middle of the night Wouldn t want to stay more than a couple of nights felt a bit like a prison cell, The room was very clean We had one facing the central courtyard bit There were pros to this which were that it was very quiet at night no street noise at all However some cons see below The rest of the hotel good lovely rooftop bar and decent breakfast 
330029,Avenida Palace, Bar was not open Sunday evening also a mini shop on the hotel premises would be useful for toiletries etc Also was not allowed to drink your own water at the rooftop pool but bar prices were very high up there , Location rooftop pool had amazing views and plenty of places to sit nice bathroom spacious room Decoration of the hotel looked amazing very efficient cleaners changed towels every day good check in and out times helpful staff
330030,Avenida Palace, The pool and roof isn t really suitable for children under 18 or relaxing small no chaises no space to lie on a towel More like a rooftop sitting area and bar and music with a pool to take a dip in Also the main restaurant was closed for renovation so we didn t get a chance to try it , The adjoining rooms were useful for traveling with teenaged children The cleaning and front desk staff were excellent The breakfast was quite good though you can get an equally good lighter breakfast at many nearby restaurants The location of the hotel is safe s central excellent for walking Remember to get advance tickets for the most popular sites 
330031,Avenida Palace, This hotel is a joke The bathroom door broke and we were left without access to the bathroom for two nights Staff would not fix the issues The first night they put us in a room with twin beds when I specifically requested a double bed The bed had no quilts , Location
330032,Avenida Palace, Unfortunately being on the 9th floor on our return from our holiday the music from the pool area which was the next floor above was quite loud but stopped close to midnight The entrance from the hallway and into our room had an awful musty odour The bathroom facilities were modern and excellent None of the programmes in the TV guide matched the television , On arrival we were given a suite which was wonderful asked could we have it on our return unfortunately we were unable to have it The hotel foyer area was very stylish The food at breakfast was very nice and plenty of it The reception staff went out of their way to see to our needs and very friendly The door man fixed my walking stick for me very much appreciated The location for us was terrific A great experience 
330033,Avenida Palace, After a hot and long day site seeing went for an hour round the pool no sun beds or chairs to sit on a small point but would have been nice for hour, location location locatin ciudad condal taps bar on the same block as hotel a must
330034,Avenida Palace, There was a sound coming probably from the metro whenever passing , The hotel generally is a nice hotel and located in town centre with easy access to explore barcelona Rooms are nice clean and spacious and staff are very nice and helpful 
330035,Avenida Palace, The hotel is old needs some renovations Our room was loud we asked from the beginning for a silent one and the option they gave us was worse , Location
330036,Avenida Palace, The hotel took full payment for the room 40 days before and did not let me know or furnish a receipt , The rooftop pool and view were great The beds were comfortable 
330037,Avenida Palace, Front desk staff could have been more friendly, Excellent location close to metro and airport express bus and walking distance to many attractions Great view from pool and small sun deck and bar area Didn t eat at the hotel as many cheaper cafes bars restaurants near by 
330038,Avenida Palace, First thing I noticed was the safe in our room had dead batteries last thing i wanted after a long flight was to sort that out especially when the automated phone for room service was fully in spanish Staff at the counter came across as rude upon enquiries the hotel is out dated and highly over priced even the drink prices at the rooftop bar we re a joke We heard loud bangs throughout the night on more than one occasion its like the walls in this place were paper thin I don t even think this was due to renovations The public computers in the lobby were riddled with malware and when we tried to print our bording pass s the computers played up and we couldn t print our documents we came back the next day to find 70 spammed copies of our private documents sitting on the desk we stayed 6 nights want some advice as we walked pass the H10 Hotels and they looked much nicer and more conveniently located , location
330039,Avenida Palace,No Negative, We enjoyed our stay at Avenida Palace and would stay there again The location was exactly where we wanted to be and we felt very safe It was close to the station when we arrived and close to the airport bus for our departure All our favourite shops and restaurants were close by The staff were friendly and helpful the bathroom was very modern the shower fabulous and the breakfast had everything we could have wanted Thank you Avenida Palace 
330040,Avenida Palace, Reception area a little sterile No welcoming lounge bar to enjoy a libation before dinner No fitness room despite webpage claims to the contrary Breakfast expensive for continental at 20 Euros pp Incorrect instructions to operate the safe which the staff could not remedy , Comfortable quiet rooms with revamped modern bathrooms Good aircon Great location on Grand Via Super rooftop bar terrace overlooking the city
330041,Avenida Palace, At certain times you would have to wait over 5 minutes for lift to arrive and when it did it was too full to enter Phone in room didn t work Rooftop terrace was the main reason we booked hotel it is truly amazing however it was booked for private party 2 out of the 3 days we were there which was very disappointing and we were not told in advance Not a great view from room but we didn t mind as only used it to sleep in , Bed was very very comfy Staff friendly Bathroom lovely and modern Very clean Excellent location
330042,Avenida Palace, The rooms are a little dated However the price is a great value You have lovely staff and great space , The staff are amazing and the location is great The lobby is lovely and we stay here each time we come to Barcelona While a large hotel you feel like it is a boutique hotel due to the staff The bathroom is spacious and well supplied Everything is clean 
330043,Avenida Palace, Our experience was very good , Rooftop pool and bar were excellent Location next to metro station was excellent Breakfast was comprehensive and included in the room cost so not an expensive surprise like many hotels overall value for money was very good
330044,Avenida Palace, We did not book breakfast and there was no kettle in room which would have been good , Central location was perfect for getting to lots of different places

330050,Avenida Palace, We had a cockroach in our room the first day we were given water and the next days we weren t and there was a random city tax added at the end of the stay even though we had already paid which we had to pay for on top of the hotel room price, Loved the beds probably the most comfortable hotel bed ever stayed in was huge Also the shower and overall bathroom was great The staff were so easy to talk to and accommodated us for our needs

330053,Avenida Palace, Have no faults with this property however to write something very minor is the fact check in and out weren t at great times for our flights but again problem was dealt with by storing our bags behind the desk , The hotel was right in the centre of all the perfect destinations night life and shops This hotel was amazing Absolute luxury and well the terrace views were out of this world The hotel goes that little bit further with towels new every day and bag storage which is perfect for checking in early The pool just Devine Honestly cannot recommend enough For a couple going on their first holiday together it felt as if we were on our honeymoon Luxury Cannot recommend enough 
330054,Avenida Palace, Bedroom a bit small Street noise and loud music sometimes at night The breakfast staff were a bit cranky Bar menu expensive and OK but not great nibbles , Great location in walking distance to gothic city tours ramblas square dining la perdera Rooftop pool and bar was marvelous at night with to die for view of Sagrad Familia Staff so helpful and friendly Airconditioning working great with outside temp of 90 Bathroom had teo showers two sinks and a tub all modern 
330055,Avenida Palace, The staff preferred to adhere to rules rather than being helpful and accommodating , Loved the location being able to easily walk to Gaudi houses Sagrada Familia and to the Gothic Quarter Wonderful to have a pool to relax in after walking all day and the roof top terrace for drinks and a fabulous view The front desk was able to communicate excellently in many languages 
330056,Avenida Palace, nothing , The shower was GREAT The Breakfast was The best you felt like a King Great place really the rooftop bar pool and View were stupendous Love it and will be back 
330057,Avenida Palace, Sadly the terrace was rented out for a private party in the evening Was a bit disappointing The room needs modernisation but the friendliness and atmosphere in the hotel weighs up for it , Extremely friendly staff got a lovely sunny room with wonderful view from the top floor Spacious and clean Great terrace with wonderful view Has the Barcelona vibe 
330058,Avenida Palace, The bell hop was a little pushy The air condition in the room was not up to the task or they have a a limiter we could not get it below 20 5 even at night it smelled a little musty in the whole hotel , The towels were Fabulous and the location was also good The staff was very helpful and pleasant It is a nice old hotel 
330059,Avenida Palace, the bedroom was old and dilapidated it was pretty dreary Mattress seemed very old and worn Lighting and decoration seemed from the 80s , bathrooms were just remodeled and nice water pressure was great sink and toilet were new and looked good 
330060,Avenida Palace, The room could have done with a A C or fan to be fair I did not ask the staff for one though and I am sure if I had one would have been provided No other complaints at all just a fantastic hotel , The staff were exceptional the hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect I definitely plan to go back with my family again
330061,Avenida Palace, Pool bar staff not so friendly Prices of drinks high For example small bottle of water 330cl 3 50 Not good when lots needed due to heat , Bed and pillows home from home Breakfast lovely Location great 
330062,Avenida Palace, No gluten free bread products at breakfast buffet so had to go out for breakfast Most places we ate had gluten free items in their freezers and happily provided it to us Noise from banquet room was considerable one night and kept us awake longer than we wanted If we stay here again which is likely we ll just request a higher floor level , Staff were always pleasant and helpful Loved the rooftop bar A nice way to wind down at the end of the day and they make an excellent sangria 
330063,Avenida Palace, Breakfast room service was really slow they run out of coffee for most of the time Scrambled eggs where gray and watery but cold cuts cheese and bread were excellent , Exelent location amazing views from rooftop bar good service at the rooftop bar friendly staff old time charm good size room good shower and double sink in the bathroom I had really quiet room in the middle of the busy part of the city 
330064,Avenida Palace, The wheals under the beds Breakfast was not any special we thought And very expensiv in the hotel for the guests We eat only the first morning But fine diningroom , There where no stoppers for the wheales of the beds our beds did not stay still if you stood up If you leaned to the wall it drove to the floor This is no problem to fix right 
330065,Avenida Palace, The beds in the twin room have rolls so that the beds aren t fixed , The hotel has an excellent location The view of the rooftop and the pool are perfect The cosmetics in the hotel room from rituals Are quiet high class 
330066,Avenida Palace,No Negative, we liked it as it was traditional but had been updated where necessary bathrooms dining room pool etc Excellent breakfast Dining staff could have been friendlier Would go back quite pricey but enjoyed our stay 
330067,Avenida Palace, The pool could have been open longer it closed at 8pm and with a better selection of food bar snacks suitable for children I asked weeks in advance for a top floor room so as not to be disturbed by guests above us but they would not commit to this for me Some of the staff on the front desk were a little abrupt but generally they were helpful , The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on I had the best night s sleep The area around the hotel was very pleasant and lots of lovely cafes within a very short walking distance Metro stop just outside very useful Lovely rooftop pool and deck with stunning views It was spotlessly clean Food was delicious Rooms were large and so were the beds 
330068,Avenida Palace, they have count my 16 months baby in the breakfast as i have paid for her breakfast as same as adult person , location was great staff are very friendly and helpful very clean hotel
330069,Avenida Palace, A little bit noise if other guests talked in the hallway , Good location on the corner of Rd Gracias and quite near to Plaza Catalunya Can take many different buses to sightseeing Friendly staff it was my birthday during staying here the front desk team sent me a birthday card and gift so sweet Very clean room cleaning service finished quite quickly and clean 
330070,Avenida Palace, When in the room you hear everything going on outside the room, The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating The rooftop swimming pool area is very nice
330071,Avenida Palace, Found the automatic door in the front entrance of the hotel and also stairs to the rooftop a little dangerous for small children my daughter s head was almost caught in between the automatic door and it didn t have any emergency stop when my hands were holding them not to close and squash her head but this won t stop us to come back to this wonderful hotel , Everyone at the hotel was friendly and welcoming room was perfectly cleaned everyday spacious with a huge bed Also rooftop has a very nice view of the city of Barcelona 
330072,Avenida Palace, Nothing could have been better But I don t recommend eating or drinking at hotel Too many good places outside hotel to choose from so don t bother with hotel dining , Magnificent and people were outstanding kind and generous 
330073,Avenida Palace, Persistent musty smell in the bathroom although it was spotlessly clean maybe a problem with the waste plumbing , Excellent and helpful staff classical design of common areas and stairs The interior looks like it has been recently and perfectly restored Comfortable bed clean and spotless room convenient to most major city attractions Excellent breakfast in our case for 15e extra per person but worth it Giant towels and terry robes 
330074,Avenida Palace, There was noise from the halls on the 9th floor where we stayed that entered the room The walls between our room 955 and the next room were paper thin You could easily hear sounds coming from the adjacent room , The location was perfect for Barcelona Could not be better An elegant but older hotel with very nice helpful staff Many shops and restaurants and transportation facilities all at your doorstep Best location in the city 
330075,Avenida Palace, Getting to the property was a nightmare Beyond traffic the entrance is only accessed through the bus taxi lane which goes the opposite direction to the one way street Parking was quite a distance and not connected with the hotel No valet , Beautiful property
330076,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The rooftop pool and the views were wonderful Also lovely big room and very comfortable beds The reception staff were very helpful too and great shower toiletries and WiFi in our room 
330077,Avenida Palace,No Negative, I liked the hotel Ambiance is beautiful Nice rooms Good roofbar terras and pool location is in the middle of the center with great shops en nice restaurants Its for us our second stay 
330078,Avenida Palace, Some staff rude No tea of coffee making facilities in room which is extremely poor for an expensive 4 star hotel , Good location Hotel lobby fantastic
330079,Avenida Palace, They should remove the carpet from the rooms as they smell of chlorine becomes difficult to stay in the room the first 2 days without opening the windows , Location is excellent size of the rooms were very good 
330080,Avenida Palace, Room not quite as the sumptuous as suggested by photographs but clean and smart nonetheless , Location was excellent Staff pleasant hotel clean and smart 
330081,Avenida Palace, The vie and reason we booked the room terrace view there was a high wall and without standing up we couldn t enjoy and therefore never used the terrace very disappointed We were looking forward to enjoying evenings out on terrace Works probably not pay the extra money for that room again, Bed was very comfortablestaff was very helpful
330082,Avenida Palace, The curtsin of the window in the room was quite old not in a good shape Could be replaced with a more elegant one , The location is perfect Staff are very friendly Hotel is beautiful from the outside as well as the reception area staircase corridors Shower in the toilet is super 
330083,Avenida Palace, The first night wasn t great when we arrived we were greeted by a strong smell of cigarette as there was function in one of the areas and people were smoking by the mai entrance we couldn t have a lie in the following morning because of noise coming from the next room I don t think the walls are sound proof , We were given an upgrade into an executive room which was really cosy staff were extra helpful and the guy in the bar and dining area is just superb we had the most lovely cocktails in Barcelona breakfast was fantastic with a wide choice and some Cava for a bucks fizz 
330084,Avenida Palace, The staff at the reseption wasn t very helpful and smiling except the youngest tall boy that was really good in his job We are a hotel owners and we know how the staff have to be with the guest,No Positive
330085,Avenida Palace, No natural light in room 150 however the lighting in the room was good but of a type that is not the best not in brightness but the type of lighting But the most noticeable issue was noise poor please remove the soundproofing on your list as this is not true And the racket from bottles being emptied into bins in the morning was better than any alarm clock , Great location room clean shower good bed Great in size and comfort 
330086,Avenida Palace, Two steps between bath and bedroom no conditioner in shower ac was a little difficult to get right room was a little musty Roof top bar was small wth minimal drink selections , Room was clean made up each day
330087,Avenida Palace, Room s wall is very thin we can hear every little thing from our neighbor and corridor Carpet in the room not very clean cause us to feel itchy Do not have kettle for tea and coffee , Perfect location at city center Staff are helpful 
330088,Avenida Palace, Staff was lukewarm and questionable I ve caught them lie to me on more than one occasion as well as ignore some of my requests The room was not as nice as the pictures and looked dated , The location is in the middle of everything downtown Easy to get to the nearby attractions and metro is across the street if you want to take the public transportation 
330089,Avenida Palace, The breakfeast that they supply is just ok not worth the extra 17 a person you can walk to several different places where you can purchase a breakfeast for a lot less and better quality The hotel controls the AC found the room very warm for sleeping , Location was excellent The hotel is beautiful very clean and the staff was very helpful Their ability to speak several different languages is a plus The roof top area bar pool and sun deck amazing 
330090,Avenida Palace, The lounge area was very pleasant and attractive but is also shared by the few people who choose to dine in the hotel I hope that the diners were not put off by those just having a drink at neighbouring tables I believe that the hotel is addressing this by building a new cafe bar for dining which will be separate from the hotel lounge The hotel s traditional dining room is used only as a large and very nice breakfast room Bedrooms are not large and many have unglamorous internal views but this is to be expected in a large traditional city centre hotel None of this detracts from the fact that this is an excellent hotel and we had a marvellous time there , This hotel is in a great location not just by being central but also because of the facilities bars cafes restaurants shops in the immediate vicinity We took breakfast in a wonderful and inexpensive cafe directly opposite for example The hotel is also beautiful in design and decor with helpful and pleasant staff 
330091,Avenida Palace, If I really try I can mention something we wondered about that s why not provide a small coffeepot for every table during breakfast , Location Cleanliness Easy to reach from the airport Rooftop pool and view Friendly staff Computers at the use for the guests 
330092,Avenida Palace, Disturbed by noise and vibration from the Metro heard late into the night and early in the morning No electronic key system is quite outdated No coffee and tea making facilities in rooms , Stunning views from rooftop terrace beautiful lobby which smelled incredible and large rooms with recently refurbished and very clean bathrooms 
330093,Avenida Palace, Pool is small not suitable for swimming , Comfortable bed excellent housekeeping Location is perfect for Barcelona beside Airport transfers and main train and metro lines Most of the city sights are within walking distance Staff are friendly and helpful 
330094,Avenida Palace, Standard double rooms need updating very dark and no view from room 157 No tea and coffee facilities and poor lighting Lift extremely slow and no public bar but waiter service available in lounge area next to reception , Amazing view from the roof terrace Bathroom was lovely walkin shower Nice odour on entering reception areas and staff extremely helpful Good secure safe 
330095,Avenida Palace, Room temperature was cool and unable to adjust I think this was due to the time of year changing from winter to summer in April , Lovely hotel in a great location Breakfast was tasty with lots of choice
330096,Avenida Palace, Personally I was disappointed with the room itself Unfortunately It was nt up to the standard of the hall way The room was small and basic The one that we occupied had no view We were just facing a another room and grey walls With the blind drawned you do not have the notion of time The mattress needs changing The springs are gone It is uncomfortable and with this you will not have a good night sleep after a long day visit of the city At least if the room does nt have a view but has a comfortable bed it compensates , A good location with easy access to tourists attractions areas such as the Place Catalunya and a short walk to the Rambla but quite a walk to the port This hotel is also situated near to public transports The hall way of the hotel looks grand The hotel staffs are friendly There are good numbers of restaurants around the area to choose from 
330097,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The breakfast was very good plenty of food We ve got natural fruits such as expensive pineapple every single morning Expresso machine salads etc Actually we skip lunch almost everyday The most important thing location location and location Few steps away from Plaza Catalunya the central hub of Barcelona Excelent towels and very high quality of cosmetic articles such as shower gel shampoo body lotion etc 
330098,Avenida Palace, No view dark room rumble from the metro drinks at the bar was very pricey Breakfast was poor and expensive , Comfy bed clean room lovely towels and bed linen extra pillows Nice staff very helpful tapas 24 and El national just 3 min walk a must to visit Great bars all within walking distance 
330099,Avenida Palace, The walls in the rooms are very thin We could here kid in room next door coughing and gentleman in the other snoring The fitness room only had one of each treadmill bike elliptical , Location is great Walking to a lot of places is what I liked The Metro subway is very close to take if you need it to get to places further away 
330100,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Fantastic location a short walk to La Rambla and plaza which made it easy to get around Barcelona Beautiful view from the roof terrace 360 views of the city Pool there as well which would be lovely in warmer weather
330101,Avenida Palace, Better control of temperature in the room sometimes too warm A better coffee machine at breakfast, Excellent room and bathroom Helpful and efficient staff
330102,Avenida Palace, Even though our preference during booking was a double or a queen size bed we got two single beds in stead This would still be OK but the wheels of the beds were not locking making the beds move all around When we told about this to the concierge we were told that it would be taken care of but unfortunately it was not , Perfect location close to the heart of touristic Barcelona but away from the crowds and the noise Right by the metro station Not the modern type but a more classic property 
330103,Avenida Palace, Couldn t fault anything staff were first class Very professional friendly and extremely helpful Accommodation facilities and breakfast were excellent I would certainly recommend to friends visiting Barcelona , Yes excellent
330104,Avenida Palace, Our room was on the 1st floor and you could hear when the metro drove by felt like a little shake But we weren t really to bothered by it , We absolutely loved the hotel Perfect location great and comfortable rooms and the rooftop terrace and small pool was perfect The staff was always polite and very helpful 
330105,Avenida Palace, No tea and coffee facilities in the room Rooftop bar was closed out of season even though it was 19 degrees and lots of people using the roof seating and pool area There was no proper hotel bar just a sole rushed wandering waiter amongst the seating area downstairs and service to get a drink to take to the rooftop pool or back to your room was slow and hasslesome No wine in the minibar only beer and soft drinks Incidentally the drinks from the minibar worked out to be more economical than those from the downstairs bar The hotel advertises its soundproof rooms however the spanish family next door sounded like like they were sharing our room they were so loud , Roof top pool and bar were a lovely bonus with incredible views We d sent a cheeky email across before hand about being on our honeymoon but got no response however were surprised by the arrival of some lovely champagne provided soon after arrival Amazing location close enough to walk easily but not in the middle of all the bustle 
330106,Avenida Palace, The elevator is too slow I booked a suite and I need to change elevator to get to the suite , Staff are very friendly The room is very nice The location is central and close to everything 
330107,Avenida Palace, What could have been better Not a lot really being picky the air con didn t really cool the room at night and the breakfast is expensive we ate out but had a lovely time in Barca and this hotel was a part of that , Arrived a few hours before check in time asked if we could leave our bags but not only were we able to have our room but were upgraded to a suite Probably the best hotel shower I ve seen Smart hotel friendly staff but above all GREAT LOCATION ideal for metro sights and airport transfer 
330108,Avenida Palace, No kettle coffee making facilitates in the room, Good and varied selection for breakfast Lovely pool albeit small Good size room comfortable bed clean and spacious bathroom Central location everything on the doorstep including lots of Tapas bars
330109,Avenida Palace, The bedroom itself needed a bit of updating the bathroom was very modern which highlighted the need for the bedroom to be modernised , The location was excellent and the roof terrace was stunning an oasis away from the busy city with incredible views 
330110,Avenida Palace, Wifi was poor in room at times Conversations clearly heard from room next door View not great I asked for tea and coffee facilities a kettle with 2 cups and sugar arrived which I was charged 5 euro for but no tea coffee or milk , The bed and linen were of high standard as was the blackout curtains Very good location Staff very helpful at reception 
330111,Avenida Palace, The hotel was very undated the photos don t live up to the standards Modern bathroom but on the second night we realised it was leaking also very dated small room The air coniditoning didn t work on our stay so every time we went back to the room it was boiling Two hairs also on the pillows once we checked in The staff members were very very rude apart from one staff member which was amazing and couldn t do more to make our stay worth while and make us feel welcome We felt everything that we asked about transport or locations that it was too much for them to handle Also a massive language barrier you would think being a 4 star hotel that they would understand us Also you could hear EVERYTHING through the walls could hear the trains early hours in the morning and also one night we could hear music till very early hours , This hotel is the perfect location for site seeing Lots to do so many shops restaurants and bars the train station was opposite the hotel and also lots of taxis to spare 
330112,Avenida Palace, Hard to imagine how you could improve on the experience this hotel has everything that you could want from a city break hotel superb , The Hotel Staff were extremely helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble The hotel was perfectly situated for shops travelling around Barcelona and lots of cafes and restaurants A real gem could not fault any aspect of the hotel or the staff 
330113,Avenida Palace, Roof top area open with excellent view of the whole city but bar closed until April Guests can bring own drinks there but waiting on elevator not practical for hot drinks Gym small no sauna steam room I could hear subway train at night from 2nd floor not loud enough to stop me sleeping but might annoy some guests Design of floor area not suitable for small children , Period design decor creates a pleasing and comfortable atmosphere to stay in High quality food and service Professional staff from front of house to house keeping All areas of hotel clean and in good condition Spacious room and bathroom 
330114,Avenida Palace, The heating system was running non stop We needed to stop it and opened the window , The location of the hotel is excellent close to all the main attractions and shopping The room is very comfortable and the staff is friendly 
330115,Avenida Palace, Noies from the street and underground do not recommend for any one Lawer floors noies from repairing the room in front of our room Room floor is made of wood it was cold and no sleeper provided , Location
330116,Avenida Palace, Booked it as special treat for husbands Big birthday soooo disappointed that we didn t get to find out the pool much smaller than photos suggest was closed due to work being done on the reception area Why no idea And more to the point the reception staff still thought it was open We checked several times but the big sign at the bottom of the terrace stairs just confirmed it was closed until further notice , Nice well furnished comfy beds interconnecting rooms for family of 3 with teenage boy Double width shower in one bath with shower over it in other so nice to have the choice Beautiful olde worlde original building stunning staircases and adorned with large mirrors statues and painting Ideally located for exploring this fantastic lively city 
330117,Avenida Palace, There was a rumble from nearby underground metro quite noticeable in our room during the night Ongoing refurbishing prevented use of the main entrance and lobby and resulted in some disturbing noises during the day , Friendly and helpful staff The decor and furnishings very attractive with spacious public areas for guests to relax and enjoy each others company The bed was very comfortable too Good array of options offered a breakfast 
330118,Avenida Palace, This hotel has the potential to be very nice However they were doing major refurbishment works which we werent told about The entire front foyer which is very nice was shut and we had to go in a side entrance to a make shift reception The room was ok maybe a bit dated It was very noisy as the nearby train made it sound like there was an earthquake we had a room on the first floor so could hear it There was also banging from the construction from the early morning Last negative was that there were no fitted bedsheets There was a sheet above and below the quilt so you woke up to a bit of a grubby quilt covering you Apart from that the location is fantastic It also has a very nice rooftop bar and pool ,No Positive
330119,Avenida Palace, I didn t like having to leave, I loved everything about this hotel the staff were great the rooms were 1st class and the bed was absolutely massive and very comfortable
330120,Avenida Palace, Hotel was undergoing a major refurbishment We had no notice at all of all the main areas were closed Bar or pool was closed Entire reception area and main foyet bar was hoarded off with loud drilling and dust everywhere They should have emailed or informed pre booking on the sites that this was happening Rooms were awful too dated and dirty , Location 
330121,Avenida Palace, I think the bedrooms are dated in comparison to the bathroom The room needs better lighting it s quite dark We stayed in 462 Also the pool wasn t open this was not stated on your website so that was a little disappointing , I loved that our room was ready when we arrived at about 11am Staff were so friendly and helpful 
330122,Avenida Palace, Room was orientated for disabled person bathroom mirror doors and so on We didn t ask for it Bathroom was too small for two people and the light was very bad Also dirty carpet in the bedroom Sad but disappointed this time ,No Positive
330123,Avenida Palace, Unaware of the construction works until arrival but staff ensured very pleasant stay , Very nice helpful and accomodating staff hotel location is ideal 
330124,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The bed was huge and so comfortable sheets and towels changed every day lovely smelling toiletries really was a lovely hotel It s in an excellent part of the city 
330125,Avenida Palace, Lobby is currently undergoing major renovations which we had been warned about but we still missed seeing the beautiful lobby, Location was amazing room was wonderful and views were great 
330126,Avenida Palace, not much to see on the TV the channels something sort of freeze but it wasn t much of a problem since there is a lot to do in Barca wasting time watching TV is not one of them , The room was nice very comfortable and clean I ve attended a conference at this hotel and it was great The food was really good and the venue was perfect As you arrive a bottle of water awaits you in the room which was much appreciated after 5 hrs travelling Reception staff really helpful and jolly string wifi 
330127,Avenida Palace, Old smelly carpet old furniture it was obvious they remodeled the bathroom which looked great but not the room , Friendly staff and great location Bathroom Was actually super nice since it had been remodeled 
330128,Avenida Palace, It was instructions in the hotel They should have told us before we stay in the hotel we weren t happy it was very noisy and dirty the booking service should have warned us i have taken videos and many pictures i will share this with booking services i am also waiting reply from booking service i usually use booking service for hotels i am genius member of the booking service please as soon as possible unswerving my email , Nothing 
330129,Avenida Palace, The Reception area is currently undergoing refurbishment Although this didn t affect us first visual impressions on arrival might disappoint I think the work is due to be completed soon , This is our third stay at the Avenida Palace which is a grand old hotel We love a short break in Barcelona in January The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping sightseeing and great tapas bars The staff are very helpful and friendly and overall it s very good value for money 
330130,Avenida Palace, I dun know its the problem of booking com or the hotel The room offered was totally different from that shown on booking com which looks so old and outdated 20 years difference at least Staff said they have a variety of double rooms so it may look different from online Then its totally misleading, staff are very friendly comfortable bed excellent location couldn t be better
330131,Avenida Palace, Was being renovated during our stay suppose better to do it at this time of year though We were just unlucky, Huge room Huge bed and extra comfy Staff great
330132,Avenida Palace, noisy often metro bivration and now this hotel is under construction remodeling maybe you have to go lobby upstair with your luggauges, large room and bathroom very clean good location 
330133,Avenida Palace, The check out staff member was rude Demanded additional funds even after I showed him my reservation receipt and credit card statement Language barrier with this same staff member Otherwise the staff was acceptable and helpful , Closeness to great historical sights excellent restaurants and shopping Very easy to walk everywhere 
330134,Avenida Palace, The only things that come to mind would be not being able to exchange money at the hotel and no tea coffee making facilities in the individual rooms , The location of the hotel close to all the amenities was excellent The staff at the hotel were very welcoming always very polite and extremely helpful from helping with directions and advice information on local attractions to taking care of luggage etc nothing was too much trouble 
330135,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The staff were all friendly and helpful The location is very good Breakfast was good The room we had was good but had no view from window but as the weather wasn t too good it didn t matter 
330136,Avenida Palace, they should have tea coffee making facilities in rooms this is the only fault i have , Great location it is being renovated at moment will go back again 
330137,Avenida Palace, It was under some work no noise but would have loved to see the main entrance I think they will be finished in February , Very good location in the heart of sights and sounds Lovely staff that were alwys very attentive and helpful The room we had was very comfortable and updated bathroom was nice Great shower to combat time change
330138,Avenida Palace, No toothbrush or toothpaste in the hotel This is a normal thing to give as a 4 hotel There is no lock on the bathroom door Had expected a bit more facilities when the hotel looks so nice from inside , Location was very good Metro is 50 m from the hotel Hotel is nearby Nice restaurants Big shops catalunya square etc Friendly staff Very Nice topfloor with Nice view over Barcelona Price is fair for the location you get Hotel lobby indeed looks like a palace 
330139,Avenida Palace, We were not informed prior to arrival at the hotel that the opulent ground floor reception areas which include the main entrance lobby lounge bar breakfast room restaurant and associated lifts were closed for refurbishment until sometime in March Entrance to the hotel was by a steep staircase to the mezzanine floor and from there on there was only one small lift to the bedrooms , This is normally an exceptionally good opulent hotel which we have stayed in many times before The bedroom was clean and very tastfully furnished and decorated 
330140,Avenida Palace, Some building work was taking place and we werent informed until we were there that this was happening There was noise from the metro that was directly under the hotel The bedroom was in need of updating to match the bathrooms , The location was central within walking distance to the local transport The bathroom has been recently updated and was great with huge fluffy towels a large shower and separate bath 
330141,Avenida Palace, Decor a little worn and dated Hall was being remodelled so was a bit noisy and dusty Also there was a sound and vibration from the trams, Staff were friendly Beds comfortable and shower good Roof pool had a lovely view
330142,Avenida Palace, Unfortunately some work was being undertaken to upgrade the reception area of the hotel and whilst it didn t impact on our visit it meant there was a minor degree of disruption to the overall appearance of the hotel , Atmosphere Location Comfort 
330143,Avenida Palace, The size of the room key made me rememeber the 1980s , Big light and spacious Beatles suite with comfy bed fresh bathroom and a nice walk in closet Location is really hard to beat Close to communication some of the main sights and plenty of good restaurants and shops 
330144,Avenida Palace, Nothing , The staff were very friendly and the room is extra clean Very comfortable bed Worth the stay and not to forget very central where all the famous moments are walking distance from the hotel 
330145,Avenida Palace, Hotel started renovations on the day we left which we did not know about The so called gym is a joke just 3 machines in a tiny passageway Pool also very small as roof had limited space , Breakfast area very pleasant and reasonably priced at 16 EUR Rooms well fitted out Good sunbathing area on the roof with great views Hotel position is perfect right next to the main plaza an d Ramblas Would go again 
330146,Avenida Palace, It took 3 days to get safe deposit box re set after asking 3 times A bit disappointing not to have a bar available this time of year however waiter service is available , The location is perfect Staff very friendly A really pleasant stay and would certainly go back there 
330147,Avenida Palace, Room temperature could not be controlled very hot room Try to book an outside view room to get more air flow through the room The breakfast atmosphere was nice but pricey good breakfast can be found locally outside the resturant , Fantastic location close to metro attractions shopping and food 
330148,Avenida Palace, no hot water in shower room at room 757 very long waiting time for lift not enough kindness hotel staff only few staff was good , location was very good to get any transportations 
330149,Avenida Palace, Very tired hotel Really noisy windows opened fully on 5th floor with 2 young kids felt unsafe Staff pretty flat sold 4 single beds asked for 2 doubles Would not go back,No Positive
330150,Avenida Palace, I didnt like how the fridge we had was not at all cold , I loved the locations which was close to the metro buses Felt secure to leave things and walk around Staff were very nice and helpful 
330151,Avenida Palace, the room was cleaned not that neat still a dust on a table an parallel space the drinking glass didn t that clean too The amenity didn t refill everyday The perfume smell in the hallway is too much it s maid me dizzy others is great , location bathroom and big bed
330152,Avenida Palace, We were in twin interconnecting rooms and one of the room s washroom had this bad odor although the washrooms were newly made somehow the bad odor was constant Everything else was excellent Told the reception but weren t able to get a solution during our stay , Excellent location quick walk to all the best attractions Amazing food options nearby 
330153,Avenida Palace, The beds were quite firm the bathroom was updated and modern but a little too cold looking for my taste We asked for an ice bucket with ice but were only able to get a bowl ful of ice , We were upgraded to a suite tho we were only staying one night We arrived early due to early disembarkation from a cruise ship Unfortunately they were full so unable to check in tho they did store our bags It would have been nice if coffe tea water had been available in the lobby We needed an American type electrical outlet for our phones and the desk was able to provide one for us We had some difficulty printing out our plane tickets and some one was available to assist us 
330154,Avenida Palace, The photos of rooms were shown bigger compared to reality may be photgraphic skills , Excellent location access to metro and also could catch the barcelona city tour bus easily 
330155,Avenida Palace, Nothing that I can think of , The location was good and there were plenty of places to eat nearby We were only there for one night we had no time to tour the city Sunday night rates were competitive for the quality of the hotel 
330156,Avenida Palace, Would have liked the facilities to make a cup of tea coffee , Perfect location Very clean and well maintained Staff very friendly and helpful Would definitely stay there again
330157,Avenida Palace, Dark room at side of building overlooked directly by offices 4 metres away Room smelled of drains for the 4 days Room was cold and air con heating did not work Tired and dated Old key entry to room and a piece of paper with your room number on to show to get back in your room A security issue No deals on breakfast which at 16 a head was expensive when dinners were 20 for 3 courses plus a glass of wine Staff business like rather than welcoming and friendly , Central location Good wifi Large bed and clean room 
330158,Avenida Palace, It was fine , Bed very comfortable I had a room on a 6th floor and the noise was fine although on the first night I hadn t closed the outside window properly second night I made sure that was done Staff very courteous Breakfast fine I don t eat meat but there was enough choice Nice glass of fizz along with my fresh orange juice Great location only a few minutes walk to the Aerobus terminal 
330159,Avenida Palace, Unusually there is no physical bar in the hotel Drinks are ordered from the waiter staff always on hand A little pricey but no different to other 4 star hotels No coffee tea making facilities in the bedroom but this seems to be the norm in Spanish hotels , Central location Classical hotel The hotel lobby and lounge area is esquite lovely place to relax The view from the top terrace with swimming pool is stunning Bedroom and ensuite bathroom good size and well furnished Brilliant rain style shower Hot water always available Very friendly staff most spoke with very good English Wide range breakfast menu great quality and constantly stocked throughout breakfast period 
330160,Avenida Palace, Beds were not very comfortable and the room was very warm even in November nothing to do with the weather no ventilation had to ask for a fan , Location just off the Ramblas and next to metro stop 
330161,Avenida Palace, Barcelona metro If you like walking long distances and erratic availability of lifts and escalators then you will like the metro , What can I say Truly incredible hotel Absolutely stunning building inside and out Wow the foyer Rooms very nice Bathroom sensational Good location Middle of the good area 
330162,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Location was perfect metro in front of the hotel Place de Catalunya a block away two to 4 blocks from famous Gaudi houses Staff was very friendly and helpful Beautiful interior and breakfast area Great buffet breakfast Exterior windows do a great job of blocking out street noise 
330163,Avenida Palace, Nothing, The hotel was ideally located and close to the Metro Train Station and all touristic spots The staff were great and would definetly stay here again The view from the roof top pool was great in the evening 
330164,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Excellent location close to center of town Delicate bathroom Helpful and nice staff Beautiful view to all of Barcelona from roof top We will definitely stay at this hotel during our future visits 
330165,Avenida Palace, As usual with a European hotel single people are placed in rooms whose windows look into an air shaft and that is what happened here Now to be fair I didn t ask to be changed either so don t know how the hotel would have reacted , Everything about the hotel was very good The morning breakfast buffet is worth the extra money The staff most helpful and the location is excellent 
330166,Avenida Palace, We didn t like food in the hotel both in restaurant and bar actually there was no bar just some limited service in the lobby You can expect more in Barcelona Rooms are rather dark , Perfect location close proximity to everything A lot of restaurants and bars nearby Very good shopping 
330167,Avenida Palace, Reception staff very rude interrupted each other while seeing to customers never welcomed us never asked if we enjoyed our stay Room was dark and claustrophobic overlooked a brick wall hardly any space between beside table and bathroom , Location was excellent for the city
330168,Avenida Palace, With the exception of the bathroom which had been recently renovated to high standard the room was dated The carpet and sofa had stains which were unsightly and gave a feeling of the room not being clean If one has a light sleep the metro which runs underneath the hotel and can be heard rumbling might disturb , Location was excellent Just in front of the Metro station Passeid de Garcia Most of the sights are within walking distance Staff were nice and helpful Large room 
330169,Avenida Palace, Nothing it was fantastic, The warm friendly welcome on our arrival was very nice Location and the suite had a great views We had the set menu one night fantastic value for money and the service was excellent 
330170,Avenida Palace, Having to come home , The staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable all spoke excellent English The location was fantastic with all the amenities you would expect from a city centre four star hotel 
330171,Avenida Palace, No ventilation in bathroom nor toilet brush so it always smells funny Lifts not sufficient Bar waiter that you must catch because he won t catch your eye contact Coffee at breakfast is served by waiters carrying around jugs so you d better sit close to the kitchen otherwise they run out before they get to your table , Location Huge breakfast friendly and professional staff beautiful interior 
330172,Avenida Palace, Hangers in the wardrobe kept falling off as soon as we put clothes on them No other downside , Fantastic location Staff friendly and helpful A lovely building inside and out Fabulous roof top pool 
330173,Avenida Palace,No Negative, I love the location the Hotel is beautiful very Pretty very clean good service from every employee the rest the food and the service terrific Was very good choice I ll recommend 
330174,Avenida Palace, Bed too short I m 6 2 feet hung out of end of bed Curtains too thin let light in early morning No bar Lounge used as bar area but no waiters looking after the area Restaurant in hallway with unimaginative menu no excuse with quality of produce in area , Location look of hotel views from roof Barcelona was fabulous
330175,Avenida Palace, The city itself but this is not the hotel s fault , Extremely comfortable bed and room sleeping certainly not a problem Frontdesk staff polite and efficient 
330176,Avenida Palace, There was a smell in the bathroom probably not just the hotel s problem as there was almost everywhere but very annoying The cleaning lady did not speak english at all Minor problem but I needed to talk to her and could not Hall furniture quite worn out Poor internet speed, great location very good breakfast spacious room and bathroom very comfortable beds and pillows helpful staff at the reception
330177,Avenida Palace, Having to leave key when we left hotel Found the staff standoffish Poor service in the bar area Cheap pillows , Location was excellent Room was very clean Roof terrace was amazing Wifi was excellent 
330178,Avenida Palace, I don t have any complaints , The staff were friendly and helpful all the time They were have trouble with the water when we arrived and we had to be put up in another hotel for the first night They bent over backwards to compensate for this and we had free breakfasts every day 
330179,Avenida Palace, We looked out onto a cement shaft and for the price we paid I would have liked a view of ANY kind, Great location and helpful staff Room was clean but small Rooftop area was amazing Pool and view
330180,Avenida Palace,No Negative, View from our suite was breathtaking the room was beautifully and tastefully decorated and the bed was comfortable The staff was extremely helpful throughout our stay Fantastic location Would definitely recommend
330181,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The panoramic view of the city skyline including Gaudy s Church from the roof top terrace is spectacular This peaceful spacious hotel is ideally situated for relaxed rambles around the city centre areas 
330182,Avenida Palace, Our room was near a service elevator and we had to ask to be moved They did move us to a nicer room as we were not able to nap that afternoon jet lag , Hotel was fancy in appearance I stay in a lot of hotels and thought for the money this was pretty good value Location is excellent many great things in walking distance for the tourist If you can get a good price the junior sweet was nice All the bathrooms seem to have been recently and nicely remodeled Bed was reasonably comfortable Great sho
330183,Avenida Palace, The hotel is a bit old abd the carpet is smelling Bathroon are renewal and perfect , Location is Excellent morover because we were traveling without much time so it save a lot of time due to there is a subway station in front of the hotel L2 L3 and L5 and it is almost in the corner of Passeig de Gracia 
330184,Avenida Palace, Unfortunately we had to move on and didn t have more time to enjoy the hotel and the great location , We were delighted with the hotel The room was lovely and comfortable with a great view I couldn t wait to head to the roof top when night fell The view of Barcelona with the sunset and the night lights was stunning The breakfast was the best and most beautifully served we experience in our 21 day trip My husband left his cane at home and they worked to help us get it replaced my thanks to them 
330185,Avenida Palace, the price of the hotel was not cheap due to a festival on that weekend which I was not aware of , excellant location very good staff food and drink very good value great roof terrace
330186,Avenida Palace, breakfast very pricey 16 per person when down the street u can get 2 for that price, location very central roof top pool over looking in city great views
330187,Avenida Palace, If you want fried eggs for breakfast you need to ask , Excellent location and a lovely hotel All the staff were great and especially helpful at the front desk with restaurant ideas etc Just arround the corner is a fantastic tapas restaurant It is a must 
330188,Avenida Palace, No tea and coffee in room and expensive to buy in bar Room service and minibar expensive 6 for a packet of crisps , Good location architecturally nice Rooms good size bed changed and clean towels everyday
330189,Avenida Palace, There could have been a few more comfy chairs on the roof top bar to take in the wonderful views, Great location and fantastic views from the rooftop bar The bedroom we were given was on the small side which was a shame but we couldn t complain as we were able to check in when we arrived at 12 noon Staff were all friendly and helpful 
330190,Avenida Palace, lift was slow key had to be handed in and picked up at reception when you left and arrived back Local tax added to your bill, Location convenient for sight seeing and the staff were friendly 
330191,Avenida Palace, Only down side was one member of staff looking down on me and my mother when we came back in the evening Every other member of staff was lovely and helpful but this particular gentleman had a bee in his bonnet about something Breakfast is okay could be a bit more cooked choice for the price it is , Hotel is in a fantastic location for all sightseeing or generally enjoying Barcelona Ideally located for Ramblas beach shopping etc We were able to check in early which was a big help as we only had one night in Barcelona during a holiday in Salou The rooftop view is just incredible and the pool is really nice with Jacuzzi jets Massively recommend 
330192,Avenida Palace, For the roof top bar to be open a little later It was lovely , Fantastic hotel Great breakfast and the highlight was the roof top bar and terrace Location very central with all main attractions within walking distance as long as you like walking Loved it 
330193,Avenida Palace, Did not experience sewage smell noted in other reviews however one of the double vanity sinks in bathroom did not drain so was pretty much useless No washcloths available and could not get more than one bath towel and one hand towel per day per person Even on higher floor could definitely feel and hear rumble of metro Supposed to drop key at front desk when leaving hotel which can mean waiting in line behind guests checking in out to retrieve key No self serve laundry on site but very clean modern laundromat within 10 min walk of hotel , Very well suited to singles traveling together and sharing a room which was spacious and had 2 closets much larger than standard Euro hotel rooms Bathroom was spacious and modern large fully enclosed shower i e no water mess on floor to contend with double vanity plenty of counter space backlit large mirror Room itself was an odd contrast felt very dated compared to bath with aged wood furniture and hardwood floors But still clean and functional and plenty of room for 2 single gals and their luggage Decent sized mini bar that accommodated refrigeration of personal items AC worked very well Directly across street from metro which is also a negative if you re a light sleeper Walking distance to many attractions and easy metro bus ride to others Business center with 2 free computers printing Rooftop bar and pool were small but very nice for lounging and great view of city Grocery pharmacy just a few blocks away Felt very safe walking around at all hours of day and night Staff were polite but not overly helpful Did not eat at hotel so can t comment on restaurant 
330194,Avenida Palace, Staff were pretty demure and not overly friendly Did not like that we had to drop our key at the front desk and that they would just give it back upon return by you simply stating the room number without checking your identity I am certain the cleaning staff looked through my bag because I purposely covered my extra handbag with a scarf and when I returned it was displaced Nothing taken though thankfully , Good location Amenities pool 
330195,Avenida Palace, We would have liked tea coffee Making facilities in our room Poor seating in roof top area more needed Also on sunset evening we arrived found male staff dealing with wine drink table the older man not the young one was surly to us after my husband a friend complained about wine we bought was undrinkable our complaint was just ignored so we wasted money as unable to drink lthe wine , Location very good central to most things also quiet for sleeping 
330196,Avenida Palace, Bed was big but not very comfy Staff could have been a little more cheerful Cleaners were lovely though , Amazing location Rooftop was a lovely spot 
330197,Avenida Palace, For a four star hotel the breakfast quality was poor considering the price which was an extra charge and not including in the room charge Room access with one old style key which is not ideal for a couple Lifts very slow to access No cupboard doors except for hanging clothes and no drawers throughout , Location was excellent Next to a metro station which gave fast access for sight seeing Staff polite and extremely helpful Reception and lobby excellent 
330198,Avenida Palace, You need a bar where you can have a drink and a proper smoking area otherwise loved our stay , CComfort very good staff very helpful location good 
330199,Avenida Palace, Way overpriced for the extremely basic room facilities offered ie there was no tea or coffee making facility in the room for a start Bed was too firm This is not typical of a 4 star hotel charging these exorbitant rates , Location was good
330200,Avenida Palace, The rooms were quite outdated the fitness center was a joke and the pictures did not accurately show some of the hotel , Location and rooftop pool were excellent 
330201,Avenida Palace, The pool looks much bigger in the pictures The lifts are a little temperamental, The staff are extremely helpful and willing I was able to add breakfast at a very good rate and my daughter didn t have to pay Room size is large and modern Location is perfect close to many of the main attractions by foot and there is a metro station across the road for longer journeys
330202,Avenida Palace, I got lots of bites whilst in bed which was a bit of a concern Bedroom was a little dated and no natural light , Nice hotel clean rooms new bathroom Lovely roof views 
330203,Avenida Palace, Smell of drains in bathroom and couldn t check into room on arrival so had to get changed in storage room to go out for the day, Location was great Rooftop pool and bar area had amazing views of city Really nice rooms and lovely brand new bathroom
330204,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Excellent staff Courteous and friendly Amazing breakfast buffet Lovely roof top bar with a great view Kid friendly and fantastic location I highly recommend this hotel 
330205,Avenida Palace, The hotel is a little dated and pictures were a little misleading There was apparently a breakfast buffet although we were never informed where it was and what the timings were and we didn t feel like we should have had to ask For a double room we were given 2 single beds even though we requested a double bed Room keys were to be deposited at the front desk every time you left and on returning you would say which room was yours and they would hand you the key This made us question security as the front door was always open and no front door security while many other hotels in the area had closed doors with security guards With staff constantly changing shifts it seemed as though anyone could walk in and ask for any key and it would be given to them , The location cleanliness large room 
330206,Avenida Palace, No lounge bar in ground floor area Maid service was very late between 3pm and 5pm , Excellent breakfast Pool area was lovely and bar prices were very good Staff were helpful and had good knowledge 
330207,Avenida Palace, Even though we booked early when we arrived they gave us two separate beds instead of a king size They ve promissed to change my room the next day which they did and offered a bottle of sparkling wine for the trouble The design of the rooms is of much lower quality than the lobby Those with sleep problems be aware Room 950 was noisy at night probably the whole 9th floor is because of the a c units placed above Luckily we were tired from visiting and were able to sleep through the noise The pool rooftop area are really small only serve a limited variety of beverages It was always noisy over crowded The elevators are really sloooow , Great location friendly professional staff great breakfast ask for anything you will probably get it good wi fi throughout the hotel clean rooms Great overall experience 
330208,Avenida Palace, The gym only included cardio machines and weights such as dumbells could have been included as this was not benificial to my boyfriend The staff were good however uncoordinated for example one said we had free breakfast due to us being an early booking we then double checked and confirmed this and went ahead however others said we didn t and we were charged I would say some services of the hotel were slightly overpriced spending a small fortune already on a memorable trip we had to pay for an ironing service which ended up being 10 per item lucky it was 1 item as there was no iron in the room Also coffees were 4 and breakfast 14 when cafes around the area had this for 2 00 5 However I suppose this depends on what you experience you are looking for As I ve said the roof terrace was amazing there could have been a few more sun loungers as we had to wait for them at times , The facilities were great with the pool and bar on the roof top what was a mini paradise and the skyline view was beautiful We had a room with a view onto the city the rooms had a soundproof window system and we slept great The cleaning staff were always busy quick and kind The atmosphere had a relaxed vibe Although the hotel would be percived as posh it has the look however the atmosphere was perfect The location was probably the best you can get being inbetween both shopping paradises and easy to navigate The other guests varied from families to couples and everyone always seemed to be having a good time in full comfort Also close to the airports bus service meant we were dropped a 5 min walk away helping us save some money 
330209,Avenida Palace, No view with room , Excellent location Great restaurants around the corner Staff very helpful especially pool barman who made us a special drink that wasn t on menu Also receptionist espe who helped with train timetables Rooftop pool lovely and breakfast too 
330210,Avenida Palace, Exercise room was just two machines in hot room towards the pool Disappointing Bathroom had bad smell sewer Room needs updating Slow Wifi, Loved breakfast Awesome shower Perfect Location Friendly Staff Outdoor pool although small still a bonus
330211,Avenida Palace, Not clean bathroom found nails from previous guest Very bad smell from drains even room was on top floor , Great hotel with great view from roof top pool 
330212,Avenida Palace, The bedroom was good but just above basic No tea coffee making facilities The roof bar appeared limited we did not use it , Reception and communal areas were very good Bathroom to our room was excellent Staff were pleasant and helpful 
330213,Avenida Palace, Not that great to drop suitcases off at front of hotel , Didn t have breakfast but location was good with supermarket restaurants and not far to Ramblas great hairdresser nearby and parking around the corner Rooms were good and beds comfy Hardly heard a sound even though in busy road Car park to use nearby and easy to find 
330214,Avenida Palace, roof top bar closes much too early 21 45 wooden floor in the room is great but needs daily cleaning the dust was omnipresent Room was cleaned very late every day bed was not really comfortable noise made by metro can be heard in the hotel, situation is very central close to pl catalunya and Ramblas roof top bar is nice great view wooden floor in the room no carpet breakfast buffet was good
330215,Avenida Palace, Creepy bellboy man was way too aggressive and front staff were pushy and slow Bar fridge was ancient , Rooftop pool with stunning views and location were the highlights 
330216,Avenida Palace, Staff have absolutely no social skills Check in Just took passport Said nothing No Welcome to Avenida Palace No housekeeping rule such as where dining room roof bar is etc No instruction to get to our rooms Its just common courtesy to say despite it being straight forward On check out Didn t ask about our stay Didn t ask if we had enjoyed our stay with them Didn t wish us a safe journey etc Its just normal customer service Not asking for them to lay out the red carpet Just Rude , Impressive lobby Rooms average Good noise reduction with 2 sets of windows Good nights sleep Roof top bar loungers view 
330217,Avenida Palace, It wasn t made clear to me at check that I had already paid for breakfast It didn t say it on any info we were given either So my payment for breakfast was wasted , Nice tidy and comfortable room Pleasant and helpful check in staff Great central location
330218,Avenida Palace, Rooms are old bathrooms where recently renovated We had a problem with our room and it took them 3 days to solve this problem It was not possible to change rooms because they were fully booked I can understand this but they didn t offer us anything in return for the discomfort Its a 3 hotel in classic style not up to date , Location is great and the rooftop is awesome 
330219,Avenida Palace, Would have liked a room with a view We had a room with a view into the indoor square so not much to see and as it was our honeymoon an upgraded room would have been appreciated , The rooftop pool and lounge area were perfect and provided 360 degree views of the city The bed was changed daily and fresh towels provided daily also The air conditioning in the rooms gave some relief from the afternoon heat We didn t dine in the restaurant but the food smelled great So close to la rambla and so many other attractions Right across from a great metro station that you can get to anywhere you want to go 
330220,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Location was great La Rambla around the corner Metro stop outside the front door A lovely clean hotel with a buzzing vibe beautiful decor A nice pool on the roof with a bar The bedroom was big spotless They had a room to store our luggage as we arrived early allowing us to start sight seeing straight away without dragging our luggage around with us Lovely welcoming staff 
330221,Avenida Palace,No Negative, An oasis in the middle of Barcelona excellent location with fabulous views from the roof top pool Great well appo Need rooms and bathrooms A modern hotel that retains its stylish Catalan heratige 
330222,Avenida Palace, No bath robes in the room so had to go back from swimming pool in briefs only , Perfect location Great interior Nice room Breakfast was worth the price 
330223,Avenida Palace, Nothing should have stayed longer, Staff very helpful upgraded second day to room 801 with large balcony over looking the fountain because work on another room would have effected us Bathroom great Location in centre of Barcelona Next to trains metro Great stay
330224,Avenida Palace, It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making in the room The scrambled eggs at breakfast were not so nice other eggs were available on request but that was not obvious , Good location on the quieter end of Las Ramblas Beautiful decor with comfortable beds and great shower The breakfast had a lovely choice of breads and meats especially the Parma ham set in a gorgeous decorated room Amazing view from the roof in the bar and pool area 
330225,Avenida Palace, The view in the room was just facing offices which was a bit of a shame , The pool area on the roof was very good with a great view and friendly bar staff 
330226,Avenida Palace, I booked a room for a couple and they gave me a roon with two single bed togheter , Local staff and restaurant very good Pool small but charming and a nice sun deck Room totaly renewed 
330227,Avenida Palace, Room had a sewerage smell when we walked in sometimes Maybe have been the air conditioner as when we turned off the smell lessened Supposed to be soundproofed room yet we could clearly hear and feel the rumble of the underground trains Pool was not operational for 3 days of our stay Overall very disappointed ,No Positive
330228,Avenida Palace, No tea coffee facilities in room Unfortunately my sister left her iPad on the bed When we phoned a few hours later en route to airport we were advised no iPad was found Disappointing , The hotel was beautiful and in a great location Large rooms and bathroom Amazing view from the rooftop 
330229,Avenida Palace, A bigger spread at breakfast perhaps , The staff were fabulous and very helpful They entertained our kids quite a bit with their constant chatter They gave us lots of valuable information on places to visit and so we managed to avoid touristy spots 
330230,Avenida Palace, Found the staff to be quite cold and unhelpful booked two family rooms together to be given rooms poles apart despite having young children wanted to coexist together Found staff to be unhelpful and cold Not sure why ,No Positive
330231,Avenida Palace, N A, Spectacular ornamental hotel with a bar dining terrace and swimming pool on the roof Warm friendly helpful bilingual staff Lovely comfortable bedroom with complementary facilities and all amenities Wonderful location central to the city Highly recommended and I will definitely use again 
330232,Avenida Palace, The pool at the rooftop was closed for 2 days We were a bit disappointed that it took so much time to re open it But in the end this wasn t a big deal , The hotel has a perfect location and the hotel itself is just so beautiful Good service spacious room and an awesome rooftop terrace Strongly recommend 
330233,Avenida Palace, They advertise fitness but it is very poor Staff had an attitude occasionally If you are traveling by car you can not access the hotel entrance unless you drive on taxi lane , Location is perfect 
330234,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Staff were very nice and helpful as was everyone else in Barcelona Location was fabulous Tapas bar on the corner was one of the best we had in the city Walked 3 blocks to laundromat Right at the top of Las Ramblas Two blocks from department store that has everything Never heard or saw another guest up where we were on the tenth floor Could see Sagrada Familia from our balcony Unbeatable for the money 
330235,Avenida Palace, Breakfast was expensive ate out every morning Sunbeds would have been preferable to the deck chairs on roof terrace not very comfortable, Almost everything room very quiet and clean public areas were very nice Reception staff very helpful 
330236,Avenida Palace, Had a room without anykind of view from the window as the room was very close and directly opposite an office building , The location was great and the rooftop terrace was great for looking at views all over the city of Barcelona The room was spacious and the bed was large and really comfy The reception staff were very helpful and friendly 
330237,Avenida Palace, We didn t use the resutaurant for breakfast because we only wanted a coffee and croissant and felt per person 16 was a bit pricey we were offered a 15 discount on this at check in but instead we found a Juice bar called Faborit and got a juice coffee and pastry for 4 50 each which was perfect for us also the room we stayed in was very dark and the view wasn t great but at the price we paid 99 on the Gran Via I wasn t going to complain I m sure if we had have paid more it would have been a better view as the hotel was huge , The hotel is beautiful in the lobby location is perfect right beside the Passaig de Gracia and rooms were spacious and very clean Very good shower and lots of toiletries Staff are helpful and available 24 7 There is a rooftop pool very small gym and a bar but we didn t get to use it because we didn t realise it was closed at 10pm but the day we left they had live music on the rooftop terrace and the bar was open late Also a beauty spa 
330238,Avenida Palace, slow elevators antiquated room keys tiny shallow pool no whirlpool, amazing location friendly stuff beautiful building nice decor impressive breakfast menu
330239,Avenida Palace, We have absolutely nothing that we didn t like , We arrived very early and were not expecting to be able to check in straight away The staff were very friendly and told us our room was ready and that in fact they upgraded us Our room was amazing Spacious comfortable and new It included a complimentary water bottle too The bathroom was beautiful and the shower amazing The bed and pillows were comfortable and big The staff were very helpful giving us advice on how to get to places where to go restaurants to book and they did the bookings for us too The hotel lobby is also beautiful The location is great close to restaurants shops and attractions We will most definitely come back and recommend it to people 
330240,Avenida Palace, The carpets smelled a bit mildewy But that may have been a result either of the doors to a massive balcony or another set of doors leading to a smaller balcony If that s the case it s ok They were also a bit worn and dirty Closets could use an updating as well Everything else was fantastic , Very good location excellent balcony with unbelievable views over Barcelona with the great Sagrada Familia poking out of the landscape Huge comfy bed New beautiful modern bathroom Nice accommodating staff Excellent all around 
330241,Avenida Palace, My only little grumble is that there wasn t a lot of variety for breakfast and it didn t change at all throughout the week therefore I got a bit sick of eating the same thing over and over However it was all very tasty and fresh so would definately recommend booking it in for a couple of mornings throughout a weeks stay , our bedroom was lovely good size with a Lovely big bed The roof top pool was really nice although very cold with absolutely amazing views of the city And all of the staff were lovely The location of this hotel is actually perfect 
330242,Avenida Palace, We were on the first floor and the sound of the subway was, Bathroom was beautiful location was great pool bar was good foyer was beautiful room was nice and big
330243,Avenida Palace, How the rooms are described just tell the truth It totally spoilt holiday , The description of the bedrooms on your site is so so wrong you state rooms are carpeted soundproof please visit room 937 not sure if this is correct but was 9th floor room was drab no carpet and Defnintley NOT soundproof people banging doors kids screaming etc 2rickety uncomfortable single beds pushed together we asked for a double on our booking plus a quiet room which of course as soon as you get into the bed they move view was the back of hotel not pretty 
330244,Avenida Palace,No Negative, I chose this hotel because of the reasonable price on booking com I wanted the convenience of the city but didn t really care about being in a luxury hotel WOW It was very grand and luxurious The location was amazing I wouldn t have asked to be any closer to Placa Catalunya and the conveniences of the city When I had a problem in my room the first night water dripping from shower above and toilet running when upstairs toilet was flushed the night manager was extremely helpful and apologetic Nothing could be done at that moment due to the time of day and full bookings but the following morning they moved me to a luxurious suite on the 8th floor with a beautiful corner balcolny overlooking the city and mountains They went above an beyond to ensure I was taken care of As a single female traveler I never felt I was unsafe The amount of staff in the lobby and the key system meant that someone was always aware of my departure and return English was spoken fairly well by the front staff The roof top pool and bar loungers and view were truly amazing I honestly have NOTHING negative to say about my stay 
330245,Avenida Palace, The drains were very smelly in the bathroom If we left the bathroom door open the whole room stank , The location was excellent and the beds were comfortable

330253,Avenida Palace, Both of the adjoining rooms had a heavy smoke smell The wi fi was good initially but slowed to a crawl on the third day , Good location near a Gaudi house the northern end of La Rambla with restaurants and the Placa Catalyuna Very good bathroom with tissues and a nice rain shower The breakfast was excellent with very good waiter service The breakfast offerings changed each day We had quiet rooms in the back of the hotel Hotel lobby and breakfast room are very well decorated The hotel offers printer services for free very helpful because many attractions in Barcelona require printouts of tickets

330258,Avenida Palace, The walls appeared very thin as you could hear your fellow guests next door The lift only went to the 9th floor and as disabled was difficult to access the pool The breakfast was a little limited , The bed was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful It was near to the centre and very beautiful inside
330259,Avenida Palace, Certainly not a complaint but although buffet style breakfast is absolutely fine it would be a mistake not to venture out for the alternatives that are all so close by , Ideal location so you can soon get your bearings very friendly helpful staff Room was recently decorated spotless Very helpful friendly staff especially in Roof area which is very nice I will definitely stay there again

330266,Avenida Palace, No boiled water available in the room Basics for this type of hotel Also no complimentary for our honey moon trip, Decor and location near to center of Barcelona Near Metro station Walking distance from main center place
330267,Avenida Palace, Most staff didn t understand English was hard to communicate Communication is key in hospitality yet is not used I was the unlucky traveller that gotten sick during the course of stay Is not that I have ask to be sick Nobody would As such I asked for a room service to sent a hot soup they told me they do not serve hot soup which I mentioned I am not feeling well but they can t do it Well they could just heat up the soup Oh well maybe it will not taste as good after heated So I asked if it possible to sent me a water boiler so I can heated up water to make tea for my sore throat He couldn t understand me so he ask to call the reception instead When I did it took her so long to understand at the end pass the phone to someone who could I had to go outside pharmacy to get myself some lozenges honey for my throat flu Oh yes I wanted to extend my stay as I was feeling very sick to travel to London so when I got back I asked if I could extend my stay as I wanted to rest The man at the reception said good The day after I wanted to pay for the bill plus I thought of having breakfast I went to the reception asking them since I am extending 1 more day I would to settle the other payment first They were at awe said I can t extend as it is fully occupied I am so appalled by the fact that the hotel is throwing me out when I am sick there s nothing they can do about it as he claim it s not his fault Then it shouldn t be told to me that it was good However I am not feeling well All he can say is there s nothing he can do To sum up he is saying I don t care you have to check out I had to find another hotel as I have change my flight ticket to the next day as I assume I could extend Will I come to Barcelona yes definitely Will I recommend or ever step into this dreadful heartless place never , It s close by to the center of catalunya
330268,Avenida Palace, The pool is small the workout room was a couple of bikes at the top of the stairs and the pool bar was not open season but the view from up there was spectacular, We were treated to a night s stay in a lovely suite but the regular room was great too Loved the location helpful staff and champagne at breakfast AND the Beatles stayed here How cool is that 
330269,Avenida Palace, No heating system the room was very cold My husband got a serious cold No ventilation either The hotel needs urgent renovation with modern lifts and all The room rates are quite high for its current condition On the other hand the location is excellent , Architecturally it is a beautiful palatial looking hotel Bathroom was very modern and convenient Beds were quite comfortable the staff were extremely helpful and friendly They put us up in a suite without extra charge when the reserved standard double room turned out to be quite unattractive 
330270,Avenida Palace, Noise from metro not too good until getting used to it Having paid extra for city view was placed in internal room and then changed to first floor room with minimal city street view All higher rooms had been allocated to coach tours apparently and we were limited to short availability despite booking way in advance , Roof top facility was superior Bathroom was awsome Bed comfortable and room very nice On the first floor we were happy to have full length Windows wth doors opening to a small balcony 
330271,Avenida Palace, Were informed that the breakfast was included it was not great and they then billed us an additional 20 Euros a head every day we ate there Slammed , The location 
330272,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The stuff reception desk and lovely kind very helpful girls on the reception Tatiana and Mellisa are the best but the others also very very kind and nice with natural smile all the time Location is perfect just a steps away from the center rooms very quiet We will be back 
330273,Avenida Palace, The room was not yet air conditioned in April so had to open windows and street noise was too loud Staff was not very helpful at first but eventually offered to move us to a view of the side street after a sleepless night We didn t want to repack for a move so instead figured out ways to minimize noise with a slightly open window They should consider turning on their air conditioning system earlier in the year , Pleasant looking lobby and staircase Room was organized and spacious bathroom modern The location was perfect and close to major areas of interest and right next to metro stop The four course dinner deal for 20E ea was excellent Staff was courteous 
330274,Avenida Palace, What I didn t like was there was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly And hotel was in perfect location 
330275,Avenida Palace, Would have liked a proper bar downstairs as there is only a restaurant and lounge and 9th floor pool bar closes at 18 00 , 3 mins from the top of Las Rambles Staff were very pleasant and helpful Surrounded by bars caf s and a lovely Tapas bar next door which the hotel probably own 
330276,Avenida Palace, Twin beds although we had asked for a double Could not sit up on beds as beds rolled off the wall in the back View into closed in court yard probably a handicap of a lower range room Staff in other hotels offer city maps upon arrival I had forgotten to ask during check in and had to line up the following morning to ask for a map , Excellent breakfast buffet but a bit pricy 
330277,Avenida Palace, No tea coffee making facility in room which I found very strange at this level , Location was excellent We had 2 adjoining rooms which were ideal travelling with grown up children 
330278,Avenida Palace, No where was mentioned at the booking the that reconstructions were going on this was disturbing very much in morning noise whise, Very nice and comfortable room
330279,Avenida Palace, Sound insulation was very poor Maybe we had especially loud neighbours stiletto heels at 4 30 in the morning but their conversations were loud enough to wake us up In a room that had recently been renovated this came as a surprise and may put us off using this hotel again Such a shame it was perfect in every other way , Perfect location close to two metro stations and within easy walking distance of Catalunya Square Staff were efficient and polite hotel was spotlessly clean rooftop terrace and pool were excellent 
330280,Avenida Palace, The room safe was a bit confusing to operate more so than others I ve used However this is a minor complaint , Avenida Palace is a luxury hotel with a professional and helpful staff The hotel is centrally located Breakfast was generous and service attentive Overall a fine hotel We would gladly stay there again 
330281,Avenida Palace, Air con didn t work but didn t feel the need to report as our stay was in March windows were enough , Huge comfy bed Great location centre of the city Gorgeous neo classical lobby and stairwell

330290,Avenida Palace, Arrived at 11 0 a m but could not go into room until 3 0 p m but they did put our cases in the luggage room , The location was excellent just off Las Ramblas hotel was very grandeur just like a palace excellent bathroom with great power shower with very generous toiletries

330292,Avenida Palace, When we arrived our room didn t have any contact numbers which was a bit frustrating It took me a long time to figure out how to call for service front desk room service Food downstairs didn t open till late which you expect in Spain but could have been a bit clearer , Lovely staff and a truly beautiful hotel Room service food was really great quality Staff were very helpful gave us a map of the city helped with a taxi when we headed to the airport Room was a great size and bathroom was good 
330293,Avenida Palace, The cleaners always cleaned the room after 2pm which was annoying as that s when we wanted to go for an afternoon nap, The rooftop pool was brilliant
330294,Avenida Palace, The initial front desk staff were efficient but not engaging or friendly There was NO AIR CONDITIONING in the hotel this was not advised at the time of booking The room was too hot the window had to be left open which created a noise problem as the hotel was under refurbishment the contractors were noisey No reduction in price was offered for the lack of inconvenience caused , The location was 1st class 
330295,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Perfect location In easy walking distance of key attractions and shops Great tapas restaurant around the corner Friendly and helpful staff Good value for money

330297,Avenida Palace, Air conditioning was not working very well , Great location right next to a metro station and a few minutes walk to Placa Catalunya Staff where professional and helpful Free printing and internet 
330298,Avenida Palace, A 4 star hotel with a gym facilities of just a threadmill is beyond belief There are no free weights Replenishing basic amenities like water bottles on a daily basis is missing , The location of the hotel is simply amazing It s smacked right in the middle of Plaza Catalunya Everything and anything you need is surrounding the hotel Metro access is just in front of the hotel Shuttle bus to the airport is a mere 5 mins walk 
330299,Avenida Palace, Location and staff , Hotel had seen better decades Refurbishment in bathrooms in upper floors caused great discomfort and other resident were shouting and unhappy Noise level in doors shutting and opening very annoying

330310,Avenida Palace, I stayed this hotel at the end of CY2015 As you know a fireworks performed around Spain square But I could not enjoy this fireworks due to early close of roof in this hotel I can imagine easily this hotel will be more fascinated if roof will be opened till midnight only year end day , This hotel is located in very comvenient place be able to take a train and bus easily At the roof of this hotel you can enjoy nice view we could see almost all famous landmark in Barcelona

330320,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Once you make the check in they tell you that they have works at the 3rd floor and between 10 am till 8 pm it will be some noise Being honest with you It s impossible to take a nap and it so noisy I can t understand how they don t have a preference with the clients and invite to the breakfast or so I won t go back to the hotel and it is a pity as the location it s great but they are not honest with you
330321,Avenida Palace, Room with blinded windows Opening windows showed an office wall and gave horrible fat smell from lower located kitchens Staff in dining room of mainly older men that have seen it all and missed the great enthousiasm to make you feel welcomed The hotel is built in great luxery with seemed to have faded over the past years , Nice location at the Gran Via between Paseigh de Gracia and La Rambla

330324,Avenida Palace, Limited breakfast choice No boiling pot in the room Inaccurate travel info given by the receptionists It happened twice , Spacious room modern design Great location very close to metro station 
330325,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The location very close to the city centre and shopping places the staff were also quite warm i didn t like the fact that my room was next to the exit though but everything else was good
330326,Avenida Palace, The hotel is remodeling from 10am to 8pm I think you can image the noise It s right above our room It s no way you can stay in a room during that time We complained and they gave us another room in the 9th floor It s better but still can hear the noise , The location is absolutely unbeatable and the room is clean with ok size 
330327,Avenida Palace, Walls a bit thin and disappointed not being to check in before 3 pm and had to check out at 12 noon Nevertheless would def recommend , Set dinner menu very good value for 20
330328,Avenida Palace, The hotel room was a little bit cold and the air conditioning not heating , The hotel and the enviroment it was good There is an excellent view of the city on the the roof terace

330331,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Great location very central but still quiet beautiful hotel lobby nice clean room comfortable bed nice bathroom with bath tub Hotel reception very friendly and welcoming Great experience 
330332,Avenida Palace, On arrival we were put in a room with no outside window It was so dark and the banging of the work going on was so loud When we asked could we be moved we were told thats what you paid for Another staff member intervened as i think she was as shocked as us at being spoken to this way in front of other people staying at the hotel There was work going on we were told work wouldn t begin until 10 every morning but there was banging earlier every morning Wasn t relaxing at all couldn t enjoy the hotel at all , The location was great 
330333,Avenida Palace, it s an old hotel I can say you still need to drop the key at the front desk the bathroom is good but old in General is a good hotel but not modern simple, I liked the location and staff
330334,Avenida Palace, Breakfast wasn t included in the price , Great location in the center of the city Easy access to metro Just a walking distance from the airport bus final stop making it easy and cheap to get from and to rhe airport 
330335,Avenida Palace, On a negative side it was the first holiday in 6 years due to my partners ill health It was a special occasion as it was her 50th birthday and I asked on the special requests section of booking com whether the hotel could make it extra special by means of whatever they could On arrival it was a standard room with no flowers or anything and I queried the special request with the reception The lady showed me the conformation of booking from booking com but no special request had been added She added as a gesture that she would send to the room a bottle of cava on the house which we were grateful for but I was disappointed that the special request had not been added at the time of booking , The location of the hotel is very good 5 minutes in either direction takes you to the main shopping areas restaurants and bars or the railway station linking to the airport The weather was good at over 20c with plenty of atmosphere in the city Would recommend 
330336,Avenida Palace, The view the noise the shower no space free water bottle provided for only 1 night we stayed 3 nights small fitness area small pool , Location and breakfast
330337,Avenida Palace, Sadly no bar They will serve drinks to you but not the same as atmosphere of a bar, Very helpful staff great location left our bags 8 hours after we had checked out really no problem even got a big discount on parking our car in car park round the corner 
330338,Avenida Palace, as a 4 stars hotel management should consider to provide a bottle of water every day for customers like other hotels doing the facilities and decoration in bathroom should be improved , location is good enough for sightseeing spots and shopping activities the closet in room is clean and comfortable room with city views is still quiet for good sleeping wifi signal is strong enough for posting pictures to social network hotel lobby s decoration is attractive
330339,Avenida Palace, room service every day but there was dust on all the furniture when we arrived and this was never cleaned during our stay Also no kettle or tea making facilities in the room asked for a kettle first one blew up and tripped all electric replacement one was sent and the plug was fastened together with sellotape , roof top pool was lovely and excellent views location was very good central for all sightseeing
330340,Avenida Palace, There is only one bar and it is on the roof with no or limited seating area It closes at 19 o clock In the lobby there is only limited seating area and no bar , The location is good The people at the front desk great 
330341,Avenida Palace, I booked the suite with a terrace with a view to the Sagrada Familia one of the more expensive rooms The room has two small green ceiling lights that are on 24 7 presumably to meet some safety regulation Cannot be turned off Result poor sleep As the room is at roof top level you get all the cooking smells from the exhaust vents The air con is not great so you open the terrace and windows Result smelly room The terrace suite is poor value for money , Location is excellent Staff are courteous and helpful Nice roof top pool and bar area with great views 
330342,Avenida Palace, the staff could have been a bit more pleasant in the restaurant when we ordered our evening meal not a word was spoken or asked if we were enjoying our meal , a good central position and a short walk from the shuttle bus from the airport 
330343,Avenida Palace, Staff at reception was not friendly They just did not care Did not make us feel welcome They were always talking with each other Rooms were dusty Bathtub was not clean , Location
330344,Avenida Palace, Waited for 30mins for chilli supper Hiwever chef added some chunky chips with sauce to apologise for the delay which were both gorgeous , Bar and room were both pleasant
330345,Avenida Palace, Poor quality of the bed Phone call from the reception to tell us to leave the room at check out time the man was quite persistent although we were needed a few minutes more The decor of the reception needs updating The decor of the other roons seemed very average A hotel which is past its glory , Beautiful decor of our suite really perfect The location The reception staff recommended places to eat that were a success 
330346,Avenida Palace, unfortunately no telephone connected in our room so we couldn t call out or call front desk so when we were very tired from sightseeing all day and ready for bed I had to go down stairs to organize for a wake up call , friendly efficient staff at front desk lovely room with balcony and view spacious and lovely big bathroom Central and close to city amenities Capped off our day in Barcelona very nicely Will definitely stay again 
330347,Avenida Palace, They didn t respect the clients and no consideration that the client could be travelling long hours , The night I have reached the hotel after 2 months before booking Hotel reception tells me we have a problem We don t have a room for you tonight claiming the have water leakage But the room will be ready tomorrow morning The question how when he said that this is Spain We don t have a service team and the room will be ready by tomorrow morning How come They don t have a service team and the room will be ready in the morning They sent me to another hotel old room rubbish mattresses logged us in the un re furnished cheap room although the staff very friendly but the room has nothing except 2 beds If I have the time I would ask them to pay back my money because they have paid Hotel Regina half what I was charged by them
330348,Avenida Palace, Staff was not very friendly Booked this hotel as there were 12 pf us in for a family reunion Was hoping that we would be able to sit in the lobby and talk but staff would not let us temporarily moce the chairs so we could be together A hotel of thos price should try to accommodate clients , Location
330349,Avenida Palace, The room was small and dark and had no facilities for tea and coffee making, The location was great within walking distance to La Rambla the old area the harbour and beaches but just away from the busiest part of town the cafes and bars nearby were perfect and we ate a different place each night
330350,Avenida Palace, Ask for an early check in and late check out or stay at least 2 days It is expensive for an overnight stay especially when the room is not ready before 4 30pm , Very nice hotel We had a beautiful suite We wish we could have stayed longer Very big bathroom and a real confortable king size bed 
330351,Avenida Palace, Damp smell in the room when we opened the window to try and freshen the smell from the canal was like a sewer Very dark terrible bed springs pinging when I moved too much more to describe , Very central location
330352,Avenida Palace, Poor service informed reception that we would like an evening drink sat down at 20 12 in reception area and at 20 32 got up and walked away as nobody came and served us Waiter was hiding down stairs When booking out staff behind reception desk ignored us and walked around until he could not hind any further No air condition in room room dark and old fashion Internet speed was slow received emails but not able to look up any information which required better bandwidth Would not go back family travelling to Barcelona next summer will not be recommending this hotel ,No Positive
330353,Avenida Palace, Staff could have been more welcoming and felt that we were shown the workings in our room by a robot Tried to explain we were tired and would sort it out ourselves but Unfortunately keep going in rote fashion until he was finished , Location excellent clean and comfortable
330354,Avenida Palace,No Negative, Location location location Ideally suited close to Placa Catalunya friendly and helpful staff Short taxi rides to most of the touristy areas or a simple stroll to lots of good eating locations With two sets of windows traffic noise from a very busy Gran Via was not heard 
330355,Avenida Palace, 1 Roof top bar was unmanned during day 2 the electricity in the room was off when I woke and needed to get ready for airport in complete darkness when I reported this to reception via telephone no apology whatsoever was offered, Location was excellent
330356,Avenida Palace, Some of the rooms were a bit tired Nowhere to get a cup of coffee It would have been good to have coffee and tea facility in the room , The location was very good and the staff were very helpful 
330357,Avenida Palace, Did not include breakfast with our booking but had it first morning and we found it to be poor, Fantastic location and very clean and comfortable Rooftop pool was nice but small 
330358,Avenida Palace, Would have like a kettle in the room , Fabulous evening dinner 3 courses 20 pp with wine water and bread Beautiful hotel with stunning rooftop pool with excellent views of Barcelona bar and sunbathing area Excellent position 
330359,Avenida Palace, The room was never cleaned eventhough we talked to the reception and complained about it they only made the bed and left the toilet and the room floor dirty There are only 2 elevators that were always crowdy and had us to wait all the time The unfriendly staff were not helpful we had to wait litteraly an hour when checking out waiting for someone to get our luggages , Great location Nice palace design 
330360,Avenida Palace, Nothing too special which we thought it would It looks grand and fancy but in hindsight it was just a hotel Elevators were always so slow , Close to everything Could walk anywhere easily 
330361,Avenida Palace, Slow internet , Great location Walking distance to Block of discord and hop on hop off bus stop is couple blocks away Internet in room is very slow but the view from our room 901 was absolutely amazing It was the corner room on top floor Nice double sinks and very quiet double pane windows 
330362,Avenida Palace, Booked a double room it was 2 beds pushed together so I kept slipping through the gap Requested upper floor but view out the window was of hotel brick walls all around No tea or coffee facilities in our room, I did enjoy rooftop pool area but probably would be nicer with more sofas 
330363,Avenida Palace, Could do with more loungers on the rooftop deck but that s just me being picky , We booked this hotel at the last minute and got a great deal The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location for exploring Barcelona We sat on the rooftop by the pool mid afternoons and could look across the whole of the city to plan our trip for the next day Loved having the pool even though it s small it s just perfect Wifi was great for us in both our rooms 
330364,Avenida Palace, Poll was small Cleaner did not clean our room Just changed the towels , We were upgraded to a premium r suite for free The Room was spacious with a good view Staff were helpful Location was excellent 
330365,Avenida Palace, The lifts were terrible 2 lifts to service all the floors were insufficient Long waits Reception requires more people Understaffed , Great location Excellent breakfast 
330366,Avenida Palace, The first night we had to share a bed even though I stipulated that we needed twin beds Luckily my friend and I have know each other since high school otherwise it would have been awkward The room was a bit shabby and the carpet very worn Not a good first impression The second night it was changed to twin room with wooden floors much better The other negative was having to wait until late afternoon to check in as we arrived early we has to change in the ladies room which was not so convenient And checking out at noon and our flight was at 10pm Again we had to leave out bags in and wear the same clothes all day I have been in hotels where there is a room available to change , The Staff were very helpful and generous with information 
330367,Avenida Palace, bad internet and pool have to be cleaned more often because its so small its not a pool actually its jacuzzi , location and roof are an ectremely beautiful if you want to stay in city hotel it would be the best choice its important to have a city view room and room was relax and large enough 
330368,Avenida Palace, Musty smell broken tv no bath plug no view tiny twin room with only 1 chair thin walls bad metro noise vibration slow lifts unfriendly and inefficient check in no extra towels amenities not replenished room safe locked shut , Location although difficult or impossible to approach in private car 
330369,Avenida Palace,No Negative, The hotel was a luxury property and our suite was beyond exceptional The location was excellent and the staff outstanding We were very impressed and on this trip had stayed in several five star hotels in Madrid Seville and Malaga 
330370,Avenida Palace, Only 2 lifts and they were very slow The pool is stainless steel and therefore very slippery Not many lounges at the pool When late check out is unavailable there are no washing or changing facilities other than the hotel toilets 4 days to get a remote control for the TV , The location was very good
330371,Avenida Palace, It can be a little noisy at night time with people walking up and down the corridor Rooms are not very well sound proofed , Staff were pleasant and the hotel was well maintained and clean

330374,Avenida Palace, I was disappointed that my a room had absolutely now view from the windows Unless you count a wall couple of meters away as a view There were no electricity outlets beside the bed , Location is perfect Bed is super cozy good sleep Room and bathroom are spacious Roof terrance with a pool Cool old fashioned lobby 
330375,Avenida Palace, Absolutely nothing to dislike , Everything We loved this property and will stay here again next time we visit Barcelona The hotel is beautiful within short walking distance to many points of interestyou and close to transit Professional staff The hotel deserves more than 4 stars 
330376,Avenida Palace, 1 The hotel is very dated too much so for comfort for the following reasons Only two elevators servicing 9 floors and they are extremely slow I took the stairs all the time instead The funriture and carpets in my room were old and dirty It was quite depressing to be in actually There isn t even a regular phone to dial room service with They provide a phone but are not clear on how to call They provide old fashioned extremely heavy keys which you have to pick up and return to reception regularly 2 The rooms are not soundproof and they put the beds against the corridor wall This means you can hear everything from the staff talking to other rooms slamming their doors I could not sleep from the noise 3 My room was beyond depressing To be fair is was probably the worst room in the hotel but it overlooked a small internal courtyard which made it very dark in addition to the small windows and dark furntiure 4 Bed was uncomfrotable Pillows were hard and no duvert was provided , The location is excellent and the building looks quite grand from the outside There is a rooftop pool more like a big jacuzzi which is quite pleasant and has nice views Also the staff are friendly and efficient 
330377,Avenida Palace, Our first night was not very good there s no toothbrush and toothpaste in our room They provide us in the end but need to phoned the receptionist to send us them , Roop top Jacuzzi and swimming pool location is very close to all the big shops and restaurants and also not far to all the tourist spots
330378,Avenida Palace, The folks at the front desk should work on a smile They just didn t seem friendly Internet was bad constantly losing signal When it came to cleaning room the norm was just do the bed put towels Floor in bath was never mopped Always found with shower water on floor Room had patio balcony doors that would not close Informed front desk but no one ever came to check , It s location was good 
330379,Avenida Palace, The bath because it had a lot of black mold around it There was no tea or coffee maker facilities in the rooms The view from our rooms was of car parks and flats so i did not open the curtains , The rooms and the beds were very big We also liked the rooftop pool and the views of Barcelona from there The hotels interior was of a high standard inkeeping with the area 
330380,Avenida Palace, In comparaison with the groundfloor of the hotel and the lobby the room is very common and a bit small The corridors give the impression of being dusty , The location of the hotel is very good in the center of the city The settings of the entrance the lobby and the ground floor are really superb It makes you think of a palace
