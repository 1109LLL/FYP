178421,Little Palace Hotel, The staff was unwelcoming the elevator was tiny the bathroom was underwhelming very small shower and lack of design Also the bathroom door was clear so that whoever was in the main part of the room could see the other person on the toilet and in the shower , Great location gorgeous view from balcony
178422,Little Palace Hotel, room was a bit small elevator was tiny but sufficient , top notch really liked it had a room with balcony it was excellent staff was really helpful did not try the breakfast but it looked nice 
178423,Little Palace Hotel, There is so much light coming into the room at night from the well at the centre of the building that I had to use the air conditioning and close the windows and curtains on my last night to have a good sleep It would have been nice to have one television channel with English language entertainment programs not just the news , The hotel is very conveniently situated it was less than 20 minutes walk for Gare de l Est and is only 15 minutes quick walk to the Seine via Les Halles a great place to eat and wander I felt safe in the area although was careful amongst crowds The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and perfect for one person it was lovely to have a bath and not just a shower 
178424,Little Palace Hotel, The fridges weren t cooling properly One fridge wasn t working At night when we complained there was no one to fix the problem Usually hotels provide two bottles of complementary water which Little palace hotel didn t The lift was too small to use for a big family and caused inconvenience In our suite there should have been a WC in both bathroom and powderoom also , The bed was super comfortable Good location and close to station 
178425,Little Palace Hotel, WiFi a little hard to connect for some reason but hot it working 2nd day , Clean Air conditioned Close to sites but far enough away from noisy street scene Close to metro and restaurants Room was larger than most boutique hotel rooms 
178426,Little Palace Hotel, Toilet was off the living room and separate from shower and sink area which were off the bedroom , Breakfast was delicious and front desk woman was lovely and very helpful Suite was spacious 
178427,Little Palace Hotel, There was a problem in the wifi connection it only work on the first day We have to go to the lobby to use the internet on the 2nd 3rd day of our stay , the place is really nice and clean Staff are all very friendly and helpful They even upgraded our room from standard to superior for free that is superb 
178428,Little Palace Hotel, 1 Staff wasn t that friendly We wanted to check out at 1pm and were told we cant flat out really weird way to treat your clients i thought 2 toilet bowl was choked called the guy twice he said he fixed it when it wasnt fixed We gave up and just managed somehow , Location is fantastic superb access to La Marais Good bars and restaurants around Park across the street is nice too 
178429,Little Palace Hotel, Elevator was very small slow but this is incredibly common in Europe , Excellent location right outside a well connected Metro stop and walking distance from major shopping eating areas Staff was amazing had a room ready for us for a very early check in always greeted us gave great restaurant recommendations with an affordable price Room was larger than expected just enough space for two people and our bags without restricting movement around the room Highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in Paris 
178430,Little Palace Hotel, Small bathroom could hear noises from the street and neighbors at night wifi requires to sign in every time, Good location nice rooms comfortable and clean balcony overlooking a park
178431,Little Palace Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included in the price Shower was rather small , Balcony and view of Paris and close location to restaurants and metro Comfortable room and good choice of breakfast Decor was well thought out and colour scheme was contemporary 
178432,Little Palace Hotel, Walls v thin could hear EVERYTHING happening in rooms adjacent and above No coffee tea facilities in room Wardobe insufficient due to safe taking up space Bathroom toiletries only shower gel Breakfast overpriced for a very basic selection Was very surprised this is classed as a 4 star Maybe superior rooms are better value but generally this was an expensive stay for such a basic hotel , Location good Staff helpful
178433,Little Palace Hotel, Very small room Waited in bar area to order drinks but no one came Noisy room we were near to lift which you could hear asending and descending quite clearly Room noise from other guests , Location 
178434,Little Palace Hotel, The door to the bathroom was a little less than private Fine but make sure you are close with anyone you might be staying with , Such a comfy bed We loved our view out over the park We were very thankful for the helpful and accommodating staff We walked all over the city with this as our home base 
178435,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, We arrived at about 10 30pm a little tired after negotiating our way from Gare du Nord through the Paris Metro system We were met with a warm welcome and were settled in our room in no time A lovely hot cup of tea in the bar was no problem 
178436,Little Palace Hotel, We went with Easter weekend and were surprised there was no decoration or even Spring themed welcome at reception rather dull Breakfast was OK but from a 4 star hotel you would expect more service like a menu to choose your eggs from I was certainly have with the balcony room , Staff was wonderful welcoming and kind Location is SUPER 
178437,Little Palace Hotel, N A, Great location Metro across the road or easy walking to some main areas Very clean room French doors that overlooked park Lovely quaint hotel Good wifi and breakfast great Staff very friendly and helpful 
178438,Little Palace Hotel, the breakfast buffet was a disappointment the staff isn t really prepared you have to ask for everything plates milk They don t refill the breakfast fast enough so many things are already taken they use a protectionsheet for the mattress wich doesn t allow the bed to breath so very hot, the bed was very comfy friendly staff nice park near the hotel parking space
178439,Little Palace Hotel, The walls were quite thin and you could hear a lot but it didn t bother us much , We loved the location and the rooms were bigger than we expected for Paris The shower was especially good 
178440,Little Palace Hotel, The hotel was a old hotel sort of semi renovated But not to its best My bathroom was leaking sewage water from the upper floor at 5 am in the morning It s a good thing we were checking out that time as the receptionist doesn t seem to have a solution nor even a care or a apology for what happened Disappointing end to an average 3 star hotel not four There is minimal amenities in the bathroom rooms are very tiny the internet not fast The location of the hotel is right next to a subway stop but in hindsight I would ve stayed closer to an attraction rather than having to spend alot of time travelling as Paris is a large city ,No Positive
178441,Little Palace Hotel, smell of flowers that makes you allergic and it was not a good smell through in the hotel lobby as soon as you enter you want to run away Awful Shame as first smell and immersion is import and here you are missing this smell of luxury also entrance is nice but needs better lights Lift is tiny Bathroom Tiny , Location Balcony View bed and pillows
178442,Little Palace Hotel, I want to reccommend about the complimentary in the room it s lack of kettle and tea or coffee Even the reception service 24 hours but still uncomfortable , Good staff They are very nice and helpful 
178443,Little Palace Hotel, Nothing rooms are small but it s Paris, People was really kind breakfast room is so nice Pleasant typical parisian ambiance Great view from 8th floor
178444,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable and lovely room Very clean and the stuff was very helpful especially when we had a small situation going on at night and we needed help Very nice location close to 2 metro stations and a park right in front of it You can also go on foot to Notre Dame and other places there are also places to eat close by There is a Pharmacy right next to the hotel the Pharmacist speaks English too I recommend you to stay there 100 
178445,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Loved the decor from the entrance to the room The staff couldn t have been more helpful Didn t have breakfast as just grabbed a croissant across the road If you come out the correct exit the Metro station is literally opposite the hotel Perfect line for Gate du Nord Cite San Germain etc etc
178446,Little Palace Hotel, The hotel was nice but it isn t a four star standard For example all of the little touches that cement a luxury hotel s status are missing Fluffy big towels individual toiletries a big comfy bed none of these were present We paid for a superior room and apart from the size it was disappointing The staff were nice and the shower was good but overall I was let down , The decor and the location
178447,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant The location is excellent 20 min away from Louvre and 3 min away from the line 9 that brings you to the Eifel tower 
178448,Little Palace Hotel, I ve had my experience with hotel rooms but it was a very noisy room with thin walls Other toilets flushing and people walking in the room above easily overhearing people in the hallway doors closing elevator stopping etc hotel offered me to change however , Good spot in between several metro lines and in the heart of Paris Good sized room with comfortable bed
178449,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, There was literally NOTHING not to LOVE about this hotel It s a gem We had a large suite with plenty of space to stretch out Large windows that opened to the space below courtyard like and the delicious breakfast were bright spots 
178450,Little Palace Hotel, the room as well as the public area were not clean we found a used bar of soap and a used towel in the bath in the hall were left roomservice trays on the floor for hours, great location
178451,Little Palace Hotel, The room was overpriced It is not really a 4 star hotel Hair on the sheet and bathroom No kettle in the room I was charged 4 euros for coffee Breakfast is 15 euros and you d expect proper breakfast for that price Coffee is served by waiter Expect to be judged if you want a refill Staff is polite though Is it not the least , Metro access Nice sofa 
178452,Little Palace Hotel, The wifi password needed to be re entered every 4 hours which was a little annoying , Nice hotel and quite well positioned close to metro and walk to Le Marais We had a room with a balcony and view over the square which was lovely The bed was firm and comfortable 
178453,Little Palace Hotel, The bathroom within our room was tiny even by European standards with frosted glass half doors No privacy at all Also shower stall leaked leaving puddle on floor Wifi in room quite poor , Very good location Close to Gard Ost and subway Beds very comfortable and clean We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment on that 
178454,Little Palace Hotel, No coffee and tea making facilities in the room the price you are paying and the view over Paris would be perfect to sit and have a coffee The price for breakfast is 15 is cheaper to go to a bakery and get fresh pastries everyday and eat in your room if the breakfast was half the price we would have eaten in the hotel , The view from the room was stunning as you can see by our photo we could see the Eiffel Tower from our room the room was clean and bed was very comfy shower room was very clean great storage with safe Staff was very friendly kept our luggage on the last day while we went out till we needed to go back to catch the train Location is perfect 2 minutes from the metro 
178455,Little Palace Hotel, Wifi disconnecting all the time not the best breakfast I ve had 15 a bit too much Either old or very frecvented hotel could need slight refurbishment , Bed s ok near metro friendly staff
178456,Little Palace Hotel, The room is too small They don t have kettle The water is 4 5 for a small bottle In the toilet only soap shampoo and hair drier provided But I never use the shampoo with shoulders together It makes your hair are very dry Because we came here from London southend airport They don t allow us to take more than one bag liquid So we need to buy anything in France , The location is very good The metro station in front of the hotel Very easy to go to airport The staff are very nice Even we check in very late 
178457,Little Palace Hotel, For sure not a four star hotel Also in a very boring part of Paris The room was okay but the decoration not authentic or original Just way to expensive and not very special , What I liked was that we stayed here once before over ten years ago We had a good night sleep after staying in an apartment with a very noisy cafe underneith The bed was good and eventhough there are two crowded streets next to it we had very little problem with it thanks to the good windows 
178458,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, great location friendly efficient staff Good sized well appointed rooms The bed was comfy and the bathroom was a good size not too squishy considering what was expected of Paris 
178459,Little Palace Hotel, We requested twin room with two separate beds Technically we got that but the gap between the beds was 7cm Speed of wifi was fine when it worked It cut off often and each time you had to sign in again Annoying and made working difficult My friend is a bit heavy and for him it was hard to fit on the toilet seat that was squeezed in a very tight spot in the bathroom Ventilation was lousy and the tiny room got easily very stuffy Judged by this room Little Palace deserves barely 3 stars , Location Most of the staff was nice 
178460,Little Palace Hotel, The shower pressure was awful The sink in the bathroom didn t drain and was very stinky like mold The towels were very old scratchy and small and some even had stains on them The cleaning staff also disregarded my bedside table items and I had to get down and find my eye mask and ear plugs had been swept under the bed , Easy check in Friendly staff Comfortable bed Great view from the window 
178461,Little Palace Hotel, Mr grandson in an adjoining room said he could hear me snore But I don t believe him , Thought this hotel was good value comfortable helpful staff Also handy position to Pompidou Forum des Halles metro and bistros I would stay there again 
178462,Little Palace Hotel, little place in the toillets when you sit Wifi a bit slow, Well decorated if you like Klimt clean and functional City center and surprisingly not so noisy I m very sensitive to noise Clean and functional The italian lady at reception and Joah were warmly welcoming 
178463,Little Palace Hotel, The bathroom was very small I am tall and weigh 195 pounds and the placement of the toilet was a little difficult to sit on and I felt like I was shoehorning myself onto the toilet The shower was OK but it was also small , The staff was wonderful I had back problems and the staff was very gracious in getting ice The location was excellent 
178464,Little Palace Hotel, The bathroom was tiny and we had booked a superior room We got a great deal so didn t mind too much but it was tiny Bathroom door was frosted glass so not very private 4 5 euros for a small bottle of water was a bit of a rip off Extremely tiny lift , Location was great very clean room and bathroom 
178465,Little Palace Hotel, The superior room that we were given looked exactly like the regular room the only difference was the balcony The shower leaked it was very easy to flood the room , The location is very good it s super close to subway We had a nice view from the room Balcony was nice it must be great during the summer The bed was very comfy Staff was nice and helpful we managed to check in 50 minutes before the the official check in time 
178466,Little Palace Hotel, Not 4 star worthy small bathroom and shower very limited guest amenities Very small King Bed it was a Queen instead Room furnishings felt cheap fabrics , Location was great Value for money was great as well as we got a good deal Loved the view from our balcony on the 6th floor Eiffeltower 
178467,Little Palace Hotel, The walls are quite thin so you could hear the movement of other guests and when housekeeping was cleaning , The hotel was in a good location close to the main road and metro but still nice and quiet from the road noise Staff were lovely and really helpful 
178468,Little Palace Hotel, The shower was awkward We couldn t figure out how not to get water on the floor , Front desk was very nice and helpful Bedding was comfy Loved our view of the Eiffel tower Quiet location 
178469,Little Palace Hotel, Nothing , Very convenient location wonderful staff comfortable beds nicely decorated Bathrooms are on the smaller side but good size for Paris and the rooms are more spacious than I expected 
178470,Little Palace Hotel, We had to have the windows open as it was too hot in the room Very quiet except for nesting pigeons in the internal courtyard , Great location good size room and bathroom
178471,Little Palace Hotel, The bathroom is a bit tight and its glass door does not really provide any privacy We could also hear some noise from the other rooms , We had a lovely view overlooking the park the room is cosy and colorful good for a couple Staff was charming and very welcoming The location of the hotel is perfect close to all the nice and trendy neighborhoods 
178472,Little Palace Hotel, Poor wifi facility no in room facilities such as kettle Terrible pillows thin bath towels almost rags Small bed stuck in an alcove clostraphobic air conditioning too hot screen on the bathtub makes it difficult to get warm water running and then get into the bath to shower and the hand basin did not drain well I don t know how you can rate this hotel as four star it would barely scrape in at 3 star , Nothing except the staff 
178473,Little Palace Hotel, Room was noisy as there was getting TV echo and sound other rooms all night and chairs moving noise around 6 7 in the morning in addition to the TV sound , Hotel location is ok Room was of a good size comparing to Parisian hotel rooms I Was given a garden view room on the first floor which is nice All basic but was enough Welcoming friendly staff 
178474,Little Palace Hotel, Payed a lot for a deluxe room with a porch to the garden The view was great but the room was sooo tiny even for a regular standard room The access to the porch requires climbing like a half a meter step Ridiculous and very dangerous No room service beside for drinks , Amazing staff Everyone was nice professional kind Most of all the night guard who went way beyond necessary to assist I wish i remembered his name to personally thank him on this platform perfect location 
178475,Little Palace Hotel, A shame that you have to log into the WiFi every twelve hours and sometimes more often , I had a lovely room with a view over the square The staff are super efficient and super simpatico 
178476,Little Palace Hotel, There was a strange group of men a couple doors down every night Also the park across the street smelled of pee constantly Other than that the location was great , I really enjoyed this hotel It was walking distance to Notre dame and have an amazing staff The room was great for 3 people 
178477,Little Palace Hotel, Small elevator but efficient during our stay Glass bathroom door may not suit all guests stay , This is our best experience in France s hotels stay We spent 9 days in 4 hotels located in Paris Juan Les Pins and in Nice Little Palace Paris has it all in terms of hotel design concept modern clean and comfortable furnishing effective housekeeping great location accompanied by intimate french service Loved the balcony with a beautiful park view 
178478,Little Palace Hotel, The elevator is small and you can hear street noise so bring ear plugs , The view of the city and the park is great the location is really good with a metro stop food store restaurants and a post office nearby The room was a good size for Paris and nicely decorated with a mini bar Would definitely stay here again 
178479,Little Palace Hotel, Ours was a very small and smelly room for which we paid 206 euros per night I paid the same price for a far better room elsewhere in a much better area and large clean modern room There are other bigger rooms but the building is old and badly maintained and mostly unclean everywhere The price is definitely very far from the standards of this hotel This is not a four star a two plus at most and the price should reflect that There are far better places at this price in Paris There are dodgy people drinking near the entrance of the hotel at night and they even sit on its stairs sometimes The immediate vicinity is not nice The Marais is close but not close enough , Friendly staff Nearby metro
178480,Little Palace Hotel, I was given standard room aka Closet room smaller than a cruise ship cabin but I had booked a superior room I had to call booking com to correct this dishonest downgrade AC didnt work even though hotel description says it has AC in every room Shower licked into the bathroom creating a mess Breakfast beyond mediocre 8 floor building with one minuscule elevator installed in 1972 , Location 
178481,Little Palace Hotel, The room was on the small side but it seems like this is the norm for Europe We were travelling for two weeks and had quite a bit of luggage so this made the space even tighter The shower flooded the bathroom a bit and we felt bad having to use the towels to mop up the water , The location was outside of the common touristy areas which we enjoyed We were right across from a park We requested a room with a balcony and they were able to accommodate our request so we were able to have great views of the city 
178482,Little Palace Hotel, The bed was uncomfortable The floor coverings were thin so noise from other rooms was an issue for us The staff weren t particularly friendly our request to borrow an umbrella was met with a sigh from the receptionist because she had to get up from her chair The interior was dated in places Overall not good value for money We stayed in The nearby Hotel Fabric a few weeks earlier it was a similar price and our experience there was absolutely fantastic Unfortunately the Little Palace doesn t compare well , The location was good right next to a metro station
178483,Little Palace Hotel, Outside the hotel there was a little park where at night a lot of men congregate and drink felt a bit unsafe if I was on my own which fortunately I wasn t This is not the hotels fault but the immediate area was a bit dodgy , Phillipe in the breakfast room was friendly and I enjoyed the breakfasts too Room was very comfortable One of the receptionists was a bit grumpy when we arrived as I had booked extra nights over the telephone and she appeared annoyed Otherwise everyone else was most helpful 
178484,Little Palace Hotel, They should have slippers and kettle prepared in the room, Staff are nice to order taxi for us and we even split the bill with the other couple location is good one minute walk from the metro room was a little small but it s good to have a garden view 
178485,Little Palace Hotel, You have to register every time you want to use the internet It can drive anyone crazy , The room was spacious and the location couldn t be better as it is located between two subway stations with more than one line each You can go anywhere in Paris in no time from it 
178486,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, it was one of the worst experiences I had in Paris the staff were not helpful at all they changed their prices as soon as we reached the hotel a different price for every night I had to check out because of how bad the treatment was 
178487,Little Palace Hotel, Breakfast is crazily overprized skip it and eat in one of the cafes in Rue de Mountgreil a short walk away , Great hotel walking distance from all the main sites and if you do not feel like it there is a metro station just outside the hotel door Room was standard Paris double which means smaller than what you would expect It has everything you need though 
178488,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great bed so comfortable and loved the balcony The Windows were brilliant at blocking out the noise Loved the hotel right next to the metro easy to find Brilliant location lots to do and see walking distance from some of the sights and great restaurants
178489,Little Palace Hotel, The free internet is very slow and you are required to register everytime you use it I think they are trying to upsell you to a faster but not free version , Great location right next to a Metro station Many good sidewalk reestaurants in the area Next door to a very interesting museum Helpful staff particularly the breakfast personel We arrived early in the day but we were allowed to check in right away Bonus after an early flight 
178490,Little Palace Hotel, Clock in the room and would have like to be able to prepare tea in my room, I really liked the cleanliness of the room and the crisp sheets and comfortable bed Staff was very nice and helpful Liked the decor and the lovely pastries at breakfast Oh Great Windows and lovely view 
178491,Little Palace Hotel, The rooms were quite small as expected in Europe The shower in our room left water everywhere as the door was broken , Staff were nice and had great knowledge of the area The hotel is close to the metro and was not far to walk from many of the attractions 
178492,Little Palace Hotel, For a superior room it wasn t that big But the balcony with the view made up for it s disappointing size Boyfriend went out and bought fresh croissants and juice from town every morning and we enjoyed them whilst looking out on it in the glorious sunshine , Fantastic location Most of the main Parisian attractions were no more than a 20 minute walk 10 minute bus metro ride away We came in on the Eurostar and it s about 10 15 minutes away on the bus It s small but beautifully lit and sharply decorated oozing Parisian glamour without being OTT and I personally loved the teeny tiny lift though admittedly you wouldn t want go in there if you re claustrophobic 
178493,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, I absolutely loved the staff everyone was so accomodating and friendly The hotel was a small boutique hotel located on a side street across from a park and train station and in the heart of everything you would want cafes parks restaurants shopping and a short walk to the monuments and other districts Our room was really tiny for two people but it was clean and cute and it overlook the park a perfect view The elevator made us laugh because it was soooo small only one person with luggage or two people could fit at a time No complaints on our end The staff eas very catering and gave us information and called a taxi every time to get us to where we wanted to go I would definitely recommend for the price AWESOME 
178494,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Lovely boutique hotel with a wonderful location Metro access right across the road and plenty of areas within walking distance Had a room on the top floor which surprisingly also gave us a nice view of the Eiffel Tower Thanks for a lovely stay 
178495,Little Palace Hotel, the big rats on the street at night in front of the hotel the little park seems to have a rat problem , brand new boutique style interior great beds the bike rental right in front of the hotel
178496,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great location In the middle of Paris but still remarkably quiet Good breakfast very welcoming and helpful Staff We enjoyed our stay and if we return to Paris we will stay in this little Palace again for sure
178497,Little Palace Hotel, Overall excellence service there was a minor issue with the key but solved by staff promptly, Wonderful location close to cit Norte dame Sorbonne university
178498,Little Palace Hotel, Day staff were rude and pretty much ignored you Floor in the bedrooms is very hard and not comfortable to walk on barefoot The mirror in the room is too low so you cannot stand and see yourself in it , That bed was beautiful truly wonderful Lovely lovely night staff and a really pretty fresh looking hotel Didn t have the breakfasts as wanted to explore Paris early in the morning and get it out Rooms and balcony was lovely and clean Plenty of room and nice shower Definatly would stay again at this hotel 
178499,Little Palace Hotel, If we d been staying longer than one night we may have needed an extra towel or two as the shower doors didn t quite line up and the bathroom floor got a bit wetter than expected , Loved the hotel and room decor very bijoux The staff were friendly and helpful and overall it was an excellent choice Loved the little balcony for sitting on to look over the treetops with the Eiffel Tower just peeking up beyond Having stayed in many Parisian hotels over the years I d say this ranks very highly on the I want to feel a bit luxurious without breaking the bank scale I would stay here again and try the restaurant bar on site looked adorable but we had plans for all our meals offsite 
178500,Little Palace Hotel, Would prefer a proper bathroom door no shampoo or tea facilities, Location so central even though we were at front of hotel it was very very quiet for a saturday night soft furnitures throughout different 
178501,Little Palace Hotel, Maybe If they had room service and a restaurant that would be good but didn t impact our stay as we ate out, Top hotel in great location rooms and hotel interior is super cool Views are amazing Staff super friendly
178502,Little Palace Hotel, Take your own hair dryer the one in the room was useless Room was clean and tidy but very basic few amenities and old thin towels , Location is perfect Staff were very friendly and helped to book us a restaurant for dinner Was great that we could check in early 
178503,Little Palace Hotel, One side of bed against wall When my wife mentioned it to staff when they asked us about our stay the staff response was pathetic , Location was great bathroom really good shower
178504,Little Palace Hotel, The whole experience was excellent and I can t fault anything , The staff were very helpful and pleasant Breakfast was well laid out with a good variety 
178505,Little Palace Hotel, I meant to inform the staff that the shower seal needed some attention Yes that is the only thing that warranted attention , The position the cleanliness and the general presentation were excellent The most impressive ingredient to an excellent s jour is without doubt the staff It was a warm welcome and nothing was to much trouble The breakfast was well provided and the coffee excellent Thank you 
178506,Little Palace Hotel, We didn t mind but just be wary if sharing with friends the bathroom door is just frosted glass so you can see the person in the bathroom as they are quite small Our only problem was there was no radio system to plug in your phone to play music , The hotel was very modern up to date and comfortable 
178507,Little Palace Hotel, Wifipage had to be refreshed every time A fresh orange juich would fit the status of this hotel , Very nice address in city center Charming design well maintained Close to metro Breakdance OK Great to return to 
178508,Little Palace Hotel, The room was small The bathroom was tiny and lacked privacy The beds were quite soft , The location was great the rooms were clean and the staff was cheerful The AC and balcony in our room was wonderful 
178509,Little Palace Hotel, Wifi was iffy You can buy a portable wifi from Orange with 2 gigs to start and have secure wifi anywhere you go in the city which is what we did , Great centralized location with a very good staff to take care of whatever we needed Close to restaurants museums and train depots You get what you pay for in a good way The windows are noise proof so no worries about traffic or other noise when you sleep We were on the 6th floor with a balcony see photo for view 
178510,Little Palace Hotel, Rooms are small almost no shelves, Great location right by the subway and close to everything Very clean rooms comfy bed The balcony overlooking the small park is beautiful and highly recommended Staff is very friendly and accommodating 
178511,Little Palace Hotel, Booking com seemed to force me to upgrade to a superior room although I just wanted one with 2 beds We were able to change to a twin ordinary room when we got there but were not able to revert to the lower price because it had already been locked in by using booking com Also booking com asked me to confirm my email address and then used that process to say I had confirmed the booking which I was then unable to alter ,No Positive
178512,Little Palace Hotel, The room was very small and lack of door to the bathroom was uncomfortable The free wifi only lasts 1 hour , The location was very convenient The design of the hotel was clean and modern 
178513,Little Palace Hotel, Nothing, Staff was wonderful and location was perfect so close to everything Rooms were very nice and clean also fairly spacious for a Paris hotel Staff was the best part all so kind and helpful 
178514,Little Palace Hotel, No coffee or tea facilities in four star hotel Shower s in both rooms leaked terribly and flooded bathrooms Overpriced, Great location on metro line 4 rue Sebastopol Bedroom windows opening onto a park Sayed was very friendly with lovely tea late at night in the lounge
178515,Little Palace Hotel, Poor breakfast wall were very thin I could hear my neighbours talking on the phone , Decent and cute hotel in central Paris beds are comfortable and the staff was polite 
178516,Little Palace Hotel, Seemed to be on edgy part of Paris and I didn t feel safe after dark , This hotel was chic and very clean However it seemed to be in a very edgy part of town with questionable people and transactions in the evening Did not venture out after dark after the observation 
178517,Little Palace Hotel, The walls between rooms are thin so that you can hear quite well the discussions and other noises in neighbouring rooms Hence the feeling is not very private unless you have nice and quiet neighbours , The internal design of the hotel very nice colors and cosy atmosphere 
178518,Little Palace Hotel, Rooms have musty smell need to air No air conditioning just a fan probably very hot in summer would not stay here Metro is very close but a nightmare with bags way too many steps compared to other metros Wifi inconsistent in rooms even TV is inconsistent No safe to put valuables , Good location lots of shops around including the all important bakery so I can have hot baguette in the morning But a bit far from tourist spots about 1km walk to anything seine Luxembourg gardens etc 
178519,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Staff were friendly even before we arrived and I asked a few questions via email It was perfect for what we needed it for and we all agreed we would stay there again 
178520,Little Palace Hotel, Our room bathroom had no real door only milkglass swing doors , Extraordinary friendly staff Only 10 minutes away from Notre Dame ile de la cit Safe public underground parking lot 80m away Beautiful building and interior design in Art Nourveau style you live like a Parisien in Paris Breakfast has a very good quality homemade hard rolls warm bread good coffee etc 
178521,Little Palace Hotel, Somewhat small rooms Those offering a super view from the balcony have very cramped bathrooms with shower There are some bigger rooms e g room 75 too with ample bathroom equipped with a bathtub However here some other minor disadvantages are to be faced with the slightly depressing view of a patio and the slanted wall of the attic which makes it rather difficult to approach one side of the double bed One must admit however that staff members are willing to show the free rooms and make a change if needed By the bye double beds are rather narrow and an explicit fatigue of the mattress filling can be stated So one can t even draw a bit apart from his her bed partner unless one would like to run the risk of rolling down from the inadequately supported sagging bedside Double beds are equipped with one jumbo duvet as usual in most francophone countries Upon request however the friendly staff provided another huge one thanks , Central location yet not noisy and overcrowded just in the vicinity of a small green park Square mile Chautemps The nearest Metro station R aumur S bastopol is just a minute walk from the hotel Friendly and helpful staff Satisfying breakfast in an intimate and stylish dining room 
178522,Little Palace Hotel, The police sirens go all day long in this area I think the goverment should look into controlling the noise level, The staff helped and the service of each employee was great

178525,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, Very good location easy reachable from any part of the city Cosy and clean room Good service friendly and helpful staff Nothing posh but good value for money Very good place for a short stay 
178526,Little Palace Hotel, Who ever designed the showers did a poor job Water always on the floor which explains why the rooms carpet was always damp Noticed it the first night and we hadn t even used the shower Can t be healthy with such dampness ,No Positive
178527,Little Palace Hotel, We went for a superior room hoping to get a little balcony with park view as advertised here but instead our room was overlooking a light well and the room was always dark which was quite a disappointment We couldn t even tell what the weather was like without sticking head out of the window Internet is beyond bad which is shocking for a 4 star hotel There is a login procedure you have to go through each time you need to access internet and it keeps on logging out and refusing to log back in for ages If you just need to check your emails skype this is too much trouble to go through EACH time Imagine you type in all your details and log in write to someone on skype and by the time they had a chance to respond if your phone accidentally locked you are already offline Then you need to tell your phone to forget this network and hope you will get a login popup with next attempt to log in I am not the type to use hotel internet every minute or even be in hotel during most of the day but this was just terrible Even checking if it will rain during the day required a whole login procedure which often failed so basically prepare to be without any internet access , Location was excellent metro just in front of the hotel right by the park We were walking everywhere and it was a pleasure as all the neighbourhoods around are very nice Nearby are several cafes with great breakfast options Room and bathroom seemed very clean and the shower was great Overall comfortable 
178528,Little Palace Hotel, The elevator is very small and will not accommodate more than about 3 4 people Not a major draw back but good to know , Very helpful and friendlyl staff The hotel was easy to find and steps from the metro and a grocery store The room was very clean and the beds very comfortable The wifi was free and quick We did not purchase breakfast from the hotel but there were many restaurants close by for breakfast lunch or dinner The area is fun and walking distance to many of the main attractions I would definitely recommend it and would stay again 
178529,Little Palace Hotel,No Negative, I loved my stay at The Little Palace Hotel I was staying an extra night after my travelling companions headed in different directions It was easy to find the staff were super courteous and the decor was a little edgy up to date and very clean My room as I suspect they all are was small but completely adequate internally The designers have done a great job prioritising what matters comfy bed good quality shower just enough bench space for toiletries a small amount of storage plenty enough for a few nights worth of clothes and not including what doesn t little toiletries of low quality that I never use anyway I also had a balcony room that had an AMAZING view over the roof tops of Paris including being able to see the top of the Eiffel Tower I have been to Paris quite a number of times before and this experience still blew me away I loved it The location was great for exploring Le Marais and around too Very central really I wish I had been staying for more than a night and would definitely stay here again Thanks 
178530,Little Palace Hotel, Lift was very tiny and slow most of the time I couldn t get it on time I was following it in stairs A pair of sleepers should be better if you put it in room, location was so good balcony in my room was nice 
178531,Little Palace Hotel, The room was quite small The shower over the bath is into an eaves corner so you feel like you need to lean sideways to stand under it Anyone taller than me I m not all that tall would presumably have found it even worse There were no tea coffee facilities in our room I d just figured that can be taken for granted these days The hotel was really quite noisy We could hear the lift mechanism in our room A loud irregular clicking one morning we finally decided was next door s shower continuing to drip after they d used it We seemed to hear all the doors opening and closing during the morning especially when the cleaners got started We got there mid afternoon after a very early morning start so we went straight to bed I was almost asleep when I heard someone coming in I called out Later please and heard I m just bringing your oh sorry the last bit presumably as she realised we were in bed trying to sleep After that we hung out the Do Not Disturb when we were in or sleeping late but I still had to call to stop one person who was using a card to come in and another time had to answer a knock at the door despite the sign being out It was a cute little hotel but it was much more expensive than say the Novotel where we would have got a larger room tea coffee facilities better bathroom quieter I booked this one because I thought it would be romantic but we concluded no we d have been better off somewhere corporate modern and efficient Maybe that s just us , The staff on reception were very helpful with checking Metro routes and so on for us 
178532,Little Palace Hotel, Rooms a bit small but in an older city building to be expected, Great breakfast selection for a small hotel comfortable clean and stylish Friendly staff Good location
178533,Little Palace Hotel, If being really picky then would say that I would have liked a coffee machine in the room and the bathroom was rather on the small side , Couldn t really fault it for a weekend stay Location was perfect for us with a metro station outside with easy links to all the attractions including easy connection to Gare du Nord for Eurostar or onward travel to CDG Staff were excellent Breakfast had a good selection for a continental breakfast Room was comfy with virtually everything we wanted

178537,Little Palace Hotel, Room are very small a little bit suffocating and enlightened only with a patio window continental breakfast is quite poor and not on the same level of the french one , the staff very helpful and accommodating we arrived few hours before the check in time but they immediately gave us a room available without any additional charge the typical french breakfast is very rich and high quality products are guaranteed the position was strategic close to one of the most attractive neighborhood in Paris Le Marais and connected with 3 underground stations 
178538,Little Palace Hotel, I was sharing a twin room with a college and the bath room had a glass door and is very close to the bed we had to change room as this was not private in anyway even if I d gone with my partner this was still very tight , The staff were helpful
178539,Little Palace Hotel, Internet connection was poor Didn t like that I need to register and submit name and email in order to connect Had to do this each time I wanted to connect, Location is excellent Stuff was polite Room was clean Good value for money

178543,Little Palace Hotel, As i checked in quite late in the evening i found the night staff to be very rude When I questioned why i needed to pay on arrival Lester was very quick to tell me he had the right to totally refuse my booking if i had issues paying in advance As i was on my own and it was late I didn t want to risk having no where to stay on a Saturday night in Paris , The location was great and was excellent value for a Saturday night in Paris The staff in the morning were very helpful location game an adaptor plug
178544,Little Palace Hotel, The shower and elevator were too small for comfort , The only friendly staff were the guys working at the cafe Hotel is next to the train station which was a plus 
178545,Little Palace Hotel, The bathroom door was see through we went to the bar for a drink before we went out and was told the bar man has popped out and the two girls on reception couldn t help , The room was modern and clean
178546,Little Palace Hotel, Some of the staff were pleasant and others a little rude Was made to pay for the two night stay on arrival and not on departure as normal Very expensive mini bar 4 50 euro for tiny bottle of water is extortionate , the hotel was clean and in a good position to visit the Louvre Pompidou and Notra Dame

178551,Little Palace Hotel, The room was very small , We liked the decor of the hotel and the staff were very friendly We also loved the views from the hotel room and the comfy bed

178559,Little Palace Hotel, It was inconvenient that no clothing iron was available It is a 4 star hotel and to me a clothing iron is a basic amenity I can understand not having it in every room but not to make it available on request because some guests forget to turn it off is not a very good reason I booked via Booking com and it was not very clear that breakfast was not included in the price The shower was tiny making it difficult to shave in it The shower door leaked the floor was flooded after showering and the floor towel got soaked The walls were thin and we could clearly hear the guests in the adjacent room , I loved the style of the hotel and the location It was super clean and cozy The balcony was nice and the room had a lovely Paris view Quite romantic 
178560,Little Palace Hotel, Nothing The area has a few strange people around but the access to the hotel is safe , With a Subway station a few steps away it s very central The room and bathroom were spacious and well decorated and equipped The staff was friendly and efficient I was given the room I asked for quiet and not too bright the heating in my bathroom was not working and as they couldn t fix it they placed a heater

178566,Little Palace Hotel, The room was in the last floor which made for slanted walls that made the room feel a bit cramped Also there was one very small and slow elevator which made it a bit of a project to get to and from room Shower a bit small , Location was excellent and easy to get to main points of interest for me The bed was comfortable Staff was very nice and helpful Hotel offers airport transfer slightly cheaper than calling a regular Paris taxi

178569,Little Palace Hotel, inaccurate answers to questions poor local advice Eg we were not told we could not buy metro tickets from the nearest station We were also told we had to go to the Eiffel Tower stop to buy tickets for the Bateau bus This is not the case resulted in a 40 minute wait as this is on of the busiest stops , Some staff were friendly helpful Had a small typically French feel to the hotel Much preferred this to staying in a chain 
178570,Little Palace Hotel, No bad experiences Room is the bare absolute minimum in size like every hotel in Paris not a problem , Comfortable room with a fantastic new bathroom Great bed Lovely ambience and a usable Juliet balcony with table chairs looking out over the green leafy in Jul Aug at least park across the road Metro entrance 50 m away Reamur Sebastopol line 4 and line 3 Gare du Nord 3 stops away Gare de l Est 2 stops away or instead we walked 15 minutes which doubled as a people watching experience and a chance to absorb Paris pavements easy for wheeling bags along Similar distances in the opposite direction to get to the Louvre Notre Dame the Seine the Marais or the town hall
178571,Little Palace Hotel, The hotel room is not sound proof We heard baby crying during midnights and early mornign everyday No street view for the suits room we lived No water boilder in each room which is unusual , Location Close to Metro line 4 5 mins of walking distance and Notre Dam 15 mins on foot Very clean
