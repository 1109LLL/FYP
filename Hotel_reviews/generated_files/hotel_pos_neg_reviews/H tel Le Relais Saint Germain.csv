258957,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain,No Negative, The in room breakfast of fresh squeezed orange juice rich coffee fluffy croissants jam yoghurt cheese and butter was a delectable luxury The staff was super accommodating and location perfect The real boon is having a nightly table at their unique restaurant 
258958,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, The lighting in the bathroom was difficult to see your makeup , Very cozy very French in bustling Saint Germain We are already missing our daily breakfast of eggs cheese croissants and fresh squeezed orange juice 
258959,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, We enjoyed an exceptional experience We highly recommend this lovely Paris hotel , The staff was exceptional with service and willingness to provide a very enjoyable experience in this lovely boutique style hotel Fresh flowers were everywhere and rooms were cleaned well throughout our stay Myself my niece and a dear friend thoroughly enjoyed the quality and care provided by this unique hotel located within easy walking distance to the extraordinary museums of Paris many enjoyable nearby restaurants and cafes and the Metro station 
258960,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, None, The property is centrally located to many restaurants and attractions Hotel staffs do speak English and are very friendly and helpful We had visited Paris many times in the past and this hotel is the best one The Le Comptoir du Relais restaurant serves delicious food and it is part of the hotel The hotel receptionist can reserve it for you when you stay at this hotel Otherwise there is a long wait line even at 10 pm 
258961,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, The only complaint I have is the restaurant Even though we communicate well in French when it comes to dining our reading of French isn t the best If they could at least have one or two English menu s so we can better understand what we re ordering Our waiter was the only one during our visit in France whom we encountered who gave a poor and arrogant description of the menu Given the price of the menu items we wanted to know for sure we ordering accordingly In this case I consider his young age The others in the restaurant were very friendly, The neighborhood it s located in The staff was very kind and spoke good English Each room was unique and comfortable While we were there the weather was very warm and our air conditioner initially did not work The staff immediately responded and fixed it We really enjoyed our time there and so did our daughters who had a separate room It s worth taking advantage of getting a reservation at the properties restaurant Only guests at the hotel get to do this 
258962,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, Everything was great , The location was perfect I was a woman traveling alone and felt very safe in the neighborhood Metro stop close by and convenient Lots of great places to eat in the area but the restaurant at the hotel was excellent As a guest at the hotel I was able to make a reservation otherwise there was a long line of diners waiting to get a table The staff was very helpful I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends 
258963,H tel Le Relais Saint Germain, Access to our room was up narrow winding stairs and the elevator only let you off between floors From 8am to 6pm the hotel was remodeling the room next door They were constantly hammering and drilling in our common wall it was terrible But before and after it was a very quiet and pleasant room , Staff was extremely helpful and very nice Room was very comfortable Location was super And the food at the hotel s restaurant was OUT OF THIS WORLD GREAT
