335962,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The only point of remark if i must give one was the fact that they re styled a little bit our room what is beautifull done But the new curtains did not stop the light sun so good as before, Like every year when traveling to Romania we made a stop in this hotel We really like everything about this hotel The rooms are great the food is fine the people are nice
335963,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The tram stop is a long walk from the hotel We actually drove and parked on a street closer to it That made it worthwhile Otherwise a twenty minute walk , They cater to buses so the room we booked was unavailable They upgraded us to a nicer room for the same price Plenty of free parking 
335964,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The metro station is pretty far away you have to walk at least 10 minutes After check in we found a spider on the room ceiling due and some water fluid on the furniture , Very quiet place the hotel is near a golf field No city or car noises Friendly stuff Five minute walk you can find a Hofer store
335965,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, Nothing , Hotel is located near a golf course and is perfect for travelers with car as it is close to major roads Parking is free which is a nice change in Vienna Hotel seems to be new furniture etc was new Staff was very helpful with positive attitude Room was very clean properly furnished Proper lobby reception area Elevators were modern 
335966,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, Don t forget to hang the do not disturb sign on the door if you don t want to be woken up in early morning by cleaning ladies Channels on tv are adapted for a typical businnes guest mostly informational channels Quite far away to the nearest metro station , The best hotel in which me and my husband have occasion to stay it was our 2nd time there The room was excellent wonderful bed a tea set a bathroom full of accessories silence The hotel will be perfect if you re looking for accommodation for a business trip 
335967,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The only issue is localisation Reaching the nearest U Bahn station takes about 15 minutes , Great staff very good facilities Room is clean and tidy Generally for this price in Vienna hotel is simply outstanding Quiet and green neighbourhood 
335968,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The floor looked dirty and used for an hotel supposed to be fancy Same for paint or other Lot of scratches and so on Really far from the city center but the tramway is at a 10min walk Hotel is basically lost in the middle of companies campus Don t hope for a late night walk , Never slept in a hotel bed that comfy Had a really hard time to get up in the morning Room was spacious with a desk a table and 2 chairs A nice view on the nearby business center and the golf practice Bathroom was cool and lot of stuff is provided Minibar in the room and full room service

335971,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, We booked a family room 2 adults and 2 children and we should pay extra breakfast for our 15 year old daughter wtf And for that 15 euro extra the breakfast was very poor Bathroom was quite small only one type of soap Usually a 4 star hotel offers much more Too pricey for that kind of offer Located quite far from the city center so you would travel a lot And Vienna is very crowded if you travel with your car , The only two things I liked was free parking and location near the highway because it didn t take much to exit from the city 
335972,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The air conditioner did not work it was too hot it was just blowing air This is a 4 star hotel and the fact that my room was burning hot is no excuse the staff were too kind they changed my room but still same story I am sure the central system had a problem or was not switched on to cut cost , This hotel has the nicest staff of any I have been to in Vienna The staff of so kind to the point that you feel bad for complaining I would like to thank the front dear people for doing their best to help us

336047,Austria Trend Hotel Bosei Wien, The tramway station to the city center is not very easy to find We strongly recommend to other guests to go by car to the city since the cost for the travel by tram 2 2 euros one way is from far higher than the fuel plus the parking costs in the downtown especially if you are more than 2 people I suggest therefore to the hotel employees to tell this information to other guests We were afraid not to loose the parking place the last available in the moment when we arrived it s annoying to see a lot of free places marked as VIP while for the common people the parking was completely full , Quiet area clean and nice hotel Big rooms well furbished cozy beds Good quality towels and cosmetics in the bathroom Practical place to put the luggage Small fridge in the room Excellent WiFi signal
