470006,The Square Milano Duomo, Nothing , The location was grateful a few minutes to the piazza Duomo and Galleria Vittorio and the famous street Via Montennapoleone and Corso Vittorio Emanuele shopping area also it s near to the two main metro stations only 100 metres missori m3 yellow line and Duomo m1 red line which connect you to the most important areas in Milan such as the main centeral rail station and famous streets and other mertropolitan underground the hotel surrounded with many cafes bar and restaurants 
470007,The Square Milano Duomo, It was a pity there was only one chair in the room this was a double room after all There was only one drawer for clothes in the cabinet and the wardrobe was an open rail with hangers would have liked a door on it The air conditioning was efficient but we found it rather cool and put it off at times Even on the landings beside the lift it was cool , The room was large we were told we had been given an upgrade and the bed too it was very comfy The shower was efficient and the hairdrier was as good as hotel ones in the bathroom ever are The breakfast room was lovely spacious and airy and the staff were attentive and very pleasant The selection at breakfast was amazing and always being replenished so even late comers had the same choice as the early birds The hotel was very near the centre and we could walk to the Duomo in a few minutes Reception were good at getting a taxi for us when required

470013,The Square Milano Duomo, We stayed for 3 nights It was a bit confusing for us on the complimentary bottle water first night there was a bottle of water available second night there was none and third night a free bottle of water was available again The same for the bed side chocolate at evening turn down service we did not get the chocolate on our first night but there were chocolates on second night and then we did not get any on the third night It is small issue though it did not affect our liking of this hotel , The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Duomo and conveniently reachable by Metro Line 3 from Milan Central Station The room is big and the bathroom is very spacious There are many different types of fresh fruits to choose from at breakfast The complimentary sparkling wine was a big hit Really like this hotel clean modern classy and English newspapers various selections are available There is a cosy corner in the room where you can sit and read your newspaper We had travelled in Italy for 2 weeks and stayed in 3 different hotels in 3 different cities This is the only hotel in Italy that did not charge any city tax for my 15 year old son not sure if different city has different policy The front desk staffs were very friendly and polite Will definitely come back

470022,The Square Milano Duomo, A soundproofing in rooms is terrible You will have a wonderful opportunity to hear everything that happens in your neighbor rooms and in a hall I informed personnel that during the last day of staying I would like to have breakfast earlier for 30 min They confirmed that it was possible When I arrived to have a breakfast every waiter repeated that breakfast time started at 7 And they did not help me at all Therefore I still do not know how they obtained 4 starts The hotel is completely overpriced ,No Positive

470030,The Square Milano Duomo, The room design and the facilities are not quite good for the price I was paying i e the air conditioning is controlled by front desk so guests have no control of room temperature , The location is great nearby the cathedral and some good restaurants and other sites are within walking distance All trams go by though didn t take any Great breakfasts 
470031,The Square Milano Duomo, Can t find anything negative to say about The Square Duomo , I was extremely impressed with The Square Milano Duomo I was apprehensive about it but it was so close to the sites I wanted to see and the Missori Metro was just around the corner The Hotel is modern and attractive upon entering I was upgraded to an executive room from a deluxe double It was a fourth floor room and quiet Beautiful very large room and large bathroom The bed and pillows were very comfortable and cushy Surprise to have a Nespresso machine The flooring was a wood laminate which is cleaner than carpeting The breakfast buffet was delightfully yummy with so many choices for everyone s desires plus a nice glassed partial surround view to enjoy it The WiFi was good The reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful with any questions The electric trains and trolleys do pass by the Hotel frequently but that s the ambiance of being in Milan The popular Duomo is a close 5 7 minute walk and The Santa Maria del Grasie is a 22 minute walk using a good map I had a wonderful two night stay and would be pleased to stay here again

470036,The Square Milano Duomo,No Negative, Staff was very helpful from the start gave us an upgraded room very spacious Inside everything was very clean and beautifully arranged The room looked out at the garden but there was no view since the window was on the ground But it was not a problem We loved it Bathroom was just like on the pictures gorgeous Pillows make all the difference for me in the hotel and here they were just perfect not too soft but i was sinking in them Had a Great sleep especially because we were traveling further the next day this was just what I needed I would recommend this hotel to everyone Great location walking distance to major attractions stores and feels very safe around Their rooftop bar and a restaurant is a must to visit too regardless where you stay It has great views and service

470051,The Square Milano Duomo, The staff were not all that welcoming and having travelled for a month in various European hotels where staff go out of their way to welcome you but also seem genuinely interested in making sure you know the area what to see where to eat this one is lacking in that sense So a pretty sterile check in again no dramas but , The location easy walking distance to much of what there is to see in Milan Excellent breakfast 
470052,The Square Milano Duomo, Perhaps the name of the hotel is slightly confusing as the hotel is not in the square close to the Cathedral but about a 5 minutes walk away , Very helpful staff Rooms were clean and spacious Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant which had an excellent ambience and the food was very good We found our room to be quiet and we had a restful stay and would return
