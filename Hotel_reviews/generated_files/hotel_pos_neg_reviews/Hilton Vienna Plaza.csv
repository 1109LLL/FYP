446094,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Not the hotel s fault for construction across the street but it definitely killed what view there was Wouldn t have gotten an upgraded suite had I known May have gone to a different hotel Also when they say cathedral view it s a stretch as seen in the pic below , Breakfast was awesome Location was GREAT for walking around town and seeing the sights 
446095,Hilton Vienna Plaza, No dedicated concierge They were just pulling all the advice from internet and trip advisor which we could do ourselves, Good location in the inner stadt Nice hotel great value for money Would stay again if in Vienna Don t look any further
446096,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I think that nowadays free wifi should be standard Otherwise all aspects of service were very good , The breakfasts were excellent The staff were all very pleasant and helpful 
446097,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Honestly I like everything in the hotel especially the staff They are very kind lovely and friendly I would difintley recommend this nice hotel to my friends , The hotel is very clean and the location is just perfect and close to all city attractions 
446098,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Small room Air conditioning working really well in the lobby but not good in the room heard others complaining Parking 35 Euro s a night extortion , Location is excellent with metro right around the corner Nice bathroom and great shower Very nice breakfast Made us a packed breakfast when we had to leave for the airport early 
446099,Hilton Vienna Plaza, reaction of reception staff about my complain of the air condition problem as we stay 10 nights and 1st 3 nights was good and after that one room keep disconnecting every 2 minutes all night and the 2nd room not cool enough and the worse part that no body care to communicate with me after i complain 2nd issue the house keeping staff not keep the shampoo daily after we use the one in the bath room and i thought will do it next day but didn t i didn t talk to the management because i want to see what kind of HILTON in Vienna as my experience is so good special in London Hilton management should care about the small details as we paid for these small details , restaurant staff
446100,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, We loved this hotel The lobby is large with beautiful floors and decorations the room and bathroom were large and stylish Everything looked new and stylish 
446101,Hilton Vienna Plaza, this was a perfect hotel , The bed was so comfortable The linen pristine the daily bottle of water a nice touch the toiletries lovely quality the towels luxurious and the decor perfect The lighting system perfect and a great choice of TV Channels the balcony lovely but not much of a view really I normally use apts but was bowled over by this hotel Staff were so attentive and the breakfast options were never ending All special requests catered for Good currency exchange rates with no commission charged Hop on Hop off bus stop right at the hotel as well as an underground and tram facility Within walking distance to all main places in District 1 I will be back 
446102,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I didn t like when the staff room service kept opening the room door as soon as they knocked without waiting for a response from the guest who s inside the room I had to put do not disturb sign on the door and lock the door with the key because of this move , Nice clean spacious hotel room and bathroom As expected 
446103,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, The service from the minute we arrived was absolutely fantastic We were upgraded at reception and made to feel really important to the hotel This service continued throughout our stay which is so rare these days 
446104,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Lounge bad not worth it Hilton destroyed their brand loyalty by their cheapness Used to be Hilton Diamond now dont care hotel was just in good location for where my meeting was , All ok standard Hilton lounge not great but that is Hilton
446105,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Everything costs extra and is very expensive even Internet is not included extra room service fees basically everything costs extra We expected a bit more personal treatment especially because it was our honeymoon and we specifically let the hotel know about it Check in process was confusing and unfriendly , Location clean neat and spacious room excellent breakfast buffet good service nice toilets
446106,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Wifi was not for free and costed 10 euros per 24h I don t think a Hilton hotel should make customers pay for the wifi, The bed was very big and comfortable and the staff was very friendly
446107,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel in a great location We used to live in Vienna and were very happy to use this hotel as our home base for a visit to one of our favorite places It is right on the Ringstrasse steps from the heart of the first district and main transportation hub Schottentor The rooms were very comfortable clean and elegant A real treat 
446108,Hilton Vienna Plaza, It would have been nice to have had a swimming pool in the hotel which we would have used most days The gym was adequate and well equipped and the sauna was good shame about the swimming pool , The hotel staff were excellent starting with the reception staff who were very helpful to the staff in the hotel bar and then to the staff in the executive lounge who were extremely engaging and helpful The rooms were very comfortable but because of the location the views were limited We were also opposite a building being renovated and the workman began their day very early This didn t detract from our stay in the hotel though as we spent most of the day out walking around the city It is worthwhile paying a little bit extra to have access to the executive lounge where we could eat our breakfast without any hassle and spend the early evening eating from a good selection of food and drink We did find it a little expensive in the hotel bar so being able to spend time in the executive lounge where all drinks were free of charge helped make our stay an extremely enjoyable experience 
446109,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The quality of the cleaning was not consistent The room was professionally cleaned the first two days and not afterwards to the same standard or degree , The hotel is really a classy establishment comfortable and convenient to both tourists and business travelers I travel a lot and this hotel is one of my favorites It has good sound insulation so you dont have to listen to your neighbors The rooms are large and comfortable The have everything one would need Room service is fast and convenient The staff is generally very nice The hotel has good internet and good gym but more than that it has a high quality overall more than many other smaller or mid price range hotels 
446110,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The stuff were not friendly I wanted to check in one hour earlier than the official check in time They said it cost 70 Euro Unthinkable The type of music which is constantly on everywhere in the hotel is definitely spoiling the elegant atmosphere of the hotel Very unfortunate , The room is very spacious The breakfast offer is super good The location of the hotel is also very good 
446111,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I had breakfast in hotel and few times I cam across with a bit off cantaloupes Everything else were very good , I appreciated a lot on your stuff s service Especially Mr Garbo Krasznai at concierge desk It was my first visit to Vienna and Mr Krasznai helped me so well and I had a wonderful time to see and visit places in Vienna as well as other places Thank you 
446112,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There was some noise coming from another room each evening when they returned to the hotel Ear plugs would have helped , Big comfortable well equipped rooms Friendly and attentive staff Excellent location Would definitely return 
446113,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The housekeeping should be improved from providing all the necessary amenities in time to the dust on the window sill, Excelent room size hotel location and design The hotel is elegant and cosy it s situated very close to all the major attractions in Vienna but still in a quiet area Great food and drinks at Emile restaurant 
446114,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Room cleaning unsatisfactory No complimentary bottled water Hotel wanted to charge 20 Euro to remove items from the minibar so that I could make room for baby food , Good quality wifi Helpful staff
446115,Hilton Vienna Plaza, No any bathrobes and slippers No any hygienic things cotton pads cotton sticks etc Wi Fi cost 25 euro per day Very late with room cleaning , Room size was big Bed also was comfortable 
446116,Hilton Vienna Plaza, For a room that cost 200 euro per night it is crazy to charge 35 euro per day for car parking 10 euro per day for wifi in 2017 there is no free wifi 31 euro for breakfast and in the room there is no rob no shoes 3 pieces of amenities Plus the room temperature was costantly 26 degree i asked twice the reception to solve the problem they reset the system but nothing worked What a rip off , Room was clean
446117,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Free WiFi would have been nice and it would have been good to have a bath in the bathroom , The hotel itself was beautiful room was large and comfortable and there was an excellent choice for breakfast 
446118,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Nothing excellent stay would Highly recommend , Good size room and bathroom Staff we re very friendly and helpful and I even got a birthday cake brought to the room when they noticed it was my birthday on my passport Nice atmosphere in the bar and the new cocktail menu was interesting and different
446119,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Everyone was helpful and nothing didn t like except for free wi fi which seemed to be a bit erratic , Good breakfast selection and friendly staff Room was good although air con a bit noisy 
446120,Hilton Vienna Plaza, WiFi was only free in the lobby not in the room When booking via external websites no free WiFi is included WiFi is included only when you have a Hilton Honors account Luckily personnel was so kind to provide an access code for three days free of charge Too much hassle for a WiFi connection , Very clean and comfortable rooms 
446121,Hilton Vienna Plaza, NO PERSONNEL TO CARRY MY LUGGAGE OR PARK MY CAR JUST 3 GIRLS IN THE RECEPTION WHO I PRESUME WERE ALSO SUPPOSED TO CARRY THE LUGGAGE COLD IN THE PENTHOUSE WITH NO HEATER FUNCTIONING IN AN EXPENSIVE ROOM AT A NEWLY REFURBISHED 5 STARS HOTEL AFTER 2 ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR AN ELECTRIC HEATER AND AN EXTRA BLANKET WERE PROVIDED , LOCATION DESIGNER HOTEL

446123,Hilton Vienna Plaza, STAFF The worst staff ever We have traveled the world Europe Asia America no hotel that we ever came across had such horrible impolite arrogant unhelpful disrespectful and snide commenting staff The front desk animals Linda and Sofi Sophie were the worst making fun of a person who has cancer laughing at us the entire time It is my warm recommendation not to ever go to this hotel as no decor can make up for what the staff will do to your nerves Literally would have paid not to stay there the next time Definitely no value for the money paid Also internet is way overpriced 25 euros for 24 hours Very mediocre choice of food for the room service Also we had requested parking but once we arrived Linda and Sophie informed us that the garage is full and that we should look elsewhere for the parking When we asked if we can park on the street next to the hotel they said it depends on the sign and after we said we did not understand German and that we would need help figuring it out they said this is not a 5 star hotel and we do not have all the streets of this city in our head This is not the behaviour for the street let alone 5 star hotel anyway truly disappointed and enraged really for such a disgusting treatment Will do everything in my power to spread the word of how badly they treat their guests , The cleanliness was ok 
446124,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Internet could be free and staff in reception could be changed Especially Eva who works in reception seems don t like her job when we arrived to do check in she looked at us like what the hell we are doing there unpolite and ect I have never seen so arrogant person Lines for breakfast Need to call and ask for bath suit what i think in 5 stars hotel unusual , Location nice room comfortable bed

446128,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Just saying sorry to have kept you waiting for so long wouldn t have hurt when I had to wait more than 15min to check in I understand that the staff was busy but when I checked in they didn t give me enough of an explanation about the facility and I had to check breakfast time Wi fi service etc myself There was a half opened bottle of water in a fridge which I assume someone left There was no free Wi fi in the room , The room was very clean 
446129,Hilton Vienna Plaza, No free internet connection in the room , Great place to stay in Vienna The room was clean and confortable the staff very nice and the breakfast diner were delicious I recommend this hotel 
446130,Hilton Vienna Plaza, No assistance with luggage or greeting on arrival Reception is not obvious as it is tucked away Concise was not able to assist us at all with our request to locate dance venues or entertainment venues She didn t seem to understand our need Executive lounge always had stale breads and tea cakes were very dry Also when behaviour of some patrons and their kids was unruly and affected both hygiene and other patrons it was not handled at all Kids running backwards and forwards using fingers and hands to collect food pop some in the mouth and proceed to feed directly from the serving dishes , Croissants and breakfast buffet was excellent in main dining area Maitre D waitress older lady was dreadful cranky and rude All other staff were brilliant especially the two Phillipino ladies Nothing was a bother for them Executive lounge it was great for timeout and a snack or two 
446131,Hilton Vienna Plaza, queue for breakfast smelly shower drain they could not fix lack of shelf space in bathroom magnified mirror at waist level hard towels very dull decor dark lighting long wait for lift in mornings, we did not get a change to sample the breakfast as there was a queue of at least 10 people waiting to be seated every morning around 9 we had purchased vouchers on arrival the Hilton refunded us these and apologised We had a nice bed and good room temperature
446132,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Queuing up at breakfast Waiting for the elevator far too long at breakfast time No free wifi available in the rooms Narrow and few parking spaces available in the garage , Nice furnishing clean room No noise coming through walls Friendly staff Close to city center Great variety of breakfast

446135,Hilton Vienna Plaza, They tried to cancel my reservation for 2 nights New year s eve on December 28 offering to cancel for a fee Reason general pre allowance checks on credit cards gave them an unspecified mysterious error my c c was perfectly working with five times as much allowance I called the credit card company who said they even never received a request from them The hotel staff even admitted my card was not at all declined I gave them in any case another card no They then added if they had another problem with my reservation they would have contacted me again directly I was left with the impression I could get to Vienna and not have a room Terrible I m a Hilton customer hhounors since my stay in Singapore or Dubai I don t remember which of the 2 or at another location I ll be again at a Hilton in Dubai soon How can you treat customers like that Never happened in a Hilton , You can get to the center on foot in 5 10 minutes 
446136,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, The staff were exceptional especially Manuel nothing was to much trouble he was thoughtful and professional we have travelled across Europe and he has been by far the most wonderful person we have met 
446137,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Room service to be more mindful and check that the glasses in the room are clean Our cups had lipstick marks on them still when we first arrived And the tissue box was empty ,No Positive
446138,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The restaurant prices were a little on the high side , The room was spacious and comfortable The staff especially the bar were really friendly and helpful
446139,Hilton Vienna Plaza, As a Hilton Honours member because I booked through Booking com I did t get points And they tried to get me to pay for wifi I won t bother with Hilton again The hotel is expensive for what it is and it feels like they want to charge for the air you breathe , A solid business class hotel
446140,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Staff at reception on 2 occasions were rude abrupt elder gentleman at check in appeared to be annoyed that we didn t want the hotel breakfast at 31 euro per person and also showed notable annoyance that we didn t accept the advance charge of 70 euro per night for mini bar incase we wanted to use it and then found the mini bar to be electronically locked once we reached our room No free wifi in rooms , Location was good Within walking distance of main attractions and near transport links Rooms large but as with any large corporate chain rooms are characterless 
446141,Hilton Vienna Plaza, WiFi is available only in lobby We had a significant discount for the breakfast which was very good but otherwise I don t think it s worth paying the normal price of 31E person day , Close to the city center The Metro station is right on the hotel corner Clean Modern Numerous and very helpful staff A 
446142,Hilton Vienna Plaza, We had dinner in the restaurant in the evening and the service was quite slow We had to wait a lot in the beginning but the guy was then very helpful and friendly , Great location helpful staff nice rooms and bathrooms We had two connecting rooms which is very convenient for a family with children 
446143,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, Great location with both train and tram stops just outside of the hotel also Hop on hop off bus It is at the quieter part of The Ring which offers great respite at the end of a long day Overall excellent hotel bed was very comfortable one of the best beds and I ve travelled a lot Hotel staff were fantastic special call out to Kristine and Igniat from Reception I was travelling alone on my birthday and Kristine arranged for a delicious cake for me A magical city in Vienna made all the more wonderful with a stay at the Hilton Vienna Plaza

446146,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There was no heat in our room so they brought in two portable heaters using both blew out the electricity After going to the front desk couldn t call because the phone was out too they came and said we could only use one heater the room was very cold all night and they didn t have extra blankets for us The next morning I took a shower since we were in a handicap room not our choice or required the shower did not have a lip or curb by which the water was contained The shower drain must have been plugged and I flooded not only the bathroom but also a large part of the sleeping room The water flowed under the portable heater of which could have electrocuted me after calling housekeeping they came and vacuumed up the excess water and had me go to another room to dry my hair NO other compensation was offered or allowed when I asked HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,No Positive
446147,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The fact that the room was ready but i should pay extra 50 euros to enter it or i keep waiting till 15pm This was ridiculous and I was about to call the police for this , The stuff are very nice Especially Nadja she is a very helpful receptionist 
446148,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Service for breakfast on Sat and Sun was very good The quality on the Monday morning dropped off considerably more like a Travelodge , Getting an upgrade to an Executive Room The U Bahn being right next to the hotel Nice female staff General high quality of the rooms The different shower head settings 
446149,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There was no hot water for one full day and I had to cancel 2 important appointments I was given a transfer to the other Hilton only on the 2nd day and they refused to give a refund for the 1st day This was most disappointing and I had to waste one whole day for no fault of mine Please make a refund even now ,No Positive

446152,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Limited choices for break fast for executive room A cost of accommodation for unknown person was added to my finAl bill Thanks God I noticed it by accident before payment , Clean Excellent location 
446153,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Nothing, The friendly staff and the non expected upgrade to a royal suite The breakfast is excellent with wide variety of food which will meet all tastes 
446154,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Even though we had booked a room with a balcony on the executive floor we thought it felt cramped , Good locatiin with subway and tram stops vlose by Good breakfast selection happy hour in the executive lounge 
446155,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Breakfast was below average for a five star hotel The service was good but the breakfast location and presentation of food has to be enhanced to play in the 5 star league , Good location
446156,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I had bad experience with them in one night I ordered after midnight from room service one of the staff mentioned to me there is no ordered at this time he asked me to make order from outside Also the charge me deposit for my room 2 times by system mistake , I like Hilton hotel group some staff in the hotel
446157,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Nothing, I really like the helpful of the staffs friendly and kind as well Perfect location near the old city with many shops eateries and attractions Good place to explore the area either by walking or using nearby public transportation 
446158,Hilton Vienna Plaza, U have to pay for room wifi abd the are no complementary water, The rooms were spacious and the single bed was big and very comfortable the shower was supurb
446159,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There really wasn t anything we didn t like, Air conditioning was fabulous lobby and other public areas beautiful Bathrooms in the rooms were very good
446160,Hilton Vienna Plaza, If you offer Executive Floor keep it open At least until Midnight No wifi in room as always you have to register ton of information then wifi doesn t work Then you call reception they tell you to register credit card then they ll refund that tomorrow Wastet 20 minutes getting wifi Just provide wifi code on checkin that works and offer significant compensation if it don t , Good bed Nice room Great breakfast 
446161,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Unfortunately the location was disappointing pretty far from the centre and from the Opera State House but there is a taxi point across the street which made it somewhat fine we arrived to the hotel very early waited for our rooms for seven hours not their fault but it was expected to serve refreshments and coffee while waiting Insurance payment was charged during the check in less than 20 of the total stay it was not expected or stated for in the booking procedures , Extremely clean comfortable and cozy rooms Specious rooms Great room service Easy check in and check out procedures Helpful staff and concierge Really liked the hotel
446162,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The only fault was possibly the breakfast could have been slightly better some of the time when we arrived some of the options had run out and one day we had to use the overflow room on the first floor , The room was excellent very clean spacious Special mention must also go to the reception staff who were really helpful and very pleasant especially the girl who help me with my city tour trip when the bus went without us even though we were waiting in reception she managed to get it sorted and was very efficient many thanks
446163,Hilton Vienna Plaza, room was very hot and when complain about it they moved us to another room but still the other was hot too when we asked the staff about the AC issues the answer wasn t convince as the AC is working cool but since we are from middle east the temperature is different hence the Ac cooling is different than the middle east Strange answer giving the fact that we were on Europe road trip and before Vienna we were in Budapest and didn t face the AC issue , hotel was clean and quite
446164,Hilton Vienna Plaza, No facilities at all I am talking about compliment water in the room air conditioning was not cooling when maintenance staff came they took out the extreamly un cleaned filter showed it to us and told us it was the reason , The staff at the reception were helpful they listen and guided accordingly 
446165,Hilton Vienna Plaza, When I made a reservation I try to up grade to executive lounge I notice they made a mistake in the a mounts of the extra payment which made me to cancel the up grade, The staff are helpful
446166,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The price of 35 Euro per day to park our car I believe was very expensive , The staff were very helpful through out our 3 night stay The breakfast was excellent and a good variety of food available The hop on hop off bus stop is only 50 metres from the hotel 
446167,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The breakfast room was a little cramped when crowded but that is only a minor niggle , Large room large comfortable bed Good breakfast Excellent central location on the Ringstrasse and very close to an underground station 
446168,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, Efficient and friendly staff One of the best buffet breakfasts I have ever experienced The chef even comes out to offer tastings of classic Austrian breakfast delights such as the pancakes with apricot sauce Spacious and comfortable room Beautiful modern art deco lobby and overall hotel design Very good value for moneyu including the room and breakfast rate 
446169,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I d recommend placing and ashtray at the outside seating area , Hilton Vienna Plaza provides comfortable accommodation and a great location within walking distance of historical center for quite reasonable price access to the nearest underground station is literally just around the corner Checking in and out took only couple of minutes and our room was nice clean and fully equipped Breakfast was great with all you would expect from a five star hotel Good coffee is a big plus Part of the deal was an access to the executive lounge which was supposed to offer light snack only however we were also pleasantly surprised with hot soup two cooked meals and abundance of soft drinks and more than fair amount of liquor and wine 
446170,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I always consider the breakfasts in hotels too expensive Also in this Hilton I booked via booking com and therefor the wifi was charged extra in case you book directly at the hotel the wifi is free not so nice ,No Positive
446171,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, The bed was dreamy Best bed we had in our 5 countries vacation across Eastern Europe Executive Level Lounge was perfect for us Penthouse King view was romantic and amazing The location was great for dining and shopping and famous tourist spots 
446172,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Breakfast as we are in Vienna every few months we ve stayed in many different hotels around the city Now we ve been to the other Viennese Hilton in Landstrasse and the breakfast there was simply amazing so we expected the same from this Hilton However the difference is huge no variety very poor selection waiters were confused and not very attentive the signs that indicated the food were mislabeled e g the cottage cheese bowl was labeled cream cheese and the the overall impression was that booking breakfast for an extra charge was a mistake Despite all the pros mentioned in the plus area breakfast is the main reason we will not be returning here However you can book just the room and go eat in one of the many cafes that are in the vicinity of the hotel, Booked a double room with breakfast The room was spacious AC was working 24 7 which was extremely important given that outside the hear stress pushed 35 degrees The shower was huge and very comfortable water pressure was 8 10 The beds were insanely comfortable and soft the cushions as well The room is sufficiently lit and WiFi was stable and fast 
446173,Hilton Vienna Plaza, We didn t have much interaction with the hotel staff but this didn t matter much , This hotel surpassed expectations with its spanky and clean five star room We really enjoyed coming back to the hotel to rest after long days of exploring the city We were welcomed with cherries and chocolate as well which was really sweet Note that despite the hotel not being located in the middle of the main attractions the walk was short and scenic so we enjoyed exploring the city from here everyday 
446174,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Because I used Booking com the Hilton did not offer free wifi in the room Felt like I was discriminated against because we did not book direct with them , Good quality hotel and good front desk staff 
446175,Hilton Vienna Plaza, It s a little expensive given the location , The breakfast was great The room was large and very comfortable The hotel is not in the best location but very well connected by Tram Metro 
446176,Hilton Vienna Plaza, nothing to be added , the location was excellent very clean staff was excellent whenever i asked for any inforamtion everyone did their best to provide me enough info 
446177,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Poorest staff ever seen ignoring my request about honeymoon ignoring Booking com request ignoring my request to have an company invoice and so on No bellboy very rare u can find somebody at executive lounge desk Do not buy breakfast take any package with executive lounge , location 
446178,Hilton Vienna Plaza, I wasn t a great fan of the pillows They were lovely and down filled but could have been a bit more filled I am the pillow queen however so I suspect most people would be very happy with them , The hotel staff were extremely friendly and attentive and were very patient with our lack of German The breakfast was fantastic and plentiful There was a great selection of both hot and cold food so something for everybody We paid a little extra for a bigger room and were happy we did because it meant getting a city view as well The staff were also very accommodating with our one year old son providing us with a cot and a highchair for the room This hotel lives up to its well deserved good reputation and we would stay here again 
446179,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Room was smelly like a mouldy smell of clothes not dried properly Worst was the Asian waitress in the breakfast restaurant made us feel unwelcome and was impolite in speaking to my wife and not serving her just because my wife is Chinese The food in the excecutive lounge was poor and not upto standard , Concierge was very friendly and excellent service as well as the reception staff were polite and nice the attendant in the lounge I think Asian very nice and very helpful 
446180,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There was a bit of a smell in the room Bathroom slippers missing too At check in there was no welcome There was no doorman either so we had to unload bags abnd take them in ourselves , The room was good Classy 
446181,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The kettle kept for tea n coffee in the room did not have a ready plug point near where it was kept and had to be moved around the room for switching on , They were perfect
446182,Hilton Vienna Plaza, In contrast to reception staff our experience with staff in the dining room was mixed On all mornings we had late breakfasts after10am and found it quite annoying that staff in the dining room were on some mornings more focussed on preparing the dining room for lunch time than on our needs despite the fact that breakfast is served until 11am For example some mornings we were offered coffee when we sat down and asked if we would like something specially prepared in the kitchen on other mornings we were ignored 50 50 In our view there is certainly room for improvement Despite this the self service buffet was excellent , Staff on reception very pleasant and extremely helpful We were made to feel very welcome on arrival and throughout our stay Room very quiet and comfortable Excellent breakfasts Central location next to U bahn station with easy access to all the sights of the city and beyond 
446183,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Although the breakfast was good the service wasn t too impressive Had to wait long for coffee and special orders Free wifi only available in the lobby where it worked well no free wifi in the room , I liked the location 1km to city center and convenient to go for a run along the Donaukanal Very high standard rooms and facilities Very good breakfast included 
446184,Hilton Vienna Plaza, If you do not book on Hilton s site even if you are a hilton member you do not get free wifi , Very clean room helpful staff great location near subway stops about a 10 minute walk to the center of the city which is ideal to see more of it 
446185,Hilton Vienna Plaza,No Negative, Room was equal to a very nice US hotel with luxurious bathroom fluffy towels washclothes soaps shampoo etc View of street was nice 5th floor was quiet did not eat in hotel so unsure about food 
446186,Hilton Vienna Plaza, Wifi is not free in the room but we signed up to be Hilton members which entitled us to free wifi during the stay as part of the promotion , Great location as it is in a very clean upmarket estate and about 15mins 20mins walk to the shopping district and attractions The train station is literally just beside the hotel Hotel staff are polite and knowledgeable Rooms are clean spacious new and have all the toiletries appliances needed for a comfortable stay including an iron and kettle Thank you for also upgrading us to the executive room 
446187,Hilton Vienna Plaza, rather stressful breakfast area on the Basement Floor free WiFi access in the whole hotel area not available, large comfortable room with a business desk chair good toiletires well isolated shower tub
446188,Hilton Vienna Plaza, There is definitely something wrong with their payment procedures first at the check in they pre authorised the wrong credit card not the one I gave them to pre authorise but the other one I used during my previous visit then at the check out they charged the right card but then they still charged again the other card with series of charges random the charges went to my card as pending charges , As every time the staff very friendly and helpful the relaxed atmosphere breakfest overall high quality of the place
446189,Hilton Vienna Plaza, We did not have bath robes or toiletries or slippers the hotel don t provide it unless u ask Wifi is not free u have to pay When I asked for an adapter for my laptop I was charged 20 euro if I return it they will take it from the bill There is no porter in the hotel I could go on but think it is enough Never again, The reception staff were friendly

446191,Hilton Vienna Plaza, The diassapointment was breakfast which was not 5 star and what you expected from Hilton Normally the staff in breakfast are not very friendly too the amenities in a room in my case I need to ask for those to bring for me instead that to be available in room such as Slippers bath robe tooth brush package even as we were two in twin rooms surprisingly only one set for shampoo and shower gel for each day , The location nice and clean and comfort room staff at reception and restaurant refurbishment of Hotel complimentary hi speed WI FI for HHonors room service and customer hot line In general it will be surely would be one of my first choices next time

446193,Hilton Vienna Plaza, We arrived after 14 00 and were told that our room was not ready We were not offered any other option but to pay for an upgrade my little son was asleep in my armswhile we were checking in Normally if something like this happens you get an upgrade free of charge right Yet the guy at the reception was very keen to make a sale and was very loud doing his pitch People in the lobby could hear every word and it was rather disturbing The breakfast stuff were great and the bar man one of the nicest people Great breakfast , Location is great overall experience was nice 
446194,Hilton Vienna Plaza, They pre authorise payment on your credit card they block estimated amount of the charge for the whole stay Personally I do not feel comfortable with that and I find it in general awkward in a five star hotel The missing free of charge wifi in the room was a bit irritating , The location and overall quality of the hotel And the staff was great they were very nice and professional and in particular at the breakfast And the breakfast itself very good
