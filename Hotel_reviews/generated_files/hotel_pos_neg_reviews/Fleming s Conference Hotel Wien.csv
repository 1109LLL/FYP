384545,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, No complaints , Really excellent place to stay for access to public transport to and from Vienna city centre Let me explain We did some research at home before we went on this vacation This resulted in us choosing to park our car at a P R location close to a public transport terminus for the duration of our stay in Vienna i e Ottakring P R From there it s very easy to travel to the hotel of our choice i e Fleming s Hotel Wien Westbahnhof and the city centre by U bahn Line U3 Turned out to be an excellent choice The public transport system in Vienna is really excellent underground trams busses We bought a Vienna City Card valid for 24 48 or 72 hours and this gives you access to all public transport in the city for a modest fee It also gives you nice reductions on entry fees for a large number of tourist attractions and major sights in city Look it up on the web we certainly recommend it as a great way to have a good time in The city of Music or The city of Dreams Oh I nearly forgot Fleming s is a very comfortable hotel good value for money too Breakfast is Tops 
384546,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Although being central the hotel is located in not a very friendly area Some sex clubs located in the same street not far away Some of the staff was unfriendly , The hotel is located close to public transportation 
384547,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Restaurant was good but would have liked some fresh vegetables on the menu , Breakfast was great rooms perfect for our short stay Loved the glass shower All very clean and staff very helpful We would definitely stay there again 
384548,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Some rooms don t have a curtain between shower and bed room Some like it some dont , Nice staff great location and access to pulic transport 
384549,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, the bath too bad glass only not practical , Very good hotel apples everywhere beside the walking street near to the metro train station location is perfect
384550,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, One of the waiters in the restaurant in the evenings seemed deliberately slow ignoring me and spending time instead sorting receipts and paperwork Although there were very few customers I had to make an effort to gain his attention He was curt and did not seem to be enjoying his work , Convenient location for public transport Well trained efficient polite staff Comfortable room Good shower Nice food and good beer in restaurant Very good choice at breakfast used dishes cleared away and tables reset quickly buffet replenished promptly 
384551,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Make sure you are willing to share a room which has a visible shower , Amazing breakfast Great location next to Westbanhof station where you can find many services Tickets can be purchased from the station It is recommended that you purchase a ticket for 5 week day 16 20euros which includes all services underground tram buses and probably city trains Very friendly personnel Interesting decoration make sure you visit this hotel with someone you feel comfortable looking at you while having a shower or make sure you request a room which has a curtain in front 
384552,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Staff at the reception wasn t too polite air conditioning ventilation system was old a noisy , Location is fairly good near to the metro station Good selection for the breakfast
384553,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I don t know why European hotels think it is OK to put two single beds together as if you are a couple when you have booked a room for two singles Didn t work for my friend and I so we separated them with some difficulty shifting around furniture A nuisance I have seen repeated again and again , High standard dining room and food Beds were comfortable and room clean and quiet
384554,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The shower is in the middle of the room and it is transparent so it is not a good idea to reserve the room if traveling with a business colleague , The hotel looks very new and most importantly for me it is very clean The location is good It is close to the train tram station and very close to the shopping street 
384555,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The cleaning sometimes is not working well mainly in the apartment area and the minibar had just some items inside , Amazing hotel with almost all the possible services 
384556,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, We stayed here 3 years ago and we can easily say the rooms furniture and carpets and hallways need to be updated We have come back to this hotel for the excellent services esp breakfast quality and diversity so we can have an objective opinion on the need to maybe refurbish and replace carpets We stayed in a quiet room and everything was perfect until our last night when from a building across the hotel the inside atrium our peace was disturbed by a three hour long very loud and noisy gathering If this situation repeats the hotel should contact the neighbours , Excellent breakfast and very good location Staff was nice and helpful we even received an upgraded room and early check in as we requested 
384557,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, staff at the reception very unprofessional made us walk to three different rooms until she finally managed to give us right room we had suitcases and the rooms were not close at all the issue was that she kept giving us room with separate beds afterwords didnt even excuse herself I suppose that small attention like free drink at the bar would perfectly solve that instead they were more like well we just made mistake what the problem , very friendly staff from restaurant great breakfast offer clean and stylish room very unique design
384558,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Very efficient breakfast room staff but it would have been more pleasant to see them smiley and friendly and have a small talk , A very clean hotel and our room was lovely with everything we needed We also apprecited the signature of the hotel 3 welcome apples and little bags of apple jellies on our pillows A really lush breakfast with plenty of choice for every kind of guest Quite healthy as well Really nice and smiley reseption staff which made our stay even more pleasant Huge thanks to the efficient cleaners Everything was cleaned thoroughly on an everyday basis 
384559,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The location is strategic close to mass transports but the area is not the best possible This is the only minus could find The offer price of 62 eu was very reasonable but for 80 there are more centerized hotels , The stuff was very pleasant and helpful The breakfast was very good and generally the hotel was very good The fancy bathroom is good for one person in the room I don t know how it works for two bed rooms 
384560,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Nothing it was a great stay , This hotel was a pleasant surprise even after checking out all previous feedback The room was nicely appointed with a shower that was situated in the middle of the room which was fun There were also different lighting choices for the room which again was fun The hotel itself was very very tasteful with classy decor in both the room and common spaces especially for the price I didn t realize that breakfast was included when I booked but was very happy it was because that was the best hotel breakfast we ve had in ages with lots of friendly waitstaff on hand to ensure a great start to the morning All in all we d stay here again 
384561,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, In spite of fact that I have made prepayment the staff charged the same amount from my card by mistake Each day they promised me to cancel the blockage but during four days they did not nothing The worst think is that they do the same during all the seven times I m staying in that hotel ,No Positive
384562,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, 1 Unfortunately there is just one warm offer at breakfast sausages and scrambled eggs only although the same class hotels in Vienna offer a much larger selection 2 Keep in mind that for families with children or unfamiliar people it is better to avoid such an offer since glass cabin are without curtain although it is in the photo Anyway it seems not very convenient My room wasn t supplied with teapot and related items tea coffee 3 Apples in the hotel were the most tasteless In addition at second and following days apples were haven t served any more In sauna it all were completely rotten although after my remarks it were replaced 4 Turkish sauna is completely useless it does not work as it should slippers are not available so you need to bring your own so not to walk barefoot In general it is nothing to do for more than half an hour in sauna You can stand under a power shower but huge pools are forming on the floor then so you may feel ashamed with other guests , I was searching for a hotel with adequate offer including booking discount with a sauna and a good breakfast Good location close to metro Westbahnhof If you do not want to travel from the airport by several subway lines that is a direct bus Approx about 0 5 hours whatever you choose bus or train metro Although it is necessary to take the evening rush hour into account since bus goes round the Cityhall in the center and stops frequently The staff at the reception is friendly Breakfast is acceptable BUT 1 Room size is specified with a shower square so suitable for a single person Two are already to be a bit crowded because of angles Interesting solution with a shower at the center of a room It wasn t good or bad for me BUT 2 This hotel as many others in Vienna offers apples in rooms and other places BUT 3 Sauna is in the hotel it s size is sufficient for 4 persons BUT 4 
384563,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, No coffee set in the room The computer for guests in the lobby is full of viruses Don t plug your USB in it No smoking area inside of the hotel , Very good breakfast Fresh apples for guests

384565,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The area is not one of the pot in Wien but is very good in relation to proximity to metro , Location next to metro station that can get you easily to stephansdom rathaus but also to schonbrunn palace
384566,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Not altogether convinced by layout and user friendliness of room No cover on bed for unpacking of suitcase Turning light off at night turned of all power sockets eg for charging phone, First class breakfast Location convenient for travel and shopping at Westbahnhof Helpful desk staff
384567,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The lighting in the sink area is extremely dark impossible to put makeup on Not a lot of room to store toiletries only a small space on either side of the sink , Excellent location near subway station Great breakfasts Cool Shower in the middle of the room 
384568,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I honestly cannot think of anything that I disliked , The friendliness and cooperation of the staff The cleaniless of the hotel and its central location in the city As I had booked to stay in your hotel earlier in the year the financial cost to me was very reasonable 
384569,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, it would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room , the people at the restaurant were extremely nice and remembered what we needed before we asked for ir
384570,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The room was having smell of chlorine and I am allergic So it was misery from the time I enter my room Also the door was broken so we had difficulties of getting in , I like the location It s closed to everything The breakfast is excellent 
384571,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The lady at the reception was awful She was trying hard to make me feel dumb and lost She is definitely not a proper person for this job Having a shower in the middle of the room was exciting but somewhat troublesome , Nice location Good value for money Interesting lights in the room Clean Have their own parking although we did not use it 
384572,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Nothing, 1 Great location just 5 minutes walk from Westbanhoff from where you can go anywhere in Vienna by subway 2 Very helpful staff 3 Excellent rooms Spacious comfortable bed and good facilities 
384573,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Daily service of the room was POOR Towels were changed but no dusting or vacuuming occurred, Hotel is close to rail station and has a bright interior 
384574,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I suggest a handle on the wall in the shower the stone floor get s slippery , Clean and nice modern Design room with shower in the room with ventilation that works Very helpful staff If you are up for a walk it s doable to walk to the museum quarters and the old town and back 
384575,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The neighbourhood is kind of shady near striptease bars etc The staff isn t always very friendly or helpful , Although the neighbourhood isn t all that the location is great due to the nearby westbahnhof The rooms are big and spacious 
384576,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The door security for the front entry got tedious after awhile but I understand they must have had to use the ring in function for safety purposes , Good breakfast and location Very comfortable beds 
384577,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Stayed in this hotel 27 to 28 Aug with a group of friends Booking com or Hotel froze an amount of money at card which is still not available even several days after leaving it That amount could not even possible to use to pay rooms Finally payed by cash Bad experience ,No Positive
384578,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, staff could have been more polite at breakfast and at arrival when we asked to change the room we were given which was supposed to be non smoking and have a curtain to hide the transparent shower we finally got the room we actually paid for , breakfast variety and proximity to trams and to the westbanhof metro station where we could also find mini markets and food good value for money 
384579,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The area location is a little bit run down Quite a few sex shops and adult bars close by It s 3 minutes walk to the metro but there was quite a few vagrants hanging around However we never felt threatened and would stay there again,No Positive
384580,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The fridge was out of order and the staff came to set it to max But it didn t work and we couldn t keep the water cold I wish there were an electric kettle for hot tea , Good breakfast 
384581,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Everything was there but the drinks in fridge were expensive If you have an eye for detail then you will find some things with cracks and dirt but they are not apparent ,No Positive
384582,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Need to walk 20 minutes to the attractions like the museums or take a trainride , The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the westbahnhof Staff s helpful and friendly The room is quite comfy and sound proof and there s a gym room in the basement 
384583,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The shower is in the middle of the room and that is a little weird A bit far from the center but 5 min away from the metro station, Excelent breakfast nice comfortable and clean rooms 
384584,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, Breakfast was delicious with a large choice of food A very good location subway railway station tramway very close If you re going on the concert in Wienner Stadhalle is this hotel the best decision very close less than 5min 
384585,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The staff was cold and when asked about parking said that the hotel s about 20 day is full and my only option was the next hotel Didn t mention though asked that there usa a park and ride facility close with 3 40 24h and despite the free WiFi policy they have a rule printed that if you want to connect a second devise you need to upgrade to business package with 15 day she informed us about this charge when asked and I was ready to call booking but their system allows second connection without charge following the policy So the whole thing is at least misleading , The cleanest hotel I ve ever seen The room was big enough and the bed was very comfortable The shower innovation and the lighting with the changing colour behind the bed depending on our preference was very pleasant The location though not very close to the historical center is good and very close to the metro station 
384586,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, It was further from the old town than I expected , For the cost the hotel was excellent The staff do need a bit more training on what is around and how to book guests into tours etc They did it but it took a long time and a few people to do it 
384587,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I ordered iron to the room and it took 40 min to bring it I called 2 times to reception and girl in reception said yes it will come right away I didn t appreciate this I could easily go down and bring it by myself if I knew it takes so long , Breakfast was very rich Idea of shower in the rooms is nice however water leaked to the room We spent two nights and it was lovely stay 
384588,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The bar and restaurant manager needs to understand customer needs Why close at 10 pm when guests ars returning from shows , This is an OK hotel recommended to me as being good value Reception staff were excellent Breakfast was not flexible if you only wanted toast an coffee 
384589,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Staff could be more friendly particularly front desk My room was only made up twice during a 6 day stay Proximity to sex workers was a concern, Close to team and train station Great breakfast

384591,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, food is too expensive but you have many other options nearby, very clean the bathroom is really nice in the rooms staff are really friendly and the room is very comfortable close to trams that take you into the centre
384592,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I think the AC is not well set up there was no ideal room temperature The towels did not have the quality what I would have expected , We were very happy about the room itself The premises of the hotel were clean and well maintained The main street was quite load however our rooms were situated to the inner garden 
384593,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, We didn t take the breakfast since we consider it quite expensive , Very comfy bedding Very good location considering the two tram and subway nodes between which the hotel is located but not convenient as walking distance between the Old City and the hotel 
384594,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, At first I was placed in a room on the third floor which used to be the smoking floor It still smelled of smoke But the friendly staff got me another room that was fine , Good service 
384595,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Expensive on site parking Noise from the street Hotel staff was opening the room with their key while we were inside, Very good breakfast Close to U bahn and city center Free parking on streets nearby on weekend They gave me a room at about noon
384596,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, No kettle in room for hot water to cook for tea drinking not convenient for Chinese to fetch hot water from restraurant at 1st floor , Location is good to Walk around on foot
384597,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, there wasn t slippers in rooms Its not hygienic to step on carpets because after shower need to walk on carpets even enter toilet without slippers I guess management should consider this slippers idea , clean friendly staff modern building and godd location
384598,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, There were Plastic covers on the beds We had to remove the covers before sleeping Horrible By livin apart is no doorbell to contact the reception Terrible If the doorkey doesn t work you had to walk the block , The Upgraded room 
384599,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, the trash bin was not empty when I first arrived in the room and the cleaning lady was not even apologetic about it the breakfast was almost the same each day but the food and drinks were good the restaurant was quite pricey few doors down was a club with go go dancers and across the street was a sex shop drunk people loitered in the nearby train station , breakfast was good location was convenient reception and restaurant staff were nice and friendly walking distance from shopping street Mariahilfer room is cozy and clean 
384600,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Some of the staff were grim and unhelpful , We stayed here because it is beside the railway station It is functional and fairly basic but reasonably priced 
384601,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Most of the staff is but not all the staff is up to standard with regards to behaviour friendliness It also depends on who you speak how good their English is but that is acceptable , Spectacular value for money with a great room and nice facilities The location is also excellent close to Westbahnhof with all its connections to get you everywhere Altogether a great hotel 
384602,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, I have to ask receptionist to change old cover of my bed No door in the bathroom so its mirror pointing toward bed often wakes me up all the time at night , Stunning breakfast Room is very clean and large Bed is comfortable Clean bathroom and toilet Staff is helpful 
384603,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The truth is that the region around westbahnof station looks unsafe late at night , The room was very comfortable and clean It was functional and designed in a modern way too 
384604,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Nothing all is perfect, Staff are very helpful and always smiling hotel is in a great location near the train station Very clean and design of rooms is simple and eye catching
384605,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Pillows are really bad I read another review on this but tought that was not important But it is They are really bad Staff was not always Gentle At the reception they could not provide us some basic information sometimes how to go to a place Also the first hotel that we ask for iron and iron board and we have to carry ourselves The paper block when we arrived was on end just 2 paper and was never put again Too much noisy in the morning cleaning staff , Location close to Banhof around a quarter walking The waitress at the restaurant was really gentle 
384606,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, We had top floor room with great view but because it was next to the street which had quite lot traffic it was a little bit too noisy and we couldn t sleep without ear plugs , Excellent breakfast and nice staff 
384607,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, There are sleeping issues which is unfortunate for a hotel The pillow was too thin but wide enough to double fold it and then it turned out fine The mattress is completely covered with some plastic cover which is a sin as this prevents nightly sweating to be taken care of A plastic protection cover is fine but then let guests sleep on a thick molton sheet below the normal linen sheet I wrapped myself in the duvet by this one too double folding it It was wide enough for a single sleeper to do this but two people would have had a problem By the way the duvet did not fully cover the mattress so even without the sweating issue two people would have had a problem covering themselves unless house keeping provides an additional one Two minor points the room s key card did not always function immediately When removing the card from the holder the lights went out immediately a time delay of a few seconds would not leave the guest in complete darkness while still in the room I was glad to have been able to cope with the sleeping issues as I did not want to prematurely leave this otherwise excellent hotel , The hotel is a relatively new one with modern stylish looks Good location for public transport but not in an upmarket neighbourhood Extremely welcoming reception departure was a bit detached though Comfort room single use of queen bed room very pleasant and clean with adequate amenities although no in room coffee or tea making facilities An unusual open bathroom setting with a glass shower cabin I suspect only acceptible by partners or very good friends but I rather liked it Private toilet though The shower is excellent Good wifi too The second building is connected to the first one and much quieter by the lack of traffic noise There is an in house connection as if they were just one building So no crossing of an open court with smoking men as a few older reviews mentioned Excellent breakfast I tried the restaurant once it served decent quality food In fact everything is good or excellent except for a few unfortunate sleeping issues 
384608,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, Exemplary staff Husband had a heart attack the evening he checked in Staff have been more than caring Feel like I m not alone coping with this in a strange city 
384609,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The room setup is not recommended for family with kids as the bathroom is fully open and not convenient i was planning to cancel the rest of my booking and move to another hotel but they didn t agree and they said they will charge me the full amount of the booking even if i cancel which was not acceptable and caused lots of inconvenience no facility in the room other than the basic, Cleanliness
384610,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Extremely uncomfortable matress and pillow Also had to wait till 2 pm to have my room ready which is the actual check in time but it is not what you want to hear after a long trip , Nice facilities and friendly staff Loved the shower in the room Very well connected to the old city center Restaurant downstairs was good althought did not try the breakfast which seems delicious according to other reviews 
384611,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, More pillows please , Location is great close to metro Good confort our room was quite quiet Little bit strange with the shower in the middle of the room but interesting concept We didn t get the breakfast cause at 16 euro per person seemed too expensive 
384612,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, We checked in one day later than expected Despite we informed the hotel they decided to charge the room anyway for the missing night I m travelling many days every year and I never received the same treatment in othr hotels This is very poor and not professional Breakfast is too expensive for what is offering , Hotel is clean 
384613,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The house keep make to much noise when doing it and we put do not disturb on the door but somebody call to check and it disturb , Amazing friendly and comfortable 
384614,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, i did order a better category of room the bill was like that but nobody explane what is more included in this service also the room was not look like in the announcement description i booked smaller poor i am disappointed , breakfast
384615,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The only thing we did not appreciate was that every morning someone would just come into the room after knocking only once to check if we needed anything from the minibar I mean we could have been showering or getting dressed and we would have not been able to cover up let alone tell them not to come in We then realized that in order to prevent this we should have put the DO NOT DISTURB sign outside the door I still think a great hotel such as this one should review this practice , Everything even though we did not have breakfast there so would not be able to advice on how good it is Position and staff are excellent and the hotel is new and very comfortable I would stay there again 
384616,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The day a big business group were staying one male staff member in dining room was very curt to other guests Other days were fine , Location close to bus and underground easy to get to other places
384617,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, They take money from ur credit card like a guaranty for the minibar 50 eur a ridiculous amount for what they have in it but they forgot to give you back the money back on ur card I felt like scamed And the attitude of the staff from the reception its horrible ,No Positive
384618,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Bed very uncomfortable Mattress and pillows very soft we actually needed to ask for extra pillows and yet we couldn t sleep well Most of the towels were waffle weave instead of the normal terry cloth and we felt like we were using cleaning surface towels Located in a busy avenue in a not so upgraded neighborhood , The breakfast was very good in terms of quality with fresh juice and lots of local products Staff was generally helpful Common areas very good if you want to relax have a drink etc The location is very good metro at 5 mins going directly to the city center tram station at 150 metres 
384619,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, While close to the train station and easy to find not in the greatest section of town , Staff very friendly and helpful in giving directions Good breakfasts Comfortable bed 
384620,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, People in the sauna did not have any towels on them they just sat naked I understand that is the norm for some cultures But in my opinion if you are an international hotel you should ask visitors to cover their private parts so that everyone could use the facility , Nice clean place with great interior design and food 
384621,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Is not coffe maker facilities, Hotel is closed from metro station Wesbahnhof U3 and gare easy to go at city center tram 18 go direkt Schonbrun Palace very clean and confortable 
384622,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Glass shower in the middle of the room only for couples Some moisture in room , Close to U3 metro station Quite good breakfast Comfortable beds spacy rooms 
384623,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Rather far away from the city center by foot However the underground gets you into town in 3 stops , Staff are friendly great breakfast variety
384624,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, No free drinking water no tea or coffee bag no coffe maker Room rate can be cheap or non cheap When room rate is low be careful it is without breakfast So when you add two breakfast you pay 16Euro X2 32 Euro and they encourge you to buy business package so you can have water free from freezer So friendly speaking this is not really a good choice When I asked late check out they offer 1 pm But I remember a booking com VIP can have better offer They said NO , Wifi OK
384625,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, One of the best breakfasts I ve ever had in 4 stars hotels The room and the facilities are very clean We even got some small presents waiting for us when we checked in very nice 
384626,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Take your own slippers if you want to enjoy the sauna because they were out , Great location and the best breakfast I have had in a hotel I can also highly recommend having a night of dinner in the restaurant at night because they serve good and tasty dishes The location is great with one of the biggest shopping streets practically right around the corner The room was very clean pretty and comfortable They also have a pillow menu for when the current pillow isn t comfortable enough for you 
384627,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The only bad thing is that our room smelled a bit but nothing special , Breakfast location staff are great Hotel is very modern looking nice and quiet 
384628,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Location is fair but you will have some dinning options until late street food Bar tender on duty Dec 18th evening was extremely rude , Room size is not bad for European standards But You need to know that the shower is FULLY exposed through glass to the room You may have no problem about it if you are solo traveler or in other situations but just important piece of info in some case The location is not actually in the city center It is few stations by under ground from westbahnhof which is few minutes walk The surrounding of the location is fair The frond desk staff were nice but one of the bar tenders was very rude was onduty on the evening of Dec 18th 
384629,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The door card locks are tricky to operate You need to get the exact speed and pressure when swyping otherwise the door won t open And the apartments are in a separate building When we after 10 repeated efforts couldn t unlock the we went to reception to ask for help The receptionist I believe named Mr Lakatos or similar was extremely annoyed and rude and barely agreed to accompany us to unlock the room This is not how the guests should be treated , The apartment was clean and spacious 
384630,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Our room and the gym had a bad smell probably a once off and there s no flexibility with the check in time so don t arrive before 3pm , Modern fitout with lots of space in the room The apples and lollies were a nice touch Also very close to Westbahnhof station and only a few minutes walk to a pedestrian mall that leads into town The wifi connection was good 
384631,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Extremely indecorous behaviour from the Hotel to block 2 3 of the payment that had been already made at the check in and none of the stuff informed me of this Also at the reception told me that the amoun would be released till the end of the day of checking out but this was totally false ,No Positive
384632,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, There was full in their garage so I had to park in the Hotel next to Flemming I ended up paying almost 40 Euros more just for the parking The surrounding of the hotel is full of strip bars and etc not ideal for a weekend with a wife , The hotel is clean rooms are beautiful breakfast is excellent and the location is very convenient 
384633,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The main ventilation could not be turned off although we called reception twice we were assured that this will turn automatically during the night which never happened , I have stayed here couple of times and I really like the place This time we were upgraded to suit which was very nice I love breakfast in Flemings it is always excellent 
384634,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Room are available from 3 pm and should be left by 12 pm I stated in my booking reservation that I need early check in but the room was not ready and I arrived at 6 am The gave me smoking room ,No Positive
384635,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, Althoug there are plenty of guests the hotel is clean cosy and the staff is really helpful Location is good either with car or with public transport 
384636,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, No refrigerator Sauna very dark to get there I can t go alone TT, Near Vienna west station just 5 min by walk If you stay not so long it s best location you can get on airport bus in front of west station Breakfast was good Clean and unique hotel especially open bathroom 
384637,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Free wifi is given just for one device person for each room We had to pay for the second device person It s a strange policy , The superb location 
384638,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The receptionist seemed to have a bad day From my side I felt a arrogant and superior attitude towards me which is the worst feeling as you just arrive and it is late a receptionist cannot have this attitude The first impression was lost Wednesday late evening at around 10pm I was put in a room which is usually for disabled people so the washroom looks unfamiliar The room was clean and actually quite nice Of course it would have been great to be in a regular room At least the receptionist could have mentally prepared me for that but he also failed on that point Its a irrational point that I am making here but this stuff counts when dealing with customers Things like that add up if the first moment was lost , The hotel is clean Upon arrival you feel good as the facility is nicely decorated and gives you that good feel of a well organised hotel The breakfast buffet is outstanding I loved it 
384639,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Nothing Everything was perfect , We were returning guests and the hotel is still one of our favourites We loved the glass walled shower in the middle of the room The breakfast was also perfect as before 
384640,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Avoid getting upgraded to the apartments at the back of the hotel unless you like going up and down half flights of stairs across a courtyard occupied by smokers through several secured doors gates and up to the apartments via a grubby lobby , Good breakfast Room ok although a bit small if you re in the main hotel
384641,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The comfort of the bed is not very good I believe this needs to be checked and would be worse for future investments , Hotel is modern stylish with a good breakfast 
384642,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The shower was placed right in the middle of the room which turned out not as well as we might thought Housekeeping had not changed any towels till we asked for that leaving the note No bed sheets were changed during 5 days stay The reception staff was ok but not really helpful , The hotel in general is pretty comfy breakfast is tasty and rich and the location is very convenient 
384643,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, The hotel is close to the Main Train Station and we were able to walk It is also near the underground train station Breakfast was included and was very nice The staff were really helpful and very efficient The main part of the city is a distance away but was easily accessible by the underground 
384644,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The wine list is pretty limited and no half bottles at all When traveling alone the only choice is wine by the glass Having photocopies made was quite time consuming , Kind and rapid reception upon arrival Clean and quiet modern room and an excellent breakfast buffet 
384645,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, location it s very close to the WestBahnof station room is very nice and the glass doors shower is a nice touch restaurant bar and the buffet are great
384646,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The daily cleaning staff needs to come up to the standard of the hotel , The perfect location to the shopping precinct and the train station You can walk to the centre from here or catch a 49 tram Discover the area like we did The buffet breakfast is diverse in courses and tremendous value if included in your tariff 
384647,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, We were so called upgraded to an apartment We wanted to be in the hotel itself for ease and tv in bed etc We do not value having cooking facilities etc or we would have booked an apartment Air con is not cold enough for us Bed was a bit too hard Mainly the location is a little bit too far away from main tourist sights About 30 mins walk to be more central , Clean modern room WiFi High class look Adjoining restaurant Room service 
384648,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Several problems with the room we had to ask for a safe which they provided Fridge didn t work and couldnt be fixed during our 3 night stay No hot water in the morning which again couldn t be fixed during our stay Very thin pillows when we asked for 2 more we were asked to collect them at reception late at night , Gym facilites good and free room upgrade was good Quiet room considering we faced the main road 
384649,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Parking not available in hotel We had to park car in next hotel where it was expensive Not any cushion option , Clean spacious rooms very good connectivity to city center and other spots Friendly staff 
384650,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Only thing I can say is that the fitness room was without power for two full days sort of cut into my workouts , Nice staff Room was large clean and well furnished 
384651,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The breakfast is not included in the price The reception staff was not very courteous , Its about 200 mtrs from the Wien westbahnhof railway station The room was clean and neat It has transparent bathing enclosure inside the room which is interesting

384653,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien,No Negative, Really cheerful and helpful stuff My ac stopped working and the technician will come in the morning so i called the reception they offered me another room to sleep in and agreed to leave my stuff in my old room because it was night and i had children I really appreciate it The breakfast was lovely and full of variety 
384654,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The idea of a shower in the middle of the room is very interesting but unfortunately engineering not so good After 5 minutes in the shower it started leaking all over the floor , Good location free apples and water at reception desk when outside are 38 degrees Celsius it sure helps a lot Billa store very close by 
384655,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The layout of the room is a bit quirky you may like it or not The shower cubicle is transparent and is outside the toilet so your roommate will see you while you shower may be a problem for someone travelling with a friend in a twin room for example I tried the restaurant for lunch and I have to say the food was a bit disappointing although service was good , Well located not in the centre but a short walk away from Westbanhof underground station also great if you are arriving leaving Vienna by train and there is also a tram stop to go to the centre very quickly Breakfast is nice and there is good choice Free wifi is ok for browising and emailing 
384656,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, For 80 euros I gave was perfect The actual prices that the hotel advertises for one night were more than 500 euro per night It sounds like a joke for a hotel like this I called for an extra pillow during the night and the receptionist was alone so I went down to the reception to get the pillow If I paid the original price i would get very mad , Nice room
384657,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, The room could be cooled There is ac working properly when key is in the plug but till air is cooled room is hot Too soft mattress Even if you like to save environment used towels hanging on hangers were changed , Very good location charm and helpful staff excellent breakfast nice furnished room quiet room back windows 
384658,Fleming s Conference Hotel Wien, Hotel location on a very busy main road with sex shops close by The pillows were way too soft and although the room was very nice I m not sure about the shower being next to the bed and open to view fine if you re travelling alone but not if you are travelling with another person no privacy I would also have liked to see more English style breakfast items I e Bacon grilled tomatoes etc, The staff were very helpful and obliging room very clean
