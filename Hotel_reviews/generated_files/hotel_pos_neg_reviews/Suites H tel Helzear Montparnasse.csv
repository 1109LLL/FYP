180459,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Reserved 1 room w 1 br and mini kitchen for 4 people At first they gave me a room with 1 br but the bedroom is so tiny with no window it s like a prison No aircon with only 1 small fan I asked to move to a room I am supposed to have based on what I prepaid The following night they moved me upstairs to a room with air con and w windows but no bedroom it s just a devider between the bed and the mini kitchen with a sofa bed Shower head was broken water sprayed all over very small bathroom I told the lady named Cecilia about the broken shower head but no one came to fix it there s ants also in the room stayed 5 nights total I prepaid the hotel with all taxes included Upon checked out front desk staff was giving me a bill but I mentioned I already pre paid seems like they don t communicate with their corporate or whoever is doing bills He asked me to pay a tax about 68 euros or something I said it s included with all that I paid 3 months ago when I did my reservations but he said it s city tax etc I just paid that way I can get out of there I m just glad he didn t pushed me to pay the whole stay of 5 nights again , Wifi great William the desk staff were very nice 
180460,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, This place was a disappointment The space is tiny and the floor was very dirty They need to deep clean the floors When my family arrived the toilet was broken throughout our stay They had people coming to fix it but it never worked Even with the toilet not working they did not discount me anything The staff there told me that I will receive a receipt at 2pm the same day through my email but I have never received any receipt When I came home I checked my credit card and it turns out they charged me 4 extra transactions a few days after I have already arrived home When I contacted them regarding the receipt and the extra transactions they took more than a day to reply and told me that they discounted me for the toilet by charging me less city tax and there was no mention of extra charges This didn t make sense because they charged me for the hotel and city tax separately The city tax was paid in full so overall it ended up costing me more than what I originally booked on here I tried to contact them again because I do not understand why they are charging me even after my stay when I did not touch any of there stuff And its not even small charges They were about 300 euros for each charge Are you kidding me They still haven t reply about it so I had to call my bank to deal with this matter I am very unhappy with this place and would not reccommend anyone to stay here This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Please take my advice and save yourself the trouble , The bathroom was clean 
180461,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The smell was so bad It was terrible to me Maybe it was because my room is in the first floor Everyday they clean the room but it wasn t perfect We could see some dust It takes 20 30 minutes to the center by 8 minutes walking and metro , I stayed with my two children A wide bed and the other sofa bed were enough for three people It has a garden with a table and chairs we had a good time there at night Water pressure in the shower room was strong 
180462,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Unfortunately we did not have warm water during our stay despite the effort of the staff to prevent this , We ve had a warm welcome by Wills the receptionist Check I was efficient and he was able to give us an early check in 
180463,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The room had a musty stale smell One of the sofa beds was broken Carpets were stained Using the toilet was difficult since it was too close to the wall , The staff at reception could not have been more helpful so polite so friendly and very pleasant Not something one experiences too frequently in Paris All three beds were very comfortable 
180464,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Advertised as 1 5 bathrooms so i picked it because we were six girls and I couldn t afford the 2 bathroom apts our apt was actually 1 shower room and 1 separate toilet room we were very disappointed Also the 2nd bedrm was located up these narrow steps in the apt and luggage couldn t safely be transported up there finally the living room wasn t even big enough to hold 6 ppl at one time super uncomfortable , The staff was awesome they helped us with alot of questions but then when one of them said they d hold our luggage for us after we checked out the other one didn t honor the request Also our pullout sofa was comfortable
180465,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Hey charge 1 50 for one coffee No hot water for a shower Dirty room Room looks nothing like the pictures Paper and pen checkin process takes about 30 mins to check in Wifi doesn t work 90 of the time Tiny room They will try to put you in the worst room unless you fight for a slightly better one One of the rooms we got out in had gross stained carpet No closet Not really sure how they rate themselves a 4 star hotel , Nothing
180466,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Taking the suitcase up to the rooms Phew the good Lady did ask if we wanted her help how can i ask a lady to take my suitcase up the steps when i am just about able to do it lol, An elevator would have been good and more breakfast options too would have been a bonus e g able to order the type of breakfast wanted 
180467,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Earlier check in say 12 pm would have been nice after a 8 hrs flight landing at 8 am , The location of the hotel is just perfect Next to Denfert Rochereaux a major station for the Metro RER which provides quick access to many interesting sites monuments 
180468,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, So tiny four people was cramped as there is no storage space for 4 cases etc , Great location fantastic staff Cecile was so helpful Lovely courtyard area to sit in 
180469,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, I paid the taxes in Cash but they still charged my credit card I am still awaiting for the refund until now We werent allowed to check in at 1230noon even though I ve explained we will check out early morning 4am the reception lady was not nice at all in telling us check in at 3pm only When we came back at 3pm to check in another receptionist was on duty Cathy was more pleasant and nicer Quite a long walk to from train station This is not a hotel set up If you forget the codes to the main gate and room at night no one will open the gate for you so you ll probably spend the night outside We were given 3 towels for 4 people booking for 4 people ,No Positive
180470,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The room had nothing to do with what was advertised The floor was cement and in bad shape also with some carpets on top of it The same happened in the exterior corridors and those carpets were not cleaned , The lady janitor was very kind always with a smile in her face and the place ia wonderfully located 15 minutes walk from Montparnasse 
180471,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, nothing, The small garden is every comfortable and quiet The room is clean and warm but it s a little noisy when other people come back and talk and walk outside since it s an old building Everyday the room will be cleaned The reception is kindly gave me much information about the marche and time manage for my travel The double code is safety 
180472,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Confirmed prior to booking about late check in charges and were reassured that there will be NONE Upon arrival before 00 00 and waiting for a member of staff a gentleman arrived and suggested that we need to pay 90 euros After a bit of discussion the suggestion by him was that we pay 25 euros and leave a good review on the Trip Adviser website At check out no charges were applied but my experience did not have a good start and their suggestion to ask for a good review in exchange for a charge was not ethical nor friendly ,No Positive
180473,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse,No Negative, cosy charming good price great location staff were helpful smooth check in out They booked our airport taxi for us making the whole process easy We stayed with our 11 y o in the little garret room beds were comfy bath was big everything we needed 
180474,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Came back late one evening and found my door open the cleaner never locked it Nothing was missing but this was quite disconcerting , Very quiet Big room Lady at reception was very nice and helpful
180475,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Faster check out process took 5 10 minutes to complete On other hand I m sure this could have been dealt with on evening before departure , Hotel was beatiful in a relaxed environment but still very much in city center Personal was very friendly contacted us 2 3 weeks before arival to answer questions and to make themselves available in case of questions This was very apprechiated Also welcomed us and made sure that we could get help This was very apprechiated 
180476,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, If you re looking for the polish of a hotel type accommodation this is not it it s more like an slightly bohemian AirBnB ours had a very nice charcoal drawing that was done on strips of tape on the living room wall Two minor things The dark cloth flooring tended to catch lint so the place never looked fully vacuumed and the window was left open after the cleaning presumably to air out the rooms so though the unit is in a locked courtyard it didn t seem very secure , Extremely helpful and pleasant staff who went out of their way to accommodate our midnight arrival Staying in this little compound was like having your own apartment in a Paris suburb and if you re trying to save by preparing your own meals then this would be your place since there is a mini kitchen with fridge stove pots plates etc 
180477,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, A pity the price couldn t have stayed the same for the next few nights or I would certainly have stayed longer , Exceptional value for money for the night I stayed 
180478,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse,No Negative, The location is great Near to metro and bus shelter The staffs were friendly and helpful I recommend it for group or family who will staying in Paris 
180479,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Room was tight access to the bed on only one side have to climb over your spouse to go to the toilet Concrete floor with chipped paint a couple of small mats would have been nice Wifi did not work , Close to the metro and quite location 
180480,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Rooms are too small which is normal in Paris but regarding to the old windows you will hear a lot of noise from outside Sofa bed is not comfortable and make a noise and in fact the 4 people apartment is suitable for 2 people The location is not very close to Metro and you have to walk 10 15 min , Nice and helpful staff we had a problem and they change our place nicely Close to the local shops 
180481,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The suite itself think very small parisian 1 bedroom studio retrofitted into a hotel room You get a tiny bedroom with double bed and bathroom with standup shower the water only heated up to lukewarm at most The living room has a pull out sofabed the TV and the kitchenette Nespresso capsules are provided at 1 50 EUR capsule Although the breakfast is a great deal and the croissants etc are freshly bought for hot drinks you have to use the hot water boiler provided in the room as well as instant coffee instant hot chocolate or tea bags provided for free or the 1 50 EUR capsule Nespresso To sum up the bad is only details which are fine when you get a good discounted price given the great location However at full price given the tight space for 4 I would defintely go with the big buisness hotels all over Paris periphery , This is really about location The suites are a pleasant stroll up rue Daguerre a very parisian market and bistro street from Denfert Rochereau a major m tro hub In Paris there are very few family rooms available in locations such as this one The staff is very friendly and the street is quiet the suites even being a courtyard away from the street The suite has a small terrace with table and chairs you can have drinks or breakfast on TV with satellite channels and mini kitchentte with Nespresso machine Breakfast is served in room or 5 EUR person and consists in 1 croissant 1 pain au chocolat 1 3 baguette jam and butter all bought nearby by the staff the very morning Definite bargain when found discounted given the location 
180482,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Some might find the rooms a little small but if you are looking for a comfy place to sleep then this is perfect , Accommodation had character and charm with modern touches good Wi Fi microwave fridge and modern bathroom Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance 
180483,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse,No Negative, The staff were so helpful upgraded our room free of charge to accommodate our toddler after a mix up with bookings Good location for Montparnasse train station
180484,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Staffs are great friendly and helpful Rooms are tiny Curtains are dusty and dirty Bathroom sink leaks no air condition so rooms were very hot that we had to stay out till after midnight The compound is nice and relaxing in the evening but very noisy in the morning with loud noises from kids and lots of banging More like a 2 stars We did not get any rest , Price is slightly cheaper than most in Paris 
180485,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, No air conditioning in the room not all rooms are equipped with air con For a summer stay it was a bit uncomfortable due to the heat They provide electric fans though Do ask when you reserve If you travel with a car parking is difficult The hotel doesn t have its own parking , The staff was very hospitable Very polite and attentive to your needs The kitchen is well equipped They have what you need for cooking Ingredients can be bought at stores located at walking distance from the hotel 
180486,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Very very noisy place You will listen for every guest arriving even in the middle of the night We were very unlucky and on the top we ve got people upstairs which were jumping up and down or its just the place , Location
180487,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The room was cramped for 4 even though we had 2 children The food preparation area was almost inadequate I did even try to prepare a meal We were on the bottom floor next to the courtyard and heard every movement and noise from other residents with kids running around outside till 10 30pm The room had no fan so we had to keep the window open all night The only channel in English was BBC News although the boys enjoyed watching scooby doo in French , The location was very good near a local market street with a small choice of restaurants and shops and near transport links The room was compact but tidy with a double bed and pull out Secure courtyard with seating 
180488,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The room is so small you may not have a space to open your suitcase No lift No oven , Excellent location Walking distance to Montparnasse station Monoprix Carrefour Franprix etc Terrace at the ground floor A white pretty apartment Balcony big enough for 3 people to sit around a table and have supper Not all rooms have a balcony tho Kitchen with microwave cooking stoves a saucepan some plates and knives and forks You can borrow a frying pan if you ask The staffs speak English They re very kind I really like this apartment Would definitely visit again 
180489,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Sure it is small and cosy but it was in the middle of Paris , The staff was really friendly The location allowed us to travel every where around Paris and it was close to montparnasse and RER to CDG Finally the building is the original parisien appartement with a couple of trees 
180490,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, We could not get the WIFI to work on our phones, The staff helped a lot on telling us on a map how to get to places in Paris and what trains to take on the Metro
180491,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, It is poorly located needs full maintenance All the gadgets needs immediate attention One nail which was in floor hit my foot Very small tiny rooms Staff is poorly trained Very basic cleaniess was also missing, Nothing
180492,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse,No Negative, I d travel a lot for business and try to find unique place to stay Helzear Montparnasse Suites is one of this place difficult to find in Paris A place where you want to came back with your wife or even with your family for a week end As pleasant to travel than for leisure
180493,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Room directly over the front door could be noisy with late night returning of some guests Call button to reception at the front door not working at time of arrival Had to call the Helzear office who alerted the staff to let us in , Location as very good nice neighbourhood in Paris Several metro lines nearby About six minutes walking Kitchen facilities actual usefull and practical Friendly staff
180494,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, No common spaces toilets etc The flat was in first floor and bit noice when people opening the door to the building and passing by or going to the stairs , The location was the best and small yard was really nice The flat was really nice 
180495,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, My only small complaint is a very tiny one checking in there is no restroom nearby easily accessable My young son had to use the facilities pretty badly after being on the train then the metro then the walk to the hotel and there was nowhere close for him to go The man checking us in told me it wouldn t take long and he could go in the room but for a little boy even the fairly simple check in process was a while to wait and I wish he the staff member would have had a better option for us Maybe he could have taken us to the room and let us fill out the paperwork there Just a suggestion and honestly this was a small issue and the only one we had during our stay , The beds were crazy comfortable even the pull out sofa that my son slept on which I was wholly surprised by Pullouts are usually pretty uncomfortable just as a rule but I wouldn t have minded sleeping on this one at all Our bed in the next room was even more comfortable we stayed in a Jr suite I liked that there was a mini bar with snacks and drinks These are always fairly pricey so that wasn t a surprise and it was a very nice convenience option to have The building was beautiful and well maintained It was clean and smelled nice There were plenty of outlets for charging devices as well as a well appointed kitchen with utensils plates glasses anything we could have needed The female staff member who checked us out was so sweet and kind and made us very comfortable We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris 
180496,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, Cons Vertically tiny Not for those over 5 ft tall There are large wooden beams bracing the ceiling at odd angles and even the ceilings themselves are slanted so it s difficult not to hit your head It s rated a 4 hotel but it s really not a hotel as it has no amenities It s an apartment and not a 4 at that We didn t love the area and they charge 2 for an instant coffee that you have to make yourself in the room There is no restaurant but for 5 each you get half a baguette a croissant and a pain au chocolat with jam brought to your room There is no staff on site after 10pm , Also known as Helzear Montparnasse Suites The booking com profile for this place is a bit unusual since all photos seem to be professional and not one of them is of the attic 1 bedroom where we stayed I think they may not want to reveal it Unfortunately we didn t take any photos either Sorry Pros nice girl very helpful Handy to have a kitchenette Comfortable bed Horizontally Spacious Free wifi
180497,Suites H tel Helzear Montparnasse, The size of the rooms made it very uncomfortable to stay The double room with 5 adults in it was unpleasant Once all the beds were out there was no room for our bags and no room to walk around the beds In the 2nd bedroom to get to the bathroom you had to walk over the bed and the foldout in the kitchen took up the entire kitchen space Paris was great and I would definitely stay in Montparnesse again but not at this hotel , The area Lovely location with nice neighbourhood and fantastic street with local shops and great selection of food and cafes Also very convenient to two Metro lines
