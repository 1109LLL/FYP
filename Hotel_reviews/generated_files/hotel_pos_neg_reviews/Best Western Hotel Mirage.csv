494856,Best Western Hotel Mirage, We had two incidents First at the arrival instead of a triple room as requested we received a double room with an extra bed but that cleared quickly as they offered as one double and one single connecting rooms When we left we were charged with 3 bottles of water just because we had some bottles of the same type of water inside the room that were empty Unfortunately we were in a hurry so we just paid them after the receptionist told us that this is what is written in their book This is a bit unacceptable for a 4 star hotel the devil is in the details , The breakfast is really good diverse and pretty cheap for Milan as it is 6 euros The hotel is comfortable clean and you find free coffee and water downstairs at the reception The employees were nice and tried to help with everything 
494857,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Hotel s room are a little small Hotel is a bit far from Milan City center 20 minutes , In overall this is a very good hotel The staff was fast responding breakfast is ok and not overprice The hotel has a gym also it is close to walking distance to other shop such as laundries supermarket hair salon restaurants and easy to get public transportation such as Tram to City Center 
494858,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Found it difficult to find a parking spot on arrival and was then the staff were unsure if my car would fit the parking lift but staff were helpful about this , The hotel is just across the road from the tram which takes you into Milan It is on the Duomo route so no need to change The staff are friendly and helpful The breakfast is good value at 6euro The parking is excellent if your car fits the ramp 
494859,Best Western Hotel Mirage, as i said everything was perfect only good things , everything was perfect thank you we will definitely come back see you soon

494861,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Quite far from Milano center 30min tram ride but the stop is located right outside the front doors , The hotel was gorgeous with lovely spacious wooden floored rooms The room was cleaned every morning and everything was perfect throughout my stay Breakfast included a range of different fruits and pastries that were well worth the money Perfect hotel for a weekend getaway 
494862,Best Western Hotel Mirage, There is a bit o traffic noise and the noise from the other rooms But it did not prevent us from sleeping No veggies at breakfast , Good breakfast with gluten free bread on request and soy milk cappuccino Good public transport connection Nice clean rooms
494863,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Rooms may be bigger the price for parking is high Far away from the main public transportation 52 EUR Taxi from Nice Station , Good accomodation if you have customers near Antibe No breakfast but a great Nespresso machine Supermarket quite near Unfortunately far away from the taxy station so every trip will cost at least 12 Euros just to reach the hotel Excellent sunsets from the terrace 
494864,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Bad Wifi signal in the rooms Door lock is noisy it has a very annoying buzz Sure that they can find something better It doesn t deserves 4 stars , Clean and simple
494865,Best Western Hotel Mirage, The breakfast could be better, Hotel is quite a regular medium level 4 The staff service positively surprised i told i had to take a small bottle of water from the minibar after having already paid the room and the desk guy told no problem and did not ask to pay for it 
494866,Best Western Hotel Mirage, Not necessarily in the city center but accessiblre easily , The room was spacy and the bathroom was big Breakfast was rich and had a wide selection of food for all tastes They offer free water from the minibar which was a nice gesture Tram number 14 to the city center just parts in front of it There is a supermarket nearby The bar has reasonable prices Will definitely stay there again 
494867,Best Western Hotel Mirage,No Negative, Staff were very helpful especially in directing me to the main attractions as well as giving the best and the easiest route to get to the center by public transportation Just take tram 14 in front of the hotel and it will take you directly to the Center Public Transportation ticket can be purchased from the receptionist for 4 5 Euro per day That ticket is valid for all types of public transportation Also one good thing about the hotel it is not too far from San Siro Stadium I recommend this hotel if you plan to visit Milan to attend football matches in San Siro
