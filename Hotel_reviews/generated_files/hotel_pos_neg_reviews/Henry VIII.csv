115165,Henry VIII, The pool was of limits as was being cleaned which was a shame couldn t park outside the property we went in to book in came outside already there was a parking attendant by my car air con in room didn t seem to be working, The breakfast was good the accommodation was ok three friends sharing a room with three beds
115166,Henry VIII, Couldn t get wifi with the code provided more fresh fruit selection and dried fruit at breakfast would be good for gluten free sufferers and porridge , Staff were very helpful polite Location was fabulous good value 
115167,Henry VIII, The only down side was the air con was broken and we wasn t told about it , I love the extra mile the staff went for my partners birthday We ve been to over 10 hotels in central London the Henry Viii is in our top 5 We will be back 
115168,Henry VIII, Bathroom was disgusting and shower did not work Hotel in need of complete renovation and the pictures on booking com are nothing like what the hotel is actually like , Location
115169,Henry VIII, Hotel was very drab Room was supposed to be a double and should never have been anything but a single room Not good value for money Would not go back even if offered a free room , The location was excellent Only a short walk to the tube station 
115170,Henry VIII, There is no aircon in the room Although I double checked and it was actually not specified in the room facilities you would expect it in a 4 star expensive hotel The room was really tiny and without room for two luggages Breakfast was dreadful and I ve eaten it just to feel full for the day but not because I enjoyed it The swimming pool and sauna were the reasons I chose the hotel instead of other options but don t get in this trap the facilities are very very basic sauna very tiny and if you can find another hotel with bigger rooms and nicer breakfast go for it and forget about this hotel , The staff was nice although it is quite strange to be in a English hotel and see only Spanish staff sometimes struggling with English fluency
115171,Henry VIII, I couldn t get WiFi in my room and when asked reception about it I was handed a password code that should of been given to me when I booked in as standard The cleaner was cleaning the pool area from the day before whilst my child and I were in the pool at 7 15 Had to tell a fellow guest to shower off before getting in Should be more notices up maybe in the rooms , Nothing stood out
115172,Henry VIII, Tiny tiny rooms need tobe updated was missinformed about the breakfast times and booked train tickets accordingly was told breakfast starts at 07 00 asked the receptionist upon arrival when in fact in weekend it starts at 07 30 , Location
115173,Henry VIII, The decor is a little dated and the sauna could be bigger but that s really the worst thing I can say it s a great place , The staff were amazing so helpful and kind 
115174,Henry VIII, Reception service was friendly but incredibly and frustratingly slow Decor very old fashioned and basic rooms Breakfast poor quality inedible eggs and hot drinks from a row of push button machines, Location quiet and convenient for Hyde Park Royal Albert Hall
115175,Henry VIII, The coffee machine only giving part measures and the television remote did not work It appears it was the wrong one It took quite a while to sort , I make use of the swimming pool
115176,Henry VIII, This is no way a 4 star hotel rooms are very small Carpets in hotel need to be replaced especially floor 5 very dirty No air con working Bar had only I white or 1 red spanish wine no sparkling rose or other country Very poor bathrooms no storage or shelf for toiletries Large crack across our sink ,No Positive
115177,Henry VIII, They froze the 120 cost for the room on the date of booking even though Booking com state no prepayment required When my daughter clerked in they demanded payment from her I called and spoke to two lovely but discussion was difficult as neither appeared to understand me I have a very mild NZ accent often confused as English They are continuing to hold the 120 payment though the stay ended yesterday I want Booking com to look into this matter, Good bed Breakfast was good
115178,Henry VIII, Breakfast was terrible The cook needs a good talking to All the pastries were burnt and the eggs powdered and tasteless and the mushrooms stewed with no flavour One male staff member strutted around with his sleeves rolled up so high on his arms for the purpose of showing his tattoos Very tacky The female staff in the dining room looked very unenthused and stood around talking , Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful Room was adequate but the sauna and pool were lovely to relax in after a big day 
115179,Henry VIII, Booked a double bed room and ended up with twin beds went back to reception to be told there was no other rooms then they found us a double room which was horrible right next to the train line and big generators as a view The room felt more like an hostel than a hotel room Back to the reception we went demanding a refund but then we were offered the best room in the hotel a suite for 1 night which we accepted but had to change in the morning We was then moved to a double room which was adequate for 1 night The pool was also closed due to maintenance one of the reasons we decided to stay here for It felt like just because we found a great deal we were put in the worst rooms 170 is not just pocket money will not be returning to this hotel , Location was good right near Hyde Park and couple of streets away to the Tube station and shops
115180,Henry VIII, The room was not big enough and not adequate for two people There was no room to go around the bed so that I had to get over my partner to reach the bathroom The A C was down so that we have been sweating the whole night Bathroom was extremely small There was no minibar I had to purchase 6 x mini bottles of water form reception not to die of thirst 1 3 of a liter each at the cost of GBP 7 5 The safe box was down as well Overall a complete disaster I will not recommend the stay at this hotel to anyone I will never go there again , Nothing 
115181,Henry VIII,No Negative, The room was equipped with more than enough to make the stay highly comfortable including the fans hairdryer and kettle not to mention that the en suite facilities were incredible In fact the hardest part of the trip was checking out 
115182,Henry VIII, The room was too small we could hardly move around in it It was hot no air conditioning with only a desk fan The ceiling fan was not working This is not anywhere near a 4 star hotel There was no manager on duty wee had to move to a livable place after only one night ,No Positive
115183,Henry VIII, The majority of the staff needed to smile and realise that they are paid to serve and look after their customers Chairs and tables for breakfast were dirty Pool sauna were ridiculously small Scrambled egg at breakfast was dry beyond all belief Room was too small for 2 people we spent 4 nights falling over our suitcases I had to laugh when my husband asked for an ironing board it filled the room Painting decorating including sanding happening right outside our bedroom at 8am paint smell noisy cleaners around the same time I think that s all, The bathroom was half decent
115184,Henry VIII, BASIC ROOM IS TOO SMALL FOR 2 ADULTS, THE HOTEL IS IN A VERY GOOD LOCATION NEAR TRAIN STATION AND RED LINE CENTRAL SUBWAY STATION THE HOTEL HAS ALSO A SWIMMING POOL FOR A GOOD RELAX AFTER ALONG WAIK IN LONDON BREAKFAST IS NICE AND SIMPLE WE HAD A TRAIN NOISE IN OUR ROOM THE FIRST NIGHT AND THEY CHANGED OUR ROOM TO A QUITE ROOM FOR THE NEXT THREE NIGHTS THE STAFF ARE EXCELLANT AND VERY HELPFULL
115185,Henry VIII, I m wondering how this hotel is rated 4 stars Rooms are very small Very average breakfast I paid the full stay in cash They removed the first night and after 17 days I still didn t get my money back Every time i ask them they said that they contacted their bank and refund will come soon Be sure to get a room with ceiling fan and AC because when the AC stop working they say that AC is not included in the booking Not very close to any underground station, Swimming pool
115186,Henry VIII, I pretty much disliked everything about the hotel It was old tired and worn The rooms were tiny and outdated Everything seemed done on the cheap from the smallest bottles of shower gel to the low quality pillows , Being moved from the smallest box room to a slightly bigger but still amazingly small room 
115187,Henry VIII, The staff here ruined my experience in London completely They were rude dismissive and didn t care for customer service whatsoever Our shower had no running water so I called reception and they said maintenance would be there within an hour 2 hours later and they still didn t call me back So I went to the lobby and asked what was going on because I needed to shower and leave the hotel for my flight and the lady at reception hadn t even called maintenance I asked if they could just give me another room I could shower in and she said she would ask and let me know within 10 minutes I waited in my room for another hour and she never got back to me Eventually my friends and I couldn t wait any longer because we would ve missed our flight so we did not shower and checked out and left When I came to check out the lady at reception asked so did u find a solution to the shower situation And I had no idea how to respond because not only did they not care to call maintenance but they couldn t even give me another room or even call me back to let me know what was going on The staff here are definitely incompetent and I would not recommend staying here unless it s only for a quick one night stay , The pictures on booking com were accurate The rooms were clean There s no A C but if you ask the hotel will provide you with a fan 
115188,Henry VIII, Very Hot weekend Air con unit in room but told that air con wasn t something they offered Windows locked so had to wait until maintenance were able to unlock windows Hotel provided a fan so room was Ok with fan and windows open , Great location friendly staff
115189,Henry VIII, Room was tiny how they got a double bed and by double I am being generous in the room defies logic there wasn t enough room to open a suitcas on the floor Air con didn t work this room should barely pass as a single , Bed was comfortable
115190,Henry VIII, Despite there being air cons in every room they had been disabled and with the blistering heat last week they declined to switch them on for anyone I did see people checking out for that reason I had a fan in my room and on checking the fine detail of my booking they did not actually claim they air conditioning You might be forgiven for assuming as I did that at this price that would come as standard My room was somewhat bijou and the bathroom was very tiny with room for one person only The Wi Fi was very slow not really acceptable in 2017 , Room was very quiet no traffic noise from road evident The room was very clean and the bed comfortable two twins joined The Pool was very clean and a nice temperature and there was a decent choice of food at breakfast Staff very polite and efficient Nice restaurants and bars in the vicinity 
115191,Henry VIII, The worst hotel I have ever stayed at I came back to our room at night and found other people in my room The staff were so unorganised it was incredible Rooms are horrible and the second room they gave me seemed to be next to the train or tube tracks Impossible to sleep , The location is the only thing that is ok for this hotel
115192,Henry VIII, The Breakfast was ok but the scrambled eggs tasted like egg powder I travelled with a vegan and while everyone else was well catered for vegans are not the communal areas of the hotel are a bit scruffy and dated, Bed was comfortable and the room was clean
115193,Henry VIII, Toiletries and drink provision a little on the mean side The soap did not lather at all No biscuits or hot chocolate etc For this price I would expect a little more home comfort and more of a welcome , Breakfast was tasty with a good choice and nicely presented Bathroom compact but clean The swimming pool was definitely a bonus Did not try the sauna The bed and linen were very comfortable 
115194,Henry VIII, I fail to see how this is a 4 hotel The room was cramped big cracks in the sick carpets stained and shredded Chairs in the dining room were stained and dirty Whilst there we were also not advised that construction work would be starting in the next room at 8am Monday morning which we were not pleased with All in all this was a complete nightmare stay and frankly not worth the money we paid We will not be staying here again Absolutely shocking hotel , The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was lovely 
115195,Henry VIII, Better explanation from staff on reception re pool and facilities , Lovely location and room excellent Great relaxing in swimming pool at night and sauna Would recommend Quiet but within easy reach of Hyde park and Kensington Palace and good bus routes 
115196,Henry VIII, Our twin room was of an adequate size for a one night stay but we found the bathroom really compact but saying that it was clean and functional , There was an excellent choice of breakfast We were expecting just a standard Continental breakfast but was delighted to see a fabulous breakfast selection Very tasty and not greasy Lovely Our room was clean and cool I couldn t get the air conditioning system to work but it was ok because there was a ceiling fan and a large window which opened and let fresh air in 
115197,Henry VIII, I booked a basic double and got a 7 2 sqm dirty stinking prison cabinet broken bed could only be entered by crawling over the foot end Unsafe exit automatic doors didn t open 25 minutes for check in When I returned to ask for the double room as booked they just said take it or leave it but you will have to pay anyway Ergo Do not go there fraud and unsafe ,No Positive
115198,Henry VIII, First way too small room especially after what they charge Secondly AC doesn t work Third Receptionists are the worst that I have seen in my life Fourth No room service So even if u want a spoon u have to go and get from reception, NOTHING
115199,Henry VIII, The single room was so tiny that I had no place to store my suitcase The small cupboard could barely fit anything The air conditioning is non functional in every room I overheard other guests is mostly for show The free breakfast was mediocre , The staff were very friendly helpful Free WiFi The location is absolutely outstanding The room bathroom were very neat 
115200,Henry VIII, The air conditioning was broke and didn t fall under the responsibility of the staff so they simply switched on the overhead fan The beds were on wheels so every time I moved during the night my bed skid across the wood flooring The location is a bit of a step outside the centre but there are good links to all public transport also , The breakfast buffet was exceptional The staff seemed nice and helpful also Good room facilities with iron and ironing board included 
115201,Henry VIII, The room was a single room sold as a double There was not room for us to both walk in it More suitable for backpackers Hugely over priced and not work the money at all Overall hotel is tired but the room has to be the worse I have ever stay I didn t even bother to stay for breakfast , Only the location there was nothing else to like about this hotel
115202,Henry VIII, People coming into your room without knocking Loud banging doors Breakfast buffet was poor over cooked and luke warm Room was more like a cell , Nothing
115203,Henry VIII, Staff was unservers unfortunately This hotel wasn t 4 stars Perhaps between 2 3 , Location was good The area is nice also lot s of shops etc The bed was also quite nice 
115204,Henry VIII, My partner got food poisoning from the breakfast has been violently sick ever since I m absolutely devastated , Unfortunately I wasn t able to enjoy anything as you gave my partner food poisoning 
115205,Henry VIII, Squeaky floors no air conditioning, Swimming pool and sauna good choices for breakfast Central location close to three subway stations and major bus route 
115206,Henry VIII, Nothing it was perfect, Everything was great The people who worked there were so lovely and helpful The breakfast was great Wifi was perfect So close to everything and close to a tube station Very clean as well Felt like home after a while 
115207,Henry VIII, I found the whole experience very deflating The hotel smells very old and I would give it a 1 or maximum 2 star rating The carpet is worn away and the furniture and upholstery is all extremely old The place smells old The receptionist could not understand anything I was saying , Nothing
115208,Henry VIII, air conditioning didn t work only a few channels on TV no itv or channel 4 When complained told that we had a ceiling fan and that the air conditioning didn t work in the whole hotel I rather think it was on a timer so it didn t work to save money This was billed as a four star hotel and it certainly wasn t and the price reduction was from 340 a night I paid 89 for a twin room which was not a price reduction I think that was what it was worth,No Positive
115209,Henry VIII, They put us up in the smallest room we could tell by the fire map on the wall which was tiny and a bit challenging for two adults to maneuver around in the mornings The aircon in the room was taped in the middle and would only stay on for a few seconds before shutting itself off We could of course have complained but we were only there for two nights and had already unpacked so it was a bit of an inconvenience , The bed was quite comfortable and the breakfast was nice with chorizo and tasty cheese which had not been left out too long like in many other hotel breakfast buffets The hotel swimming pool looked nice but we didn t have time to try it 
115210,Henry VIII, I booked a double but was put in a twin when I asked to be moved I was told the room size is the same I explained I would like a double bed so was moved Air con is in the rooms but doesn t work although an electric fan was supplied However it was during the heatwave so it just wasn t enough so I slept badly due to the heat Restaurant only serves breakfast there s lots of places for food nearby though but not ideal if like me you re uncomfortable eating out alone Swimming pool changing rooms are just a hanging curtain next to the pool , Good location near restaurants shops underground
115211,Henry VIII, You are paying more than 100 bucks per night and you don t even get air conditioner inside your tiny room I complained it and the receptionist gave me very old small fan and recommended me to use another fan on the ceiling But it was very noisy to turn on all night Single bad is extremely narrow If you weigh more than 70 kg your body will be bigger then mattress Swimming pool is also very small it fits only for 2 people swimming at same time , Location was not bad it is close to hyde park and subway station I only liked its location Probably it is good for Spanish speaking people since most of staff are hispanic guys and everything is written in Spanish in this hotel even inside elevator 
115212,Henry VIII, The room was tiny Two people could not comfortably stand up in the room and our small carry on suitcases did not fit in the room , The location in London s Leinster Gardens and particularly the famous 23 Leinster Gardens was great The swimming pool was unexpected and great 
115213,Henry VIII, Air conditioning was broken on the hottest days of this summer and staff were not concerned about getting it fixed Beds uncomfortable and pillows useless Pool was ok but sauna tiny 2 people maximum No showers or adequate changing areas The photos were clearly photoshopped, The location
115214,Henry VIII, Price value total rip off Very old and unconvenient facilities mainly shower Staff was unfriendly and not professionnal at all No A C couldnt sleep whole night, Breakfast was OK 
115215,Henry VIII, Start to finish everything a room where you have a metre of floor space air con units fitted but hotel policy isnt to switch them on food was aweful 2 3 of the staff there didnt care less you so that in their customer service what made it worse is i travelled with my 5 year old and even she said it was bad Looks a lovely hotel from the outside but needs a complete transformation in my opinion , I will never stay there again 
115216,Henry VIII, The front foyer looks terrible with patches of worn carpet It really brings the hotel down and you wonder why it is a 4 star The furniture in the foyer also worn and dated An overhaul of the main entrance would definitely be beneficial to first impressions , The breakfast was wonderful staff was great 
115217,Henry VIII, The room was tiny The breakfast was disgusting we had paid for breakfast for both mornings but didn t bother going for it the second morning The facilities in the room didn t work Not as described or advertised online , It was close to Kensington gardens
115218,Henry VIII, The hotel is generally in need of re decoration throughout The temperatures had raised and the rooms were quite hot and it was a shame that the AC was not working particularly in the triple room , Clean and comfortable place to stay with welcoming staff 
115219,Henry VIII, the first bedroom had loud train noise so we moved second bedroom and bathroom was very small almost unbearable customer set up phone on Face time or equivalent in breakfast room and spoke very loudly in foreign language for over half an hour could be heard through out the room and was not approached by staff Staff spoke very poor English three members of staff didn t know what a poached egg was when we asked for it bar is poorly stocked and staff not knowledgeable tried to tell us tonic water was the same as soda water, The location suited us very well public transport hire car office close by used the heated pool many times good for London breakfast good range and refilled as needed many different nationalities to talk to
115220,Henry VIII, This hotel looks the part from outside Just don t go in The room is more like you would expect in Claxton No offence to clacton The first room you could not swing the proverbial cat We moved to a bigger room and that smelt of stale cigarette smoke The 3rd and final room we looked at still shabby but stayed 1 night instead of 2 Do not boot this hotel Try the YMCA , Nothing
115221,Henry VIII, Air conditioner and fan didn t work Room was so small we had to back up into tiny bathroom to pass each other, Excellent breakfast Very clean and daily service excellent 
115222,Henry VIII, it was a 10 15 min walk from Paddington station, fab breakfast swimming pool great to relax and cool down in after a hard day shopping room was basic but clean quiet and comfortable 
115223,Henry VIII, Shabby carpets cooked breakfast was Apoling, The place was run down and definitely not worth the money the hotel 2 doors along we had dinner in it every night and drinks out side on the front patio Nothing like this at the Henry v111 I wouldn t recommend this hotel Over paid for the facilities it has
115224,Henry VIII, Small room not working air conditioner stuff can t help us , Location is very good near to Paddington and some Underground stations to Hyde Park and museum V A Beautiful building and neighborhood 
115225,Henry VIII, We only chose this hotel for a business trip because they had a triple room available When we arrived we were eventually told that there was a problem with the room and that we would need to share a bed or have separate rooms on the same floor which for three women isn t ideal The hotel didn t attempt to contact me in advance of our arrival to let us know however after some discussion the issue was eventually resolved and we agreed to take a family room with a double and sofa bed which was adequate We also received a partial refund and the staff were apologetic so it wasn t a disaster , The location was good The staff were polite and helpful Clean Good facilities Comfy bed Lovely big bathroom and good decor Tasty breakfast 
115226,Henry VIII, Everything see above, I booked and paid for a double room it was actually a 3 4 bed the air conditioning didn t work there was no bar the carpet in communal areas was a trip hazard I chose this hotel for the pool it was disgusting I wasn t allowed to check in until 2 I left at 4 and stayed at the Radisson Blu I would like my money back
115227,Henry VIII, Room was cramped and directly over rail tracks Trains passing all the time Floors boards in the room were very noisey Floor boards in the room next and above us were very noisy We could hear everything said next door to us Air con was broken There was a fan in the room but it just pushed around hot air Window had to be closed at night to drown out the noise of the trains Not a modern hotel Bed was clean and comfortable Bathroom was very small but clean and shower was good Good location but the room was not worth the price at all But that is what you get in London Room was ok if all you were there to do was sleep in it and get out early for the whole day Not a place for couples , Location was great 5 min walk to Tube Bed was clean and comfortable Bathroom was very small but clean and shower was good 
115228,Henry VIII, i tried to call the hotel 4 weeks before travel on a saturday it was permanently engaged then i was left on hold and finally when i did get through i was told to hold the line ahd eventually put the phone down after waiting 30mins i mentioned this to a number of staff but they just said sorry the other thing is my night in london was 10th june and the hotel took the full amount the day after i booked it which i think was a bit harsh especially as every person who was checking in the following day i spent a number of afternoon hours in reception paid at the desk on the day , the pool was lovely first time ive been in a hotel pool that is so warm 
115229,Henry VIII, The air conditioning had an error meaning it wasnt working breakfast was very continental and lacked flavour orange juice was orange squash, Clean and tidy
115230,Henry VIII, Very hot in the room air con not working fan in room did not help all three of us , Staff and atmosphere at the hotel was lovely good facilities and breakfast was lovely Hotel not far from local corner shops if anything required pubs also close by Tube station max ten minute walk which was also a pleasant and easy walk 
115231,Henry VIII, The cleaning of the pool and sauna facilities, Sauna was rather different from picture and so the pool The room was tiny and the toilet only a step away from the bed end 
115232,Henry VIII, Scruffy and dirty reception and corridors Very cramped room Aircon broken Ceiling fan broken TV remote broken Desk chair ripped No orange juice left at breakfast time Cheap food products at breakfast Undercooked breakfast items sausage absolutely no colour and cold to touch No staff service at checkout when we asked for a manager there wasn t one available , Location was the only positive aspect of this hotel
115233,Henry VIII, The very small room if you wanted to stay up next to the bed it was impossible , Location is very good near Hyde park very nice area the hotel is quite old and smells like an old building the staff is very nice the room is from far the smallest hotel room that I ever saw the buffet breakfast was nice with lots of choices the swimming pool very large and also very clean this was the only good thing about the hotel the swimming pool and sauna
115234,Henry VIII, The bed was quite firm for us and the room size was very tight literally no room to move around and no place for suitcases Location of the hotel was a bit far away from most of the main attractions and we would have preferred to be more central as we were there as tourists Nearby restaurants were limited too , The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast room was large and had a very good selection of hot and cold foods The room was very small but by London standards was probably standard and everything was very clean and adequate The indoor pool and sauna was a real bonus and we really enjoyed using those facilities after a long day of sight seeing 
115235,Henry VIII, it is for sure not a four star hotel maybe two the room we had has no view it s very small for a double the pictures about the pool are photoshoped it looks much better than real in the photo cold water no minibar the remote control for the TV had no battery cover noisy shower because of an deffective regulator the filters in the A C were maybe never cleaned therefore the A C had a permanent error and was not working , good position easy reachable from paddington station 
115236,Henry VIII, Room was very small for two persons but clean and some parts of inventory have already reached the point to be replaced, Distances have been very short Hyde park Paddington station staff was very polite 
115237,Henry VIII, The staff were unhelpful The Air Conditioning was broken throughout the whole hotel The Bar shut at 11pm There was no room service The breakfast was poorly cooked and the quality was very poor and had run out of many items Service from the foreign staff with vey poor English was abysmal, There was nothing we liked about this hotel A DREADFUL EXPERIENCE I HAVE STAYED IN BETTER 2 STAR HOTELS
115238,Henry VIII, Room size was poor 10 for upgrade , The room was so small we asked for something larger We had to pay 10 for the upgrade The whole hotel needs a make over Swimming pool is ok but needs a big clean Breakfast was good
115239,Henry VIII, The rooms are very small and although it s advertised as a double room it s really a single room with a small double bed The air conditioning units did not work The whole hotel looks tired and is in need of refurbishment decoration , The staff were friendly and helpful and when called upon we re willing and happy to assist
115240,Henry VIII, Bedroom was too small to walk around the bed properly Bar didn t open till 8pm Hotel ignored request for rooms to be close to each other, Good location 
115241,Henry VIII, Poor lift small room loads of noise from neighbouring rooms floor squeaking convos etc poor customer service at breakfast poor parking shocking door for the bathroom All in all really disappointed with this hotel which is allegedly 4 Worst booking I have made on this site , The breakfast was decent
115242,Henry VIII, The carpet was a bit shabby in places and the breakfast selection was rather limited , Comfortable and spacious accomodation in a quiet area close to good restaurants and shops The pool was ok quite small and it was nice to have a sauna but you could only fit two inside and only then if you were good friends 
115243,Henry VIII, I do nt know, Too small room bathroom und shower more than bad shabby Furniture no window in the breakfast room brackfast to cheap in the food condition the entrance like a hostle 
115244,Henry VIII, The sauna was not operating and the TV didn t work despite being reported early in the evening of our overnight stay , It was lovely having a swimming pool which was warm and of good size Good breakfast 
115245,Henry VIII,No Negative, Nice breakfast very good choice and not busy at 9am Room was pretty small but I suppose that s to be expected in London the location made up for it 
115246,Henry VIII, Nothing to none about, We have stayed here several times and enjoyed being there The breakfast was superb with plenty to chose from It is close to Hide Park and Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall a little further away The staff were very helpful 
115247,Henry VIII, Didn t feel like i was in London felt like I was in Spain Spanish staff guests 2 languages on everything Wasn t expected Wasn t the cleanest Needs a refurbishment Room was tiny breakfast was not great either Probably wouldn t go back , The bed was quite comfy location was good Pool was decent 
115248,Henry VIII, The room was just too small to put me and the suitcase in I could only open my door half way when putting my suitcase The air condition was not working at all the fan they gave me was too loud to use for night time , It is close to Paddington station which is quite convenient 
115249,Henry VIII, The room was small Breakfast was stale and the eggs tasted like cardboard The room in where you ate breakfast smelt like mould, the location was convenient
115250,Henry VIII, Everything place is a hole 1 star maybe rooms are a broom closet, Dirty old hotel all carpets everywhere wore old mattress terrible tiny rooms poor water for shower lousy restaurant food very bad staff and management poor won t recommend to my dog 
115251,Henry VIII, The wifi is sporadic at best and the staff is non responsive to concerns , The location of this hotel is helpful for those that want to spend time in London central 
115252,Henry VIII, The room had an insect infestation It was extremely dusty and not very clean I certainly do not agree with the star ranking of this hotel My room was changed the next day as the manager was not available on the first day I did not get any apology and the cleaning unit did not attend The breakfast was certainly not vegetarian friendly The sausages are placed next to egg and other options and hotel visitors mix the utensils when serving themselves The staff had real difficulties in understanding my issues and never picked up the phone , The only positive was the location 
115253,Henry VIII, Could do with new carpets and a lick of paint in the reception , Friendly staff no issues at all for us on our stay Quiet room at front of hotel had a ceiling fan nice quiet which was good as it was hot and we don t like air conditioning My suit got a bit creased in my case while travelling to London so it was great to discover the trouser press had a built in ironing board Swimming pool was nice hardly any guests were using it so also nice and quiet 
115254,Henry VIII, The bedroom was very small and was only just a single not double as booked the bed was extremely uncomfortable and left no space to move around There was an issue with check in where the room we were booked into was not ready and so we were put into the small room I was asked for my passport which confused me as I am English The receptionist gave us the barest of information referring to a scrap of paper Trains were passing the room so could not have the window open due to excessive noise , The hotel was near to where I wanted to be Breakfast was good and plentiful
115255,Henry VIII, We were very unhappy that the TV did not work only very loud radio and volume control not working No instructions on how to operate the TV in the room Reception informed and said they did not know how the TV worked and could not help with the problem until next morning but we only were there for one night so not a a lot of use They said they would ask someone and ring back they never did The Air Conditioning unit did not work when set it went to error it was a hot night Nice Area and Very good Buffet Breakfast, Walking distance to Kensington Palace handy for Hyde Park Safe area Very Good buffet Breakfast 
115256,Henry VIII, Double bed is not 4 but 4 6 in briton furniture very tired with items not working i e air conditioning Room not ready on time , Price
115257,Henry VIII, Everything Incompetent staff ridiculously small room for a big price there wasnt even space for our 2 bags miniature TV no fridge disgusting lobby scary elivators, Breakfast was edible
115258,Henry VIII, When we booked it was stated that there was parking facilities this was not the case we had to park at the thistle hotel around the corner which cost me 48 00 for 2 days We booked this hotel on the understanding it had parking facilities When I questioned the receptionist about this he said oh we have to get this taken off write up sorry there is nothing we can do the only parking facilities we have is at the front of the building on a meter which was impossible to book over the phone He wasn t bothered that we had driven up there on the understanding there was parking facilities for the hotel or that this cost me another 48 , Very comfortable clean and tidy Pool and sauna was excellent Breakfast very good with a lot of choice 
115259,Henry VIII, We were disappointed with our room which had no carpet felt like we were staying in a kitchen The bed was also very hard uncomfortable The breakfast was very basic bland Overall the hotel was very below what I expected by the reviews I had read before we booked it , We liked that the Hotel was close to the Hop on Hop off bus stop We also liked that there were several little pubs eating places small grocery shops nearby The area of the hotel was nice and quiet all lovely properties The staff were friendly helpful however some of the staff were unable to understand english and some conversations were confusing 
115260,Henry VIII, Mostly industrial products for breakfast don t recommend it Decoration a bit older , Nice staff people and good location near the Paddington underground 10 min by walk Indoor swimming pool and sauna 
115261,Henry VIII, The hotel was not clean did not smell clean either The room was so small and uncomfortable I could not sleep The bathroom was not cleaned properly Disgusting and disappointed, The location was okay 
115262,Henry VIII, Run down and not a quality hotel in my humble opinion Room was hot Broken air con with extra fan in the room Despite this on full blast it was still hot Very tired decor , Friendly staff and good wifi
115263,Henry VIII, The room was a little small but quite adequate as we weren t in it much We found it hard to find fault with anything else , Lovely hotel staff were very friendly and helpful the breakfast choice was excellent and of good quality We especially loved the swimming pool it was like getting into a bath which we had to ourselves the time we spent in it The bus stop which takes you into the central areas of Oxford street and Piccadilly Circus is just a short 5 minute walk away as is Kensington Gardens We had a great time and would definitely visit Henry V111 hotel again 
115264,Henry VIII,No Negative, On arrival I was told that the room wasn t ready OK It had just turned 13 00hrs I was also told that I had booked a double room that only measured 8sqm It might be too small for me I could however if available upgrade into a room that was 12m for an extra 13 per day more I said ok I will do that The person on reception a young Spanish man by the name of Juan was very heplfull and also very polite We left our baggage there walked around for an hour or so and then came back and checked in to the hotel The room we were given was ample clean and fine for the short stay in London 3 days The quiet location of the hotel is great when you use the bus system and an oyster card to get around As said staff very helpful but be aware of the small rooms I heard many complaints whilst in the lobby from guests saying how small their rooms were But we were happy 
115265,Henry VIII, It needs renovation furniture wise, Although the reviews about this hotel on booming com were not good but I booked it and was surprised that it was not bad at all as they said and the staff were so friendly helpful very polite and they speak English well
115266,Henry VIII, Whole hotel a little tired the cleaners hoovered the corridors at 07 30 and banged the hoover against our door The walls are very thin you can hear a lot from other rooms and the bathroom , Comfy beds very clean and excellent breakfast staff are very friendly and good location 
115267,Henry VIII, The bedroom was like a box room Not much in complimentary washing items , Breakfast good although tea and coffee machines were not working properly When you used the hot water for tea it came out frothy Coffee undrinkable 
115268,Henry VIII, Room very basic and small considering we had two single beds Windows not well insulated Looks a bit worn out overall although quite clean , Very central location at 5 minutes from Paddington Station 5 minutes from Queensway Tube Central line and 2 minutes from Hyde Park Quiet location Staff very friendly and efficient Breakfast is good Did not use the swimming pool but it looks large 
115269,Henry VIII, Staff were very abrupt The room was not to the standard shown in the images and the air con didn t work bathroom wasnt 100 clean and the electrics looked dangerous , The price was good and it looked nice on the website The location was also good 
115270,Henry VIII, the size of room very small luckily only stayed a couple of nights so wernt to bad every floorboard creaked and we had to lay on bed and look to the left to watch tv as it was above dressing table and not on wall in front of us i think it needs a bit of a revamp, good range of breakfast very near hyde park and tubes
115271,Henry VIII, Our room 210 was classed as basic double but was actually only the size of a small single room The bed was a large single and not wide enough to be considered a double bed The a con did not work fortunately not required for our one night stay Shower head partially blocked Breakfast was poor Coffee machines out of order and staff not coping , Nicely located 
115272,Henry VIII, Room was next to the lift so did not sleep at all Very noisy hotel Not ideal for me and my 10 yr old daughter who had school the next day and sleepless night for her, Nice staff
115273,Henry VIII, The noise maybe the workers outside, The room was i saw it on the site its look bigger but when im check in my room was a bit small than i thought and a bit expensive than i expected from my room breakfast is good buffet personeel freindly helpful mostly the room maid room guy reception 
115274,Henry VIII, Small sauna and the diet around the swimming pool on the mosaic tiles where the water splashes up the sides , The bed was lovely and comfortable and the breakfast was lovely with all the choice I was impressed The swimming pool was good as I like to swim and the sauna was ok but only could fit two people in comfortably I recommend a clean of the edges of the swimming pool on the rules The staff were polite and helpful I enjoyed my stay with you Thankyou very much would come again 
115275,Henry VIII, The breakfast was not very nice Cheap sausage and the egg was a funny texture Coffee and tea was not very good at all The shower was very temperamental and difficult to turn on and off and keep at a steady temperature The plug didn t work in the room The wifi was awful and was supposed to last five days but had forgotten my device by the morning , The ladies at reception were very nice and helpful 
115276,Henry VIII, Rooms were in need of repair Broken tiles on floor toilet seat was nearly off We had chocolates in the room that had been opened and were 1 2 eaten Rooms all smelled of smoke Lots of foreign men at night all laying on the sofas in reception Very off putting d, Breakfast was great staff friendly bed comfy
115277,Henry VIII, Air con faulty in room and room too hot Shower temp was very difficult to get right Sound proofing terrible we were in 506 and may as well have been in a family room with the guests next door could hear EVERYTHING which wasnt good when sharing a room with my 11 year old son There was one lady on reception when we first arrived at the hotel who completely blanked us for several minutes whilst tapping into a computer She was clearly about to hand over and did not want to engage but a simple acknowledgement and a few words t o welcome us and reassure us that somebody would be with us shortly wouldnt have gone a miss Although clean the hotel is very tired and in desperate need of some money spending on ut , The room was very clean as was the Hotel in general Staff were generally helpful and breakfast was very good Hotel was in a great location handy for tube and quiet
115278,Henry VIII, The rooms are really small for 4stars hotels the furniture is very used The pool needs renovation and perhaps poolbeds where u can stay and relax could be good idea , The location is really great Just next to Hyge Park with easy access to city center by public transport with bus stops and metro just next to the hotel The stuff on reception are really friendly I enjoy their Spanish spirit everytime I stay in the hotel The breakfast is good don t miss it 
115279,Henry VIII, We had originally paid for a double room with a double bed and were given a twin room with two single beds pushed together We were then moved to a double room We queued at reception to wait for the receptionist to become avaliabe and she checked in the people behind us even though we had been stood waiting Communicating was slightly difficult on times as English wasn t the first language spoken by some of the receptionists , Breakfast was a good spread each morning Although you ran out of tea bags on 2 occasions by 9 30am so I had 2 mornings without my cup of tea 
115280,Henry VIII, VERY DIRTY Dust and Stains MOLD everywhere Carpet even felt dirty walking on it with SHOES Shower full with MOLD Nothing as promised NO WIFI was working for 6 days I was told after asking for 4 times to dont be so so difficult and go sit in the hall with the others NO water pressure in the shower burbinh hot or ice cold water was the choice Sigarette smell through the whole hotel Rude personel I was laufged at when telling the reception that I wanted to swim The swimming pool was not available because of maintenance I was told to swim in the river nearby Bad breakfast NO working coffee machines 30 for an egg and some CANNED BEANS is not really my standard of a proper breakfast BAD Bed the springs came through the mattress VERY high price with NO value for money , Only the location was ok 
115281,Henry VIII, The whole hotel needs to be modernized or the rates reduced much much more Our entire floor smelled of cigarette smoke we left after 1 night of our 3 night stay ,No Positive
115282,Henry VIII, The first night we were put in room 6 that had bad plumbing and very noisey from the reception area late at night we were moved to room up stairs 204 This room was much better in size and location until the second day in this room the toilet was leaking all over the floor the staff at reception and the maintenance man were soon to the room to rectify the problem in all we were happy with our stay but the hotel is of an age that requires and comprehensive overhaul , We enjoyed most of the hotel really although thing I had ordered for never materialised we therefore wouldn t re book to stay again
115283,Henry VIII, Only criticism was a rather loud noise generator boiler which went on for about a minute at just after 7am on our last day Luckily we were already awake otherwise that would of woken me up , Great location for us A 10 minute walk from Paddington and a five minute walk from Bayswater tube station My daughter loved the pool and the breakfast had a great selection 
115284,Henry VIII, the room too small and no view from a window the bed was uncomfortable the sink did not work that well and the elevator didn t work well, the location of the hotel
115285,Henry VIII, The only thing I could fault this hotel over was the fact that the pool closes at 11 , The hotel was in an excellent location Less than five minutes walk from Queensway tube station Two minutes from a garage which was handy for snacks The staff were more than helpful and very friendly Spoke both English and Spanish We checked out at 11am and our flight wasn t until 8pm but the hotel hold the luggage so we didn t have to lug it around London 
115286,Henry VIII, When making the booking i was given the opportunity of making a special request As i was travelling with my son i asked for a room with two separate single beds which we didn t get on arrival The staff at reception was not even aware of our request We insisted and got what we wanted the next day but not via your services I have had this three times now twice on a Nairobi booking where i asked for an airport transfer which was simply ignored Your system only talks about deals all day but should concentrate more on satisfying the client s needs In this case the hotel did dispose of rooms with twin beds and could easily have accommodated our request from day 1 In fact your system sucks as you are not giving the client 100 priority in satisfying his specific needs , No the croissants were not of good quality The beds were ok 
115287,Henry VIII, The breakfast especially the eggs were awful The air conditioner didn t work because it was apparently only ever turned on in the summer The room was the smallest double I have ever had the misfortune to experience ,No Positive
115288,Henry VIII, The Deluxe Double room was smaller than expected short of drawer cupboard space for a 4 night stay and would benefit from a having a fridge There was free wifi but it was very slow The window looked out on to some inner space so no view at all , The breakfast had a good range of choice and the pool was nice and clean The location is good very handy for Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and two or three underground stations 
115289,Henry VIII, Very poor service Waste of my valuable money for the price I paid to stay in for 5days Very dissatisfied with the staff and cleanliness of the hotel Quality of service was very poor ,No Positive
115290,Henry VIII, I paid for a double bed but had a small single room really small, the swimming pool was very good the staff friendly and very helpful breakfast first class
115291,Henry VIII, I had noisy neighbours in my room one night but no big deal , The hotel is good All the staff speak english and spanish and they re all very friendly The breakfast is delicious and it has a good price Also the hotel is well located close to two different Underground metro stations and next to the amazing Hyde Park so you can even go jogging in the morning before starting your day The hotel even includes a swimming pool and a small sauna for relaxing after a long day As an extra treat they offer free apples and water in the lobby 
115292,Henry VIII, The room was not the one advertised on booking com When we complained to reception about this they did nothing Our room was right next to the underground train track and the noise levels was awful this also was not mentioned in the booking com ad again the staff on reception did nothing about getting us another room Some of the staff had poor English and knew nothing about local area We spent 4 weeks in Europe staying at all sorts of hotels and this one was by far the worst we had come across ,No Positive
115293,Henry VIII, The recepTionist wanted us to park in An expensive Public car park Cause They were not informed that there is Free parking After 1 30pm saturday and on Sunday Rooms are Super Tiny and The train Noise If So Mear As If He Would cross The Room, Location and parking in The street in front of The hotel The staff wasn T aware of The parking rules On the street
115294,Henry VIII, Took a while for the initial receptionist to understand that just offering to cancel the booking when I had nowhere else to stay was not really a satisfactory solution , When I got there late evening I found my double room had been given to someone else They gave me a single room 25 discount so five stars to the manager who did her best to recover the situation fortunately I was alone and did not have to have a double bed 
115295,Henry VIII, The room was too small The hotel needs renovation Our room was next to the underground line which was pretty noisy Thin walls didn t help with the noise either , The room and bed were warm and relatively confortable 
115296,Henry VIII, In the evening I have noticed there was no water from the tap First of all when it happened I was not informed about it and when I rang the reception they kept telling me to wait for half an hour as their maintenance team is already working on it for 2 hours After 2 hours of not being able to use the toilet I finally went down to the reception and complaind about it and the receptionist told me that she can only do and say what she was told to I get that but that should not be the response First she should have apolosiged about the inconvenience Any way I was offered another room The following morning when we checked out again there was no apology what so ever I know this is not a 5 star hotel but there is no harm in having 5 star service It doesn t cost any extra money but the effect can be surmounting , Location was fairly good as there were 2 tube stations near by And we enjoyed swiming and sauna even though the water was cold and the sauna was tiny Bed was good not too soft Wifi speed was quite good Even though interior in general needs refurbishment all area was kept very clean 
115297,Henry VIII, When I arrived at the property I had no running water in the room called reception and they said they would get maintenance to look at it Subsequently went out for the night and came back around 10 30pm still no water The receptionist was very apologetic and found me another room happen to be a Suite within 30 minutes , Good comfortable beds Staff friendly and attentive Breakfast was good
115298,Henry VIII, The room was rather disappointing for a 4 We didn t have any cold water in the evening so couldn t have a shower as it was scalding We were told that the water tank was empty but it would be OK for the morning , Lovely hotel loved the pool and location
115299,Henry VIII, See above, We had paid extra for Breakfast on our three day visit Twice we were left standing at the entrance while staff tried to find out if we we re entitled to eat The manager of the restaurant fail to apologies Embarrassing
115300,Henry VIII, The over all feel of the hotel Not good dated and falling apart and rooms really small and pokie Over priced Travelodge would of been better , Breakfast was ok 
115301,Henry VIII, Tired worn carpets in hallways Swimming pool was good but the tiles could do with cleaning as there was a dirty rim mark the whole way around the pool but over all it would be fair to say it was clean enough , Breakfast was varied enough choices for every one Hotel was very easy to find pleasant staff lifts in hotel which made it easy to get to the rooms with luggage Shower and bath facilities were very good Nice quiet area so little noise from outside I would be happy to go back there again 
115302,Henry VIII, Cold air got into the room throuw windows Heating could not do its work like that Those windows should be properly isolated, Well located breakfast was good staff friendly 
115303,Henry VIII, This hotel is in need of a major refurbishment and I hope they have it booked in the calendar soon The carpets were worn stained badly and in some places stuck down with tape and this was just in the main reception area The paint was coming off the walls Breakfast wasn t really anything to shout about either 20 limited selection but the hot English breakfast was limited to bacon that had been there all morning scrambled eggs that were not worth eating and I wont even mention the sausages This hotel could be amazing but the simple things are letting it down Needs attention rapidly , The service was fast and great we were greeted with a warm welcome The pool area and sauna is really good clean pool is heated and hard to get out of once in The rooms are very basic but you get what you pay for beds are comfy 
115304,Henry VIII, Pretty small hall not that clean bathroom too tiny difficult to regulate water s temperature and bathroom not that lighted , Position and room cleaned 
115305,Henry VIII, Only drawback is lack of parking but this is central London , Conveniently located hotel close to multitude of restaurants on Queensway and Westbourne Grove although the closest restaurant Zorbas on Leinster Gradens best avoided Friendly welcome Very acceptable room with all the usual refinements kettle tv etc 
115306,Henry VIII, The lifts seemed abit temperamental went up and down a couple of times when we reached floor 1 so I recommend using the stairs Also in the morning water started coming through the coving above the bath and toilet to find out this was the person above us having a shower So I didn t use our shower purely because I didn t feel safe enough with risk of how safe is the ceiling Reception did call maintenance who confirmed upstairs was using the shower and they did offer another room for me to shower in but by then we had to leave so I wouldn t of had time to , Lovely staff really friendly and helpful bedroom was clean and simple not very big but we only stayed 1 night so big enough for us bed was very comfy and the ceiling fan was good as it was quite warm when we stayed 
115307,Henry VIII, Booked a double room Got 4 singles The carpet was up in places and shabby i e The reception the room the 5th floor corridor The room itself was too hot There was a fan and an air conditioner in the room Neither worked The window door would not open to let some air in I was awake from 4am I went downstairs to get water and had to pay a fiver for a bottle of water 4 pound for the bottle but the night porter had no access to change I never got back to sleep Please do not describe this hotel as 4 stars I was in room 507 with a locked access door to the room next to me which meant I heard their conversations and arguements till 1am I never visited the bar pool or had breakfast so I cannot comment on them, The room was clean the staff were friendly
115308,Henry VIII,No Negative, room very small noise and crank all night through so we woke up third still definitely not a 4 star hotel and I ve stayed in few four stars around the world its a 2 star as toilet door broken and noisy in much ned of an update the whole place well overdue breakfast soulless and dry eggs tasteless cakes and old would never go back the pictures were deceiving 
115309,Henry VIII, The room was quite small Clumps of dust and hair on the rooms floor Massive food looking smear across the mirror , The pool was really nice Beds were comfortable Really nice lady on the first desk 
115310,Henry VIII, Bedroom was small and next to the underground track when we arrived the room was freezing we expected the heater to already be on at a comfortable temperature not a cozy welcome , The cooked breakfast was excellent and the pool was lovely and warm even better that we had it all to ourselves 
115311,Henry VIII, the water flow in the shower was not strong enough but it is really a small thing, Nice rooms comfort beds clean good location near bus and underground good wifi connection
115312,Henry VIII, Wifi didn t work most of the time or was very slow Our bathroom door was broken where clearly had been a leak and they fixed themselves The spa was nice but when we checked in no information was given if you just went there or needed towels etc , Swimming pool was lovely room was clean beds comfy breakfast good variety powerful shower 
115313,Henry VIII,No Negative, Nice location with plenty of local shops cafes Really good to have a pool too esp at the price Its a lovely walk through Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace and Whitehall Buses are only a few minutes walk away and go directly to Oxford Road for shopping otherwise use the tube which is also close 
115314,Henry VIII, Single room next to lift shaft no sleep at all Needed to get up early to go to a meeting so went to bed early TV has very limited channels lots of babe stations ,No Positive
115315,Henry VIII, It was cold in the room The rubbish hadn t been removed from previous occupants It was overall a bit tatty and could do with some refurbishment , The location
115316,Henry VIII, Slightly ageing carpets and light switches could be cleaner , For the price the hotel was better than adequate room was fine bed comfortable and the pool and breakfast made for good value 
115317,Henry VIII, Air conditioner and shower didn t work The fan that was supplied was too noisy to leave on all night Opening the window resulted in the door banging all night Also the wind coming through went into the bathroom and made the bath panel moving that made the noise of a small dog barking all night Staff and hotel very good But had virtually no sleep in two nights, Swimming pool and sauna were excellent
115318,Henry VIII, Basically no room service tried calling three times in one night no answer Went down stairs for two glasses of wine had to wait for someone to come to the so called bar Glasses were filthy Got charged more than it said when I booked it would definetly not recommend ,No Positive
115319,Henry VIII, Room too small TV didn t work Air con didn t work Room too hot Very noisy Staff refused to give any discount on my room after complaint Could only give me 25 off a future stay I will not be staying again , Nothing
115320,Henry VIII, The decor a little tired Pillows were dreadful Had a cracked sink and bath panel but all worked Shower was okish but did the job for a cheap stay , The hotel for what you pay is good good location
115321,Henry VIII, Room far too hot with air con not working and impossible to turn down radiator Found quality of experience poor for 120 Very noisey outside with people walking about and shouting Had to have window open and on ground floor Corridor areas and rooms very tatty and unappealing Carpet wearing away etc Staff vacuuming outside the door directly banging it into the door at 8am Sunday morning Also staffs Todd outside door talking loudly on he radio , Central location was good as was the pool area Helpful reception staff printed off some documents for me 
115322,Henry VIII, Asked for a room with a view Could have been any view and I wouldn t have known Windows were extremely filthy and couldn t see a thing Iron or trouser press didn t work Heating refused to work Tv had no reception and the shower was terrible Seen more water from a light rain shower Lift was like something out of the twilight zone and terrified my wife Overall it was an over exaggerated luxury hotel , Good location
115323,Henry VIII, The room s were very very small the picture s were not accurate at all The hotel bar had a very poor selection of drinks , Breakfast was very good at the henry viii hotel Nice quiet location 
115324,Henry VIII, Shower head was partially broken so the water flow was pretty poor Also their was a stain on the duvet , Everything was just absolutely fantistic The poor the atmosphere the room was just perfect 
115325,Henry VIII, Much of the breakfast did not include gluten free options e g cereal was all wheat based It would help if potato products were labelled as GF or not, There was gluten free bread available Buffet breakfast had good choice for most
115326,Henry VIII, Awful breakfast Swimming in fat So I had toast instead Sausages looked half cooked Waited for more to be served out waited 15mins and gave up Bathroom was grubby room was like a bedsit stains on the bed worn tired and in need of restoration didn t feel comfortable and wanted to go home Tiles were loose in the bathroom hairs hanging down in there Mold and try to find the toilet flush is a mystery side mounted How odd , To be honest I was disappointed and will never stay there again Watch out for the 27 pound parking bill you have to pay for Although I selected parking on filter looking for hotels and Henry came up on the search with parking what they don t tell you is its 15 mins on foot in an underground dark parking facility not good if your a lone woman visiting 
115327,Henry VIII, Very small room Very small bed Very old carpets bathroom and furnitures The water when you shower takes a long time to go down the drains Needs a renovation asap , Very good location 5 10 min walk to underground and bus stations Everyday cleaning Everyday change of towels Very cheerful and helpful personnel 
115328,Henry VIII,No Negative, Even after I wrongly accused the house keeping of stealing money from my room the staff at Henry VIII maintained a professional yet empathetic manner Top notch class I highly recommend Henry VIII for location comfort and world class hospitality Sincerely a kind although tired Canadian chic
115329,Henry VIII, Wooden floors meant noise could be heard from other guests above unfortunately we had a school trip above so we didn t get much sleep The staff were very good and we did move to a room without double glazing so the next night was spent listening to the traffic and noise from outside ,No Positive
115330,Henry VIII, Air Conditioning didn t work so had to open the windows which meant the room stunk of chargrilled meat from the Greek restaurant Asked at reception and was told none of the AC was working as it d been turned off for winter Shower head only worked on a fixed central jet and couldn t be changed to a shower type spray There was litter on the floor from a previous guest Generally a bit unclean Hotel reception carpet the first customer impression was awful worn out patched and loose , The beds were comfy 
115331,Henry VIII, Room was a lot smaller than pictured Interior of rooms and hotel were dated The noise from outside the room was very loud from early on in the morning Noise from passing cars was quite loud , Location was good 
115332,Henry VIII, Dirty rim around the pool shower was hopeless very small TV made watching it difficult as had to swing the glass Reception weren t very welcoming they were polite but just off, Location clean easy check in check out
115333,Henry VIII, All great , Lovely street of 19th century appearance Beautiful small hotel with warm swimming pool Close to Paddington station Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall Friendly staff and good value for money 
115334,Henry VIII, Orange juice and bacon both tasted horrible Eggs were dry Bed was too firm , Room nice and clean Old building but presented ok Location ideal for Kensington attractions museums Royal Albert Hall Kensington Palace and Gardens Near to Paddington rail terminus but in a quiet location in a side street Good value if you can book far enough in advance 
115335,Henry VIII, The room was tiny just enough room for the bed and toilet Couldn t sleep well for the sound of trains Toilet door didn t close Asked for a room upgrade which we would pay for but was told the hotel was fully booked Air conditioning unit had lights flashing on it so the room was like a disco at night , From the outside the building looked lovley however on entering the reception area was a bit outdated 
115336,Henry VIII, I chose to pay when I arrive however a deposit of 90pounds 101euro came out of my account a few days before I arrived I paid cash when checking in with the knowledge that the deposit would be refunded into my account in 5 7 working days It has now been 9 working days and I have not received my money back and I inconveniently have to make expensive international calls in order to follow up on it , The hotel was nice and warm compared to the very cold and windy weather conditions outside
115337,Henry VIII, would have liked a softer mattress no shampoo conditioner had to ask on reception no drinking water in room all minor things, lovely warm pool sauna breakfast room large and breakfast offered good choice
115338,Henry VIII, Maybe the staff of the reception they weren t very kind and helpful but they knew do their work, I like so much possibility to enter in the spa and in the pool there aren t much hotels that offer this I have been very good in this hotel 
115339,Henry VIII, Shower was broke and had to get someone to sort it The pool was lovely and warm however The changing facilities were a joke there were only two changing cubicles at the side of the pool with no lockers There was nowhere to leave your belongings The shower was freezing cold and the sauna was not working , Room was nice Friendly staff Breakfast was very good 
115340,Henry VIII, The hotel seemed understaffed in reception and tired in appearance with some little things needing attention e g the air conditioner unit in our room made noises in the night even though it was switched off the bathroom door was water damaged the flooring was warped the bath chipped and in general the decor looked tired and a little old fashioned , The swimming pool was nice as were the staff The cleanliness standards were acceptable for us and the breakfast plentiful Lovely bacon and good fruit 
115341,Henry VIII, Decor could be updated but to be fair basic room booked and that is what it was , Location ideal for Kensington gardens and Hyde Park 15 mins walk from Paddington 
115342,Henry VIII, photos and description of the hotel were not accurate There were many repairs to be made in the bathroom And over all the hotel was not the 4 star accommodation it claimed to be , Location 
115343,Henry VIII, The bedroom was small but it is perfect for the likes of us tourists who are out all day sight seeing , The breakfast in Henry the VIII was excellent Really set us up for the day And the location is great very close by bus stop which would bring you into the city centre in 10 minutes 
115344,Henry VIII, The room was a bit poky but it was only a base so it didn t matter , It was a comfortable comfy hotel The lift was good It was quiet and the staff were pleasant 
115345,Henry VIII, The bar and restaurant was advertised but didn t seem to open Room was advertised as small but it was tiny barely room to move and there wasn t anywhere to put my case , Great location and good value accommodation 
115346,Henry VIII, It would be nice if the bar opened a little earlier in the evening as it would be nice to have a drink before going out , The staff are really helpful and very friendly the wifi was excellent I had to do a lot of work during my stay and I never once experienced a problem with the wifi The bedroom was spotless 
115347,Henry VIII, The hotel supposedly has 4 stars That might have been true 20 years ago but not anymore The interior is very dated and it s not as clean as I hoped I chose this hotel because it was cheap and it had parking It turns out that the parking is just on the road and there s no guarantee you ll find a spot When you do you have to pay around 65 to be standing there an entire day ,No Positive
115348,Henry VIII, D cor not very good Rooms and corridors smelt of smoke Bedroom very small virtually nothing worked properly i e Air con heating kettle television pixilated bathroom panels broken restaurant closed apart from breakfast and coffee tea machines wasn t working, good location
115349,Henry VIII, The fittings carpets decoration all need refurb Breakfast offered everything but all low standard There was absolutely no attention to detail , When I was looking it Appeared to offer good value for money
115350,Henry VIII, Room was tiny we couldn t leave the luggage open and be in the room at the same time also the a c was broken and lighted annoyingly all night when we asked to move to another room the staff member told us that the a c problem exsist in all rooms so we need to stay in our room , The location was amazing 10 minutes from Oxford street 
115351,Henry VIII, The coffee machine was spluttery and took a long time to work Wasn t too impressed by it , The breakfast on the sunday was far superior to the saturday morning There was a good range of options and the food appeared freshly cooked and prepared The staff were friendly 
115352,Henry VIII, Bed extremely uncomfortable pillows terrible Ordered a wakeup call for flight Never happened even though I rang to double check they had the request Carpet old and shabby Cold in the restaurant ,No Positive
115353,Henry VIII, Wifi was really slow and tv channels were all over the place room was small but manageable, Easy to get to lovely juice and apple in reseption great location to the park and easy walk into town or underground the swimming pool is really nice and warm
115354,Henry VIII, I found my room to be tidy but didn t feel it was the cleanest and the hotel could certainly do with a little updating For the cost my stay was pleasant enough I certainly wouldn t have wanted to pay anymore for this room though , Overall I found the staff to be friendly Location was great five minute walk from Paddington station which was perfect 
115355,Henry VIII, That I wasn t aloud to have the breakfast I paid for on arrival and now I cant get my money back The staff could work out with in them selfs that my breakfast was paid and refused me Refund is denied Don t want to stay at any other of their hotels ever Thank you,No Positive
115356,Henry VIII, There was just some dust under the bed I dropped something and it went under the bed But it was nothing major All in all we had a fantastic stay ,No Positive
115357,Henry VIII, Our only dislike is the shower the pressure and temperature are both wonderful but there isn t a curtain there s a little plastic wall so it didn t keep much heat in , We checked in a little earlier than anticipated and they had no rooms open except for a suite They upgraded us for free The employees were all very nice and cheerful Our room was great and the bed was comfortable The sauna is tiny but great and the pool was refreshing Breakfast included a ton of options and was fantastic The location was 5 minutes to two different metros as well as restaurants grocery stores and currency exchanges Hyde park is a two minute walk away and provides beautiful scenery We had a fantastic time 
115358,Henry VIII, Bacon and eggs could be higher quality Beans were slightly cold , Room was very clean location was great excellent value for money considering the pool sauna Staff was friendly Nice fruit at breakfast 
115359,Henry VIII, Decor is tired and needs updating carpets in the hall on level 5 had dribbles of bleach staining etc that made it look a little shabby The breakfast was average and the Coffee from the machines was TERRIBLE Also I extended my stay from 4 to 5 for 1 extra night agreed this with the reception and was told the price and said that was all fine but when I came to check out they said the price was higher than agreed with no explanation Also please note I did my search on Booking com for a hotel with car parking This hotel came up on the search but does NOT have parking and it cost me an additional 135 gbp for parking about 10mins away A little scam on the search criteria by the hotel and a little cavet is hidden in the small print Naughty , The room was warm and clean the hotel is very conveniently located for walking to most places if you like a stroll 
115360,Henry VIII, The doors and walls are thin as paper you can hear every single step and people passing by , The location was great really close to the undergrounds and buss stations There were many coffee shops and restaurants around the Bayswater Also the breakfast was really good 
115361,Henry VIII, Staff was rude unfriendly and insulting They would not speak English in front of guests and would talk about them I understood what they were saying and it wasn t nice The carpet was old and filthy The dining room was disgustingly dirty I was afraid to sit on the chairs they were so soiled I also found something weird in the milk and gave it to one of the waitresses and was never apologized to nor was the problem corrected ,No Positive
115362,Henry VIII, The apparently 4 star hotel is more like a bed and breakfast bedsit The initial room that I was allocated smelled absolutely terrible I requested to be moved and was initially told they had no more rooms I asked to speak to someone senior and then my request was honored Once in the new room which was a slight improvement I noticed an unpleasant human deposit in the shower This is my first time writing a review based on my bad experience HENRY you have a lot of improving to do if you want to be king , The only good thing was the location There are lots of shops opened to late 
115363,Henry VIII, Small room could not upgrade when checking in despite being promised over the phone that it would be possible bad quality bed kept moving and the head board fell off The air conditioning unit was too loud and kept waking us up,No Positive
115364,Henry VIII, I booked a double room because I thought the single rooms might be small My room had threadbare carpet was tiny and left no room to move, A good location in the centre of London
115365,Henry VIII, The hotel is old with tiny rooms and technical problems It was very cold when central heating went off in the first night Small lamps for the reading are not working Technical support came once but didnt fix it and left many dangerous glass pieces behind on the floor in the carpenter We cleaned it by ourselves Its almost not possible to watch TV without standing in the front of it angle position and size of screen Breakfast is nothing special you can get for the twice less money three times better English breakfast on the same street, The location is superior reception working well they are helpful Its nice to have a bath in the room 
115366,Henry VIII, To single beds pushed together Fell in between them twice and bathroom was dirty wooden floor was coming up would of not said a 4 star hotel , Staff were polite and good location 
115367,Henry VIII, Hairdryer blew out luke warm air Shower hard to turn on Breakfast Hot plates but luke warm food Sausages looked as if microwaved left them alone Otherwise OK , Room OK Bed comfy Nice sheets Swimming pool looked good Staff pleasant and cheery 
115368,Henry VIII, Breakfast was standard We did not always have warm hot water can be a pain if you like to shower warm Walls are thin we could hear the next doors guest snore hope he was alone in his room , Location is great close to everything big plus Swimming pool is great Sauna was okay
115369,Henry VIII, I didn t like the style of the room as we were given the room next to the lift and so was T shaped making it feel small, I liked the comfort of the bed and the location of hotel
115370,Henry VIII, The room was too small for a double bed The water was cold on the 2nd morning and the bedroom furniture was tired and damaged The cooked breakfast food was poor , The location is good and the hotel price was good
115371,Henry VIII, Unfortunetly the boiler broke down in the night and our room was very cold and still hadn t been fixed in the morning at 9 30 am so woke up cold in the night and couldn t have a shower before leaving the hotel so left to warm up in a near by cafe , Thought the hotel was in a good location 
115372,Henry VIII, Bathroom door didn t close no lock on it Was woken on first night by room service in error She did apologise for knocking on the wrong door , Really comfortable all round excellent breakfast Plan to come back at our nearest opportunity Fantastic location will recommend to friends
115373,Henry VIII, our room was very shabby and if you are not a lover of lifts forget this one they are so tiny we were on the 5th floor absolute night are felt like we were climbing the shard ,No Positive
115374,Henry VIII, The room was poor and not comfortabe had the smallest TV ever duvet was wafer thin as were the pillows Hair dryer was hopeless no iron but did have a trouser press no help if you want to iron a blouse shower took ages to heat to a decent temp and taps were very stiff , Breakfast was good with a good choice and the location was great
115375,Henry VIII, I was in a box room with the train line outside my window and the elevator the opposite side of the wall I didn t sleep well due to the noise Hard to get comfy due to lack of space in the room TV also did not work , Location was perfect for where I was working at the time 
115376,Henry VIII, Room was very noisy could hear everything in reception Complained several times regarding the noise of staff in reception Was then moved to a better room the following night , Location 
115377,Henry VIII, We are shocked this has been given a 4 star and will be contacting to feed back The room was smaller than a servants quarter in a state home We were in the atic The curtian was ripped with a hole in it also did not draw closed and fit Receiption staff told me that they will fix this and change in the morning and heard them talk to house keeping Returned home that evening and still not done The hindge of the cupboard was broken Dust on the celing fan You could not sit on the toilet as a sink was blocking your knees The swimming pool needed desprate repair And sauna door did not close properly causing heat to escape Cement was needed on stairs into pool Grouting needed with new paint What we saw in the picture advertising the hotel was heaverly photo shopped Therefor making the hotel site diseving Limited drinks in the bar No cocktails available Just beer sprits soft drinks and wine Staff show no concern and customer services really do not exist The hindge was fixed after complaining But why was this not picked up before room available Television was about 13 inch in width Air com does not work and the doors to the belcony did not open as locked Good job no fire Booking com filter showed this hotel as having parking however being disabled there was no parking Will say the receiption did get us a space on the hard stand Every language spoken but fluent English In our opion did not even speak my partners language I really would not recommend this hotel as better places in london and round the cornor More to write on trip adviser , The bed was comfortable And a range of food for breakfast 
115378,Henry VIII, The hotel was very tired and in need of refurbishment The room was like being in Henry VIII s broom cupboard and the breakfast was pretty disappointing In particular the coffee self service from a machine was vile Had to go out immediately after for proper coffee , The location was good and it is easy to find It was clean and adequate for our needs 
115379,Henry VIII, The beans at breakfast were cold and the other food items were not warm such as the sausages The coffee machine did not work properly The hotel provided large mugs to the customers yet the coffee machine only provided less than half a the mug of coffee I attempted to order a cappacino and the machine made the drink without any milk The toilet did not flush effectively it kept getting blocked The bathroom tap splashed a lot of water out of the sink when first turned on The TV in the room did not have a decent connection The lifts were too small so had to wait for lifts if already full 3 people in the lift would deem it to be full , The bed was comfortable room was warm the free wifi was easy to connect and fast Hotel provided complimentary toiletries in the bathroom which was convienient Complimentary chocolates magazines and the large bottle of water was nice Contacted reception due to blocked toilet and a plumber came to assist in less than 5 minutes 
115380,Henry VIII, The room bed its noisy got no sleep at all and when I complained was told to make the best of it so also insulting staff to add to it I would not call the scraps put out breakfast At 150 a night I should be given my money back as you can t call this a hotel never again , Nothing at all
115381,Henry VIII, The room was a bit small but very clean , Hotel is situated very close to central London Makes it quitre easy for shopping and to view places of interest 
115382,Henry VIII, No good staff tried to contact 3 times to confirm the booking and they put me in wait small room all Spanish staff very noisy and small room not clean , Rubbish hotel
115383,Henry VIII, Wifi was crap Room way too small TV faced wall unable to see it Wardrobe got caught in bed when tried to open as room was tiny No space even to open my suitcase Door of bathroom wasn t even a real door Extremely disappointed Room not like photos ,No Positive
115384,Henry VIII, Single room considerably smaller than double but cost almost as much, Clean comfortable helpful staff good breakfast small but good pool and sauna good location
115385,Henry VIII, Just a little modernisation needed, I took my 7year old daughter to see Aladdin and we stayed here for her birthday She cried when we had to check out She didn t want to leave We enjoyed staying here the service food and facilities was fantastic cannot be faulted The only thing is the hotel could do with a bit of modernisation but this would not stop me from coming back as we had a good time 
115386,Henry VIII, Smelt quite a lot of cigarette smoke on coming out of lift on the 2nd floor , Breakfast excellent value We stayed last year and wanted to come back My daughter loves the little swimming pool 
115387,Henry VIII, There should be a sign in the corridors that from midnight no noise or silence as some guests were too loud and didn t respect other people s sleep, Nice rooms and hotel overall
115388,Henry VIII, Cooked Breakfast was mediocre and selection incomplete No mushroom no cooked tomatoes the scrambled eggs were inedible and the quality of the sausages poor In the hotels defence the continental selection looked entirely satisfactory but that s no good when you want a full English The room was adequate functional and sparse My room 118 was next to the lift shaft so the motor could be heard throughout the night A friend of mine stayed same nights in a room on the 4th floor and his comment was that my room was positive luxury compared to his which doesn t sound good This hotel is ok if you are a one night stayer but I would not stay there again for multiple nights , Friendly staff and lobby comfort along with a good location
115389,Henry VIII, A bit worn but not overly so Do note the Lancaster Gate tube station Central line is set to be eliminated in January , It has a lift Which is a godsend in London Paddington area especially when you have a room on 5th floor Very clean Excellent staff WIFI full breakfast included in price 
115390,Henry VIII, Getting disturbed at 5 30am by reception for a taxi for the wrong room Without a proper apology Even when I said it was not for us he continue to say was I sure Really Yes I think I would know if I had a plane to catch from Heathrow , Breakfast was good Good location 
115391,Henry VIII, You can hear everything there is no isolation between the walls The pool is tiny , The staff was very kind and helpful always smiling with a great attitude The breakfast was good The room was very clean 
115392,Henry VIII, the air conditioning heater in the room didnt work the bed was uncomforatble and the door on the toilet was broken room 111 , the swimming pool was a nice addition to the stay
115393,Henry VIII, The breakfast could ve had more options and the hotel should have some way of providing some dinner options no cooking after 6 30pm and only sandwiches before The hallway and room also smelled like someone had been smoking there for some reason Maybe it was the carpet , The 5 10 minute walk from Paddington Underground was really convenient 
115394,Henry VIII, Double Room was quite small could just about squeeze past the bed to get to other side Bar didnt open until 8pm Not good if you fancied a drink before then , Buffet breakfast was excellent 
115395,Henry VIII, Room was very expensive Bar was closed Room was very small TV in room was tiny Bed in strange position and not centre of the room, Breakfast was nice Location was nice 
115396,Henry VIII, Breakfst awful Coffee machine not working and grotty and cleaning sign flashing Bed was teeny Don t stay in standard room if larger than size UK10 worst night s sleep ever Receptionist told me I should of noted bed measurements before booking Carpets worn Needs updating I will stick to Premier Inn in future, Not much
115397,Henry VIII, The staff was not knowledgeable about the airport buses and when or where they left from they gave us poor information and we ended up having to take a cab which cost a fortune , I like the pool and the location 
115398,Henry VIII, This is a very very shabby hotel The carpets were threadbare and a definite trip hazard especially in the main lobby reception area and on the stairs There are very small trip steps in the corridors that actually caused me to fall many times The last time I injured my hand and asked to make an entry in the accident book What accident book I was asked that says it all Health and safety need to take a close look at this hotel for hazards Also the bathrooms were very small if you were over 80kg you would not get in the bathroom , The breakfast was very good Plenty to eat and plenty of choice 
115399,Henry VIII, Although clean overall I found that the bathroom could have been better We had a large crack in the shower tray and jelly beans on the floor present throughout and prior to our stay , The pool and location
115400,Henry VIII, Room was a bit warm and the control was not working but I am sure this was a temporary glitch , Always enjoy our stay here The rooms are very nice and we like the whole feel of the hotel The swimming pool and breakfast are particular highlights 
115401,Henry VIII, Very inflexible with our booking On booking com website I added what I was looking for in the search bar stating a room for 2 adults and one 9 year old child it offered the rooms available at this hotel and having given the criteria I assumed the search would ONLY reveal rooms which were suitable for me thinking it was suitable else why is it on the list given my criteria I clicked and gave card details Booking was confirmed however I thought I had better check that this double would be suitable and I politely requested a small put up bed for the child as it showed a double room on my confirmation the hotel said no so I politely requested an extra pillow and duvet so we could make up a little bed on floor hotel said no I enquiries why not Health and safety Very Very inflexible booking com appealed for their help with my booking no luck I also spoke to manager she refused and refused to let me cancel as I was within 24 hours of arrival date Booking com were very helpful and couldn t understand the hotel s inflexible approach to my booking which was done in good faith and on the assumption that a little camp bed would be offered NEVER ASSUME Very expensive hotel for what was offered decoration tired in places breakfast very average cheap marmalade and jam mass market stuff coffee and tea from vending machine All in all poor disappointing really as a little more flexibility would ensure a happy customer not so ,No Positive
115402,Henry VIII, Hotel was booked as a double but it was two single beds pushed together the bathroom tiles on the floor was lose and dangerous to walk on the heating in the room didn t work and the window not closing properly ,No Positive
115403,Henry VIII, Do not think this hotel is for a 4 star level Rooms are way to small and bathroom was poorly done Plastic around the bathtub was broken and looked horrible Breakfast is I guess typical English like in some other hotels but not offering a variety of international food , The hotel is nice and cozy Location is very nice 
115404,Henry VIII, broken shower broken bathtub old carpets poor wifi The whole hotel needs a full refresh I don t understand how they got their 4 stars Even the breakfast was poor , Location is very good 3mns from Hyde Park 10mns from Paddington
115405,Henry VIII, A hotel that s needs a lot of love and TLC You know things arent good when the TV remote control doesn t work when the water doesn t drain from the sink when a double bed is pushed against one wall so you can get out of bed the other side and when the safe is so safe you can t get to it without being either a magician or a catorcinist And guess what no mention of Thomas the Tank engine railway line running under my room Not good Not good at all , Still wondering 
115406,Henry VIII, Main room was rather cold no bedside light on one side of the bed and light came in round the curtains , Good welcome very convenient location for our visit and generous bathroom 
115407,Henry VIII, The room was tiny but you couldn t fault it really as it contained everything you would need from hair dryer to trouser press , Great location close to shops and restaurants and just a short stroll to Hyde Park
115408,Henry VIII, The rooms were VERY small and even though we booked a double room the bed would not fit us , The breakfast was good and the location of fhe hotel convenient 
115409,Henry VIII, the room was a shoe box with the smallest Tv I have ever seen Very basic room not worth anywhere near the cost of the room Very disappointing, breakfast was nice the pool was nice and warm
115410,Henry VIII, This is not a 4 star hotel 1 star b b would be pushing it totally deceptive photos will stay at the Hilton next time considering it s the same price , Nothing 
115411,Henry VIII, Reception appearance could do with a make over , Loved the shower Hot hot hot Breakfast choices was good and the bed was comfy Real radiator so you got proper heat and a window you could open for fresh air 
115412,Henry VIII, uhm the carpet on the floor but this is London right , I liked the use of complimentary pool and sauna we got to relax quite well The breakfast as well was very varied and well prepared 
115413,Henry VIII, The size of the bed Too small , Perfect location for getting around and plenty of places to eat and drink locally Also liked the cold water drinks machine in reception
115414,Henry VIII, The room was meant to be a superior room however it was small a train roared past every ten minutes and the carpet was thread bare and dirty, The location easy access to central London and nearby tube station 
115415,Henry VIII, The hotel is old the elevator is not trustworthy The twin room is very small the bathroom is tiny The furniture is weary The hairdryer work a minute then you have to re charge it The rooms look bigger and nicer on the photos , The location is good it is though 10 min walk to Paddington The breakfast room is big enough the choice for breakfast is good for couple of days The staff is friendly and helpful The twin room is small but clean the same applies to bathroom Good for a couple of days if you spend most of the time sightseeing and enjoying the city 
115416,Henry VIII, The fan didn t work and kept blinking throughout the night The curtains stop just short of the floor which kind of defeats the purpose since all the cold air flows in There seemed to never be any forks around at breakfast one had to specifically ask for one which was a bit odd Very small issues basically , Big and spacious room including a Harry Potter style under stairs room and the breakfast was great Location was awesome One could leave the luggage even after check out which meant exploring London an extra day without lugging stuff around 
115417,Henry VIII, Generally tired decor and dirty No hot water and had to move rooms at midnight Offered us 9 discount for the inconvenience Breakfast was poor Cheap sausages powdered egg ,No Positive
115418,Henry VIII, Floors are creaky and annoying especially if you have neighbors who pace above you all night hotel is not sound proof and water pressure is terrible elevators are like a death trap Owners really need to invest in some renovations The exterior of the building is beautiful , The staff was very nice and accommodating reception and breakfast staff These folks have a hard job they have to sell a terrible product Breakfast was good though 
115419,Henry VIII, Keep out from room facing to the yard specially on the right hand side there is roofless tube line directly below windows with really loud noise But our room was changed very quickly to the street facing side , Nice hotel with a great location just at the edge of Hyde Park very good breakfast and helpfull staff willing to help at any time Swimming pool in reasonable size with quite small changing room is open till 11 p m 
115420,Henry VIII, Minimal rooms I found lower prices for the same room in a lower price and they don t respect his own best price guarantee Air conditioner doesn t work room hot because swimming pool below bathroom tooooo small noisy subway running below I reserved standar double two days and I paid expensive double room for the next five days but they don t gave me nothing bigger Advertise says chocolate wine bottle of wat and till now I didn t see nothing Ahhh comfortable but small bed and full of old carpets Thinking to call UK customers protection advice , The staff was friendly but four stars I m not sure it gets two 
115421,Henry VIII, Room very poor very hot and probably the worst room in hotel at a guess because of discount booking web site Bed uncomfortable felt like springs gone left back sore by morning air conditioning not working in a room that needed it to be place looking tired inside price does not reflect value for money Far better off staying in travel lodge consistency basic but works value for money , Breakfast OK nothing special
115422,Henry VIII, Very small room No tables at breakfast staff slow to clear plates etc it was very disorganised Pool a waste of time more like a bath sauna nowhere near hot enough , Close to two tube stations and Hyde park 
115423,Henry VIII, Very grubby hotel rooms tiny no room to get ready in desperate need off refurbishment swimming pool grubby and sauna not working only room for one person in there usless you want some one on your shoulders and once again staff do not even ask on depature if everything is ok which I find rather rude I would not stay here again, Nice breakfast
115424,Henry VIII, The restaurant breakfast staff came across as largely indifferent to customers needs and issues The scrambled eggs were consistently the worst I ve ever come across gritty and dry The free wifi kept dropping out despite good signal strength and it was frustrating having to re enter passwords all the time The furnishings and carpets in the common areas were starting to look quite shabby , The desk was staffed continuously and the desk staff were generally helpful and attentive The room was basic but comfortable and housekeeping generally paid good attention to detail 
115425,Henry VIII, No AC in all rooms faulty in our room Tiny TV with 5 channels not in English Very uncomfortable bed bed base was a twin with a queen mattress on top meaning that you are falling off the end of the bed due to overhanging Restaurant was not open at nights so no option to purchse food even though we were told by reception that it would be open Some of the bulbs in the room were blown UIneven corridors with sudden drops without signs to warn led to me tripping over , Breakfast was very nice with good variety to choose from Staff very friendly and professional Nice pool area and sauna
115426,Henry VIII, Dark dank and depressing Avoid this hotel at all costs It is not 4 star by any stretch of the imagination in fact I have stayed in better budget hostels ,No Positive
115427,Henry VIII, Breakfast wasn t very good Rooms were basic We could hear the person in the next room snoring Very bad bar facilities , Staff where friendly Location was great 
115428,Henry VIII, We ve stayed at this hotel on three different trips It has gotten shabbier as the years have gone by and maintenance has been ignored I expect small rooms in London but the value just isn t there anymore We ll try another hotel when we come back to London in 2018 , Great location near Hyde Park and other attractions Plenty of dining options nearby 
115429,Henry VIII, After 10 days the breakfast became very boring same choices everyday Also didn t like that there was only fat free yoghurt and the fruit was fairly bland tasting would have been nice to have fried or poached eggs for a change , The location and the friendliness of the Staff who all seemed to be Spanish 
115430,Henry VIII, Air conditioning did not work in the whole hotel room too hot old not modern inside very basic noise from next room people talking bed not comfortable would not stay there again Bad choice of hotel , Staff friendly
115431,Henry VIII, Shower didn t work The shower has got to work Paid for double bed Only single Room was small but OK In a corner 3 rooms very close Quite noisy Staff didn t do anything when told of problems Apologised for shower But no offer to get snyone to contact Showing to age , Location worked Price was OKish Wouldnt have wanted to pay anymore Staff at check in was nice Staff at check out not bothered 
115432,Henry VIII, Decor size of rooms quality of bedding were not what one would expect for a 4 star hotel Scrambled egg was disgusting possibly made from powdered eggs, Good selection for breakfast Good pool Easy walking distance to tube station
115433,Henry VIII, The rooms are very very small If you have two large suitcases forget it It is either you or the suitcases There is a train that goes by every so often Mainly in the daytime but you can also hear it early evening , Location location location But that all depends on what one is looking for This hotel is within walking distance from Paddington and close to one of the stops before that on the Circle Line the beltway line The hotel seems to cater to people from the Iberian peninsula so the hotel staff is very friendly 
115434,Henry VIII, Inside the hotel is very run down staffed by uninterested clueless Spanish staff with a very poor command of English The dining room is located in the basement and is airless and hot The food on offer for breakfast was appalling Hot food served barely warm with a broken down hot drinks machine Cheapest cereals and sliced bread provided The bedrooms are very spartan and the provision of basic toiletries virtually non existent It seems as though the owners are using this hotel solely as a means to generate revenue without spending a penny on the building or its amenities This is a great shame as it could be an excellent place to stay , The location was excellent for visiting museums and tourist attractions in central London Very close to Queensway Underground station 
115435,Henry VIII, I couldn t work the air conditioning unit and the room was very warm I experienced the same problem the last time I was there I was woke up around 6ish by a loud gushing noise like something firing up which then continued to drone on quite noisily ovens boiler My breakfast wasn t that pleasant I didn t like the cereal choice so opted for scrambled egg which was like rubber I had breakfast at 7 15 so it should have been quite fresh The croissants were very hard and dry , Very clean Quiet location I asked for a quiet room and that s what I got 
115436,Henry VIII, The heating was broken They didn t tell me until I asked them how to get it to work Very dismissive Apparently they don t guarantee heating Very odd Breakfast was average I ve stayed in a similar location paid half the price had a bigger room nicer decor heating and a better breakfast Disappointing ,No Positive
115437,Henry VIII, The bed mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable Noisy patrons on the second night made the bed situation worse We left the hotel at 7 30 am the next day frankly relieved not to be spending any more time at the Henry VIII, Location perfect Staff courteous and professional 
115438,Henry VIII, There was nothing I didn t like A tiny criticism was at breakfast I was taken to my table but given no advise on how to help myself to everything but it wasn t a big deal , Loved the efficient yet laid back manor of the hotel loved how easy it was to access the pool and although the pool was a little dated I loved it The room was comfy and a fair size The location was great
115439,Henry VIII, I wish the bed was a little more comfortable and the shower had better water pressure , Great professional staff Hotel was very clean and had many extras that made the stay very pleasant Good location with shopping and train stations very close I would definitely stay at this hotel again 
115440,Henry VIII, Not worthy to pay that amount of money I dont know why it is 4 star hotel bathroom very stink even the door closed still lingering the smell in the bedroom aircon broken We called the receptionist staff but she told us that she cannot do anything about It We booked double bed but the 2 single bed joined together even the headboard is too far apart Location nice breakfast but the rest very bad Not worthy to pay that amount of money I dont know why it is 4 star hotel bathroom very stink even the door closed still lingering the smell in the bedroom aircon broken We called the receptionist staff but she told us that she cannot do anything aboit It We booked double bed but the 2 single bed joined together even the headboard is too far apart You can hear the noise of the underground tube , nice breakfast
115441,Henry VIII,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location I was given a very nice spacious twin room the staff were all very friendly helpful breakfast was plentiful and offered good choice and late check out was very helpful
115442,Henry VIII, All I want really from a hotel room is a Good Shower and unfortunately the room I was in had a rubbish shower 2 temps Freezing and scalding and not enough pressure , The location is brilliant and the staff friendly
115443,Henry VIII, Room smelt of cigarette smoke when we arrived Not really their fault though because guests aren t supposed to smoke Room was pretty small but we were in the lowest category so that was fair enough Coffee from the machine at breakfast wasn t very nice , Great to have the pool and the sauna Great location friendly staff 
115444,Henry VIII, Room was a lil cramped and the elevator claustrophobic but really couldn t complain much , Location was very good Staff extremely friendly and helpful Plenty of sights transportation and restaurants within walking distance Great breakfast 
115445,Henry VIII, Nowhere to leave luggage as the room was not ready so we had to carry our cases with us for a while which was inconvenient The bar was NEVER opened during our stay and there was nowhere in the hotel just to sit during the day to have a cup of tea or coffee , Excellent choice for breakfast nice eating area with tablecloths Small but clean room Good hotel for location if you just wanted somewhere to sleep 
115446,Henry VIII, The basic rooms are indeed very basic very tiny no space around the bed small bathrooms and mine had a noisy air conditioning unit , Staff and hotel facilities very good Location was spot on just a brisk 10min walk to the nearest tube station Breakfast wasn t over priced and the selection was fine as long you get in early 
115447,Henry VIII, No air conditioning and unable to open window enough to get some cool air Although the reception area was cooled the guest rooms were like an oven Many guests were very irate , Good location
115448,Henry VIII, AC is not guaranteed in the rooms Get a fan , Be careful booking this property It is a 2 star The hotels location is where it says it is in London You can sit on the toilet and wash your hands at the same time You can see the TV really well from the bed 
115449,Henry VIII, See above, The bed and bedding were very very basic the safe one of the lights and air conditioning did not work in room One half of dining room was too cold with air conditioning and the breakfast was cheep and cheerful food The bathroom was tiny 
115450,Henry VIII, I was given the wrong room I paid for a double and they kept telling me that they would change me another one but they did not the shower did not work the first day the other two days it work improperly The staff always has excuses about why they could not give me a manager to talk to Worst stay in London ever and so expensive Incredible they still in business Uncaring irresponsible robbery , The breakfast was good
115451,Henry VIII, The rooms were smaller than expected and toilet privacy could be an issue however for a 1 night stay it was adequate The young lady on reception was under considerable pressure to checkout many guests at the same time which led to quite a lengthy queue and some irate guests It would have been better if she had some assistance , The breakfast was good with a reasonable selection of cooked or continental breakfast The staff were very friendly and helpful 
115452,Henry VIII, Don t get fooled it s not a four star hotel Maybe three Interior is completely outdated The girl in reception was nice and friendly but she was trying to do a work of two Checking out took us 30 minutes , Great location helpful staff breakfast was very good 
115453,Henry VIII, Wasn t sure that the property s star rating was right 3 star is just about right but the room facilities were a little wanting, Friendly Staff Great Location for transport links good breakfast easy check in and out 
115454,Henry VIII, room very dated sink in the bathroom plug did not work and could only get a dribble of cold water the shower was just as bad AIR CONDITIONING DID NOT WORK the room was very hot there were fans in the room these were noisey had to sleep with window open that was noisey as well the pillows were not fluffy it was like sleeping on rocks Breakfast was not the best cold bacon undercooked potatoes only egg choice was over cooked scrambled eggs there was a fruit choice but is was in big slices making it hard to eat we went to use the pool no towels no lounger to relax on THE SIDES IN THE POOL WERE FILTHY we would not use it because of the fithy scum all around the sides, The location very good reception very helpfull waiting on staff very good
115455,Henry VIII, Staff not friendly staff also struggled with understanding English Bed was very uncomfortable and you only had one not so soft pillow to sleep with Sauna in pool also didn t work carpet throughout premises was dirty and well worn, Location
115456,Henry VIII, The breakfast staff were very rude and unfriendly Our room had a view of 3 very high concrete walls right outside the window and an air conditioning unit so couldn t see daylight The pool area was small had no chairs or loungers to sit on and the sauna was very very small , The r ception staff were very friendly and helpful The location was fab walking distance to a lot of things Has a good local pub and a fab Greek restaurant just up the street Great breakfast Hotel looks lovely from outside 
115457,Henry VIII, The bed was small uncomfortable A C didn t work Ceiling fan is great with window open the sound of the trains is hard to sleep, Location breakfast variety
115458,Henry VIII, Nothing, Well this hotel is supposed to be a4 star so that s why I booked it it s never seen a 4 star 2 star at a push it s very dated and the didn t have ac so the room was like s sauna there was no end of people complaining about this the rooms are very small also I new it wasn t going to be great because of the price but it states 4 stars I think this needs looking at asap
115459,Henry VIII, This isn t a bad budget hotel But it is not 4 Maybe a good example of you get what you pay for but grossly misleading classification , The staff were helpful and friendly and the hotel is in a good location 
115460,Henry VIII, The air conditioning didn t work in either of the 2 rooms we rented Bedrooms a little small, Friendly staff Good location Pool was good if a little warm
115461,Henry VIII, Hotel a little tired with some worn out carpeting but great value for money , Fan in room as air con wasn t working Nice swimming pool good breakfast friendly receptionist
115462,Henry VIII, The rooms were old and tired as was most of the hotel they were very very small and the air con unit didn t work the hotel was very dated with carpets that looked like they had been there since Henry 8th last visited I honestly can t understand why this hotel is classed as a 4 star as the swimming pool must be tidal with the tide mark that surrounded the pool that come off when rubbed with your finger I ve had warmer ice creams than the what the sauna was I didn t feel at all safe in the lift and expected at any given minute to plummet to my death with the rickety old bone shaker of a lift they have better lift facilities going into a mine shaft this is literally one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in and travelling to London on a regular basis from now on I ll stay in a travel lodge Very poor all round , The breakfast wasn t bad
115463,Henry VIII, Needed a bit of refurbishment, Breakfast was good good range Lovely to have a hotel with a swimming pool in London Good location near to Hyde Park and tubes Friendly staff
115464,Henry VIII, Humidity smell in the bathroom Constant noise Overall the hotel is poorly maintained , 5th floor room was OK this followed our 2 adult stay on a second floor room which was too small Friendly and enthusiastic reception personnel
115465,Henry VIII, Tired decor and carpeting that needed updating Our room was comfortable but bath and bath panel were damaged Also no hot water in the bathroom sink, Friendly staff and comfortable accommodation 
115466,Henry VIII, Very small room Underground passes every minute from early morning to past midnight above surface and just below the hotel Not clean smelly very old and badly maintained Black spots and humidity in the bathroom It must have been quite a good hotel long time ago needs much refurbishment and maintenance , Breakfast is somewhat OK The reception staff very helpful and enthusiastic 
115467,Henry VIII, The hotel itself was a little noisy think we were located below a generator, The location was great for tube station a deal for sight seeing Breakfast was lovely plenty choice Had a balcony in our room with a lovely view 
115468,Henry VIII, Decor is a bit dated and worn but everywhere is clean Something funny about the scrambled eggs like they were powdered Nice swimming pool but limited spaces to change shower Makes you feel very exposed , Easy location near bustling Queensway option of two tube stations 3 lines and close to Hyde Park Got upgraded from double yo triple room so plenty space Tea and coffee in room always welcome Good shower plenty towels and gels etc Finally a place with common sense French doors opened for fresh air but also some air conditioning ceiling fan AND a desk fan Decent choice for breakfast And a small swimming pool Issue with remote control resolved on asking 
115469,Henry VIII, The hotel was tired looking worn carpets The pool was not very good photos misleading Rooms small and some noise from near by tube line , Location for my trip was good
115470,Henry VIII, liked a lot about the hotel although thought the bar opening times could be reviewed as not tended to opened during the day and closed at 11pmthought this may be more midnight TV was small in my room , Very clean and staff very helpful ample choice at breakfast my family loved the breakfast
115471,Henry VIII, My room over looked the tube not a major issue but very noisy Breakfast was very average I had pre paid for it but only bothered turning up twice on a 4 night stay Great little cafe 50 yards down the road , Great location and friendly staff
115472,Henry VIII, Rooms and corridors could do with an update They seem very worn and could do with a little tlc Also slow closing doors would be good as room doors slam shut Not good for residents wanting a lie in or for little fingers , Great location friendly reception staff Our 2nd stay and would stay again 
115473,Henry VIII, The size of the room spoilt the trip It was advertised as a 4 star and to me the hotel was a one star Tiny grim rooms , Location near tube Bed was ok Had a tv Bathroom ok 
115474,Henry VIII, Broken sink doors and windows not closing properly in the first room Taking full day to find another room Beds mattresses could have used a replacement several years ago Breakfast are very monotonous especially if staying for more than a few days , it s within a walking distance to central London locations 
115475,Henry VIII, Room was small Just barely room for the bed , Nice location short walk to Kensington Park and bus stops and only a couple extra blocks to an underground station 
115476,Henry VIII, A standard double for two would have been very cramped Better for a single traveller , Good location for transport into central London with Paddington tube station just a short walk away Pool and sauna are a modest size but open late and added to my stay 
115477,Henry VIII, the staff was rude and they did not speak fluent english Unbelievable for a London hotel close to Hyde Park Especially the Spanish girl in the reception could not understand words as outstanding and remaining in order to explain us the situation with the bill When someone works in a reception should be able to understand and speak the international language and not to be rude with the customers that pay him , I chose the hotel due to the location in the end it was the only good thing 
115478,Henry VIII, The staff was extremely rude and with a real bad knowledge of english They barely understood english The one receptionist informed us that the payment took place before our arrival and we did not owe anything and the next day a rude girl in the reception informed us that we had to pay the full amount and no payment had taken place Moreover when we request from the reception a taxi they said that they order one but the taxi arrived half an hour later and when i went to reception to request to call the taxi again they answered to me Get a black cup taxi from the road Finally in the bathroom s sink there were brown stains that i had to clean them by my own when we arrived , Only the location It was close to hyde park amd 5 minutes walk from the queensway station central line 
115479,Henry VIII, The first room we had was way too small squeaky floorboards in room and rooms above no proper changing facilities at pool sauna can only house 2 people double bed not really a standard double very small for two people air con didn t work in first room having to pay to move to another room, location and the breakfast
115480,Henry VIII, No fridge in the rooms, Tiny room but comfortable double bed Clean room served its purpose for 5 days Good breakfast Air con in the room No mini bar but daily room service 
115481,Henry VIII, Air conditioning did not work There was a desk fan in the room so it was obvious the hotel were aware the air con was broken It was the hottest day of the year 32 degrees so it was very uncomfortable Not good enough to have facilities that are broken Carpet very worn disgustingly old and looked dirty Repairs had been made to the wardrobe door with polyfilla Very cramped in the room Tv kept turning itself off and could only be seen from one side of the bed Lots of broken things that needed repairs , Location very good staff quite helpful overall pretty clean no dust liked the fact I could open the window lots of places keep the windows locked BUT I needed to open it due to the air con not working 
115482,Henry VIII, It s a bit faded and worn and without a restaurant does not really rate 4 stars The pool and sauna are well kept but very small not suitable for any serious exercise , The Henry VIII is really well located close to Queensway tube station and only a 15 minute walk from Paddington It s right beside Kensington Gardens and a short but pleaseant walk takes you right to the sights The buffet breakfast is simple but tasty and the cleanliness levels and staff are really good 
115483,Henry VIII, my t v didnt work no signal so the tech guy came in and worked half an hour changed cables and still didnt work so i got a compensation but only after i asked for it you would expect a more professional approach plus the place is all a bit shaby not a 4 star hotel maybe 2 , nice and basic not a 4 star hotel a bit old hotel from the inside staff were trying their best cahnged my room after i asked them cause it was too small and the neighbours noisy breakfast basic 
115484,Henry VIII, The air conditioning working Comfier beds and duvets Frozen potatoes, Pool was divine Hotel is dated but kept very clean Lovely staff apart from the lazy fat waitress
115485,Henry VIII, the hotel is old and tired my room was about the same size as my walk in closet at home and the AC for the entire building did not work , location is great
115486,Henry VIII, Stained carpets Size of room and lack of ventilation Bathroom standard folding door entrance TV very small and view blocked , The reception team were friendly and efficient 
115487,Henry VIII, Hotel is old and needs to be renovated soon i guest that s why the prices are so good However our room was clean , Good location good price nice staff
115488,Henry VIII, I specifically chose this hotel because it was close to our meeting the following day and your website stated there was parking which I understood to mean that there was off road parking There wasn t Apart from that major inconvenience I didn t sleep well as the mattress was very hard The room was very small and there was a recurring noise outside the window every 5 or 10 minutes throughout the night which exacerbated my already restless sleep hard mattress Bathroom door kept opening spontaneously and sink was a bit blocked More like 3 than 4 , Apart from scrambled eggs rubbery and chewy breakfast was good Dining room staff were very friendly 
115489,Henry VIII, Room very small no air conditioning bathroom very very small and cramped with no ventilation shower basic and very cramped room very warm uncomfortable if weather is warm with very little ventilation their is a room fan but just circulating warmth around very expensive for price of room, The only thing good is location less than 10 min walk to subway car park
115490,Henry VIII, I had a twin room with a friend and was just chatting over a cup of tea before bed and next door banged on wall as well as coming to the door aggressively We also received a call from reception Quietly chatting g should be accepted as norm so will not use again as you can t be silent I would ha e understood if we were noisy,No Positive
115491,Henry VIII, Room with less than 10m2 for 180 is by far too much Impossible to stay in the room as bed took half of the space Windows are not noise isolated and we were directly exposed to the train noise, Good reception and welcome
115492,Henry VIII, Room No 1 was tiny immediately outside the window is some piece of equipment heating aircon I think that was permanently on sound levels varying from loud to very loud If that wasn t bad enough disturbed sleep man on reception reacted to my comment as if I was the first person ever to complain about it Reception area is tired and looks grubby ,No Positive
115493,Henry VIII,No Negative, The beds were large and really comfortable we loved having a bath in our bathroom and the location was really central Fan in the room was great for hot London nights 
115494,Henry VIII, Very dated Small tv Facilities unclean Baby bed dirty and unclean Given a free upgrade dread to think what we would have got , Bathroom was nice 
115495,Henry VIII, In need of upgrade Noisy trains from rear rooms Hair dryer not working Shown to table at breakfast but no explanation of what to do , Breakfast was good 
115496,Henry VIII, Unclean carpets on 5th floor corridor unclean kettle unclean carpet noisy staff showing new guests rooms at 1 and 2 am noisy lift filthy curtains no option to check door locked from inside couldn t leave windows open as you could get in from another room along roof Single solo men on sofas with no apparent reason not reading or waiting in reception made us feel uncomfortabe on arrival reception area dark and crumbs etc all over the carpet scruffy, Quiet location clean bathroom and towels and sheets good breakfast
115497,Henry VIII, The room was so small The TV didn t work The breakfast was ok the English breakfast was on additional cost Breakfast ended at 10 no chance to get a further cup of coffee at 10 01 , The location is great 5 minutes walk to the next tube station of central line A 24h shop a pub and two restaurants just a second away Fast WiFi connection in all the hotel 
115498,Henry VIII, Cleanliness could of been better the beding was filthy stained and the hotel bar was only open from 8 11pm, Great location the staff are really friendly and the pool and sauna was a good facility to use
115499,Henry VIII, The room was nothing to write home about and bed was too small for the price we paid 150 is a lot to pay for 1 nights stay Rooms were too tiny, Location was great 
115500,Henry VIII, can t see why it was a 4 star seemed more like a 2 or at best 3 i believe other hotels in the area probably offer better value better location and better facilities, not much to like really location ok but other hotels in bayswater have better locations
115501,Henry VIII, This is a 3 star hotel at best not the 4 stars it is advertised as 170 for a very small room is a lot of money They have air con but it is switched off I was worried about road noise with the window open humid day but as it happens it wasn t a problem , Close 10 mins walk to Paddington station Good Greek restaurant close by Halepi Small pool was good on the humid day I was in London Tea coffee provided Breakfast was pretty good
115502,Henry VIII, Two single beds joined together poorly to make a double bed Poor quality ingredients used for breakfast Hotel appears tired in places for instance carpet was worn in places , Good location not on a busy road
115503,Henry VIII, We were given a key to the wrong room and proceeded to walk into a room which had people s stuff in which could have been very embarrassing for both parties if the people had been in the room at the time We were understanding with the staff and didn t make a fuss When returning to the hotel the next night our keycard had stopped working on our lock so had to go and ask them to fix it Luckily we were on ground floor but if we d been on 4th as per our original room it would ve been very annoying Asked if we could cancel the second night as our plans had changed told a flat no by front desk staff It was ok but I wouldn t stay here again , Nice pool good sauna
115504,Henry VIII, It s not the most stylish hotel you ever stayed in I m 6 2 I ask for a double bed so I can sleep diagonally across the bed when 2 single beds are pushed together it s not comfortable And the lighting was harsh , The front desk staff were super helpful and friendly The location is great 5 minutes walk from Paddington station And it s great value for money 
115505,Henry VIII, There was a huge disgusting cockroach in my room so horrible that I am now terrified of hotels in general when I complained the staff just moved me to another worse room and refused to make any other amends for this disgusting experience They told me they had one very small mouse recently but never cockroaches well that s reassuring isn t it ,No Positive
115506,Henry VIII, The room was dirty the sheets had clearly not been changed and the staff were extremely unhelpful I decided to look for another hotel to stay at and will be requesting a refund ,No Positive
115507,Henry VIII, Sound proofing in room 507 was absolutely appalling This room should not be allowed to be let Plus very unsecure with a flimsy wooden door separating the two rooms , The location and price
115508,Henry VIII, The hotel is tired especially in the common areas Staff are not over friendly especially in the restaurant area at breakfast TV and air con didn t work properly , Good location 
115509,Henry VIII, I had the room 3 ifyou get it do t take it you can hear every single noise from outside espacialy early morning , The breakfast was great there was a choice for everyone food was tasty and fruit nice and fresh only the apples had Wax onthem wich is pretty unhealthy The room was just average could be modernised abit more the bathroom was great and spacious not deficult to use and the water pressure amazing The swimming pool was nice and warm and quiet at the time i went there Plus they close it really late so you can have a nice swim before sleeping
115510,Henry VIII, Kids swimming classes are given in the pool so its noisy and full of kids Elevator is so slow Room is extremly slow Wifi cuts off sometimes , Location is not bad 10 minutes walk from station 
115511,Henry VIII, The Swimming pool was a little small and there was no proper changing rooms but minor point really as the lift is close by I just got ready in my room instead , I frequently stay in a Marriott Hotel but this is a much cheaper hotel and I got what I expected Most important factor to me was cleaniness this was a very clean hotel really important towels bed linen all beautifully white Breakfast was very well presented and there was lots to choose There is a few good places to eat nearby and its close to tube stations Also the staff were all pleasant 
115512,Henry VIII, Not really a dislike but the room was as small as possible while still containing the bed However the bathroom was very nice with comfortably roomy shower C est la vie in London , Surprise the breakfast was a full English not simply Continental as advertised Very pleasant helpful staff allowed us to check in an hour early 
115513,Henry VIII,No Negative, We have stayed here a number of times and it is always a great place to stay It is convenienty located by Hyde Park and the tube and has a great selection of breakfast goodies Staff are very friendly and helpful
115514,Henry VIII, I booked in via booking com The mix up began when I arrived at the hotel The room was too small and then I was told I can have an upgrade this did not happen The lack of clarity and mix ups No GM in a 115 room hotel Front Office manager takes care things poorly No fridge TV is minuscule inside drawers are dirty, Breakfast was okay Cleanliness in rooms is good lobby is dated All staff are all Spanish why is there no English person working for a hotel in London Swimming pool is okay The English theme of Henry Viii is all that is left of the English Breakfast staff are nice and clean Location is easy to get to the city and A40 Area resturants are not the best Best to go the Westbourne for High End 
115515,Henry VIII, The mushrooms in the breakfast weren t nice it was almost like they were pickled , Bed really comfy bathroom and bedroom clean good wifi signal 
115516,Henry VIII, I wouldn t say the hotel is a 4 more of a 3 The Breakfast was mediocre many of the pastries were rock hard There was quite a bit of dust in our room and the loo roll holder was broken They didn t replenish the tea and coffee facilities in our room for the second night of our stay , Good location quiet yet within easy reach of many places including Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens The hotel has a pool and although I didn t go in it looked quite nice 
115517,Henry VIII, Room clean enough but very small and too warm Paint flaking off the bathroom ceilng Hotel Very old fashioned i choose it for the pool but on a Sunday morning its used for childrens swimming lessons Local Shops do not buy from the shops just up the street they charge stupidily , 2 positives tube station 5 to 10 minutes walk away bars and restaurants close by 1 positive for the hotel is the staff where friendly 
115518,Henry VIII, Did not feel it was 4 as advertised First room was unacceptable and when we complained although they moved us the staff did not seem happy about this nor particularly helpful , Swimming pool 
115519,Henry VIII, Very basic facilities and small rooms However wasn t a problem as we were out all day and only sleeping there , Very clean hotel and great location 
115520,Henry VIII, Only Spanish TV channels reception under charged me on check in neither of us noticed but they then proceeded to ring my room at 11 30pm to ask for the extra money Had to go down I reception barefoot and half asleep to do this A little extreme for 5 , Easy to find close to shops and 2 major tube stations 
115521,Henry VIII, The breakfast rates as one of the worst we have ever had in a London hotel The food items though plentiful were not fresh when we went to eat at 9am The bread roll s and pastries were both too hard to eat We even had to queue to press the button on the drinks machine for a hot drink The water was not hot enough to make a cup of tea and the coffee was lukewarm You are clearly not catering for the British market , room although small was nicely decorated and very clean with clean and fresh bed linen 
115522,Henry VIII, I was told free checkout until 1pm I asked reception if it was possible to have later checkout until 3pm and was told this would be a charge of 20 I was then asked for 40 as the late checkout until 1pm was not free Inaccurate information was given lack of communication through staff members , The balcony was lovely close to shops and places to go 
115523,Henry VIII, very small rooms 8m2 old hotel you can hear every noise from everywhere I could hear every noise from the next room elevator etc There is a railway very close so you can hear train all the time Terrible I went to reception to change the room but of course the only available room was more more expensive etc Would never go there again, breakfast was solid 
115524,Henry VIII, Parking was a nightmare we thought the hotel had parking facilities as it appeared to show this on the website so kept having to ensure parking meters were kept fed , The central location was ideal for our trip and close within walking distances to shops restaurants and parks etc
115525,Henry VIII, Breakfast is self service buffet style so plenty of it but poor quality Limited bar on site but good pub 50 yards away The A C was temperamental and a bit uncontrollable in my room , Good sized room and bathroom Location is about 350 yards from Queensway tube station Lots of local shops and bars in Queensway and a few close by 
115526,Henry VIII, The only thing was the shower which was over the bath This was not very powerful and hard to keep a suitable temp either too hot or too cold , The Staff was very helpful We had come down to take part in the moonwalk which is a marathon walk 26 2 miles through the streets of London through the night on the Saturday and had the hotel booked for the Sunday Although check in was not until 2pm and we arrived at 9 30 and had our room ready for 11 00 They even stored our bags the day before Brilliant service The room was very comfortable 
115527,Henry VIII, Booked a double but allocated a twin on arrival Swapped O K after we returned to reception Rooms too small but this often the case in London Premises old and tired needs redecorating Pool not available due to a technical problem on the day we arrived Also unable to use sauna steam room for the same reason TV in room only 12 inch Reception staff disinterested and appeared to help grudgingly pretending to not understand English very well No parking on the premises but used another hotel about 200m away , The pub down the road on the opposite side of the street was welcoming with good food at reasonable prices 
115528,Henry VIII, Room was small but this is expected in London , Swimming pool lovely quiet location Plan on going back with my family 8 min walk from Paddington tube station 
115529,Henry VIII, The shower in my room didn t work initially They did send a guy to fix it but this wasn t in time for me as I had to leave for a meeting , Lovely location and the staff were helpful when I phoned needing to arrive and check in earlier than anticipated 
115530,Henry VIII, Dark and dreary breakfast room very small sauna more like a cupboard small pool with noisy kids for swimming lessons, Location close to a choice of restaurants and near beautiful Kensington gardens
115531,Henry VIII, Hotel was in need of refurb a very typical small basic London B B style hotel An OK place to stay but not somewhere to have guests meet you, Single room was clean and of expected size bed was comfortable and you had a sense that the staff was trying
115532,Henry VIII, Carpets filthy room so tiny we couldn t even sneezed no cold water on the tap and shower breakfast really down to basics air conditioner not working in the room I didn t mind about having only Spanish people around us staff customers as I understand but it might be disturbing , Frank the guy from the reception has been fantastic and really accommodating I would credit our stay to his only kindness or else I would have left our daughter found the swimming pool great and pool water was warm 
115533,Henry VIII, The floor in my room creaked every time I would walk through it Nothing major just a little annoying , Great staff Walking distance to Paddington Train Station and Queensway underground made it easy to get anywhere in London Excellent Breakfast 
115534,Henry VIII, English breakfast was cold tried to give a double room with 2single beds put together and the bar was not open , The location from London centre and the local high st was excellent 
115535,Henry VIII, The room was very small and compact but had everything we could have wanted , Everything we needed in the room A very good breakfast with plenty to choose from 
115536,Henry VIII, Dated decor and looking tired I booked a superior single but was told that this option doubles up as a standard single There was nothing superior about this room , Location good staff helpful 
115537,Henry VIII, The cooked breakfast was pretty poor low quality ingredients , Spacious room friendly staff great location but best of all a swimming pool and sauna 
115538,Henry VIII, The staff spoke some English but it was not their first language and often simple questions received odd answers or none at all The hotel also appeared to be home to some refugees who refused to respect privacy and were loud despite us having a young baby trying to sleep even after we asked them to be quieter Breakfast was Ok but cleanliness and the decor left a lot to be desired , The location and swimming pool were great 
115539,Henry VIII, the bed was not as comfortable as expected Needed more toiletries in the bathroom only one small soap was there , The location of the hotel cannot be any better The room was OK size wise but had all the required facilities such as ironing board trouser s press tea and coffee facilities We only stayed one night but getting such quality in the centre of London at a very reasonable price is excellent 
115540,Henry VIII, Breakfast was poor the quality of the produce was low Limited choice not of a high quality The room the floor boards creaked badly I thought I was at at sea in a Old fashioned ship The rooms are in need of real modernisation The shower was poor not stopped at a hotel with a tap mixer shower Poor The hotel had a feel of a contractors hotel more like a hostel than a quality hotel, Not a great deal location was perhaps the only good thing about this hotel
115541,Henry VIII,No Negative, A great welcome and smiles at check in On arrival there was a card box of chocolates and a lovely bottle of wine were in my room to congratulate me on my birthday It was totally unexpected what a wonderful surprise The bed linen was spotless and the room and bathroom scored 10 10 for cleanliness The swimming pool was of an ambient temperature available from 7am until 22pm so convenient I would most definitely recommend The Henry VIII Hotel and shall most certainly stay again 
115542,Henry VIII, The air conditioner didn t work as it kept beeping and giving an error message so I switched it off Thankfully a working ceiling fan was available I did notify the front desk when we checked out to raise a maintenance ticket for its repair The tv was a luxury but it would have been really good to have had UK morning news but as the reception was so poor on the only available channels we watched the UK news on the ipad , The free wifi was superb as we were able to work out our transport routes into the City and back The breakfast had ample choices although the croissants were a little frozen and hard otherwise very friendly and helpful staff Thank you for looking after us 
115543,Henry VIII, One tip only they should have a 24hr bar or atleast for breakfast lunch and dinner doesn t need to be open throught the night but it would be good if it was , Staff were very friendly and helpful also the swimming pool was also very nice 
115544,Henry VIII, Kitchen sink in room is needed instead of having to use bathroom water only flaw, Room was small for family so they rectified this with an upgrade best hotel ive stayed in so far and kids enjoyed the facilities thank you for your understanding
115545,Henry VIII, The hotel needs some upgrades The rugs are worn my shower didn t work to a standard expected in a London hotel, The hotel was good value for money and location was good 
115546,Henry VIII,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful They agreed to let us check in really early and at no extra cost The room was really clean and comfortable I especially liked the swimming pool too And breakfast was delicious I saw a few negative reviews and was a bit worried but found none to be true in our case Location wise it was perfect for us as it was situated in a quiet area very close to the Bayswater station which helped us get to Heathrow airport easily I wouldn t hesitate to stay here next time 
115547,Henry VIII, The only thing I felt upset about was I missed breakfast and got the times wrong and asked to be given some in my room and I was told no which was upsetting Apart from that I had no problems , The bed was very comfy lovely sheets bathroom was spotless and very nice and specious the staff were lovely and they also made amazing towel swans on the bed and they were beautiful I told them it was a belated birthday present for my partner and they left a bottle of red wine on the house with two glasses besides them I thought that was amazingly sweet of them The hotel is beautiful and swimming pool was lovely and warm and Sauna was lovely Smaller then I expected but truly was lovely Very clean Design was beautiful Amazing experience as a whole lovely location I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a comfortable cosy place to stay The design in the room was beautiful lovely wood furniture and curtains were gorgeous Shops open at night and not far at all from two tube stations Defiantly 10 out of 10 if that style is what your looking for Will defiantly go again It had a lovely warm feeling to it Defiantly worth your money 
115548,Henry VIII, 1 Staff need more attention to detail For example reception didn t ask have you stayed before Breakfast is downstairs in the restaurant bar area and at breakfast they took my room number gave me a table and that was it I would have expected them to ask if I knew where everything was rather than feeling you had to fend for yourself I am harsh but have worked in catering and expect a decent standard 2 Food provided for room service is appalling Brakes congealed tomato soup and walkers ready salted crisps no bread roll Was cheap and nasty and charged 7 00 for the pleasure of it I feel if you are going to offer room service do it properly Also room service was advertised between 7 11 and when I rang I was told it wasn t until 8pm No apology given After 8pm it took me six attempts to order as the bar didn t answer If you want to provide guests drinks and don t have the catering staff put in a mini bar I had a cupboard in my room that was a perfect candidate for conversion The menu was mostly drinks which says a lot It made me wish I had gone and bought something from sainsburys 3 Could do with a refurbishment I stayed in 108 and the side of the bath was coming off No carpet in the rooms and makes it feel cheap Advertised as 4 but feels budget if I compare to other 4 hotels I have stayed at 4 No gown or slippers provided for use of spa facilities Reception should warn you of this and how to use pool etc , I am 37 weeks pregnant and the pool was the best part of my stay and the bed was comfortable albeit they could do with a thicker duvet on offer Breakfast was decent 
115549,Henry VIII, The room was a little impersonal as we could hear noise from neighbouring rooms so I m sure they could hear us Also when down for breakfast towards the end of service several guests were I felt they wanted to clear up more than allow the guests to enjoy breakfast with the same quality as guests who went for breakfast earlier , The location is great a few minutes walk from some great restaurants and bars shopping areas transport and so much else Hotel had some nice touches to it and all the basics 
115550,Henry VIII, Room could do with a refurb Smelt of cigarette smoke on third floor, Good location Friendly staff Good quality hotel for the money spent Breakfast included Early check in at no additional cost
115551,Henry VIII, Out dated , Good location nice staff But property deffinetly needs updating Carpets very dirty Hallways smelly Also pictures need to change They don t match to what your actually getting
115552,Henry VIII, nothing particularly bad to say Swimming pool room was quite chilly Room service till 23 only TV could be larger , staff was very nice and attentive during our stay price for 3 nights for two adults was reasonable even including breakfast Not too cosy just good place with good service facilities for affordable price definitely would reccomend
115553,Henry VIII, Air con was broken in our room would be a problem in summer , Good comfy room and fair breakfast for a budget hotel in it s location Plenty of varied restaurants and cafe s around right on central bus route and near tube station 
115554,Henry VIII, The table in our room haf crumbs on it The door to our first room wouldnt open The cleans walked in without knocking even tho we asked for late check out,No Positive
115555,Henry VIII, There wasn t a restaurant in the hotel , The first room was a bit small so we upgraded and the staff was very helpful and accommodating The indoor pool was a favorite it was very warm and the open hours were late so we really enjoyed that My son loved it 
115556,Henry VIII, Bed was hard damp smell carpets in very bad condition pool and sauna small and had kids swimming lessons going on dirty scum marks around top off pool , Breakfast was ok 
115557,Henry VIII, It s very difficult as I don t know where to start 1 all the staff are foreign which is not bad as itself but the problem was they can t speak English at all You expect that the people who work at reception can speak a good English so you can at least check in 2 found staffs are rude from the reception to the kitchen For instance the trainee receptionist was a young guy with glasses can t remember his name but when I asked him to get me his manager he told me that in his wording I m the boss when my manger is not here He was saying this while he was wearing a trainee name badge 3 very old hotel with scary lift 4 the beds are very small and uncomfortable, Good location in central London
115558,Henry VIII, Room very small mould in shower base Dining room very dark and gloomy and staff unhelpful Breakfast very dry coffee awful we went out for breakfast the second day, Receptionist was polite
115559,Henry VIII, Hotel was very tired and shabby it was clean For the money I expected better and should have just booked a travel lodge Pool was nice but no robes and changing area wasn t ideal next to pool side , Staff tried but due to not speaking or writing English the service wasn t quite what was expected for a UK hotel 
115560,Henry VIII, Hopefully you are not planning on using the tv for entertainment my iPad mini could win a competition for size The room is old fashioned and out dated matching the kettle from the 90 s The walls are paper thin and we could hear the conversations being held in the room beside us and the people walking in the room above This is not great when it happens until past 3am The breakfast was average not worth the amount they ask for , The room was clean and the location was good 
115561,Henry VIII, Room was very small could not see TV from the bed Shower did not work well very low power taps were not secure in the wall very tiny bathroom Bathroom door did not shut well, Staff we re fantastic and the location is great Food was very good The pool was a lovely added bonus Very clean Despite the tiny bathroom we would go back but not to the same room
115562,Henry VIII, Double room was so tiny Twin room was better size No toilet brush Shower didn t close, Breakfast was really nice beds comfy didn t use the pool as didn t get time but looked ok
115563,Henry VIII, Staff had lack of English the corridors smelled like ashtrays the rooms whore tiny boxes the mattress has seen better days years they do not provide a car park Too expensive for what we experienced Problem with payment transaction they charged us twice We do not recommend , The location was spot on 
115564,Henry VIII, Room 2 was too small for a couple could not open both wardrobe doors had a water leek from the bathroom ceiling the bar was not open in the evening we were there The price was good and staff were friendly good for Hyde park access , Bed comfy
115565,Henry VIII, I booked a double room but the bed was 3 4 size so not a lot of space room was quite small and at the back adjacent to the exposed tube lines so noisy trains late night and early morning More like a single room than a double The people next door woke us up when they came in at 2am The hot buffet breakfast was cold as it had been out for too long The whole thing was a disappointment and not like our previous stay some years ago I wouldn t go back , Location was good handy for city centre and tubes buses 
115566,Henry VIII, The room is hot but over all amazing Overall no complaints, The Staff is great The pool is charming The room is extremely clean with daily house keeping The breakfast is great I don t know why others complaining I would recommend the 5th floor I felt its like 5 stars hotel with this money value
115567,Henry VIII, Exceedingly small room and bathroom Upgraded to a larger room eventually but overall a disappointing stay It badly needs a refurbishment in my opinion Tired In the original room we had to tape up the window to stop cold air entering, Young slim Spanish guy particularly helpful Location good
115568,Henry VIII, Tiny room Windows wouldn t open Freezing shower in morning Room hot and air con wouldn t work receptionist very unhelpful and no apologies Meant to stay 2 nights but checked out after one No manager on duty to discuss getting a refund so left my comments and contact details as yet no ones bothered Dreadful place , Location
115569,Henry VIII, Cooked breakfast limited and stone cold two mornings in succession despite raising the matter with management on day one, Good selection of restaurants nearby
115570,Henry VIII, Our room was tiny It was fine for 1 night but if we had stayed any longer we would have wanted a bit more space to unpack , Breakfast was nice the location was convenient and the pool facilities were fab 
115571,Henry VIII, The walls are quite thin and some times the noise in the hallways and adjoining rooms made it difficult to sleep , The hotel is located within a short waking distance to tube stations and near Kensington Park The staff was very friendly and helpful b
115572,Henry VIII, Room was tiny and for over 100 poor value Wardrobe door couldn t open because it was hitting the bed nothing like the pictures on line also crack in the single window , Location was good
115573,Henry VIII, Service very average Room tiny Hotel very worn and badly needs an update Breakfast cold and terrible mushrooms from a tin and not even heated up Staff were dismissive at best WiFi useless Not recommended , Location was very convenient 
115574,Henry VIII, Cleanliness carpets walls and room fan were dusty Room 204 which we had the unfortunate luck to be in was next to the stairs and the in front of the elevators making it quite noisy , Location friendly and bilingual staff nice basic breakfast in room WiFi good value for money 
115575,Henry VIII, Two out of three mornings the scrambled eggs beans and bacon were cold Had to ask every morning to refil the lemon water before I could have a drink , Lady on reception very helpful swimming pool clean and nice treat room clean and relatively quite
115576,Henry VIII, Tv was very small and the colour contrast was off so everyone was bright orange that was the only downfall and didn t affect us too much as we weren t there to watch tv, The breakfast buffet was amazing plenty to choose from Very comfortable bed speedy room service 
115577,Henry VIII, Room next to train noisy at night Breakfast really basic not for a 4 star 3 star hotel max despite good location, Good value small room with all basic facilities 
115578,Henry VIII, The room was very cold until I called the receptionist in and she had to turn the radiator on herself as the AC Heating unit wasn t working then when I came back from being out all day someone had left my window wide open which being on the ground floor didn t make me feel like my things were secure My bed was a little precarious a king or super king mattress over a much smaller frame so if you sat on the edge of the bed you fell off It was also noisy one because I could hear people shouting in the pool and another because the door didn t have a second lock and every time someone walked past it rattled loudly and made me think someone was trying to get in It was all a little tired really odd repairs done like one side of the door had a small silver handle and the other a larger bronze one so it s very mismatch , It s only a short and extremely easy walk to London Paddington station straight up one road so it s convenient Plenty of shops and food around There s a free breakfast and swimming pool The staff were nice and friendly 
115579,Henry VIII, Even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice When following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable The breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc The lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions Although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm It is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down Even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it All in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided , The room was clean Staff were helpful Indoor pool was good 
115580,Henry VIII, On the first night we were given a room with two single beds room 217 put together even though we requested a double bed The room was dirty and the bed had bed bugs could not sleep all night Next day we changed rooms and moved to 405 which was definitely much better What i disliked about this hotel was the staff especially the manager very unhelpful The hotel charged me twice for the same room and they were unwilling to refund me saying that the reservation was unrefundable which did not make sense as I had already paid it once and was staying at the hotel cleary I showed up for my booking The manager who did not speak good English did not care at all that we were customers and started yelling at us for a mistake that it was theirs I had to contact Booking com to resolve this situation and receive my refund of more than 700 pounds Also a day before my trip to London they contacted me saying that my card details were invalid and that they would cancel my reservation Meanwhile my card was fully charged I had to be with them an hour on the phone so they could find the credit card slip and see that i was already charged Very unhappy Such a shame that this hotel is run by incompetent managers and supervisors , Location Breakfast
115581,Henry VIII, Breakfast was a disappointment Although lots of fresh fruit the bacon and scrambled eggs were cold The bread was not always fresh I paid for two single beds but were given a bed for two and I was travelling with my young son , Bed and cleaning was fine My son enjoyed the swimmingpool although the shower facilities were British style i e you shower with your swimsuit on 
115582,Henry VIII, The only down point which ruined the start of our day and made us regret booking the hotel as we mainly booked because we could have a morning swim was the fact the swimming pool seemed to be running a toddles swim we went in for half an hour 45 mins during that time 4 toddles had a lesson each one absolutely screamed the house down we normally swim for an hour or so but left early as a child choked so much he was sick spitting water up it wasn t a good start to the day we also wanted to use the sauna but parents were using it as a baby change It was horrible listening to babies choke cry and scream it wasn t on the agenda I believe the hotel should book baby lessons in after 11 as most guest will then head out for the day and at least be able to have a relaxing swim also the instructor had his sister and brother in law in there it felt like we shouldn t of been there despite the fact we paid to stay in the hotel we felt uneasy with the constant children and stares from people it was not a nice experience more like a free public pool then a private pool in a 4 star hotel and is the only thing that would make me not book again, We had a very large room which was clean and comfortable
115583,Henry VIII, single bed a tiny bit wobbly and my door wouldn t lock without slamming it however it was fab , The spanish staff were most lovely and welcoming Muchos Gracias Ate logo 
115584,Henry VIII, the room could have been bigger Furniture in room looked a little cheap, The fan on the ceiling Very clean bathroom Clean towels linen etc staff very friendly 
115585,Henry VIII, A rather large group of single men were always in the reception and the lifts I found it quite intimidating One of our rooms was very warm 406 and the other was very cold 414 ,No Positive
115586,Henry VIII, The hotel was very tired the carpets threadbare Hairdyer broken in the room and waldrobe door room was very small Staff couldn t understand english, Location very convienent for public transport
115587,Henry VIII, Hotel for sure not for 4 Stars Room for 3 People not big enough View for roof on the another building maybe cause special Price Swimming pool nice but any part not good for kids too deep for them , Hotel in good location nice and clean rooms Really warm swimming pool Nice delicious breakfast 
115588,Henry VIII, Your room is a little cold and heating is not warm enough Your shower faucet did not work without any water in Room 501 , Your staff always smiled especially that gentleman 
115589,Henry VIII, Good choice for breakfast but the milk for the cereals was very strange and the coffee was poor , Excellent location with 4 tube stations nearby and Hyde Park just down the road Nice room with comfortable bed Staff generally were very friendly and helpful 
115590,Henry VIII, Fridge in the room I thought there was one but we didn t ask either , Staff were so friendly and helpful from checking in staff to breakfast staff to the chambermaids Lots of excellent choice and range for breakfast Room was large enough clean and travel cot Tv worked perfect and the wifi was good enough to stream programmes on the iPad Swimming pool area was lovely and we had it all to ourselves Great location for tube Hyde park places to eat and walking into centre Overall a whole lot better than we expected for the price we paid 
115591,Henry VIII, I have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation They took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further 88 over and above the sum due On talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank My son who is from Scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in London with his bank account wiped out I gave it as a gift and am really angry They still haven t refunded the 88 and I am taking this further I was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments They are a bunch of crooks sorry to say Such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them , the hotel itself was fine It was the staff that let it down 
115592,Henry VIII, There was no substitute for the bacon and sausage at breakfast as I don t eat pork , The room was perfect I could live there that s how good it was 
115593,Henry VIII, Woken up most nights with noisy people coming in and out of the rooms 0100 onwards , Close to Paddington Station approx 10 min walk Very nice facilities
115594,Henry VIII, Not much to dislike but if I had to the decor is a bit dated , The location is great for central London but best USP is the heated indoor pool and sauna The breakfast buffet well stocked and varied catering for all tastes The staff were happy friendly and engaging 
115595,Henry VIII,No Negative, Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night in January for shopping in London location was good if you want a cheap stay and value for money We had to walk around 15minutes from the hotel to the underground that takes you to Oxford Circus and such BE CAREFUL IF ANYONE OUTSIDE ANY UNDERGROUND STATIONS OFFERS TO TAKE YOU TO THE HOTEL OR SHOW YOU THE DIRECTION TO ANYWHERE This happened to myself and my boyfriend outside the underground on Queensway and once we realised the man was trying to take us in the complete opposite direction to where google maps was showing us and refused to go with him he ran away Overall though such a lovely stay lovely breakfast lovely swimming pool we had it all to ourselves Very helpful and lovely staff definitely reccomemed for a posh but affordable getaway 
115596,Henry VIII, Everything looks worn out All televisions in the hotel were not working for the 2 days we were there The wifi speed is so slow it s not worth using The room we had was at the end next to the train line Very noisy , Great staff Location is perfect Breakfast was ok
115597,Henry VIII, The bedside light switches were both broken and needed immediate attention The Tv s were out of action for the full 2 day stay The internet connection was totally inadequate for a hotel The bedroom ceiling fan had not been cleaned in a long time very dusty and dirty, The common areas were generally ok and the breakfast was very good and a great choice 
115598,Henry VIII, WiFi too slow and sometimes bad connection I won t suggest take the hotel if you need to work with internet Saw staff taking coffee where we are having breakfast and we needed to wait for him to finish, Great Reception staff Pool and Sauna Nice bed really confortable
115599,Henry VIII, The room was very basic TV broken and terrible lights Swimming pool was very small and old looking and no proper changing area for women men , Excellent staff very polite and helpful Breakfast was amazing 
115600,Henry VIII, When we arrived we had no television reception in the room This was not fixed for our total stay even though we kept reporting it to reception We were told that the fault covered the hotel and not just our room The Internet access was very patchy and kept going down and was very slow , Good location Room clean and well serviced Breakfast ok 
115601,Henry VIII, Solo Traveller TV didn t work whole time I was there Had breakfast option Only one morning out of three did i try to have breakfast and was simply told we are full No attempt to accomodate me They have done pre authorised transactions on my card 4 times So currently in addtion to the bill being paid I currently have another 290 of my funds in my bank account currently reserved by them which I will not get back for another 7 working days,No Positive
115602,Henry VIII, This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Do not get the basic double room it is a utility room sharing a wall with the lift shaft Worst hotel I have stayed in Bea the reception was extremely rude and in my opinion really needs some lessons in customer service Shower was broken Tv was broken No massage available even though it says on website No parking available even though it says on website, Heated pool was nice Room was clean with tea and coffee
115603,Henry VIII, See above , Bedroom was small and poky television not working when we asked about this we were told none of the televisions in hotel were working Shower inadequate and breakfast poorly cooked 
115604,Henry VIII, Very poor in need of refurbishment The pool had no changing rooms The sauna didn t work The heating in the bedroom didn t work The hotel had no supervisor or manager a young lady was running the hotel alone very unsafe in event of a fire etc We left early due to the experience The hotel cost was refunded after various arguments with the lady who couldn t contact the manager who was in Spain ,No Positive
115605,Henry VIII, The d cor was drab and grubby the photo s on the website must have been taken 10 years ago The aircon didn t work in the room which left a small radiator for the only source of heat The cleaners left the window open so on return the room was freezing The breakfast was of average the bacon and sausages were obviously a very cheap brand The eggs only offered scrambled were like rubber All in all a very disappointing stay I will not be returning , The staff were friendly and helpful
115606,Henry VIII, Bed pillows stair carpet needs replacing Round the pool needs deep clean carpet upholstery in dining room need clean , 63 so value for money 
115607,Henry VIII, free room wifi did not work well, the small swimming pool is a comfortable temperature and deep enough to exercise in without touching the bottom plenty of choice at buffet breakfast 
115608,Henry VIII, Henrys bar was awful selection of drinks were pretty non existent barman was helpful but not able to help us Bathroom needed some tlc especially the shower and the loo roll holder was hanging off the wall , Liked the location liked the breakfast staff at breakfast and on reception were friendly and helpful 
115609,Henry VIII, The receptionist was extremely helpful but other than that the hotel is more like a 2 star The supposedly superior room was very cramped carpet stained and floorboards creaked non stop The curtains didn t close properly and the view looked onto someone s bedroom The television did not work and as my room adjoined reception I could hear music and people coming and going I returned to the hotel in the evening and there were several make guests drinking outside this gave the impression of a DSS halfway house Certainly for a lone female guest not at all reassuring about safety Breakfast food was cold and generally school dinner like A woeful experience, Receptionist Bea was very helpful
115610,Henry VIII, Decor a bit dated and tired, Staff were friendly upgraded our room as it was my birthday and left a bottle of wine nice surprise Pool was lovely room clean and super comfy Lots of choice for breakfast Would stay here again
115611,Henry VIII, Kiwis at breakfast sliced awkwardly to eat if nit picking Place could do with new carpets and sofas in entrance but overall good stay, Lovely reception staff allowed us to drop off luggage early Room okay although a little on the small side Shower very hot Overall decor could do with a revamp but on the whole good stay with excellent transport links to London attractions Thanks
115612,Henry VIII, Very small double room 8 m2 with a not good closing bathroomdoor bathroom even without ventilation Room was above the general airco machine so impossible to open the window too noisy Tv was not working, The location
115613,Henry VIII, Bar poorly stocked bar staff not good room was cold room was too light due to the street lights not being blocked out by curtains tv didn t work and staff were dismissive of this and unable unwilling to help, Good location nice building room was a good size staff friendly and helpful on check in
115614,Henry VIII, There were some cultural differences I think arising from the fact that the owning company is Spanish as most of the staff seem to be One as I have seen in another review that whilst there is a hot food selection for breakfast sausages scrambled eggs bacon beans every day that food though good quality was no more than luke warm I asked if there was a bar and was told it was open from 8pm until 11 When I went there it was the breakfast room was in dimmed light with one attendant at the other end of the room She came to see what I wanted but didn t speak a word of English She showed me a drinks menu and I managed to buy a drink But I don t think that it s what most UK people would expect when they say they have a bar , The staff were helpful and well intentioned and ready to help We didn t have the most basic room and it was fine for us There was a good selection of foods for breakfast and the quality seemed good 
115615,Henry VIII, We used the staircase rather than the lift and noticed that this area could do with a lick of paint , Everything was just fine Comfortable bed and good facilities in the room Breakfast was included even though we didn t think it was We liked being so close to Hyde Park 
115616,Henry VIII, I secretly notified the hotel it was my husband s birthday they said they would put something special in the room This did not happen The staff were all foreign and seemed at times to lack in understanding The rooms were also rather small but adequate for one night , The swimming pool and leisure facilities were very good Breakfast average The domestic staff seemed very friendly and efficient 
115617,Henry VIII, Bar not much variety and could not get a nice coffee latte hot chocolate in the evening at the bar , Staff very good great hotel great location would recommend this hotel to friends Good breakfast 
115618,Henry VIII, No bath plug Non attentive bar staff Hardly spoke English Stains on bed linen Air con not working Room was separated only by party door Pool tiny, Location was good
115619,Henry VIII, I like an electric supply near my bed as my phone acts as my alarm clock but the nearest one was on the other side of the room One other thing the oldest staff member I saw was in her late twenties I wonder how many employees are unpaid interns , A very pleasant atmosphere hospitable staff and filling breakfasts 
115620,Henry VIII, Everything is just short of being good breakfast is ok but quality is standard nothing of high standards sauna is there but is tiny and not so hot rooms are ok but quite small so leaves a strange feeling of almost being there but in the end rather standard , Close to Hyde park and subway Swimming pool and sauna
115621,Henry VIII, Breakfast wasn t great but there are lots of nice places for breakfast on the same road , Very good value great location for Paddington Station and Kensington Palace Gardens Friendly staff 
115622,Henry VIII, The room was ridiculously small and I could literally hear people talking in next door room It did not worth the money at all The staff were not friendly and overall I do not recommend this hotel , Location was great 
115623,Henry VIII, Could clearly hear Tube trains every few minutes Door to swimming pool difficult to open No changing facilities at pool and no information given to suggest changing in own room Room was very small could only get in the double bed from one side , Close to Paddington Station
115624,Henry VIII, At breakfast you need to gaurd your table l had finished my cereal went to get some toast by the time I had returned the table had been cleared and other guests had been seated when I complained to the waitress s they seemed to think it was my fault when a simple sorry would have been a more acceptable outcome, Quiet location great swimming pool
115625,Henry VIII, Small rooms but I had read this on reviews I still booked as the added perk with pool for me and my daughter sold it to me For the price was worth it , Went with my 14yr old daughter for shopping Location good for Oxford St Pool and sauna was nice to use after a long day Lots of choice for breakfast Staff helpful 
115626,Henry VIII, Don t have a room front of the hotel because the bin men make quite a lot of noise from around five pm carpets were tired , Breakfast was very good Facilities where v good
115627,Henry VIII, For starters the reception staff do not speak English In London Noisy rooms from the lift all night TVs that don t work and beds and pillows from Henry s days Don t expect much from this place and you won t be disappointed , Location
115628,Henry VIII, Room doors are exceptionally loud not because guests slam them but because they are heavy and poorly adjusted Constant noise of loud doors This was my only complaint with this otherwise more than satisfactory hotel , Location Breakfast was of a good standard Staff were very helpful 
115629,Henry VIII, The cooked breakfast wasn t very nice at all And everyone seems to stare at you when you go down for breakfast , We didn t have a chance to use the pool and sauna but it looked very nice The staff at reception were friendly 
115630,Henry VIII, The rooms too small We can hear our neighbor easily, We only appreciate this hotel for the sweet staff and the cleaning The breakfast was ok Calm area close the Kensington park
115631,Henry VIII, Do they realise that in the pool changing rooms the curtains are white and you can see everthing through them Can be very embarrassing when people are changing, Breakfasts cater for all nationalities and tastes and was really good LOVE the pool Reception staff great
115632,Henry VIII, On a Saturday breakfast room was full I got seated went to make a drink and they had sat someone else in my seat I took another got a cup of tea then went to get breakfast Came back and they cleared my tea and table I told the staff but the English wasn t good and she brought me back a ruined drink I said no and she just ran away Double room super tiny , Fit for purpose
115633,Henry VIII, Only quibble was our room was right opposite the lift so a little noisy but otherwise great hotel , Loved the swimming pool which although was fairly small was lovely and warm The breakfast was included and great value with hot and cold selections Our room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful 
115634,Henry VIII, The reception is a little shabby but rooms are clean and all you need , The staff were really friendly breakfast was good rooms clean and comfortable Really good location for central london 
115635,Henry VIII, My room was awful Situated on the ground floor near the main road so I was disturbed by traffic Rooms are also poorly insulated so could hear noise from upstairs and in the hotel lobby, Staff generally polite and pleasant
115636,Henry VIII, obviously had a very good photographer because the rooms are nothing like the pics My single room was hot and stuffy in December with an ineffective and loud fan In the end I opened the window Tiny bed even for a single Breakfast buffet had run out when I got there had to wait 15 mins for more Dirty stained chairs in the dining room and staff that did the bare minimum and no more There are better hotels in London for the money and I ve stayed in lots of them Avoid , central location
115637,Henry VIII, Is this hotel rated 4 They put us opposite the lift and it was too noisy going up and down the small balcony is full of people talking and can see them outside our window which is just a meter away and it was past midnight and we could not even sleep The room is jam packed with furniture and no enough space to walk around but oblige to sit in bed End up leaving the hotel too early , Spacious reception
115638,Henry VIII, ppl staying next door kept making noise the whole morning by slamming the door and talked very loud outside my bedroom , like the location and the price
115639,Henry VIII, The room was small but it didn t bother us too much as we didn t send much time in the hotel we just slept there , Staff were very friendly Fantastic breakfast The location was good very close to under ground station 
115640,Henry VIII, Carpets in corridors and at the reception need cleaning or replacing Unfortunately they make place look shabby , Staff was good and helpful Room was clean 
115641,Henry VIII, sauna is large enough for one person only two if you have a close friend interconnecting door to next room is very thin and no sound proofing could hear someone coughing all night and every word of their conversation Breakfast was cold and the breakfast staff not very attentive , staff and location
115642,Henry VIII, every thing is great breakfast is fantastic the staff are so friendly and more than nice location is near city center but quite and very safe One can t ask for more ,No Positive
115643,Henry VIII, Scrambled eggs were awful But in general the breakfast was quite good and lots of it The carpet on the stairs is very warn Especially between ground and first floor We requested a room on a high floor but unfortunately were given a room on the first floor looking out on a roof other building but we were only staying for 2 nights so didn t ask to change It was just the ordinary double room that we booked anyway , Staff are very polite and helpful Swimming pool is very relaxing So warm Beds were very comfortable Lovely fresh fruit for breakfast 
115644,Henry VIII,No Negative, The choice of breakfast was excellent Room good Some areas a little run down but I am sure are being attended to Only stayed one night but was clean and comfortable 
115645,Henry VIII, Nothing all excellent, Excellent reception staff who went out of his way to print out some documents needed for a visa application Nothing was too much trouble and they were so kind helpful absolutely brilliant 
115646,Henry VIII, Property looked nothing like in the picture Maybe it looked like this 10 years ago Staff is quite rood not everyone Very unprofessional behaviour of one of the receptionists Breakfast salami was smeling and tasting like it was out of date Would not recommend, Location
115647,Henry VIII, Had to wait a long time for items to be topped up at breakfast Something food or drink had splashed on wall in restaurant and not been cleaned right , It was nice to have a pool but didn t have time to use it Room was clean neat and quiet

115649,Henry VIII, The rooms are very small Internet service was temperamental I had to log on frequently , The location and peacefulness of the hotel It had a sauna and swimming pool When I asked to be changed from the original room allocated the staff did that willingly and with professionalism All staff members at the front desk were professional and helpful It was value for money and I enjoyed my stay there 
115650,Henry VIII, Incredibly noisy room awake for hours because of it Staff didn t know why probably room close to the lift shaft or a large air con unit Not great if you need sleep and have to work the next day , Excellent location very clean and friendly staff 
115651,Henry VIII,No Negative, The location is fantastic and the hotel is such good value for money The staff are calm and helpful The hotel even has a pool Great simple buffet breakfast 
115652,Henry VIII, 1 The air conditioner was not working 2 The shower soap tray was underneath the water outlet limiting the space and causing accidental collision that hurt my arm 3 The shower soap tray was loose and falling apart 4 One of the coffee machines was not working queuing people to make coffee during breakfasts , The staff was very nice 
115653,Henry VIII, made an error boooking and explained it per emil the direction did even not take the time to consider and gave a stereotyp answer I was awar of the conditions and this answer that is why I made a personal request so I had to pay one false booked night for a room I coumd no utilise the direction even did not propose half a solution this will prevent me from staying in Henry viii again and also I wwill NOT recommend it to my Luxembourg grman or french friends This is a pity as I stay at least times a year in London and my friends even more and we are always looking for a nice hotel with is worth it s price qhqnery viii was my favorite ludovicy danielle booking made for my daughters ROEF Claire and Nina, correct hotel for price
115654,Henry VIII, The room was tiny the walls were paper thin We could clearly hear guests in the next room talking Very difficult to sleep because of this , The hotel was close to central London only a 5 min walk from Queensway Tube station The rooms were clean enough Reception staff were very pleasant 
115655,Henry VIII, Third or fourth time staying here and the wifi is dreadful Rooms are ridiculously small even a hobbit would have trouble manoeuvring Breakfast anaemic fried foods tasteless watery poured off filtered off someone s boots Overpriced and underperforming hotel , friendly staff 
115656,Henry VIII, Rooms are small and very squeaky floorboards You can hear people moving around next door and talking in the corridor but we spent very little time in the room , Pool and sauna are great for a bit of relaxation after a long day sightseeing or shopping and they are open until 11 pm Location perfect for Paddington station and a nice early morning walk through Hyde Park Excellent value

115659,Henry VIII, Horrible location felt vulnerable as a single lady D cor old shabby and room cramped and uncomfortable not at all like the photo s on the web , Friendly staff
115660,Henry VIII, The room wasn t that big however for us that wasn t a problem The only thing about this was that you don t have a normal door to the bathroom so you can hear all the strange noises in the room The TV could have been bigger nevertheless you most likely don t use it that much , The staff was very friendly and helpful their English wasn t always the best though For the price the hotel and facilities were good The breakfast had enough options to please most of the people The bathroom was big and had a good shower The location is very good as you have a park next to you and all transportation option are close bus metro train 
115661,Henry VIII, Rooms are really small which was little bit inconvenient and most importantly wifi was not good enough for basic connection I found much better hotel and better price than this hotel , Generally everything was fine Breakfast buffet is nice Location is also nice walking distance to the bus station and tube station

115666,Henry VIII, The hotel was too old the room was small without fridge in the breakfast was poor we tried to call 4 times in reception but doesn t work, I loved the area it was quiet and near by to all stations the girl in morning duty at reception was very helpful

115673,Henry VIII, Stayed at back of hotel which was noisy from trains very disappointed that the leisure facilities promised were not available , The staff were friendly the location was great 
115674,Henry VIII, It wasn t the quietest of neighborhoods and throughout the day there was usually numerous people stood outside the hotel very adjacent to our ground floor room in loud and lengthy conversations in their own language , My wife I spent a couple of nights here a hotel that I perhaps had too high expectations of being as it s situated in Bayswater W2 London The facilities were as advertised and the staff mostly Spanish were always polite Food was reasonable but nothing spectacular we only had breakfasts Our room was spacious with ample draw wardrobe space sofa tea coffee facilities en suite comfortable double bed Swimming pool was warm clean didn t use sauna 
115675,Henry VIII, The filth, This Hotel was so bad that we checked in and checked straight out again The place was so filthy This was NOT a 4 star hotel This site won t allow me to give it less than 2 5 but it really shouldn t be even that

115681,Henry VIII, Room and Bed is unbelibably small It was double bed room but I think the room bed is not enought to use for one person Even there is no space to open keep my luggage And the bed is just little bit more bigger than single bed , Location Facility Breakfast are good enough
