54745,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame,No Negative, We stayed in the penthouse and found it to be comfortable with plenty of space and a spectacular view of the Seine and Notre Dame Taner and Dino were most helpful in guiding us around Paris and providing restaurant advice Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking to be in the area of the 5th and 6th RER and Metro only steps away 
54746,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame,No Negative, I liked the wonderful friendliness and helpfulness of the people who worked there the tasteful decor of our very spacious blue room the views on Notre Dame for real magical at night and of course the unbeatable location Thank you again to Rives de Notre Dame The hotel is better than on the photos
54747,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, The breakfast For the 15 per person I expected a bit more variety Coffee was not good Nescafe instant coffee just doesn t say Paris to me , The location Walking distance to most everything but you also have the Metro stop on the corner as well Nearby St Germain neighborhood is a must walk and literally around the corner you re surrounded by Cafes and restaurants The view from our room of the Notre Dame Cathedral and the river was an unexpected bonus

54752,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, N A, Great location in the heart of the Latin Quarter The hotel is alongside the lift that goes down to the train platform that goes to the airport The hotel is family run and is small enough to give a homely feel We managed to get a room that was advertised as a special rate If full price was paid it would not have been good value

54764,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame,No Negative, Location and view are key at this charming hotel For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful The courtesy of the staff can t be surpassed Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored 
54765,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, I m afraid the decor has been ignored to the point of shabbiness not shabby chic Such great potential but definitely needs a facelift , For those who want to see the sights in Paris the location is great Also loved the staff extremely helpful and friendly Our room had a comfortable bed and a good shower

54767,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, the hotel is in desperate need of renovation You can tell that they have tried to keep it up but with cheap budget means Also it s not super clean some surfaces in the room and bathroom hadn t been wiped for a long time We stayed in the penthouse suite so you should probably expect even more attention to detail there but unfortunately they missed a bit too much , I love the location The hotel is located right next to Notre Dame This is a great starting point for any Paris visit Staff is very friendly These two factors are enough to choose a hotel in Paris but

54770,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, Had to leave too soon , Everything was excellent from the moment we walked in and met Dino on the desk He immediately upgraded us to a superior room overlooking the river and his local knowledge was excellent He was extremely helpful We can t praise this place enough and will be returning we went by train so I can t say about parking
54771,Hotel Les Rives de Notre Dame, Forget about number of stars they have put for the hotel star rating and you would love it Room size was small but that s the way Paris is , There couldn t have been a better view from a hotel room than this Hotel was bang on Quai Saint Michel Despite being on the road room was quiet Just get down from the hotel and one was in the best of the locations Street behind the hotel was full of eateries and fairly priced Saint Michel Notre Dame RER station was right opposit the hotel and Saint Michel metro station is 180 meters away We reached bit early but hotel manager Tanner was helpful and gave us room immediately Rest of the staff was also very helpful
