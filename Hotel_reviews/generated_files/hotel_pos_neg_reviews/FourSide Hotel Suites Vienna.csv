324917,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, location is too far from center you can t eat at weekend in hotel restaurant late in the evening, very helpful staff big number with kitchenette
324918,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, Elevator is too small for a stroller to fit the other elevator was not working Wifi was non existent in the room We have to go to hotel lobby to do our bookings for hotel and train for our travel Location was a bit far out from the main attraction Will never use this hotel again and will not recommend it too , Room was big and the bed was comfy

324924,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, One person in the reception area was a little unfriendly the others were nice The light of the room wasn t enough , The facilities were wonderful the distance to public transport was very good and the braekfast was wondering The room was so big and good furnished 
324925,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, I had booked a studio and was mentioned that it has kitchen as well where as it was having only a microwave woven and few utensils but no microwave pots Similarly bath accessories were not provided for a 4 star property standard , Very conveniently located and in 10 minutes can reach the city center

324927,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, The street was rather loud Although we reserved the room until 3 p m the cleaning lady was very persistent until we opened the door and explained it all face to face There should be better communication between front desk and cleaning staff The many plastic flowers in the dining area were disturbing fewer flowers or a simple accent of fresh blossoms or sprigs would have been far more appealing for a 4 star ambient The elevator was extremely slow and thus we opted for the stairs from the 4th floor on more than one occasion As the hotel is really located on the far outskirts of the city we needed more than half an hour to reach it by car from the highway , The best point goes to the option of staying until 3 p m free of charge The beds were comfortable the rooms modern and clean The breakfast was sufficient with a variety of cheeses and sliced meats eggs and sausages bacon as well as fresh fruit and vegetables and even cooked vegetables The underground is just a few minutes walk from the hotel Parking directly outside in front of hotel While we didn t take advantage of it the room was equipped with a small kitchenette fridge including teas and a hot water cooker as well as iron board 
324928,FourSide Hotel Suites Vienna, Only news channels were available in English on the TV , Not a central place but if you travel by car it is from an okay distance from the city center There was enough place in the room for our dog to feel at home and he was not confined in a small room but with enough space to walk around The kitchenett is a nice touch The water pressure in the shower was great
