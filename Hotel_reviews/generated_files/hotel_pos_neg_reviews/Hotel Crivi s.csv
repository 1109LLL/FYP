304080,Hotel Crivi s, There is metro line passing under the hotel You can feel it , It was a nice experience to live here In such a price level Crivi s is the best one that I lived in center Milano 3 mins walk from hotel to the Metro Station with shops and stalls around the location was really good The breakfast was nice milk bread bacon and fresh fruit and juice serving with daily English and Italian newspaper Frontdesk was nice Room was clean and bathroom was big enough 
304081,Hotel Crivi s, The air conditioning could be better , The host was really friendly he has provided us with the town map and instructions on what to see Aside of this he has recommended us a really good place to eat nearby the dinner we had there was the best during our week in Italy The room has everything necessary 
304082,Hotel Crivi s,No Negative, This was our first trip to Italy and Milano was our first stop Hotel Crivi was very nice comfortable and reasonably priced We enjoyed the neighborhood and accommodations The staff was superb and very helpful with directions We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the rooms were a nice size and very clean We would absolutely stay at Hotel Crivi again and recommend this place to others 
304083,Hotel Crivi s, No take away breakfast for those who check out earlier than the breakfast starts even though the breakfast was paid Not possible to iron in the room they take your clothes for ironing and charge for it At the checkout the receptionist wanted to charge me once again despite the room fee was deducted from my card already It took about 10 minutes he realized that I payed for the room this lead to my late arrival to the airport , Location is not bad
304084,Hotel Crivi s, It needs renovation No AC in room I had to open window and due to street noise and mosquitoes could not sleep at night, Love the breakfast Staff serving breakfast
304085,Hotel Crivi s, Somewhat poor sound proofing in rooms from the corridor especially annoying since the cleaning staff are local energetic and like to chat to each other starting to work at 0700 in the morning , Very helpful and accommodating front desk staff with very decent English and solid determination to help and provide best experience possible Information maps and oh so useful local knowledge shared freely with tact and respect Very good breakfast service with good variety and rich selections Above average coffee 
304086,Hotel Crivi s, This is not 4 star hotel but rather 2 5 stars Only one receptionist was friendly others were not approachable and not friendly at all Air conditioning did not work so it was very hot in the room and when the window was open the noise from the street was coming and street was quite noisy Hotel did not have iron or ironing room if you need to iron something then you should order laundry services for additional fee In addition some bugs bited us during the night Much better hotel can be booked for the same price , Very friendly waiters at the breakfast and quite ok choise for breakfast 
304087,Hotel Crivi s, An old man at the front desk during breakfast was very rude to my wife Location it is not in the city centre as mentioned by Booking com 6 metro stops from central station Property didnt have aircon when asked they said their aircon doesnt work had to open the windows which was noisy and got bitten by mosquitoes, Size of the room Front office guy and the trolley luggage man very friendly
304088,Hotel Crivi s,No Negative, Good location not far from Duomo The rooms are nice clean and big enough Friendly staff nice breakfast free wifi And the price surprisingly reasonable I love this hotel It is not my first visit
304089,Hotel Crivi s, The comfort rating was lower because the bed was too firm I had to sleep on the pillows to be comfortable , The price and staff were great the location was good as well as the accommodations
304090,Hotel Crivi s, I got bitten numerous times 23 in total by miggies or something through the 2 x nights whilst I was sleeping , Breakfast was ok but could have been a larger choice for hot food rather than just scrambled egg and wafer thin sliced bacon 
304091,Hotel Crivi s, I was not told there was a camera in the bed room had I known before I would had not stayed it was not till the morning I was leaving that I looked up and saw the lens it was a very disturbing feeling never the less as I ha e never seen a camera over looking the bed and I had changed and it was a very disturbing feeling and to have to pay for that feeling was even more disturbing , It was interesting 
304092,Hotel Crivi s, 1 wifi disconnects intermittently but you have to simply have to click on your wifi connectivity button to reconnect and gain access to the internet again 2 they don t have irons for you to use because of bad past experiences with hotel guests and so you have to give them your clothes that you want ironed and wait for 30 minutes to an hour to receive them back, 1 Location close to train stations and it also in walking distance to the Duomo 10 15 minute walk 2 Overall a nice hotel I saw the comments from people complaining about trivial things and they make no sense to me because when I travel it is for the purpose to go sightseeing and to experience the country not to spend an extended amount of time in a hotel room The only time I m in my hotel room is to sleep shower use the bathroom and have at a minimum a decent place to sleep It squeaks in at a 4 star hotel but it is a 4 star hotel nonetheless 3 safe neighborhood and quiet 4 hotel staff is nice and speaks english 5 they have a multi plugin charger unit that has the ability to accept all international devices Lastly I don t understand how you can complain about certain aspects of a hotel when you re provided with over 25 pictures of interior and has a large number of comments from people that have previously stayed there you have more than enough evidence to make an informed decision some of these people sound foolish with their reviews comments 
304093,Hotel Crivi s, It was very noisy outside don t quite know what produced so much noise throughout the night It might ve been some generator belonging to the hotel The view was also quite depressing from my room It is generally a noisy part of the city I think , The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Very charming too It is very central 10mins walk to Duomo Several good and trendy bars and restaurants just around the corner I think via Otti is the street full of bars and restaurants Also the canals are quite close I walked there one day and it was ca 20 25 mins to walk or a few stops on a tram 
304094,Hotel Crivi s, Actually we liked everything , Room was comfortable had a tub which really helped with evening relaxation Had valet parking Access to city center by trolley was a snap got tickets at a tabacco shop For dinner the concierge recommended La Osteria Dell Oca Giulia Viale Bligny 29 Milan superb dining
304095,Hotel Crivi s,No Negative, The best moment is when I arrived so tired and wet due to unexpected heavy rains and they checked me in immediately Friendly home like atmosphere Real Italian style Wi Fi was free and great Breakfast was very good and they always helped with bringing Taxis when and as needed The location of the hotel was excellent for my purposes

304101,Hotel Crivi s, I had a hard time getting anti allergy pillows and couldn t sleep well due to this They had an alternative pillow but it was like rock solid and had neck pain after sleeping on it , Very close to city centre Not far from everything like shopping food sight seeing Staffs were very friendly gave is even free late checkout until 3 pm Breakfast was limited but nice Wifi was very good as well 
304102,Hotel Crivi s, Obtaining coffee at breakfast was not always easy Hotel staff were not alive to new arrivals in the breakfast room , Reasonable location and comfortable rooms
304103,Hotel Crivi s, The reception could be much nicer with nice new sofas and nice new lamps It seemed that nobody wanted to hang out there like other hotels Dark and depressing 80s sofas It was clear that nobody wanted to spend time there Breakfast area was good Bedrooms and hallways were nice and cosy and functional , Lovely traditional typical old fashioned Italian hotel with perfectly functioning facilities and fantastic efficient staff It was like stepping back in time to its heyday in the 80s Quality and comfort as expected by a hotel which was designed in this period I loved it and would stay there again with pleasure as I appreciated the authenticity but it is not for everyone and I think for a four star hotel it needs a refresh in terms of reception sofas and lighting Stay away if you want modern 
304104,Hotel Crivi s, Poor behavior by the receptionists expensive for only fairly good quality Un expected checkout I got charged extra 100 euros i don t know what for Misunderstanding because of poor communication with them made me pay double expected price Please remove from booking ,No Positive
