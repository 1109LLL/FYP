21536,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The air conditioning fan was a bit loud , The location was great it was very convenient to walk to restaurants it was at the major metro stop and easy to walk to different areas for shopping 
21537,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, A C did not work in 2 of the rooms They gave us table fans to make up for it Rooms were not ready when we arrived and we eventually got 2 of the 3 rooms we booked almost 3 hours after the promised check in time The sink in one of the toilets did not work and hotel staff took almost our entire stay to fix it Telephone in our room also did not work for the full 6 days inspite of multiple complaints Too many issues for a hotel of crowne plaza brand , The location of the hotel is very good Well connected to the metro Good food options around 
21538,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, I was very happy to stay at the hotel my only disappointment was that I had specifically requested for Booking com for two Twin beds but they only passed to the Crowne Plaza that I had requested two Standards rooms the hotel only had one Twin available What a pity other than that my stay could have been perfect ,No Positive
21539,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The air conditioning is not cold enough When it is busy breakfast time there is not enough staff to clear up the table and the services could be a bit abrupt then , The breakfast is superb The metro station is just outside the hotel with connection to lines to major sightseeing sites 
21540,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, rooms were small the wifi did not work for an entire day and when it did connecting to the network took long, fantastic location very close to the metro
21541,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Arrived on Saturday tried to book the restaurant to be told that it was not available on Saturday and Sunday Evenings Unless I missed this should this not be advised when booking , Very good selection on the breakfast 
21542,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The noise from the Republique Palace in the front of the hotel disturbed me a little at midnight , Good for the business trip While the hotel is in the area of relatively north and east it is very convenient to everywhere in Paris Also if you have extra time you might be able to enjoy the hip culture of Saint Martin area In there you can see the totally different aspect of traditional Paris 
21543,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, I have a room facing the republic The noise level was a little higher than I would have liked, The location is great Close to a metro Rooms are comfortable and the staff is great 
21544,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Breakfast cold on each morning of our stay Poor layout to dining room too We would not include breakfast if we stopped again , Proximity to square and ease to get on tube
21545,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Totally impersonal treatment no one has a minute to answer a question Only the breakfast staff were polite, Zero personal attention in spite of me being a Spire Member The worse Crowne Plaza I have been to 
21546,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The only thing that brings my rating down is the dirty glasses coffee cups cutlery at the buffet breakfast I struggled to find a clean glass at the juice station on each of the three mornings I had breakfast there and on one occasion I realised too late that I had stirred my coffee with a dirty teaspoon very off putting , Location was perfect close to the metro and bus stop and in a bustling square with lots of shops and cafes restaurants 
21547,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique,No Negative, Hotel was beautiful we had an exceptional view of the republique and everything was convenient and near by Walking distance to center and food shops and bakeries opened late just a few steps away Subway in front and taxi and bus stand just across the street Exceptional experience
21548,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Yet again complimentary drinks selection poor and not enough provided When I asked staff who were topping up for more milk he would not give me more yhan three extra The milk portions are tiny and too small and I would say most would use two per cup To outrightly refuse yo give me more even when asked twice And to walk away whilst I asked was frankly rude Our friends who also stayed on our recommendation had a disaster with your room service breakfast which they said was very poor value for the money Not impressed These little things make all the difference It comes across as penny pinching but will ultimately lose you customers , Location Front of house staff bed comfortable but a bit too small
21549,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Bathroom cosmetics could have been better e g Molton Brown would be nice Concierge did not greet smile at all , Great location close to metro station and walking distance to bars clubs There are demonstrations happening on the square in front of the hotel almost every weekend so be ready for some noise Room 336 twin room with huge beds has great view of Place de la R publique Wifi worked pretty well Good selection for breakfast Receptionists were really nice and always smile 
21550,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Club Lounge was not up to the mark not worth spending free time there with non functional snack bar mostly , Courteous staff variety of breakfast location easy access Metro station Facilities offered at the hotel were not user friendly For example couldn t operate coffee machine in the room while the one at Club Lounge was not operative all day long 
21551,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The area around Republique felt quite poor there was lots of homelessness soup kitchen and demonstrations in the square and we were only there for 1 night 2 days, Lovely comfy beds esp liked the This Works sleep spray Staff were friendly and great recommendation for dinner on Saturday night from the concierge 
21552,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique,No Negative, Great location for exploring Republique and surrounding areas Vibrant lively city living area Recommend for people who enjoy everything that comes with the big city experience 
21553,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique,No Negative, The location of the hotel was great we walked for a lot of our trip and the surrounding area was lovely We were able to check in early and had an option of whether we wanted the front or back view We decided to go for the front and had a great view of the square It was lively buzzing during the weekend That said it wasn t terribly loud and during the evening it was fine 
21554,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Food was not that nice everything really over priced my room is not what i paid for or booked i booked that hotel for 1 room did not have it and i requested that room, The bed was nice comfy staff were plasent and helpful
21555,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, We felt cheated because when we booked we requested bed and breakfast but we were denied breakfast Considering the amount of money we paid we felt really short changed by booking com and the hotel Even now we are in Frankfurt but we have also been denied breakfast through we booked through yourselves at the Aparthotel Adagio Frankfurt , It just was a normal hotel
21556,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, No sink in the same room as the toilet you had to walk into another room but that is a minor thing Pillows weren t the best on the bed but each to there own , The friendly manner of staff and went out of there way when possible to help us out or answer any questions we had Upgraded our room when they found out it was the wife s birthday 
21557,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, They should provide more shower items since I need to be requesting for shampoo shower gel conditioner and body lotion It was only one available in a tiny tube , The location and the rooms are amazing 
21558,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Just one thing that needs to be dealt with that is negative in the lobby and bar there was a sewage drains smell lingering all the time , Nice comfortable hotel breakfast was great Location is good not too far from Gare du Nord but would go to Lafayette area if I returned
21559,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Republique is quite nice for the transportation but a little bit scared and with some people making assembly on the square , Very good breakfast staff confortable room good shower some restaurants near taxi stop and subway Very beautiful building 
21560,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Having atleast one bottle of water per person Fixing their bathrooms a bit before giving it to a guest , The staff was really helpful friendly The breakfast was very good Very convenient to commute to other places 
21561,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Room 149 I stayed in was run down and needed a bit of maintenance , Got upgraded to a Suite which was excellent as my earlier room had some fruit flies in the room 
21562,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique,No Negative, The location is fantastic Plus It is a four stars hotel but it is actually so much better than the five stars renaissance hotel near by I wouldn t get why people would ever have any reason to book the renaissance instead of crown plaza unless crown is fully booked 
21563,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Breakfast logistics weer very bad No cups no glasses no seats Rude staff at entrance , Great staff in bar Good location Metro at your doorstep Parking around the corner

21565,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Unfortunately the Plaza st the front of hotel too busy with protests rowdy crowds Lots of eateries but not goid quality, Great size beds fantadtic breakfast
21566,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Poor customer service we spent three nights in an unbearable heat and were never assisted with a repair Every time i mentioned something in the front desk I was disregarded Asked the manager for a discount and ended up with three cocktail coupons If the quality of the room is imperative for you avoid this hotel , The location
21567,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Asked for back area room as front area noisy when demos on most of the time but got front room Locked out of our room last day even though we had confirmed and prepaid for extra day , Good Breakfast Reception staff member helpful on directions 
21568,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Not enough tea bags and no cartons of milk in the room The separate toilet was too cramped , Quiet room overlooking a private courtyard Room safe easy to use 
21569,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The breakfast no French Cheeses they saidnot in august I guess August tourists are less important , Pleasant staff wonderful location clean and simple and fair price 
21570,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Such a beautiful place but once you go outside there were too much crowd vandalism garbage political activism in a nearby park independence statue It s not hotels fault I think locals don t appreciate the beauty of the place, Very convenient location from the airport just ride train get down at Republique go up the stairs and there you go the Crowne Plaza Hotel 
21571,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique,No Negative, Excellent hotel well located Metro outside the door and only 20 mins walk from Notre Dame if you prefer indeed walkers will find it good for many sites We had a quiet room and really pleased we included breakfast as it was excellent with nice fresh croissant and great cooked options Concierge very helpful ask for their recommendations of where to have dinner locally 
21572,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Prices for drink and food were very high Never ate there on this trip I did eat there on a previous trip and the breakfast was OK at best and certainly not at all worth the price , Very good place to stay when you arrive on an overseas flight Great location in an interesting and different part of the city Great staff I got a very good discount on the room rate making it good value 
21573,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The food and drink were very expensive as compared with restaurants in the area We therefore did not eat or drink in the hotel , Character of the building and the location Also friendliness of the staff 
21574,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, I paid 40 more than a chinese woman standing close to me during check out I know hotel prices are the most uncertain matter in life but I still argue when I can , Very good breakfast
21575,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Nothing , Great and comfortable hotel in a good location Not close enough I mean to walk to most of the touristic points but almost in front of a subway station You can get anywhere from there Near by many restaurants and a good night life I would definately stay there again 
21576,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The personal try to charge me the breakfest also when i did the check out they ask me evean the breakfast we did nt have it we never wake up so early to eat the breakfest that was not nice because we check out 5 o clock in the morning when you are not really wake i explain them we did nt have it and in the end they charge just was we have use it verry expensive the mini bar 1 red bull 9 eurooo The personal was not really good for the hotel with 4 star we don t get every morning the biscuit and chocolate what we must become from the hotel that s was on the free mini bar Next time i will search for my group another Hotel , Was on the good part of city not too far 
21577,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Location not so good but 1 minute from metro station About 15 minutes by metro to get to the city center This time was very noisy as French guys like to meeting for disagreements here , Great breakfast with chef prepared very delicious omelette good choise for cheeses hams juices fish etc 
21578,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The location was not central to most city attractions There were demonstrations going on on the square Large police presence made us anxious , Bed was comfortable room was reasonably clean a little shop worn We enjoyed cocktails on the outside

21582,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Overnight loud music coming from student demonstrators in square outside not the hotels fault but would ask for a room at the back in future, Excellent omelettes served at breakfast
21583,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Rooms small and front of hotel very very noisy from the main square traffic This Crowne Plaza is not as modern as some some room aspects dated and overall felt cramped with just two in a room , Location to Gare du NORD station good although definitely ask for a bedroom at the back or a high floor due to street noise staff very friendly and helpful 
21584,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, My room had a very small ceiling not possible to anything except the sky My shower was not working properly I asked house keeping to fix it no success Worst complimentary bottle of water was open and used I informed this on checkout they offered me a bootle of water free it was a joke I guess,No Positive
21585,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, We had a courtyard room which was a little misleading The windows were only half windows and did not offer any views The window shades were a bit worn and one did not open completely The bathroom was a tad bland and a little cramped even though it was the best use of the space , The staff was excellent and the location very nice Transportation options were right outside the door and easy to access The hospitality was warm and inviting The breakfast options 18 Euro were really good as well with a wide variety of fresh choices for a range of tastes The room had lots of natural light and was quiet from outside and guest noise It was nice to have 2 double beds to accommodate a family of 4 with small children 
21586,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, We had a superb breakfast but one of the waitress was very rude my boyfriend haven t finish he s coffe and food and she just came very aggresive to our table and took he s coffe cup and plate and we over heard she spoked rude to a old customer We stayed only one night and that was okay because we had a very small room with the small bed not very comfortable We was at two and we get only one bathrobe , Close to the metro station clean room superb breakfast breakfast the only one male waiter was super kind Fitness room was clean and nice I give a extra point for a jar of lemon water mint water We will be back for our next visit to Paris

21591,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The continental breakfast service was brusque I felt as if we were in the way and annoying rather than being welcome The bathroom was tiny but for one night more than adequate , The staff was friendly and helpful our room was quiet and comfortable especially given the turmoil taking place outside

21597,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Air Conditioning was ineffective Thankfully not essential during late September A 0 25cl bottle of water should cost EU6 90 , Great location friendly and professional front of house staff Comfortable and clean room 
21598,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, dirty towels and very very old bathroom the area is quite noisy so you cant sleep good if your room is located to the square, wifi worked good the staff fulfilled the tray with water and some sweets everyday
21599,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, Housekeeping no water available at any time no toothpaste no slippers which means lots of basic equipment missing for the price of 240 euros per night , Service in the breakfast it s very good very helpful staff

21612,Crowne Plaza Paris R publique, The exercise room was too warm to use , The hotel is located in the popular area We had a very nice room that we had to change because it faced the square where there was a lot of activity We asked to have our room changed No upgrade just moved and they accommodated our request without a problem
