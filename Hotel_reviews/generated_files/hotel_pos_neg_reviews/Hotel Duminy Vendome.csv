133406,Hotel Duminy Vendome, One of the people who was at the front desk was very rude when we let him know there was a problem with the sink drain The shower was tiny and uncomfortable , The place was clean and was in a fantastic location
133407,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The toilet was old and didn t flush great but it wasn t a big deal The lifts were not air conditioned and Paris was having a heat wave so hot but in normal temps would be fine It would have been helpful to have a list of restaurants nearby but the person at the front desk didn t seem to know There are lots of choices you just have to find them , The hotel was very nice clean and the staff was friendly The breakfast was wonderful with great service and good food Room was very large for Paris 
133408,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The lift is pretty small Be patient if you have luggages you may have to take turns As it could only fit 3 people in the lift , Great location Very close to the shops bars and restaurants Just a second away from Jardin du Luxembourg and few minutes walk to the Louvre museum The hotel lobby smells very nice 
133409,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The room was very small and not as I expected it was on a garret so very hot The air conditioning blown a bad smell , Nice breakfast with quick service Very nice position 
133410,Hotel Duminy Vendome,No Negative, I especially liked the way we were welcomed and how we were assisted by the Asian lady in the front desk unfortunately I did not get her name Two thumbs up to her hospitality 
133411,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Lift was erratic Room too hot and air conditioning not working Room was minute Had to walk around the bed sideways we are not fat people how do others manage Emailed before to request a room high up no reply and we were on the 2nd floor of 6 , Breakfast was good Staff good helped where they could 
133412,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The elevator took a little time to get from floor to floor , The breakfast was great The quality of food excellent Staff friendly and helpful Hotel was quiet 
133413,Hotel Duminy Vendome,No Negative, The staff of the Hotel Duminy Vendome were wonderful They provided me with maps as well as great excellent recommendations that ranged from restaurants to local attractions The location is great as it is 2 blocks from the Tuileries Garden and an easy walk to the Musee du Louvre The breakfast was worth every penny and was a great way to start my day I would absolutely recommend this hotel 
133414,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Rooms are Parisian small and bathroom even smaller but it is something that you need to live with in Paris , Perfect location and very helpful stuff I stayed twice already once for business and once with family weekend and in both cases it was a very good experience 
133415,Hotel Duminy Vendome, apart from its location there is nothing else to like about this hotel the worst was the smell of cigarette in the room unacceptable The price was ok for the location but there were other options in the area also very reasonably priced , The location
133416,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Very noisy at about 4 5am everday of stay Hotel had a slightly overpowering smell of perfume, Nice location 5 mins walk from louvre and 2 mins to metro
133417,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Condensed milk in the bar for taking with tea and coffee is revolting Better to have fresh skimmed milk available , Breakfast ok tea selection ok front desk excellent location excellent
133418,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Wifi Slow and stops sometimes Bathroom No tooth brush and toothpaste but I guess it is common in Europe Room 1 Asked for iron to fix up my clothes during fashion week and nothing was brought up ever 2 there are no outlet for charging phone next to the bed only near the desk or near bathroom wall 3 The sound proof was horrible that we kept on hearing our neighbour and their TV 4 There was ALWAYS a muggy humid smell in the room every time we come back from the outside Maybe because there isn t a fan or ventilation in the bathroom so humidity stays inside the room 5 The hangers were very annoying to use Environment There are two lifts but still takes 2 years to go downstairs , Check in service Great friendly efficient staff all fluent in English we had to change our reservation from single to double occupancy and the staffs were very accommodating and gave us a very good deal considering it was a busy week for them Room Clean decent size for the price bed was comfortable comforter is not overly heavy and the pillows are great too The safe has instructions and was very easy to use nothing was stolen or missing throughout the week we stayed 9 days Good closet space for clothes Location Unbeatable One street away from Metro stop Tulleries makes it easy to go to EVERYWHERE one street away from Rue Saint Honore near all shopping and restaurant locations plus plenty of banks or ATM near by One block away from Colette Room Service food wasn t top notch but definitely not over priced comparing to regular restaurants nearby 
133419,Hotel Duminy Vendome,No Negative, The hotel was excellent Not cheap but good value I have paid more for a lot less before and although I was on the ground floor street noise was minimal at night and in the morning Good breakfast And location was good 
133420,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The rooms are typical of European small hotels nothing fancy but very functional , Very close to the Louvre and many other venues so this was a perfect place to stay Since the street it s on is off the main avenue a block or so we found it quiet and central for places we wanted to visit 
133421,Hotel Duminy Vendome, tried to be eco friendly by hanging up my towels but they replaced them again anyway Facecloths would be good Some hotels provide darker ones for washing off makeup and find them good they didn t replace what we used from the mini bar on the first night when they serviced the room small things though so still very happy with the hotel , great location staff were incredibly helpful Room was very clean and tidy and bed was comfortable particularly loved the pillows
133422,Hotel Duminy Vendome, At this time was very noisy in the morning and night I can t sleep they close the door all the time and talking more and more in the morning i think from the housekeeping am very angry about that, Every time I arrived at this hotel was very good the room location staff every thing
133423,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Lift is slow and small, Stayed on the 5 th floor room 504 very quiet and comfortable Staff were all so friendly and helpful Area is perfect safe close to Louvre Latin quarter metro etc Highly recommend 
133424,Hotel Duminy Vendome, We asked for two beds in one of the larger rooms and we got two single beds so close together they were touching with no way to move them It felt like we were sleeping in a single bed Not great if you are travelling with someone other than your spouse partner , Fantastic location good breakfast very helpful staff 
133425,Hotel Duminy Vendome, One day our room wasn t serviced until around 3 30 pm , Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast and breakfast staff were really great Loved the soft pillows Location was very central and we could easily walk to museums and Notre Dame 
133426,Hotel Duminy Vendome, When booking I picked bed and breakfast but when we arrived they told me breakfast was not included in the first night that it would cost 17 Euro per head I wasn t impressed , Lovely little hotel and very central Rooms are quite comfy Staff are lovely
133427,Hotel Duminy Vendome, A little more milk in the room would have been greatly appreciated and for a four star hotel some of the bathroom decor was a little shabby but this is a minor point the shower was excellent powerful and hot , The location and the breakfast were excellent and the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant The chamber staff did an excellent job it was wonderful to come back to a warm comfortable room after a day sightseeing in typical February weather 
133428,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Ensure you request a room not on the ground floor The room walls were very thin Could hear every word from the room next door especially when they return to their room in the early hours plus there is the noise from the reception, Staff were very nice and hotel in great location Staff did find us a new room for our second night which was much bett
133429,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The rooms were rather small and the hotel is quite basic in terms of facilities although the complimentary coffee and tea area at the waiting lounge was a great welcoming touch , Value for money considering the amazing location reliable wifi connection and very friendly and helpful staff 
133430,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Room was small for the price tariff although it was clean and well eqipped, Bed comfort quiet location but central good breakfast buffet by most standards
133431,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The room wasn t anything to brag about small but we coped just fine The shower however was so tiny that anytime you moved you risked accidentally turning off the water The whole hotel had this perfume throughout that was very overwhelming especially to those with a sensitive nose and allergies Some might enjoy the perfume but we did not , Couldn t beat the location for the price was so close to everything and great value for money The staff were helpful and friendly 
133432,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Single room is a little bit small but it s fine to stay 3 or 4 days , Good service of the front desk and housekeeping everyday Nice fry egg during breakfast Nice location of the hotel Also stuff can help to book shuttle bus to airport 
133433,Hotel Duminy Vendome, 1 The rooms were not noise proof at all and the walls transfer talks easily If you have a sensitive character it is not possible to have a good sleep 2 The pillows were not comfortable 3 Although the hotel is clean but the structure and facilities are old If you do not prefer the old environment I recommend choosing another hotel , Staffs were kind and available for requests and questions 
133434,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Seems to be a trend with my recent bookings but once again I m a bit annoyed by the non smoking room constantly smelling of smoke Would have to assume is was from neighboring rooms Opening window helped but outside temperatures made it hard to do for long Heating system unfortunately just pumped in more smoke , Location location location Close to the Louvre Place Vendome and an easy walk to Champs Elysee Price was quite competitive relative to other hotels in the area Breakfast was surprising good

133437,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Sound insulation is not very good air conditioner sounds a bit noisy , Very good hotel Location is very good very clean and comfortable the staff are very hospitable breakfast is also great Want to re enter the next jurnery 
133438,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Typically as a North American we are accustomed to more space This is not a reflection on this establishment but generally of the different expectations between Old and New World , They were extremely accommodating when we messed up and booked our train leaving one day early They did not charge us extra and even facilitated our departure in a timely and gracious manner The evening desk clerk from Africa was delightful and very thoughtful He fetched me a cuppa tea when I could not sleep from jetlag 
133439,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Really This place is the best value , A great value and really good location for visiting the heart of Paris We ve stayed before about 6 years ago and it s just gotten better Very near the subway and lots of restaurants and coffee shops
133440,Hotel Duminy Vendome, We had a view of the inner courtyard I d recommend a street view , The location is perfect just down the street from the park and very central to the great sites of Paris Breakfast was also very good 
133441,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Late night dessert ordered in room service was not good Didn t even eat it after first bite No pocket wifi available for rent We were spoiled by this on our recent travels , Breakfast was included We didn t know but this was great And they opened at 0630 so we were able to have a bite before our early departure Staff were courteous and so helpful excellent staff 
133442,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Only one thing elevator was small 2 people plus luggage was tough , Friendly efficient greeting reception rooms unencumbered easy access to metro to Tuileries place de la Concorde haute couture houses to all the sites on the Right bank Close enough to the Left too

133444,Hotel Duminy Vendome, First night we were given room no 1 and from 4 30 am we were woken up by deliveries trollies being pushed and extremely noisy elevator bottom mechanism that was only on other side of a thin wall It was so bad we had to take ear plugs and stuff them in our ears to manage a bit more sleep Room no 1 should not be given to guests unless they are seriously hearing impaired ,No Positive
133445,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Nothing really , Great location near the louver shopping area The room size was good for one person It was very was clean the bed was comfortable

133449,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The lift was inoperable our entire stay and thankfully we were only on the second floor Rooms are small but adequate , Close proximity to many key attractions Walkable to many attractions 
133450,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Though we did not ask for our towels to be changed it seems that they were and what we got was not properly washed and had stains all over Also some of the juice water glasses at breakfast had traces of lipstick on them , The hotel has an unbeatable location right in the city center yet on a quiet side street Close to several metro stations Reception staff is very friendly and helpful computer with printer available downstairs as well as tea during the day Breakfast is very good especially the scrambled eggs

133452,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The shower was miniscule There always seemed to be someone who wanted to clean the room including 2 hours before check out on the departure date Some of the main TV stations did not work on my TV After calling for someone to fix it twice in each case the fix lasted less than 10 minutes I gave up , The staff at the front desk were very welcoming and helpful They answered all kinds of queries from all kinds of people and their English was perfect The breakfast consisted of a very nice selection of food in quite a unique space The rooms were nicely presented 
133453,Hotel Duminy Vendome, We spoke to 2 separate front desk employees on 2 different days about the trains running to the airport for our return Neither said anything about what appears to be a well publicized rail workers strike that greatly impacted our trip We would have taken a cab or shuttle if we had known , Nice room in a great location We got the deluxe room and appreciated the extra space Friendly and helpful staff The breakfast buffet was very good too Reasonably priced compared to other hotels we considered 
133454,Hotel Duminy Vendome, The room was too small Not at all what looked like on the web site , The location was excellent the bathroom was clean Staff very good Breakfast good 
133455,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Better Wi Fi signal kept dropping , Location is fantastic Hotel is nice and comfortable bathroom a bit tired and fairly basic but clean and quite big
133456,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Very noisy our room was right behind the lift and the lift was very load so my wife was unable to sleep In my opinion that room should not be used as a bedroom and should be converted to a storeroom or something else it s just not suitable for someone to sleep in I felt the area around was a little soulless lots of high end shops but no atmosphere or energy ,No Positive
133457,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Noisy if you kept window open or shut Lots of truck deliveries middle of night early morning Thin walls if you have noisy neighbors TINY SLOW elevator If noise keeps you awake not for you Also if you are impatient and can t manage stairs since the elevator issue not for you, Location to sights shopping metro Upscale location opposite the Tuilleries Little cafes nearby Some great restaurants nearby Very clean We loved our room Twin beds pushed together was comfortable to us 
133458,Hotel Duminy Vendome, Wi fi connection was dodgy We could always connect on our phone but only about 20 of the time on the tablet Noisy garbage truck came down the street at about 6 every morning Lifts are small and unreliable Both of the rooms we stayed in looked tired , Excellent location and a bit cheaper than most hotels nearby Our room for the first night was wrapped around the noisy lift well and was on the first floor so got lots of street noise Successfully requested a move for the remainder of our stay Staff were very helpful Fifth floor room was comfortable Breakfast selection was pretty good 
133459,Hotel Duminy Vendome, First given room 108 on the first floor at the front which was incredibly noisy and also had the smell of smoke coming from the street so we had to move There is a small bar very near the hotel and when it closes the street gets busy with people chatting and unless its raining all the smokers stand outside in the street Next given room 007 which is on the ground floor at the back of the hotel and much quieter , The rooms are large for a central Paris hotel do not expect USA type rooms The beds are comfortable and the service and staff are wonderful The hotel is always clean and fresh

133463,Hotel Duminy Vendome, We had both the single room and the double room Both were very small but are ok There were no room space to walk around especially if you are choosing the double room , Very close 1 minutes walk to other upscale hotels like the Westin with a fraction of the price Close to the Opera Concorde and the Louvre Even a 20 30 minute walking distance to the Champ Elysees There is a bakery and a small Carrefour branch within 10 minutes walking distance There are metro stations near by at Concorde and the Opera Bus stations are also near 
133464,Hotel Duminy Vendome,No Negative, We first stayed at this hotel almost 50 years ago and have watched it change yet it still preserves its personal courteous service and a pleasing old world feel that combines with extensive improvements the beautifully designed new breakfast room in the basement for example
