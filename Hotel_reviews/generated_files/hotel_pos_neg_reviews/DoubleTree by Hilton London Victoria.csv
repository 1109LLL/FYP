87221,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, My only criticism would be the price I thought it was on the high side for the type of hotel it is but that said I did not book too far in advance so therefore expect to pay more I ll give myself more notice next time , I liked the hotel because of it s location and convenience to Victoria station it could not have been better We did not really use any hotel facilities because we spent most of the time out not even the bar The room was clean functional and quite acceptable I would not hesitate to stay here again

87226,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, We got upgraded to a bigger which is great but the extra sofa bed wasn t meant for sleeping luckily we had a king size bed and we all had to sleep in the bed together all 4 of us The housekeeping tried to bring an extra bed sheet to put on the sofa but still not fit to sleep due to the old spring sofa bed hopefully the extra bed will be changed Else for a family of 4 would be a bit of challenge to stay or share together , The location of the hotel was very accessible to both key locations such as Buckingham Palace Westminster Abbey Parks as well as the tube which just right across the road

87248,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Nothing The stay was perfect, It was my partners birthday When we arrived we were greeted by lovely staff who just so happened to ask us about our stay where we mentioned it was her birthday Just as we were leaving a member of staff pulled me aside and asked me for my partners name I thought nothing of it We went out and explored London for a while by the time we came back we d discovered a lovely slice of cheesecake with Happy Birthday written onto the plate and a birthday card written for my partner signed by all the staff An amazing surprise and really put the cherry on the cheesecake so to speak on our stay 
87249,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The wifi didn t work in my room so I couldn t access the Internet The view out of my window was Victoria station not very interesting , The room was perfect and the bed was like heaven The staff were amazingly friendly nothing seemed inconvenient for them The location is brilliant due to transport Easy to find and the breakfast was spot on 
87250,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, reception staff need to be trained more housekeeping services are annoying in the morning with lots of noise in the corridor , Unfortunately I had a bad experience I liked nothing 
87251,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, My only suggestion for improvement would be making the wifi sign in totally hassle free You have to go through The Cloud which is great if you already have an account but took my jet lagged partner a little while to set up , Super comfy bed Warm cookies upon check in was a lovely touch The whole experience was easy and welcoming Gorgeous smelling free toiletries Great location for walking with suitcases from Victoria station 
87252,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, To go to 10th floor you need a lift to 9th floor then again stairs to climb up But this is short term problem I guess , Superb room with helpful and gentle staff
87253,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The noisiest room I ve ever stayed in The room was overlooking the station and whilst we were expecting some train noise we didn t bargain on the incessant rumbling scraping noises from a waste recycling plant next to the railway sidings which seemed to be going all through the night When I complained the next morning the receptionist stated she had been told about this before but thought the plant should only be operational for one hour during the night I managed to get very little sleep because of the noise and this was despite the background noise of the air conditioning fan which we had on full blast to try and drown out the racket , The bed was comfy and the air conditioning worked well The hotel was very convenient for Victoria Station Underground
87254,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Housekeeping and cleanliness could have been better , Fantastic locatio directly across the street from Victoria Station Walkable distance to most major attractions in London The breakfast was a complete success offering many choices including eggs and omelets made to order 
87255,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, For some bizarre reason there was no shower curtain fitted to the rail over the bath and as a result of which the shower was almost unusable , Convenience of location to London Victoria
87256,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The only reason this property didn t get a full 10 from me was that the gym was very basic , The staff in the Doubletree were absolutely fantastic Right from check in to check out they were fantastic The dinner in the evening was lovely as was breakfast next day The hotel is across the Road from Victoria Tube Station close to Regents Park and in the heart of everything Great hotel that I would highly recommend 
87257,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The room was 27 c despite having the air con on the coldest setting it wouldn t force it any lower than about 26 c Also the shower was very poor the water dribbled out I d expect much much better , Great location at Victoria a 15min walk to Regent St or a one stop tube ride to Green Park Room was an ok size not too small 
87258,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, There was no toilet brush and we never got new toiler paper even tough we almost ran out of it after the first night , Staff especially at the reception was very nice Location was excellent
87259,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The bed was a little firm for my liking but maybe others would think it is perfect , It was a warm and comfortable room friendly staff Excellent location for seeing london 
87260,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I have stayed in Double Tree Hotels a few times and this one unfortunately let the side down a little The room was good but the floor was a little dirty and the shower and bathroom had the signs of a quick rinse rather than a thorough clean The breakfast was a little lack lustre and not much choice For the money you pay I would expect a little more attention to detail a bit more finesse and certainly a really clean room In addition the website informs you that on a Premier King Deluxe you will have a mini bar and a fridge No mini bar and the fridge was as warm as the room was ,No Positive
87261,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I paid by cash for my room on arrival and was Meade to feel like some lower class by the staff that was on the desk We was not able to order room service because we had no card but was able to go down and put a balance on to enable this fair enough , The Hotel was modern and comfortable
87262,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, one of the lifts was out of order and didn t get repaired for the 2 days we stayed there, It was lovely to be welcomed with warm cookies and smiling staff Thanks for your kindness
87263,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and the beds were comfortable The location was great Right across the street from the train station who could ask for anything better than that 
87264,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Room too warm didn t fully understand cooling air con till next morning My wife was really looking forward to a bath as our bathroom is out of action but no bath in room Breakfast was nothing special and breakfast staff were uninformatve as to what was available , Modern facility and extremely comfy bed
87265,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, There was nothing that I didn t like , Great location the hotel is next to Victoria train station Customer service first class Very helpful reception staff especially Christina and Angelica Nothing was too much trouble Comfortable room Breakfast was goodz
87266,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The room for 3 of us was very cramped also facing the train station so from very early am the noise from outside was very loud considering i paid over 600 euro for 2 nights i expected a lot more from the room, The location was perfect
87267,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Staff gave an unapproachable unhappy vibe Lack of information presented to you on check in Breakfast only served until 10 Was in contact with the help desk multiple times in advance of booking who were helpful in providing me assurance of an early check in due to an event I was attending but when I arrived at the hotel the woman on reception was very blunt and said that no request had been notified and told me to come back at 2pm to check in I returned at around 12 45 to the help of a male receptionist who was very helpful and provided me with another room that was available , Small walk away from the city centres attractions 
87268,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, There wasn t anything I didn t like only fault was room service took almost an hour to arrive, The room was very spacious comfy bed and great location
87269,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Cramped room, Asked for a family room it was just an ordinary double room with an extra bed in it not really worth the price we paid for it was just as well I was only staying 2 nights
87270,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Not necessarily a pain point however I felt that the rooms and service were very mediocre and nothing to write home about Fortunately the location was great and the room wasn t expensive we spent most of our time out and about in the city , Didn t get the opportunity to use all the facilities but from what I saw they were OK What I liked most about this hotel is the location 2 minutes walk from Victoria station literally therefore pretty central Ease of access to so many places including good places to eat and or bars For this reason I could stay again 
87271,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The breakfast was ok but the scrambled eggs were cold and there was no other option for eggs i e poached or fried , The room was lovely and clean plenty of hot water and the bed was soooo comfortable 
87272,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Pull out bed was uncomfortable Could feel the springs on the mattress against my bones No bath towels in room When I called reception they bought one towel when there were three of us in the room Security lock box was not fixed for the entire 4 day stay Had to carry my valuable around with me at all times Broken toilet Water keep flushing Had to push hard to stop it Reception failed to follow though on the morning call Caused me to be late for an event Very disappointed with this hotel , Very close to the main metro station
87273,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Didn t really provide much amenities but I could make a request , Best location to travel via public transportation such as train or bus Facilities are okay I would highly recommend this hotel for its location Loved it 
87274,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, For the price of 150 a night I was expecting more not just a standard looking hotel the room was okay but it was more for half that price I would get the same Breakfast they were using ham and cheese from the day before because it was visible the drainess of it they should offer more options it is from the hilton group I was expecting more good moments, All hotel very nice was a good start with a welcome cookie and friendly stuff that print us tickets for teathre Room was great 
87275,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, A choice of welcome cookies an option without nuts The tiling in the ensuite could have been finished a little better at floor level and where tiles were cut to house screws , The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a brilliant night s sleep We also appreciated the free upgrade to an executive suite Breakfast was brilliant and our evening meal in the restaurant was delicious 
87276,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I was surprised a hotel that has such a price tag doesn t provide complimentary water in rooms, very comfy bed and duvet room very quiet food in restaurant very good great service
87277,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The room was fairly small I expected it to be a little bit bigger considering the price and the fact it was in a Hilton Honors floor Plus it was hard to get into the elevator Only two out of three were working and we had to wait quite a lot on Saturday morning ,No Positive
87278,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Reception staff on arrival put us in the wrong room and wanted us to pay for breakfast when it was already included in the deal I was also requested by the receptionist to forward all my emails about the hotel back to them Which seemed a strange request,No Positive
87279,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Breakfast was really mediocre in terms of choice and quality , The room amenities bathroom comfort control system and the quietness There was an excellent well designed workspace with lots of power outlets 
87280,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Problems with lifts a nuisance , Just what we needed for our short break and theatre visit Location excellent room comfortable and breakfast tasty Would certainly book again 
87281,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria,No Negative, Love the location Very central to places of interest and attractions either within walking distance or just a bus tube train ride away Victoria Station was just opposite the hotel Wicked the musical a stone throw away and lovely cafes and restaurants nearby 
87282,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Free wifi was not very good, Room was warm beds very comfy very little noise from busy road outside friendly staff Convenient for getting around London
87283,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Room warm and struggled to turn down air conditioning so it was turned off , Lovely hotel helpful staff Excellent breakfast and fabulous food on bar menu Hot cookie on arrival a real treat 
87284,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria,No Negative, Great stay Wonderful staff comfortable room and perfect location Ordered the traditional breakfast room service for one person and it was big enough to feed all 3 in our family 
87285,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The room is smaller than the picture shows The receptionist told me the room is very big I don t really mind the size of the rooms but please don t lie to customers ,No Positive
87286,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Had the 2 course set menu far too small not good value the crumble pudding came out in the ramekin Main menu was far better value which felt a bit lmisleading,No Positive
87287,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Bath shower water pressure was poor Highlighted to reception on check out staff apologised , Super location adjacent to London Victoria train station Gatwick Express is 30 min train ride to airport Room was clean with modern amenities and comfortable beds quite room
87288,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, On our first night we asked the sour faced barman if food was available without speaking he looked at his watch and then threw a couple of menus down on the bar We took them to a seating area and were chatting and looking at the menus I briefly went to the toilet and when I came back my friend told me the barman had taken the menus away I saw a member of staff serving people with big plates of food so enquired to her if food was still available her reply was food finished one minute ago So the attitude of the bar staff and lack of basic communication got our weekend break off to a very poor start We went to bed hungry after travelling all day Is that how a four star hotel operates It was very embarrassing as my friend was visiting from abroad and had been travelling all day yet they allowed East European prostitutes to bring bags of smelly McDonalds into the bar and eat them there without buying any drinks , Check in out staff great breakfast staff also very efficient but due to problem on first night with bar staff we did not use the bar area again during our stay Room fine everything to a decent standard We would have liked a kettle and coffe tea facilities in the room but had to do without which is not great when you want a drink when you first wake However as we were packing our bags to leave at the end of our stay we found these facilities hidden away in a draw Quite frustrating but overall a good hotel Twenty seconds walk to Victoria station but the prostitutes eating McDonalds in the bar is not good for this hotels image so we did not go in the bar again after the first night 
87289,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The fact there was no hot water to shower and they only offered a 50 discount for one night , The staff were very friendly however we had no hot water to shower for the entire duration of our stay and they have only offered me a 50 discount on one night when we were there for 2 nights so I was not particularly happy 
87290,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The pillows were the worst Uncomfortable and flat, The room was comfortable and clean it was big and lovely to relax in It had everything u needed to enjoy ur stay 
87291,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Just picking but there was not really enough tea or coffee in the room Only one sachet of hot chocolate and no decaf coffee It would have been nice to have asked if we would like different eggs besides scrambled we were not given any instruction at breakfast and staff seemed very overwhelmed Not sure if it was an option but our friends would have preferred a bath rather than a shower , Location to Victoria Station was very useful We choose this hotel for the location being so close to the Victoria Apollo Something that could be used better to your advantage when advertising your plus points Staff were accommodating for our request for all of us to be next to each other Excellent choice at breakfast Every taste catered for Although we overlooked the station we did not hear any of the trains and would recommend these rooms we were on the higher floor and would say this would be better than being closer to the street 
87292,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Room was not clean enough mug with dirt coffee mark Towel rack under the washing basin had dust and dark mark Staffs were in cold face and not friendly Bell desk never sent helping hands I had been stayed different Hilton in different countries I can say this is the worst one They charged me almost 200 night not even provided with bottle water in room Breakfast was not good and choice were limited Relatively paying the same rate I can find a better hotel than Hilton , location
87293,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, If I had to pick something perhaps the room could have been a little bigger I would also have liked the use of a swimming pool , Breakfast was exceptionally good I eat only the white of eggs as I have an allergy to the yellow I requested the white and was presented with this wonderfully cooked egg I hope to make a return visit soon 
87294,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The only slight criticism was the queue for breakfast it was really busy not enough tables for the amount of guests , Liked everything about this hotel it was in a great location to where we needed to go 
87295,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Advice in room was misleading as it gave impression breakfast was served until 11 on weekday morning which was not the case V expensive for a breakfast , Good range of food 
87296,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The breakfast was okay I would have preferred better quality over quantity , The location is excellent near to the train station and lots to do nearby 
87297,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria,No Negative, Great breakfast and perfect location It is just in front of Victoria station and also close to Victoria coach station And they give warm welcome cookie That is awesome too 
87298,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Having to leave a 30 deposit for our stay and then then saying they d return it immediately however our stay was Saturday and now on Thursday and no refund , Pillows were plumpy and room was cosy

87319,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Our room was looking a little tired around the edges but was spotlessly clean The dining room is very very small so time breakfast carefully and be prepared to wait a little bit but there is a good selection We left our bags whilst we shopped and they were not stored securely when we returned there was nobody there keeping an eye on them and we had to retrieve them ourselves from by the front door , The location is great for getting around London the room was pleasant and the beds comfortable and the room was spotless and you could not hear too much from outside

87323,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The shower in the room was blocked and being at the end of the corridor every temperature change took 2 3 minutes room 515 This meant I nearly scalded then froze my 7yr old daughter When we thought that was sorted she ended up in floods of tears because water quickly began to flood the floor Maintenance came quickly but none of us wanted to use the shower after that Then the air conditioning could not be turned off It repeatedly reset to far warmer than suited us and the noise when I tried to get it to cool the room made it hard to sleep I was going to call down again but the kids were extremely tired by this time and didn t want another person in the room with us all in night clothes Furthermore they charged me twice for an adult breakfast when only myself and one child were eating and offered no concession for the previous night s issues This was an expensive stay as a treat for the kids and I wish I d booked somewhere cheaper I stay in London for business regularly and thoroughly believe had I been in my suit and heels I would have been treating significantly better ,No Positive

87352,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Small room The shower was awful it made terrible noises lost pressure and flooded every day which required a visit from maintenance and housekeeping to sort out each time We were almost late on two occasions because of this No root cause was found so we just lived with it We tried to order room service drinks at 11 01pm on Saturday night and were told the service finished at 11pm so we should use the mini bar fridge The fridge in our room was completely empty and no alternatives were available , The location was excellent being very close to Victoria station and in walking distance of major landmarks The staff were very friendly It was especially nice to have a bottle of bubbly and some cake sent to the room to congratulate us on our anniversary Very thoughtful

87367,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, WELLLLLL There were issues with the room It was a warm day and I wanted to turn the air conditioning on I would set it and it would return to 23 degrees C Then i tried to open the window and though there was a sign that it just tilted in for safety purposed I thought at least some air would be nice It would not open not matter what I did A workman came and adjusted the air and it was fine BUT it was exceedingly loud Luckily in this case I wear hearing aids Made it tolerable when I slept He then started repairing the window but after about a half hour or so and installing some hardware he sort of gave up to work on it in the future My toilet was running for while but straightened itself out after I was away for a while Housekeeping accidentally turned off my bedside table and I had to get someone up to show me how to restore it I assumed the black buttons were decorative I had tried pushing them down but it seemed they worked by tipping them The only other issue I had and I assume this is a British construction issue because I found it elsewhere I nearly tripped on the high marble doorstep to the bathroom , Although the hotel was on a back side street it was convenient to most of things I wanted to do The staff was absolutely magnificent and responded quickly to all of my needs Went my purse went missing they even offered to let me charge more on my bill so I had some cash Luckily I recovered my purse at a local convenience store minus the money only 4 pounds but the credit cards all intact I had occasion to eat in the restaurant Very nice Everything good and nice selection The concierge even walked me two blocks to show me the right turns for a strange street crossing 
87368,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The only small problem was that the pillows were feather and not firm enough so when you lay on them your head sunk to the bottom , Room was very clean and beds very comfy There were three of us so one had to sleep on a pull out bed but even that was really comfortable 
87369,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, staff was kind but not trained They were not able to book a room for us to extend our stay I has to do it online There is a minibar in a superior room but with NO drinks , position room are very clean
87370,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Wifi was difficult to log into The extra camp bed in our room was very uncomfortable and noisy The room was too small for it My friend and I travelled with my 9 year old daughter and so booked a family room But I feel this kind of booking requires a larger room not just a regular double with a camp bed inserted in the corner There was very little room to move about , Staff were very helpful Very close to Victoria tube station in fact the location was vey central Breakfast also very good with great variety of food 
87371,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria,No Negative, Perfect location for train bus station station 2 mins walk Rooms very modern clean comfortable Staff very friendly helpful View from our bedroom window was looking over railway station so be aware that you do not always get rooms with views of London Would definitely stay there again A free warm chocolate cookie given to us on arrival 
87372,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I can t really think of anything the pillows could have been more firm but that s about it , We held out conference in the hotel with a buffet lunch The conference room was fantastic especially compared to Las Vegas which are always too cold no windows and terrible color scheme Thank you for making it warm with wood paneling and windows The buffet lunch was delicious Loved the room and especially loved the location as I took an express from Gatwick walked 10 steps and I was basically at the hotel 
87373,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Communication was complicating as they kept emailing and asking for my credit card details when booking Com already had them We went out for the day and expected our room to be cleaned by the time we got back 4 30pm and it wasn t Not good when you have a very tired child wanting to sleep while they clean your room The breakfast was limited and always crowded I don t like giving negative feedback but we did expect more from a Hilton Hotel and the price we paid , Location Was perfect place to stay for us as close to the tours we went on and easy access to transport with Victoria station and tube right over the road

87377,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I couldn t manage to log in to the free internet but it didn t effect the stay , The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was a nice size Lovely luxurious bathroom 
87378,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I was told brexfast was on offer at 12 50 When I ordered it it was full price 18 50 each apparently I had to pre book the night before this was not made clear when I mentioned it I was told there s nothing they can do My first time in London I ask of possible heigh floor room with front veiw I ended up 3rd floor looking at the back , Room was clean and lovely
87379,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Why take 30 and then refund if you don t spend it They say they only pre authorise but then keep it authorised for another week POOR EFFORT, Staff were good breakfast very good
87380,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, beds not comfortable thired bed was unsleepabe hotel was unable to replace it not possible to have hot water for coffe or tea in the room no place for suitcase, best thing about this hotel is location
87381,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, When arrived for checking in the staff member was very rude with attitude The staff member slammed our room key on the side and we got left to our own devices we also got asked for a 60 deposit which we never got told about until arrival A little later in my partner and I went to the bar to order a few drinks there was three staff members behind the bar but yet it took five minutes for them to actually acknowledge us Overall I was disappointed with the stay as it was a surprise getaway for my partners birthday ,No Positive
87382,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The first room they offered us was far too small for 2 people We complained and were quickly given a free upgrade The second room was lovely though not very well cleaned , The staff were very helpful and the location was excellent for Victoria Station We didn t use any of the hotel facilities 
87383,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The area lots of redevelopment resembling a building site in places but that s London I guess, We found our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean all the staff were excellent and Location was central to our needs 
87384,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The team in the restaurant started to lay for breakfast around us while still eating our evening meal at 9 30 pm They reached across to pour wine and generally hung about up to 6 at one point only 3 metres from where we were eating Not very convivial ,No Positive
87385,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Had to ask for our room to be cleaned on 2nd day somehow got double charged for room and had to call our bank to explain to hotel as they denied it Luckily had it reversed and funds refunded , Good breakfast across road from Victoria station transport and taxi very friendly staff all the time

87387,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Due to our air conditioning situation we were very kindly provide with a breakfast voucher which we were extremely happy with I would say after having breakfast it is not worth the money as it was quite limited although lovely I am glad we did not add this on when originally booking , Location of this hotel is great a minutes walk from Victoria station Room was fantastic clean and comfortable Although our air conditioning was not working once we reported it to reception it was dealt with brilliantly Staff were friendly and went out of their way to help checking in with Mira was a pleasure Will definitely be back to this hotel when we visit London again

87389,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, when we arrived at the room there were three men sitting on the bed apparently adding new channels to the TV No warning from reception The aircon unit made such a bad noise we had to turn it off and so the room was boiling The banging from the cleaning room door opening and closing all of the time was really annoying, location was good quick access to most places in london

87557,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The check in staff was unfriendly and not helpful The room was extreme small We booked for 3 adults as our child is 16 And we could hardly walk in the room let alone put our suitcases somewhere There was no way to change the situation even the manager could t do anything apart from a small discount I understand rooms are small in London and all cities is the world but we paid more the 700 pounds for 2 nights I expected a lot more for that amount of money and a Hilton Hotel, Location close to bus station and train The concierge was very friendly

87577,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Room was tiny Expected more considering the price paid Bathroom had shower and no bath so that was disappointing too They advertised free wifi but you had to be signed up to the Cloud to use it, Great location right next to Victoria Station Perfect for catching the Gatwick Express Concierge extremely helpful
87578,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The rooms are not as insulated to noise as I thought You can hear people talking in the hallways Also there was a very annoying noise started at 2am which was probably coming from the aircon heating system It woke me up and made it difficult to fall asleep Not ideal for business people who have to get up early , Location is good especially for gatwick airport Good to have the executive room it has good view and more comfort 
87579,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, I had checked out early on my last day and had forgotten my house keys and flight pillow in the room Luckily i remembered at 3pm and asked a friend to pick up my things for me I am very disappointed because the Hotel did not call me or email that they had found my things Why ask for this information if you are never going to use it very unprofessional , THE WELCOME COOKIE The deluxe queen has Comfortable bed the staff were friendly

87584,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The only thing I was struggled is hard to understand the ladies who were in front of the desk spoke the English they have strong accent , I had booked this hotel for several times it is a good hotel with cleanliness and convenience to travel in London the hotel is located in the opposite of the tube and train station 
87585,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Tried to put me in a very small double room very little space to move about Complained this was not what was shown in Booking com advert and was moved to the normal double don t know why they try it on Should supply water in bedrooms Shower was not very good no power , Good location easy to get to Pleasant hotel

87590,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The view was horrible from our room but about par for the location which we chose for convenience Room satisfactory but would not want to spend many hours there awake Bathroom hand basin cracked , Close proximity to Victoria Station Early check in as we had a wedding in West Dulwich at 3pm Comfortable but not luxurious Breakfast was reasonable quality and good value 
87591,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, This property is way overpriced for what you get especially the breakfast One of the front desk managers completely darkened our whole stay there She was particularly rude and sarcastic Regarding some travel problems we were having she offered no solution Literally talked back to me Did not even treat me with basic sensitivity nor as a customer whose satisfaction was important She seemed to have no regard for the fact that she herself is a public representative of the Hilton but rather she acted as though she was doing me a favor by just being there even there are 100s of hotels to choose from I will never go back there or recommend this property and I may never choose Hilton again because of Giulya, over all the staff were nice and the property is clean
87592,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, Room for 3 persons was actually standard one with double bed with added bed so quite crowd But staying just few nights can survive , Overall good quality perfect location just behind Victoria station

87602,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, For over 200 a night still required to pay 19 for buffet breakfast However breakfast hot beverages were available in the room so that was some consolation Fridge is empty and one must ask for it to be stocked Automatically charged 30 against possible bar restaurant purchases to be credited back eventually if not used Reminds me that London is an expensive town , Perfect for arriving leaving from Victoria Station Rooms are comfortable and quiet Bar area is pleasant A lot of fun places to eat and drink right behind the hotel on aore intimate street 
87603,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The breakfast was terrible I had the eggs benedict It was cold The toast was undercooked the cream was without taste I never ate their again , Location and ease The room service food hamburger etc was excellent

87607,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The room appeared to be a single trying to be a double as one side of the bed had only 8 inches between the side of the bed and the window My wife had to climb down the length of the bed to get out Room 826, The hotel itself the staff the cleanliness and modernity of the bedroom

87614,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, On arrival couldn t check in as room not ready but to be fair it was midday The room we were then given had a 4 foot bed We complained and they told us it was a double In fairness the staff upgraded us to a full double room , close to tube rail station 
87615,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, we ordered a taxi cab and I think that the driver was friend with the concierge man The normal price for that distance it was 84 90pound and he took 140pound Never take a taxi for long distance from concierge man , clean and confortable close to coach and train station

87619,DoubleTree by Hilton London Victoria, The window in our room was broken and couldn t be opened The televisions sound kept going up and down A couple of things at breakfast although i feel it was due to a particular member of staff who on the first morning forgot about our poached eggs and by the time we got them they were more like hard boiled The second morning he completely forgot about the pot of Tea and when we did get it there wasn t any milk by this time our breakfast was finished , The staff were very friendly and helpful in reception as well as being greeted in the restaurant Some of the staff were especially attentive Air conditioning was good
