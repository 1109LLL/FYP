119277,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Lovely hotel amazing location next to st Paul s cathedral There was a small issue but this was very quickly resolved by very helpful manager Would highly recommend this hotel 
119278,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room could use some updating better lighting and better AC My husband worked from the hotel room during the day while I went out for work and he said that the room got quite hot during the day A couple of hooks in the bathroom and an extra towel or two would be lovely , Club Quarters really grew on me as we stayed At first the one room suite looked dark and smelled musty but the large table coffee making equipment and the small fridge along with a nice bed and pull out sofa along with free bottled water and ice on level 2 swayed me On top of that this hotel is in an outstanding location 
119279,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room looked onto a concrete wall and seemed the furthest from the lift around corridors up and down stairs would not have been suitable for anyone with poor mobility Room 352 dark and dingy Bathroom dated and smelly Problems with the tv couldn t get channels so called reception Reception sent help who moved a few cables and it worked for the evening Next morning the same thing menu came up but wouldn t respond to remote yes the remote was working as sent light Couldn t order room service from external website as details given by the hotel were not recognised Air con really noisy and without it room very warm and stuffy Only one window opened slightly No teaspoons on tea tray only enough milk cartons for one cup each I booked last minute and paid 129 for a double without breakfast , Comfortable bed fantastic location Restaurant next door had good food and service Reception helpful Water facilities useful to be able to fill up bottles 
119280,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Fantastic location great staff lovely basket for my friend s birthday will definitely be back Lovely coffee available all the time and cold water Nice touch with the biscuits Really comfy bed Great breakfast available next door Thanks a lot Mattell 
119281,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very weak water flow in the shower and especially in the toilet , Very friendly staff Perfect location Coffee and bottle of water as complimentary whenever you need it Cafes and restaurants all around Definitely would stay again 
119282,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Not really a hotel more a great room to sleep But that s all you need in London, Great location for east central London Fair price for a clean and comfortable room with friendly and helpful staff We will use this hotel again
119283,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Staff on reception not friendly Upon checking in I was asked to provide my card and enter my pin for an amount of 289 00 when my booking com confirmation had said it would be 259 00 for two nights I questioned this and was told rather abruptly that I wouldn t get charged for anything until I checked out I repeated that as I was a little confused by the price and also this method of paying and was hastily told something about pre authorisation and again told that nothing would be charged until check out Later that evening after an issue with my card whereby I had to phone my bank I was told that 289 00 had been taken from my bank by the hotel I questioned this again with two different reception staff the next day who before I could calmly finish explaining what had happened interrupted and very abruptly told me that the whole amount is taken on check in and held until check out Upon check out I would be refunded the difference 30 00 which I am yet to receive back I got the impression that I was bothering the staff who weren t happy to help and didn t even get a smile from them or what I felt was a genuine apology for the confusion I await the money that requires paying back , Room was comfortable and managed to get a great night s sleep Customer cupboard was great for guests to help themselves to additional coffee tea etc Location was excellent 4 mins from St Pauls tube station and loads of restaurants nearby nice short walk to the Tate Modern and views of the Cathedral too 
119284,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, When Christina was off the gentleman on reception was surly unhelpful and rude he charged me 50 00 which has never happened before and when I queried this he said I would get it back as long as I did not take the shampoo however I thought it was there to be used he also charged me three times on my card for the room which blocked my card and I had to wait a week for the charge to drop off not happy with his service , When Christina is on reception the place runs like clockwork and is the reason we go back again and again as she is fantastic 
119285,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bathrooms need renovating Plastic shower curtains are a no no for London Laundry machines were faulty , Stylish rooms nice gym brasserie is terrific for breakfast
119286,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very loud wedding party at adjacent venue that kept us awake This would prevent us from booking again if this is routine at weekends , Location and convenience
119287,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Hotel quite expensive probably because I was there during peak tourist season Bathtub needed renovation maintenance as some rust was showing , Big room including kitchenette and working space very comfortable high quality high speed WiFi Excellent locaton both for business and leisure Just a few meters away from St Paul s Cathedral with plenty of landmarks accessible on foot and good public transportation 
119288,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The breakfast was a bit disappointing Provided by the neighbouring cafe the Continental lacked sufficient variety whereas the full Monty was not that full , Perfect location very convenient Nice facilities good size rooms Very good complimentary coffee water bottles to go Overall tidy and well maintained 
119289,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Lots of traffic at night including garbage collection and other activities such as street clean up etc which for a 4th floor room facing Ludgate meant numerous wake ups , Ability to walk around in the evenings Millenium Bridge etc walking distance 30 min to many places Covent Garden British Museum 
119290,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, How would you feel if during the summer months in London and nowadays they can get hot you get into your room and the air conditioning doesn t work And it struggles to move the temperature from 26 5 to 26 3 in two hours And it gets all stuffy And the windows don t open And when you speak to the front office or housekeeping they say that yes that is a problem but we can t solve it and then they rub it in by asking if they could do anything else We stayed 4 nights from the 8th to the 12th of July at this hotel at the end of our long travels Our nights inside the hotel room made us believe we ll end our holiday on a new low but then the London weather smiled on us and became cooler for the last couple of days Oh and yes they did move us from one room to another equally stuffy but the temperature did go down to 26 1 They did try to make with free breakfast vouchers for a couple of days but for you enjoy your breakfast you need to have slept well , The location is fantastic There is the touristy huff n puff around you but if you re ok with that then there s little else to complain 
119291,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, First reception not what a 4 star very impersonal similar to the new Hub by premier inn bed really hard seems to be a trend as the Hub Hilton and Holiday Inn all use them Very noisy very poor sound insulation , It s location the room was large 
119292,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, I liked the free coffee and nutribars in the business centre I like tea coffee in the bedroom I like tissues in the bedroom I would like a toilet brush in the bedroom 
119293,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Needs a safe in the room , Excellent location great for walking across the millenium bridge to get to the sights at Westminster Breakfast at Joes kitchen next door was a great way to start the day definitely worth a visit 
119294,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Booked superior rooms with kitchenette x 3 for 4 nights Rooms were so small you had to shuffle around the bed to get in no kitchenette and when complained and told reception this was the room we booked she informed me that this was the biggest room they had Extremely disappointed and will certainly not be booking here ever again 
119295,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The girl on reception seemed a little aggressive when I queried whether we could have early check in I appreciate that there can be no guarantee but her response was far too negative for my liking , Rooms were clean
119296,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We booked a rather pricey double room for 2 nights We arrived at the hotel very late only to be given a room where we had open a number of fire doors walk lengthy corridors stairs up and even more stairs down Imagine all this while carrying 2 suitcases each one of us The room was clearly in a different building without a lift The walls were paper thin and we could hear those next door talking not to mention shutting their door I ll never come back , Location
119297,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The lighting in the room was very bright and intense first thing in the morning It was also quite a compact room you had to move the desk chair in front of the door to be able to move around the room easily , The bed was firm which we really like It was surprisingly quiet for its proximity to the road and it was nice to faintly hear the bells of St Paul s The location is fantastic very close to the cathedral and the river 
119298,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing in particular , Met expectations Good location Friendly staff 24 hour access to small extras on each floor Bottled water available on each floor Value for money 
119299,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Decor a little dated and tired in places Television remote did not work despite the little light flashlhing so had to control manually and then the television kept going into standby mode , Great location Friendly staff 
119300,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Liked Location, i did like the room and staff however i was dissapointed with the end bill being increased because of V A T in my opinion i should have been advised of this prior to booking and arrival 
119301,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The smallness of the queen room, The 2nd floor has a laundry room Ice buckets An ice machine A water dispenser and also a vending mahine that sells alcohol 
119302,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We have stayed in many Central London hotels and this was the worst value ever For 220 per night we had a superior room with a shower room so small the wash basin was in the bedroom The mini kitchen only had a microwave and china over what any decent hotel room has The room was small and the double bed even smaller Though clean there were holes in the sheets The heating cooling fan was so loud you could not sleep with it on Best of all you could clearly hear conversations in the neighbouring room and when other rooms ran water it was like an express train rushing through the room I could go on but you get the idea , Difficult to find anything good to say Only consider this place if it s location is vital you have a double to yourself and do not mind awful value The staff were fine but clearly had no control over the very poor hotel fabric room quality nor were they able to respond to complaints about these 
119303,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Breakfast service air conditioner is very loudy and ineffective Windows do not open , Location clean perfect and free coffee personnel smile all time
119304,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Limited interaction with staff so didn t create a welcoming atmosphere No bar or room service after 11pm , The bed was comfy and the shower was lovely hot and powerful 
119305,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room was small and had paint chipping on the wall Wasn t told they would hold a further 20 off my card encase and extras were needed I am still waiting for that to be released The receptionist was quite rude ,No Positive
119306,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bathroom smelt used when we entered lots of electrical items were faulty inc tv hairdryer and phone Staff were unresponsive and did not want To help with issues Poor amenities in the room no toothpaste or ironing board Overall not worth the 214 spent ,No Positive
119307,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I would say a bit cheaper but it was so competitive no issues at all , Staff were great always had time for you and very helpful Room was very comfy as was the bed Great location access to a lot of attractions is good we walked everywhere so seeing the sights was easy 
119308,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The printer at the lobby was out of ink could not normally print out the boarding passes , The location extremely friendly and helpful staff the breakfast ar the lobby connected cafe is great 
119309,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The staff were rude The rooms are dull and dingy No fresh air in the rooms and it was really humid and hot so had to sleep with AC on and woke with sore throat Have stayed in club quarters Lincolns inn and the staff are amazing and the place is like a palace compared to this dump Shower was dirty I do have pictures but don t have time to post right now ,No Positive
119310,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We thought the breakfast was expensive although it was of good quality Reducing the price would encourage more residents to partake of meals , My husband required extra pillows and these were supplied speedily and with a smile The bathroom sink failed to drain properly once reported it was repaired within a few hours excellent service We thought the check procedure and the security arrangements were particuarly good we felt safe at all times 
119311,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, One of the hardest beds I ever slept in We asked for a quiet room but they gaved us one that was lookeded out to the street Front desk need to learn how to smile Seriously I ve been working at a reception for four years now and my boss had fired me after one week if my face was that stoned The man that checked us in charged a bigger amount then it says on the confirmation During the check out when I asked why he did the answer was as a guarantee OK fine But why didn t he tell us about that I think u need up the service and hospitality game , Free shampoo body wash hand soap and body lotion Free bottles that you can fill with water in the corridors 
119312,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Friendly staff who actioned requests immediately We prefer thin pillows and as the ones in the room were too high we asked if they could be changed they were very shortly afterwards The room was spotless and the bed very comfortable The breakfast menu was reasonably priced and the buffet dishes fresh and the complimentary coffee tea iced water facility was a bonus Bus and metro services within a few yards and frequent taxis passing 
119313,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room was very hot as it was a hot weekend We couldn t get the air conditioning down to a lower temperature and it was noisy , Bed was comfortable although extra pillows would have been good Staff were very friendly and helpful 
119314,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Location was great See photo of view of St Paul s from our room Staff friendly and helpful sealed bottles provided for you to fill with water which was much needed on the underground a hot day 
119315,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing, Air conditioning was ace even in a roadside room 6th floor fairly quiet I liked the water dispenser and fruit and nuts available in the reception area 
119316,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The stay was dominated by probably the worst nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel It was akin to trying to sleep in the middle lane of the M25 The room was at the front of the building and the secondary glazing was useless Seriously this is unacceptable I had an early start for an important conference and at 2 30am I wanted to give up and go home And yes I had earplugs , The staff were friendly and helpful 
119317,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, N A, Location is excellent for exploring dinning bars and a short walk to the metro station Bus tours stop 15 feet from your hotel so you may explore even more of London 
119318,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The breakfast was very poor Just some boxes of cereal a bowl of fruit a toaster like we have at work and a few pastries Not the exciting buffet hotel breakfast that you would expect for 200 per night I won t be coming back ,No Positive
119319,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, would have liked to have had the facility of having an evening meal in the hotel, loved the idea of the help yourself area in the lounge where snacks and drinks were supplied It was easy to entertain visitors
119320,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very expensive l felt for room only despite location Drinks on the expensive side especially with waiters that fail to return with your change , Location allowed to check in early very efficient check out 
119321,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Broken glass in the cupboard above the sink curtain puller came off in my hands took 20 mins to check in despite being the only people in the lobby air conditioning poor at best , Good sized room comfy bed
119322,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, A mini fridge in the room would have made our visit a bit more pleasant The bathroom was tight strictly one person at a time , Great location next to St Pauls Cathedral and many restaurants A small but well planned room so that there was room for everything for a couple Free laundry facilities for hotel guests is an excellent bonus Nice common area on main floor for coffee tea newspaper some snacks Fast elevator service and friendly front desk staff 
119323,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Just about everything The Airco was noisy and ineffective My sleep was disturbed by clonking pipes The shower water when tuned to full heat was not even lukewarm The staff refused to give me a invoice since i wasn t the person who paid for the room and called me rude when I insisted , I could check in late in the evening 
119324,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Tired room cheap mugs cheap coffee plastic stirrer cheap toiletries Very noisy, Decent location by St Paul s but room at front on 6thfloor noisy all night 
119325,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bed was a bit small for two people , The softness hardness of the bed was excellent The location is perfect Even at 2AM we where checked in promptly The room has built in usb charger ports 
119326,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It might not have fully registered with the hotel we were travelling with a child as when our room became accessible there was no sign of the sofa bed we had relied on finding We noted this at reception and went off to do some sightseeing and on our return found that the sofa bed had been duly put up so all was well We also found two rather than three sets of towels in the bathroom In the event we simply got on with it though given the helpful responses to our other request we don t doubt we would have received another set had we asked , The front desk staff were most helpful and friendly and the manager on duty went out of her way to enable us to re print tickets for a particular attraction which we had left behind thank you very much again The location was absolutely fantastic for the things we wanted to do and is very easy to reach by public transport just be aware that the travel options are a bit more limited on Sundays The free chilled water available to bottle and take away with you on the floors is a nice touch as is the tea coffee station in the lobby And what s not to like about looking out at the lit dome of St Paul s from your bedroom window at night 
119327,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No public toilets on ground floor , Room was larger than I expected and looked onto a quiet rear hotel view Staff were very helpful All areas were clean Good to be able to access coffee and a range of teas in the public lounge 
119328,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The rooms need to be updated and some of the fixtures in the bathroom was rusty but as was staying for one night it would do The Gracechurch property is much nicer, Great location Adequate property 
119329,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, AC was a tad temperamental but only a minor thing , Excellent location clean comfortable and great facilities like free chilled water tea coffee Staff were great a relaxed atmosphere with top notch service which is always nice 
119330,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Brilliant location right by St Paul s Lots of restaurants nearby Good customer service hotel provides everything you could need including a launderette Double glazing is excellent couldn t hear the tour buses right outside our window at all And the City of London is lovely at the weekend deserted and packed with an amazing jumble of architecture 
119331,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Only 1 pillow per person and no additional ones available in the room Stayed in Room 106 and able to hear the argument of the couple in the room next to us Tea and coffee supplies could have been a bit more generous only 2 sachets of milk sugar teabags for two people Staff were efficient yet a bit distant a genuine smile goes a long way , Good sized room for London Good Location good hotel for somewhere to sleep 
119332,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Perfect stop over and staff very attentive , Perfect location for St Paul s and Paternoster Square Dined at Paternoster Chop House aka First Dates restaurant and an ideal location to explore London the following day 
119333,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing, As we were travelling with 7 people we enjoyed the lounge very much with delicious coffee and tea facilities for free some computers to use the internet some facility to pick some free water in plastic bottles on each floor The staff was very friendly and helpful 
119334,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Something to consider is the proximity to St Paul s Cathedral While this might be a boon to some consider that the cathedral bells sound every quarter hour day and night This might not be ideal for a light sleeper or someone who can t sleep while wearing earplugs , This was an ideal base for a 2 night stay in London I tend to walk everywhere when I m in the capital as I find that I always notice something I ve never seen before and found that the hotel was a short walk from Liverpool Street station There were many other amenities that could be reached on foot The room was small but still felt well designed and comfortable There was plenty of storage and a very comfortable bed Staff were friendly and efficient at one point my room key stopped working and it was replaced instantly and with an apology The ground floor lounge with free drinks is a nice touch I will quite happily stay in this hotel again and at others in the chain 
119335,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The only thing I felt was missing was a tea towel , The location was excellent with plenty of bars restaurants coffee shops and convenience food stores nearby It was also very handy for the underground and regular buses to take us to different parts of London The staff were very friendly professional and helpful The room was spotlessly clean and I was very impressed with the facilities particularly the number of plugs available and the charging points I would definitely recommend this hotel and will return when I m next visiting London 
119336,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The complimentary Lounge room for guests supposedly stocked with beverages was in a disarray pretty much the whole time I was there Only on my arrival on Thursday night did I actually find beverages Pepsi products in a small fridge The rest of the time there was only coffee or tea available In all fairness the coffee was quite good , Great location nice neighborhood very convenient to the Underground Thames London Tower St Pauls etc

119338,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Layout of the family room was a tad restrictive kids bed in the lounge area closest to the door This confined us to the bedroom only , Excellent lounge area communal and fantastic restaurants just footsteps away Location is the strongest point for this hotel west end or city are both easily walkable

119340,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The deposit for the room took 5 days to return to my bank account which was not explained when I checked in This wouldn t matter if you were using the same card to pay but is an inconvenience if you are not , Great location and good value for money very easy to get to from the tube or bus Room was big and very quiet we were at the back and the bed was huge and very comfy

119342,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room very noisy all night Think it was the heating or air conditioning pipes Still very noisy when we turned the air conditioning heating off at the mains , Location

119346,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the bed, Excellent location decent rooms The hotel provides water and water bottles free tea and coffee The only negative point was the smallness of the bed I will definitely return for my next trip

119368,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the bathroom is small, The service provided by the staffs are fantastic They treat their guest like their family members and make you feel like part of them as when my pick up driver had a dispute with me during my departure to the airport the front office ladies actually came out and help us out to discuss the matters which she had gone extra miles within her job scope Much appreciate it 
119369,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The fact that the bell on the cathedral rings every hour during the night makes me never want to stay here again , The location is fantastic as its next to the cathedral and close to everything

119382,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Breakfast is expensive and not good The continental breakfast options are really poor I think standard there should be boiled eggs or cheese which were not at all You can easily cross the street and find more places to eat in and they are cheaper and has more variety, Perfect Location
119383,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, what I did not like I told the staff at the reception that the shower head to the flexi pipe was leaking and they did not repair it within the two days I stayed at your Hotel I checked for myself and it was only a case of changing the gasket the water presser was low So the water was running down the flexi pipe and you can imagine there was very little Water to Shower , We like the cleanliness of the room

119387,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, You do hear the bells from St Pauls at all hours in the room but some people may like that and maybe it was just the location of our room perhaps be worth asking at reception when you check in if you are a light sleeper , Friendly and helpful reception staff Good facilities in room everything from ironing board hair dryer cooking facilities fridge table to work on Cold water dispenser on the floor near the lifts but be warned if you use the plastc bottles provided that the lids are not great and your bottle is liable to leak in your bag Nice lounge area on ground floor with free hot drinks and another water dispenser

119393,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The rooms weren t as clean as you would expect from an expensive hotel Maybe I am a clean freak but if I pay this much money I would expect the room to be specklessly clean Also the size of the room wasn t clearly stated when I was booking The air conditioning was too loud The neighbours were too loud We could even hear them sneeze They probably heard us talk as well I also saw that on the hotel s website the same room was cheaper Then the cheaper room disappeared so I cannot prove this claim But I recommend to check the prices at the hotel s website before you book , The location was excellent Easy access from the public transport 
119394,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Excellent service quick simple check in out great value for money for central London location Within easy reach of the historic city of London and also Bankside and Borough Market Room was well equipped very clean and had all the facilities you could need Staff were polite friendly and very helpful

119473,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room not cleaned properly on 1 out of 3 days and tea coffee products not replenished in full , Room and hotel as a whole has everything a solo traveller needs Cote restaurant is also great

119476,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bed has completely ruined my back After one use the toilet was blocked The room was grubby and staff on reception were miserable and irritable We only stayed one night thank goodness and it was a soul destroying experience , Can t think of anything other than a good location for the wedding we attended around the corner from St Pauls 
119477,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I did not like the self check in process This is actually the first experience in the hotel and it s a very cold and impersonal one , great value for money considering location facilities vs price very good location right next to St Paul s Cathedral good facilities fridge small kitchen tableware microwave owen room was clean very friendly and helpful staff

119480,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, What s not to like , Right beside St Pauls cathedral and a short stroll to millennium bridge the Tate Modern and The Globe Great facilities the lobby with free refreshments and a warm fire is delightful Quiet even in the centre of London 
119481,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The reception people lacked the communication skills knowledge I expect from an up scale hotel Speaking rapidly with a thick foreign accent as some did does not work in a noisy environment The breakfast was not included The central heating was stuck on hot , We found this hotel ideal for our purposes and the room was nice and at a reasonable price 
119482,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Double bed a little small but ok Thin walls in back rooms crying baby next door just unlucky I guess First time in front rooms was better , Location in front of St Paul s and close to tube Free good coffee in lounge Quick check inn lots of pubs and restaurants in hidden square next to cathedral 
119483,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Price Bathroom a bit dated but room and bed very comfy , Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were busy Extra pillows arrived within 5 mins The landing cupboard was a good idea help yourself to extra coffee tea blankets shampoo etc Love the toiletries not screwed to the wall 
119484,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing, Excellent location comfortable clean rooms friendly helpful staff thoroughly enjoyed our stay would highly recommend will definitely be staying here again
119485,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room wasn t small but it s not comfortable for three people , Location is great There are a lot of interesting places nearby so you can go by walk In addition it s very easy to take a bus or London tube Also staff was great extremely helpful very good check in and out and always a smile It s not common 
119486,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We didn t know we should pay the full amount of our stay plus insurance on arrival you receive your insurance back at the end of your stay There are computers with printers available on the ground floor however the printers were out of ink We also had some problems with the microwave you will find certain instructions to prepare it for usage when using it for the first time Also the lights in the room are all turned on or off at the same time except for a small lamp so it s either too dark or too bright in the seating area In addition the wifi could ve been better , We stayed at Room 344 which accommodates three guests and has a small kitchenette The room design was extremely efficient for the area it was perfectly arranged to separate the main sleeping area from the seating area and it has a fully equipped kitchenette The room temperature was very comfortable around 22 24 degree Celsius without turning on the heater at all it was very well insulated The beds are extremely comfortable The hotel location is also fantastic very close to St Paul station which is on the central line that goes to oxford and hyde park St Paul Cathedral is fantastic it is seen as you go outside from the hotel entrance There are at least 3 supermarkets at a walking distance and many cafes and restaurants just across the street The hotel also provides free coffee on the ground floor which is nice 
119487,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Extra pillows but that is all , Location location location And some great deals at this hotel Recommended and nice and quiet for being central London 
119488,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It was a very bad idea to use a sliding door for a bathroom Also it s not possible to turn on the bathroom light without illuminating the rest of the room , Convenient location friendly and helpful staff cozy hall excellent equipment for digital devices USB ports for charging laptop to TV connectors etc 
119489,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, My only real complaint was that while they had a hair dryer available I couldn t find a plug for it in the bathroom So I had to sit on the bed I could still see myself in the mirror to dry my hair A bit odd Maybe I just missed it and I admit I never asked The toilet in our particular room was very slow to fill back up and had a few problems with finicky flushing as well , The amenities and the staff here were excellent The staff went out of their way to make sure that our stay was enjoyable and that we had anything that we needed They even had adapter plugs for us when we asked where we could buy some nearby I was quite impressed Even though breakfast was not included for us if you get downstairs early enough they have fruit and snack bars set out as well as a coffee espresso cappuccino maker available 24 7 In the afternoon there were nuts dried fruits wasabi peas and chocolate candies all available from dispensers 
119490,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Doors need to be repaerd not able to close 2 there is no safe box in the room but not that important, Location compleat satesfaction for the value free refreshment in the lobby area coffee tea etcget for my mony
119491,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The air conditioning didn t work very well in our room Too hot during the night , The lounge area with complimentary coffee and biscuits was well laid out A very nice feature 
119492,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Breakfast on a Saturday doesn t start until 08 30 and I needed to be out by 8am so had to skip breakfast , Great location in the shadow of St Paul s
119493,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The option of checking out later could be advertised a little more as well as the ability to leave bags in a room to pick up later , I loved how close the hotel was to everything Two tube stations only minutes walks from the front door and attractions easy to access by foot The staff were very friendly and helpful I also like how many breakfast places were on the doorstep I also felt very safe staying in the hotel due to the card swipe lift 
119494,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bed a little small Side tables too near bed kept hitting them at night , Convienence of fridge and microwave in room Easy check in out Spacious bathroom Hotel located near many tourist attractions 
119495,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, What the hotel don t tell you is that upon arrival they take a holding fee of the total amount they tell you the card details are just for authorisation of stay When you then check out the next day they duplicate the payment and the holding fee takes 5 x working days to be released My advice if you are staying there is to use a credit card as opposed to debit ,No Positive
119496,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It is a small room Good though for the price I guess , Location Pictures on the walls superb and books on the shelf Cosy And tea coffe water and snacks in lobby as you wish microwave in the room kitchen corner All that you need 
119497,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room was very small and a random person entered our room while we were in there saying he usually needs to check the bed for confort I don t believe he knew we were in the room Hotel staff wasn t able to answer who that person was , The location is excellent and many attractions are located within walking distance St Paul s tube station is also nearby 
119498,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We did not like the fact that the wash basin was in the room as you walk in by the door and not in the bathroom, The location was great and friendly staff
119499,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Staff let themselves into my room when changing knocked and entered without waiting No biscuits Even in cheaper hotels you at least can have a cup of tea with a biscuit Ok stay for overnight after staff party but nothing special , Location is very central
119500,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I booked the room and added my children to the booking however when I got to the facility after traveling all day I was told I did not book the right room After traveling with children I just wanted to relax in the room I booked a month in advance I should have been able to check in the room I booked then later tell them if it was too small or not They changed my booking without asking I did not like that , Comfortable and convenient 
119501,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Our room and the bathroom in particular was quite cold There was no heater in the bathroom and the one in the room would get covered by the curtains if we closed it , The lobby lounge with all day snacks and hot drinks Walking distance to many attractions like the Tate Modern Covent Garden St Paul s Cathedral 
119502,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Beds way too small water pressure particularly poor Showers drain poorly meaning you are standing in a puddle Our first night we had no hot water but the staff were helpful in getting us into another room Perhaps it s just me but whatever deodoriser they use in the rooms smells like cheap aftershave , Location was fantastic Easy to get around loads of bus and train options St Paul s cathedral right on your doorstep how beautiful We were travelling for a while so having the option of free washing and drying was fantastic Free coffee in the members lounge plus an apple or muesli bar Staff were lovely and accommodating For us travelling off peak overall it was value for money however I would balk at paying full price 
119503,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The beds not comfortable at all the room cleaners didn t do a good job and the noises from the elevator is so bad I stayed at room 744 and it was so bad, Location only
119504,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It was all good I was impressed given the price , This hotel is located very centrally really is perfect for sight seeing and getting around The staff and facilities are nice and certainly much better than I expected at this price point in central London I really doubt you could get better value for money 
119505,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, called as error with preapproval not lifting Staff have not responded as promised and a week later the preapproval is still on credit card People staying should get written confirmation that preapproval lifted when checking out ,No Positive
119506,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Our room was quite small and the shower in the morning was cold even after running it for over 5 minutes so after having cold showers we mentioned it at reception and were told it would be noted there was no apology for the inconvenience , The location was great right next door to St Paul s Cathedral and the reception area with free coffee and somewhere welcoming to meet was much appreciated 
119507,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Wonderful friendly and helping staff especially Ahmed from Gambia Lobby amenities including the coffee tea TV room and orienting facilities By the trains and transportation Great location Will be back 
119508,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nasty modern art Some slightly tired fittings , Friendly staff ease of access cleanliness and central location Plus little extras like toiletries and water some locations skimp on 
119509,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Decaf tea in the room would have been great V helpful staff directed us to a cupboard where we were very pleased to help ourselves to a sewing kit but no decaf tea great location, Really comfortable beds good shower with pleasantly scented shower gel and soaps etc and fabulous view of the cathedral 
119510,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Lack of information about AC In the winter there is only heat To turn AC off you set it to off and then wait 20 minutes for something to happen , The hotel is smart clean comfortable and quiet Very close to St Paul s The suite was nicely arranged 
119511,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Heating got stuck on 32 during the night 2am Phoned down to reception only to be told we could only get it turned off not down if they sent someone from maintenance We finally got to sleep at 3am only to be woken by a truck delivering the clean linen to the hotel No bath only a shower with only one flannel and one hand bath towel , The location St Pauls is beautiful if a little loud at night but being that close what can you expect 
119512,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very disappointed given the price Poor facilities no bar so we had to get our drinks from the attached independent restaurant and walk through the reception to a badly designed seating area The bed was poor and uncomfortable the pillow only one each was so thin it was like sleeping on the floor The room was next to the lift so sleep was almost impossible because of the noise Cannot recommend , Location 
119513,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Cleanliness of the hotel Location to all the shops and tourist attractions This hotel was the quietest one I ve said at in London Loved the sound of St Paul s bell chimes on a morning
119514,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Couldn t get seated in the restaurant Had a poorly child and couldn t order room service When trying to order a takeaway was told it could only be done through the hotel and the system was having problems so basically had to go without evening meal Staff unbelievably rude ignorant and unhelpful, Location was good It was clean enough although not spotless Kitchen facilities were ok
119515,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Central London location aside this hotel lacks any kind of charm or USP for the price Reception were transactional rather than friendly The rooms were small and even on the 3rd floor traffic noise was constant through the night as were the hourly chimes from St Pauls , Convenient location
119516,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room size very good but bathroom very small and no shelves or hooks for toiletries , Wonderful to see the facade of St Paul s cathedral from the bedroom window and feel the buzz of the city Good to have water and drinks available both in room and in the lounge area 
119517,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Speedier replacement of kettle no hotel guest toilets other than shared with Cafe Rouge, Staff were excellent check in welcoming great view from room good lounge facility for meeting friends
119518,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It s a bit noisy loud people in the corridor and noisy water system when you flush or use shower but it s just a minor thing common to lots of hotels, It s compact but not cramped very clean and staff were friendly and competent Great location 20 min walk to west end with some great places to eat nearby 
119519,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room was functional but looking a little tired and dated We had a problem with the heating which was on cook mode and we needed to call housekeeping to unlock the windows to cool things down , Fabulous location Like the lounge area with complimentary drinks Housekeeping attentive with our request for additional pillows 
119520,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Wasn t given any information regarding meals specifically breakfast which led us to believe breakfast didn t start until 9 on the Saturday so we went elsewhere Found out from another guest that breakfast is served for guests only earlier down stairs It would have been nice to know this from the start of our stay to save us finding somewhere else to eat Even an informtion poster or clearer information in the rooms would help, The rooms and locations were excellent
119521,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Curtains let in too much light , We were lucky enough to have one of their recently refurbished rooms Well thought out facilities and the new furnishings were to our individual taste 
119522,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Cost 200 for a standard double nothing fancy dated bathroom shower curtain who has those in a 4 start hotel Too excessive for the amenities no bar no mini bar no restaurant no breakfast incl no pool no room service vending machines for snacks expect that in a travel lodge not CQ s Process improvement consultants have been in since I last stayed efficient however added only the Travelodge easyjet model to what was a private members club venue previously therefore my rating is lower than normal , Location ideal
119523,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Guest stairs not brilliant leading you outside That s if I found the right ones , Staff brilliant and accommodating Made my daughter s birthday extra special 
119524,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the weather could have helped but just visiting a weekend for the Christmas shopping we couldn t asked more , It was very convenient the facility at the lobby area having available coffee and drink plenty of tables to relax charge phone and laptops etc warm and cozy the bus stops outside could get anywhere easy though first you need to learn the bus routes recommended as its quite centric 
119525,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, An additional elevator would not be bad , Perfect location only a few mins walking distance fm St Paul Sbwy and City Thameslink Luton and many buses just stop in fron of the Hotel taking you to the very downtown of London Extraordinary clean rooms comfortable beds 10 points in all categories from us 
119526,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, You could hear the outside noise in the room but it wasn t too much of a problem , It was nice to have the lounge area with access to hot drinks It made it feel like a home away from home 
119527,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Seems like these people haven t been to the Continental Europe you cant call breakfast that contains boxed cereal croissant and toast only with jam a continental breakfast and charge 9 50 for that Because of change of plans I made two bookings that I requested to merge in one the Staff wasn t able to do that had to check in every morning and had to give my credit card where the safety deposit was taken every time , It was a good location close to the District and Central Tube lines 
119528,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Temperature of room could not be controlled it was too hot A C did not work windows could not be opened without assistance from staff not much use at 03 00 in morning when trying to cool the room Bed a bit hard , Friendly hotel in good location well designed good sized room 
119529,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The noise made by the heater It hissed from time to time , We loved the perfect location of the hotel situated next to St Paul a very convenient area with plenty of shops restaurants take away and mains of transportation Big bus stop in front of the hotel several tube stations and a train station for London Gatwick shuttles The staff was very helpful assisting us with our shuttle from airport at arrival Although we checked out 2 hours after our departure they allowed us to warm up the baby s food into a room Junior suite is perfect for family fully equipped with microwave a dinning corner and 2TV screen We already plan to come back in 2017 
119530,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, dated decor no in room safe and mini bar poor comfort familly with 2 kids were given queen size bed and single sofa not to mention that kid s age were given in advance standards throughout are miles from 4 star , location friendly staff 
119531,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We were brought a pot of tea at breakfast last time a self service tea bag in a cup of not quite boiling water from a pump flask was a bit disappointing but a request did result in the desired pot , I ve never had a microwave AND a fridge before 
119532,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Poor shower no safe in the room no mirror convenient for make up poor tea and coffee offering peppermint tea bags on offer would have been good tv at an awkward angle to bed position , Location and front if house staff were terrific 
119533,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The basement was an unappealing place for breakfast On the other hand the adjoining restaurant is good but not open for breakfasting guests I should go for breakfast somewhere nearby another time , Efficiently run and well organised Modern clean and tidy 
119534,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room was more like a mini office than a typical bedroom suite and the bathroom sink was outside the bathroom These gripes however are easily outweighed by the positives and we will definitely go back , The location is absolutely superb walking distance of so many places including the West End 
119535,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, One of the two lifts was out of order so at peak times much pressure on the one working lift unfortunate at the weekend , Superb location close to St Paul s Cathedral Very good room and quiet night Staff efficiency and friendly competent service Excellent Cote restaurant on hand 
119536,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Helpfully supplied extra pillows but quality left much to be desired flat hard and lumpy , Availability of free tea and coffee Good shower Excellent wifi Helpful dining staff 
119537,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Upon returning to the hotel from my night out I was looking forward to a nightcap in the bar However I found that the bar closed at 11pm I was disappointed with this , I enjoyed the basics which was what I was after 
119538,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Unfortunately we were very delayed due to public transport problems and didn t realise there wasn t room service availability after 11pm , Very good location Stayed here for the following day s Lord Mayors Show Quick and efficient check in and out staff and process Lovely Breakfast Compact but nicely designed room 
119539,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The hotel staff at reception are just one step away from being rude they are not friendly or approachable The walls of the room are like paper due to the placement of our room we were surrounded by three rooms and I could tell you every word all the people in these rooms said had a shower put the hairdryer on when they left and returned to their room It made for a very uncomfortable night on our first night there as we were constantly being awoken by our neighbours who were doing something as innocent as flushing the toilet The beds and pillows were also very soft and I woke every morning with a sore neck and back , The Location of this hotel is ideal five mins walk from the St Pauls Tube station and then less than 10 to the Blackfriars tube which means you have two main tube lines at your door St Pauls cathedral is right beside the hotel and the Tate Gallery is just across the bridge There are also a few good museums within walking distance of the hotel 
119540,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, heating system in the room on arrival which was rectified, close to St Paul s cathedral and overlooked the route of the Lord Mayor s Show close to other sights
119541,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The only downside was the bells in St Paul s chimed all night and effected sleep , The location was excellent for access to the tube and to some of the main attractions 
119542,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bathroom shower was leaking outside the shower area light bulbs were flickering no window to open air con blew warm constantly, Free filtered water easy access to the ironing board and replacement coffee condiments
119543,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The cost is higher than I d like but that s Central London for you , The best thing about the hotel was its location The rooms were clean and tidy if a little small Having a Cote restaurant attached means breakfast is offered 
119544,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, There are no proper towel racks to hang towers in the room but we hanged them using the hooks provided at the door , The room is bigger than I thought it would be Absolutely love the big table provided in the room my partner and I are able to do our work side by side without affecting each other The location is perfect as there are many restaurants around the hotel Although we could hear St Paul s bell ringing once in a while but our room was at the other side of St Paul s so it wasn t too big of a factor 
119545,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room was very cold the windows were very thin and old and I felt cold draft from the window room was very cold at night Walls also very thin and can hear noise from other rooms The shower had very week pressure , Location is superb staff are friendly
119546,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing smarties everyday , Lounge area is comfortable and smart with free newspapers tea coffee biscuits and soft drinks at any time If you re really lucky you may even get the free smarties and nuts dispenser We did 
119547,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room facility is so so The receptionists are very busy and when they are not busy they act as if I create trouble for them to solve Early check in requires 40gb more In overal not a good value, Excellent location next to St Paul cathedral and underground station 
119548,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, A C was good to cool down but not to warm up the room, 1 Very comfortable spacious 3 bed room 2 Central location but the noise of the street didn t reach our room 3 Hotel offered to store our luggage even after we checked out
119549,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Excellent location adjacent to St Paul s Cathedral Friendly helpful staff Clean comfortable rooms Refreshments available 24 hours including water dispensers and ice machine you can also have free use of washing machine and dryer Excellent
119550,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bathroom seemed a little tired and the room wasn t as warm as I would have liked and didn t seem to be able to change All else was great , Great staff really helpful Free use of the lounge coffee tea water etc with wifi was great 
119551,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Our room was noisy and the alarm went off at 6 o clock , The croissants were delicious and the English breakfast excellent though a little pricey The location was ideal 
119552,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Nice and comfortable hotel with good location Very friendly and helpful staff Have lots of free amenities such as computer printer free bottled water coffee tea and biscuits 
119553,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bathroom poor too small and the washbasin was outside more or less in the bedroom Air conditioning heating impossible to regulate Aircon made a terrible whistling noise on our last night lasted 20 minutes, Quiet room over the courtyard behind sitting room with tiny kitchenette and table Lounge on ground floor with coffee etc Cote Brasserie connected was very good when we had dinner there
119554,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Will not fit on the back of a postage stamp to mention , The location is ideal staff very helpful restful rooms and superb find Breakfast good value and enjoyable
119555,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Light sleepers should be warned that the bells of the St Paul s Cathedral also ring at night every quarter of an hour , The hotel has a fabulous location a perfect place to stay if visiting the Tate Modern The staff was friendly and helpful the room was clean and comfortable 
119556,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The small bathroom, Would have been excellent but there was only one pillow each and the bathroom was a little smelly Staff were excellent as was the location 
119557,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bathroom wasn t good It wasn t pretty and the douche was rather complicated to use and malfunctioning Air conditioning didnt work properly , Nice big bed and desk 
119558,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Dressing gown and slippers would have been a nice touch But that s me being picky , Location was perfect the Cote Brasserie was fantastic value for money with excellent food and lovely staff 
119559,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Hot water on the first morning would have been a bonus This may have been the number of simultaneous users or it had run out maintenance said they got hot water from he shower later int he day On subsequent mornings it took an extended period of running the tap and shower for it to reach us on the 7th floor which is not good for water conservation , We ve used Club Quarters before and they are a good hotel group This was in a fantastic location with a great view from the room and coupled with the ease of travelling by foot bus or Underground We will use it again 
119560,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I didn t find the reception particularly friendly the coffee machine was not working for 1 full day , Excellent location The room was large enough for 3 of us kitchenette with microwave in the room and other services available in the lounge very good 
119561,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I found the electronic check in system a little impersonal nothing beats a friendly desk clerk and human interaction All rooms should include a bath AND shower I had to upgrade for a small charge for a room with a bath tub , Location excellent transport links within 1 to 5 minute walk St Pauls Cathedral less than 50 meters away good choice of eateries within a 100 metre radius perhaps best to check these are open at weekends 
119562,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The noise from the running engines of lorries and deliveries being made to the supermarket and offices next to the hotel was really loud and went on for most of the night night , Excellent location with everything you need for a short London Break also the staff were first class
119563,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The hotel charged my credit card for a security deposit and the blocking is still there even after 3 weeks from my stay at the hotel , The room was spacious
119564,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Small poky rooms Extremely thin walls We were in 417 and could here someone next door throwing up all morning in their bathroom it was disgraceful , Location only 
119565,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Pillow was a bit too thin for my liking and did not give enough support I did not ask the staff to help with this as it was late at night but I expect they would have produced a solution , The style of the hotel and the outstanding quality of all staff 
119566,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I am struggling to say what I didn t like no can t think of anything , Great location very friendly and helpful staff Chilled water and computer facilities were very useful We would definitely stay here again 
119567,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Nice hotel right next to St Paul s The free lending of adapters for the electricity were a nice touch before I always had to buy them because i forget to bring those things Staff was friendly and helpfull fast checkout via the PC in the lobby 
119568,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Although Cote Brasserie was very nice and we had a good dinner there on our first evening Breakfast was just too terrible By the lifts there is a notice that Cote Brasserie is open from early morning to late evening for breakfast lunch and dinner Unlike the previous evening when we entered from the street wearing outdoor clothing this time we entered via the door from the hotel and as we looked for a nice table by the window we were hustled with downstairs please Into the basement we go breakfast was just about over the buffet was depleted the waitress hustled us with I will leave it there for another 5 minutes but we close at 9 40 we had arrived at 9 30 We had to make a quick decision me standing up as to our choice I ran back and forth from the buffet getting coffee juice etc as a team had already moved in to clear it The coffee was the dregs from a flask and cold we had half a cup each A little spot of juice I managed to grab a slice of bread each some butter and jam before they too were taken away The cooked plates arrived whilst my husband was still eating his cereal Then they started to mop the floor As we left I notice the board on the pavement offering what we had just had for 10 95 sitting in the main restaurant with views and no hustle Enter from the hotel and then you pay 13 95 even though they had almost stopped service and had set up for lunch , The little extra club like the chilled water stations on each floor along with bottles The housekeepers cupboard for you to help yourself tea coffee milk bathroom items irons extra pillows etc The staff The location and the view of the Old Bailey Dome from our rear of the building window The real fridge microwave crockery and knifes and forks etc and sink with a little bottle of washing up liquid and a sponge made With a M S next door along with other food outlets all around then if you have a food intolerance or like to eat a fruit breakfast etc then these facilities make it very possible and easy Plus there is a free launderette very handy Many guests were corporate attending meetings etc We would certainly return it was good value in a good location 
119569,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No biscuits with tea and coffee in room no extra pillows available the bar closed early and didn t sell rum breakfast finished at 10 30 but we didn t have to check out till 12 so why couldn t breakfast be made available till 12 don t get many lazy mornings so don t want to waste the ones we do get by getting up early to eat , Location and loved the water bottles and water cooler to help yourself
119570,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The staff at the front desk did not explain anything and were blunt and just rushed you No fridge in the room Room small for a queen room , Was ideal location for toying London
119571,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, My only criticism is that the room in which we stayed was very small and so there was only one bedside table etc and that was on the side my wife always sleeps , The location is excellent We introduced my daughter and son in law to Club Quarters and they were also impressed The breakfast is excellent and the staff are friendly and efficient 
119572,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Little in the way of nightlife locally, Great location for business and tourists Very nice comfortable room and friendly helpful staff Plenty of local amenities Not much to do at night on weekends 
119573,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, firmer pillows , customer service especially Kristine and Maria was simply outstanding they are efficient polite helpful and have a sense of humour too 
119574,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I would have liked a safe in the room as in most continental hotels, The bed was comfortable and the room very clean On each floor bottles were provided and a dispenser for cool water was available
119575,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We got in at midnight on the first day and I was given a room on the ground floor overlooking the road it was not great and I requested if I could have a room on a higher floor There was but it was at 30 extra Whilst I as happy to pay that for the next 2 nights I suggested that perhaps since it was already midnight they could have just given me a first night free upgrade as it was unlikely they would get anyone for that room anyway It was declined and I think they missed out on a nice goodwill gesture at no extra cost as it was really unlikely they would be able to rent out that room at that time I have a poor impression of management at Club Quarters and unlikely to stay here or any of their other chains again Compared to my earlier stay at CitizenM which I highly recommend the staff and policies at Club Quarters seems made to squeeze out any bit of from you Oh yes you also have to pay extra if you would like late check out after 12 even if it s just to 1 pm any other 4 hotel would have just thrown in free subject to availability , Location
119576,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, The guest lounge with soft drinks facility the ability to look after our luggage until the evening Prompt and cheerful service from all the staff we encountered Great location for Globe theatre and of course the cathedral and London Museum and catching the river boats near the Globe 
119577,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Could have been more pillows in room , Rooms were spotless and very modern Free hot drinks and water stations Helpful staff very easy check in Fantastic location just in front of St Pauls Catherdral
119578,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The fact that we paid for the room and they requested my card again when we pay for our meals on production of the bill for that meal, The location was fantastic within easy reach of the tube station and with good restaurants and shops nearby
119579,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, There is no parking place at the hotel You have a garage near by but you have to carry your own luggage to the hotel , The hotel is very confortable with a great location and the staff is helpful The price is also very convenient in a city like London that is so expensive 
119580,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Reception guy was so rude Staff wasn t helpful as well as room wasn t clean as it should be they didn t change the towels and bed sheets , Wifi and location 
119581,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the windows don t close properly and the noise of the main road was awful the bed was uncomfortable the shower was mouldy and the room should of had a sofa in it , just the location

119584,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The only thing I think could really be improved on is that we like to help the environment by re using our towels especially when staying for just a weekend However there was no place or heating in bathroom to hang dry the towels not too much of a problem in summer but would be in cold weather , King sized bed very comfortable Great location The room was really nice and was very clean and quite spacious Really good shower Great view of St Paul s from our window Supplying free water and bottles in reception area and on landings an excellent idea 
119585,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, it is always nice when the cost is lower , The location of the Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s was perfect it was so easy to get to everything much of what we wanted to see and do was in walking distance from the hotel We also loved the free extras like wifi in the room bottled water available right near the elevators on the floors and soda coffee and snacks in the lobby area The staff was also both friendly and helpful 
119586,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The sound proofing of the rooms needs attending to the single glazed windows allow all outside noise into the room , The location in terms of London was fine but it is right next to St Pauls and unfortunately even though we were 7 floors up we could here road traffic during the night and the bells of St Pauls chime every 15 minutes which kept us awake

119597,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very substantial amount of free biscuits in the TV lobby past reception which allowed my 6 year old to attempt doubling his body weight in less than 24 hours there wasn t anything we didn t like at this hotel , Superb location and not in line with some of the ridiculous hotel costs in the center of the city Staff in reception and who ran the cafe restaurant were authentic professionals going out of their way for us 
119598,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I had the unpleasant experience the hotel was double booked due to their system problem but one of staff members told me that i have to pay penalty for no show even i received cancellation email about first booking from booking com so I had a complaints based on this email as a result they realized that their mistakes but they did not apologize at all , Location
119599,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Not to overstated but It appears to be a universal problem in the UK that the beds are a little too firm for our liking Ventilation system was overly noisy in one room attended to quickly by staff and we were offered alternate room the following night , Great location with easy access to supermarkets restaurants and transport Availability of espresso coffee in member s lounge Provision of self serve washing and drying facilities at no cost Attentive front of house staff Another good Club Quarters offering 
119600,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, some pipes started making a noise in the night and we couldn t sleep but we were moved to another room straight away, nice and clean comfy bed and room size was good
119601,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No restaurant in hotel Only Cote that was attached to the facility We had been traveling for hours and didn t want to eat at cote asked if we could order food and was disappointed that it was unavailable Also the pillows were hard as rock, Staff really friendly Fantastic location 
119602,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room was much smaller than expected felt more like a single room but fine for 1 night , They looked after our luggage after checking out which gave us the rest of the day to sight see 
119603,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Hotel guests are directed into a separate section of the restaurant where breakfast costs 13 95 same as when you buy in advance online There is a nice separate section of the restaurant facing the street where the same breakfast costs 9 95 Insulting to guests , Good location
119604,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Breakfast excellent standard good value for money Bed extremely comfortable Hotel located in a fantastic area with lots of great restaurants to choose from 
119605,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The way the desk delt with us on our arrival was poor They made it difficult to check in with a poor explanation of how to get our key cards made and how to operate the lift which required our key cards , The location was good 
119606,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Staff very friendly helpful Room very comfortable and clean Good Location Close to Station Underground Not too far to walk to Theatres Sights Shops

119609,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Excellent location next to St Paul s Cathedral 3 min walking from the metro station Clean rooms with good Wi Fi and helpful staff The rooms have everything you need they are just not very spacious which was not a problem for us 
119610,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The sound proofing isn t exactly brilliant as had unfortunately noisy neighbors both sides and could hear pretty much the laughter and conversation for hours Also the Hotel needs to modify somehow the loud noise from guests slamming shut their doors when coming and going Maybe some kind of tape to apply to door surrounds to dampen the sound , A well run Hotel that punches way above its star rating The staff are friendly and efficient and like the idea of free water coffee 24 hrs a day The location is superb The room facilities more than adequate and the bed most comfortable Would recommend as this Hotel represents great value for money

119612,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Beautifully presented and amazing location Hotel room was very clean staff were amazing we had an early check in and enjoyed the late check out No need for rushing around Bed was extremely comfortable The kitchenette was brilliant Enjoyed a proper mug of coffee 
119613,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, False advertising about parking there is no onsite parking is located at least a ten minute walk from hotel staff are very vague about parking location , thank you for sending me a comments email I have just arrived back to Scotland yesterday and have been meaning to write to you and booking com regarding my stay with you on the 23rd of August When i initially booked this room i had searched on the booking com website for hotels with parking and yours was one of many that came up Now as i had a lot of baggage i was expecting onsite parking so i can check in immediately when i arrived outside the hotel i called to ask reception where i was to park the car as i thought it was to the rear of the building I was directed to a private car park 0 3 miles away from the hotel The hotel wasn t even aware of the postcode for navigation Regardless i went parked and had the sluggish walk back to the hotel at reception i met with an abrupt member of staff was checked in within seconds and almost thrown a card at me for my room The hotel room was dated didn t feel clean and worst of all had a damp towel in the bathroom Its was extremely warm there was no fridge and no iron press I travel a lot through my work and i must say this was by far the worst experience ever I look forward to your early response 
119614,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I cannot think of anything , As with other reviews this hotel is in the perfect location for getting around London The staff are very courteous and the rooms are spotlessly clean comfortable and the perfect size for a couple An added bonus of seeing St Pauls Cathedral from our window was awesome We didn t experience any noise problems and had no difficulty getting off to sleep We will make this our hotel of choice whenever we visit London again 
119615,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, All was fine, Good location for the tube station and St Pauls Cathedral Also close to the Thames and millennium bridge Staff were helpful Rooms were fine and comfortable for a one night stay Complimentary tea coffee available in the rooms as well as down stairs in the small lounge area Also water bottles available on each floor to fill from dispenser to take out with you which was good We had breakfast at the adjoining Cote restaurant which was very good value and set us up for the day Would recommend 
119616,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The air conditioning didn t work very well The room was quite small but to be fair that was what we booked Next time would definitely choose a bigger room , Great location staff very friendly clean 
119617,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I noise level emanating from the room next door was most unsatisfactory the noise was the closing of draws and use of the wardrobe and normal level conversation among themselves if I was staying C Q for a longer period I most definitely would have taken it up with the Hotel , I was generally pleased with C Q other than for the issue I have highlighted 
119618,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, perfection, excellent location underground short distance bus stop on doorstep m s food shop next door free bottled water an can drinks an coffee machine all for use in tv laptop room room small but comfortable saw st pauls from bedroom window staff very helpful let us have our room at 10am
119619,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Location handy for various forms of transport esp bus tube etc Smart clean comfortable rooms and very helpful staff A variety of eateries nearby reasonably priced for London Soundproofed room on floor 2 with buses continually pulling up outside but could not hear them 
119620,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Just more tea in the room , Staff were excellent in ensuring we had what we needed For an overnight stay when visiting the sights this place is perfect It isn t the place to go if you are after luxury but we have stayed here twice and it was brilliant I made a mistake with one booking and even entered the wrong ate but the manager kindly sorted it out and ensured I had a room Superb and discrete service 
119621,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Noisy bathroom fan water pipes so heard every flush shower from neighbouring rooms Also very thin walls heard adult sounds from next room that I wouldn t want my children to hear thank god they were asleep , Staff lovely helpful Would definitely stay again The superior room was very big clean 
119622,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, As the location is central it s popular for business stays and for tourists For me the folk in neighbouring rooms were late coming in and quite inconsiderate in the level of noise they made for those getting up early for work the next day , The bed and room were really comfy and the air conditioning was easy to adjust The room was quiet considering such a central location Loved the fact you could help yourself to filtered water tea coffee etc Very easy to stay there 
119623,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Not really anything which didn t hit the mark for our particular trip , Convenience to tube and some london sights Helpful staff filtered water and good coffee available at all hours included 
119624,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, As my experience there the staffs weren t very helpful with luggage they don t help you carry it to your room to guide you around the hotel and where your rooms are as I had to find my room myself There were some major confusions at the check in as I had to pay 20 per night as deposit even though I had already paid for the full price 2 weeks before I came down to London to check in this wasn t explained on the website The staff who worked at the reception didn t speak English very well so more confusion were made , The hotel was close to the subways St Paul s also very close to Tesco express and restaurants with a few minutes of distance walking The hotel was in a very nice location and was modern from the outside 
119625,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Early morning noise coming from plumbing when adjacent rooms started showering Minor discomfort, Staff friendly arranged early check in looked after bags on day of departure and were friendly an unobtrusive Apartment room with kitchen facilities was excellent and size of room was spacious for London standards
119626,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Exactly at 3 o clock pm I could have my room not even 10 minutes earlier Not really fair to pay for earlier arrival when I ask them to allow me to leave my suitcase there an hour earlier, Matilda Antonio were really helpful nice
119627,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, staff were efficient but could be more friendly, excellent location in Central London and good value for money considering the location and pricing of surrounding hotels Functional and comfortable room
119628,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Rooms were comfortable enough but lack attention to detail Tea and coffee sachets provided in the room but no milk or spoons Free tea and coffee provided in reception but again no spoons and drinking out of paper cups Room was quite noisy due to street noise and neighbouring rooms In pure terms of value for money you are paying for the location there are other hotels a bit further out that provide more creature comforts and better quality rooms for the same price , Location ideally sited in the centre of London within short walking distance of underground 
119629,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No real negatives We didn t get the remote control we asked for but it wasn t a big issue As a mother staying with two grown up children I would have liked the option of three single beds rather than a double and one single I think 3 friends travelling would also prefer this so I don t know why it it is rarely available in hotels , Great location very near to St Paul s underground station Powerful shower and some unexpected facilities eg Microwave Sky sports channels Secure facility to leave luggage for a few hours after checking out Water bottles provided on each floor 
119630,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bathroom shower was obstreperous the controls could only produce a warm trickle or a gush of extremely hot water , The location was excellent great for exploring the City and a 5 min walk to the Millennium Bridge let you reach the theatres concerts and street circus of the South Bank the staff were responsive check in and check out were easy and fast 
119631,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I prefer an open window at night instead of air conditioning which is noisy Although the hotel reception offered to get someone in to open a window if required I would have preferred to be able to open and close a window myself Please note this was only a minor grumble , The meals were fantastic and the staff were friendly and helpful Staff were able to advise and offer Gluten Free options in the restaurant and had a gluten free menu High quality food with friendly service and wonderful atmosphere brilliant 
119632,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Hallway door slammed and caused entire wall to shake multiple times Corridars were very narrow Bathroom small with cracks in floor Plenty of plates but no bowls, Beds were large and spacious Happy we found the mini fridge to store bits for the morning Large tv Quick response for extra pillows
119633,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I wanted to book regularly and when I called to arrange this the reservations person was not at all helpful and lost 40 nights , My room was really comfortable I was upgraded on the day from the room type due to availability of a Superior Standard I heard the bells of St Pauls twice in the evening and once in the morning which is not bad given that they ring every quarter of an hour 24 hours a day This may differ if you are in a different place in the building 
119634,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Didn t feel like a new hotel The room felt dated and the bathroom was old For the cost I was expecting something with a newer feel Saying that it was a comfortable bed and I slept very well , Location was good the staff were very friendly and helpful 
119635,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Breakfast was 9 50 for a continental breakfast Poor selection of cereal no cheeses or hams Fruit salad didn t look inviting Pastries were good , Central location
119636,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, When we arrived in the room there was a puddle of water near the toilet and the toilet paper on the wall was wet We called the desk and they sent someone up to fix the problem The door to the adjoining room was unlocked an apparent oversight and security risk , The room was larger than most rooms we ve experienced in Europe The resturant next door was excellent 
119637,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing everything was perfect , The staff on reception Kristine and Matilde were great really friendly professional and helpful they couldn t do enough to make sure we had everything we needed The room was a suite with kitchenette and was great Will definitely be staying here again and would recommend 
119638,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The steaks we had in the hotel restaurant were very sinewy and fatty Although the steak was returned twice it still came back sinewy Very disappointing , Coffee and tea facilities in the foyer and comfy chairs are a nice touch Friendly staff 
119639,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, A bit bad acoustics , Great location good combination of price and quality I bit bad acoustics but in general fine Great that you can have unlimited tea and coffee at lobby 24 7 sometimes you can even find there fruits or cakes 
119640,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing really Perfect for what we needed, Staff were amazing they were very friendly and helpful Also loved the free water bottles around the hotel a great idea

119643,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, While staff were very efficient I felt they were quite curt and it felt a little like you were an inconvenience to them Other than that very little to complain about the shower felt a little dark because of the bathroom having one single light around the corner from the shower , The bed was extremely comfortable and the room remarkably spacious for such a central hotel Guest request closets were very convenient and the free filtered water in the hall with sealable bottles was a nice touch 
119644,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bar was not open for a drink Closed before midnight which was very disappointing as it s nice to be able to have a relaxed nightcap in your hotel Only one pillow available had to ask for additional Bathroom soaps shampoo were not refilled Would benefit from a coffee machine in the room especially as bar closed , Great location Size of room excellent for central London location Unlimited free water bottles and dispensers on each floor an excellent idea Self controlled air conditioning per room Free wifi Attached to Cote restaurant for breakfast and meals we love Cote 
119645,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We couldn t fault this Hotel or area , The staff facilitated every request Hotel supplied fridge in room which was necessary for medication Hotel was very close to underground Choice of good restaurants close by 
119646,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, frustrating to have nothing supplied in lounge on other days , nice to find fruit nuts and health bars available with refreshments in the lounge 
119647,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, We liked that our room had a small kitchenette area The lobby where you could relax with a tea or coffee at no extra cost Helpful staff the proximity to St Pauls the Thames and the Tat gallery Transport connections the list is really endless 
119648,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The noise from the chiming clock on the hour every hour , Easy access to the start of the Prudential 100 surrey classic bike ride There was no problem with me taking my bike to the room with me There was plenty of space in the room for the bike to fit 
119649,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, the size of the rooms was above the standard for London The room was not old fashioned and clean The staff were really helpful and cooperative with our requests The free water at all floors and the free coffee water fruits and freezing drinks at hotel lounge was also a big plus

119652,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Overall a nice experience Wish that the check in time was little earlier We came in on a red eye flight and arrived at 9 00 am and it would have been nice if they had an option to check in early so that we could rest I would have paid extra for this When you have been awake for close to 18 hours and then having to wait another 6 hours to check in is brutal for the family , Nice facilities and staff is helpful
119653,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Toilet cistern could have worked better Cold water in bathroom basin smelt and tasted strange , Very clean and tidy Reception staff very friendly and helpful Ideal location for where we wanted to be Liked the water station on each floor 
119654,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Being woken up to the sound of the bells from St Paul s Cathedral and the fact the Cathedral is virtually on the doorstep Also not too far a walk to the underground and the tour bus stops outside hotel 
119655,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, seem to only leave one pillow each as standard bed was very hard toilet flush lacked force, Close to St Paul s clean efficient check in and check out
119656,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, All good so didn t dislike anything, Very helpful friendly staff lovely and quiet during the night Nice touch free refillable water bottles on each floor 
119657,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We found the bed pillows to be very uncomfortable Also we were led to believe there was a car park on arrival found this is not the case , Very helpful friendly staff 
119658,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Check in was poor Did not get informed when check out was or that there was free tea and coffee in the lounge No introduction to basic amenities and no one showed me into my room or informed me of its whereabouts , Modern design great selection of free coffee tea etc in lounge bar Rooms were comfortable with good amenities Great location 
119659,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Perfect If they did breakfast it would be heaven, This was an excellent hotel Great location knowledgable and friendly staff Bed was superb Clean and full of amenities Loved hearing the bells of St Pauls Sunday
119660,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Would have been nice to have cups as options for water machine too Also clarity regarding deposit policy and more understanding from staff I arrived ready to check in and was terribly tired Unfortunately I d recently had my bank card blocked due to fraud and awaiting the arrival of a new card which meant I didn t have a card to provide a deposit hold from I offered to give ID but this was declined Some more understanding compassion would have been appreciated I had to wait for my girlfriend s arrival to pay this deposit which was inconvenient as I really did desperately need to sleep , As a whole the hotel was great Spacious comfortable rooms and we had a nice view of St Paul s out of our window An especially nice touch for me was the water machines that has bottles you could fill up 
119661,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I got stuck in the rain wearing my extremely expensive designer jacket I was pretty upset and I asked if there was a dycleaning service or anywhere I could take it The lady at the desk told me somewhat rudely that there was nowhere for me to take it because it was Saturdaya d everything was closed and then proceeded to tell me that I could use the dryer in the laundry room I went up to my room and googled dry cleaners and I found AT LEAST 5 that were OPEN and close So I was a bit frustrated that she didn t even attempt to help me but I still enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back , The location was perfect My friends and I bought tickets for the hop on hop off bus and went around the entire city There was a ton of great places within walking distance like bars coffee shops and restaurants The room was very nice and clean I will be coming back 
119662,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We were on 2nd floor and although room clean and all amenities it did feel dated and in need of a refurb , Location was excellent Pleasant welcoming reception Checked in within 5 minutes of arrival 
119663,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Really the only thing was that our room for 3 adults was clearly designed with only the largest bed in mind When one had to pass from one area to another one had a tiny area between the bed and where the desk jutted out for the single bed To be fair this room is probably rented usually to only two people but we were traveling with an adult child , Location right by St Paul s is excellent All sorts of things accessible including the tube and the bridge to the South Bank Also liked the luxurious treatment with keeping everyone supplied with water and water bottles teas and coffees and cappuccinos in the lobby where one could sit very comfortably and relax read chat etc And given that no one can possibly ignore the signs of global warming what luxury to have air conditioning in a London hotel Affordably priced for our stay Hi speed wi fi caters to the business clientelle but we all benefit

119676,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Bed was a little small and breakfast was quite pricey But wouldn t deter me from staying again would still highly recommend , Fantastic location right next to St Paul s and on the central line a hop skip and a jump to everything Good sized rooms with a comfortable bed however bed was a little small for the room size standard double not a queen or king 
119677,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Cost of breakfast at the Cotes is expensive especially when Joe s Kitchen next door is offering cheaper options Internet speed was a bit slow kept buffering , Excellent location to main attractions We love the proximity of the Cotes Restaurant 
119678,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Great location very close to st Paul station and plenty of nice restaurants friendly staff and a spacious room for 3 for London we ll be back

119809,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, Great location within the shadows of St Pauls My flight to London was delayed by over 5 hours which meant I didn t get to the hotel until 3am The staff were very helpful 
119810,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Very noisy guests in corridors at 3 00am Sunday Then to be woken again at 5 30am by fire alarm then several times later Saturday evening only one lift working Sunday morning you only had service lift working No communication to guests from staff other than a note on doorframe by lift , Perfect location for St Paul s for our granddaughters christianing

119819,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, The staff was excellent they upgraded us when we were late arriving as they have a small suite The amendities were excellent especially in the lobby area which is quite large it has free coffee and tea The lobby lounge is large and relaxing with a lot of comfy chairs and has access to computers The location couldn t be better right next to St Paul s Cathedral 
119820,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The toilet it s practically in the room as the door from the toilet it s very frigile Going to the toilet with someone else in the room is a interesting experiance Also the lavoar it s in the room not in the bathroom ,No Positive
119821,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, My only complaint was the temperature control for the room It took me until I left to figure how to use it properly It seemed to either pump out hot dry air or was cold And the bathroom had no heating so middle of the night visit was a shock to the system, Being so close to st Pauls underground station made getting around the city easy The hotel was clean and the staff friendly You could help yourself to extra pillows if wanted bottles of water and buckets of ice Which was a great unusual touch great view out of my window of the cathedral which I managed to visit finally 
119822,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Double bed was a slightly too small , Location was excellent adjacent to St Paul s and within easy reach of tube station Staff were very helpful especially with allowing luggage to be stored The Cote Brasserie next door was also very good

119826,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The gentleman at the front desk was tricky Tried to discourage me from paying cash deposit for use of room service Wasn t even aware there was a charge for this The room wasn t ideal for two people Better suited to a solo traveler Struggled with adjusting the heating , The location was great 
119827,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It depends on the purpose of the visit the location could be an issue Shame that the toilets aren t clean which would put off people from staying or eating at the bistro despite fantastic food and service Hygiene is a must and hopefully an action will be considered to improve their state , I felt like I am home with the presence of books everywhere a fire place in the lounge and free coffees and especially free water is so handy Very nice staff at the reception and at the bistro 
119828,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Our room smelled terribly of dampness It was awful to return to There was large bubbling of moisture in the paint The bathroom had no extractor and dripped from the ceiling after a shower Very tired condition , Excellent position 
119829,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Jammed window just a crack open Was closed enough to prevent the shower steam from getting out yet open enough to let the freezing night air in along with the noise from outside Said window moldy from trapped steam and pure neglect Bed too small for 2 persons Why on earth are the hallway doors closed at night This is a potential safety issue Escape routes always need to be clear and open Escape route doors open inwards Now how is a person in a wheelchair supposed to manage these especially in an emergency situation Stay was booked on business terms but the space provided for laptop documents etc was not large enough and cramped between TV and bed This was my second stay and the above describes the room I had towards the rear of the building 1st stay in May 2013 was in a room towards the front a business suite which was better , Staff friendly basic cleanliness great location 
119830,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No electric socket adjacent to a mirror no mirror adjacent to an electric socket , Friendly helpful staff good bed I always sleep well CQ St Paul clean tidy room with plenty of storage space Fresh water with spare bottles and ice on every floor 
119831,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We only stayed one night and were very disappointed to have a disturbed night Something really needs to be done about soundproofing the rooms We could hear the television through the wall of the neighbouring room We could also hear the conversation of the guests although they were not shouting ,No Positive
119832,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room was very cold and heater didn t seem up to keeping the room warm and it was very noisy Certainly couldn t sleep with it on , Location great staff great room great
119833,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing to dislike really other than the lack of mini bar in our room but this was generously compensated for by the lounge facility with complimentary refreshments loved it , We loved the location on Ludgate Hill right next to St Paul s which we planned to visit and a short walk from the Thames There were many places to eat nearby and great shopping at One New Change Our room was small but comfortable great shower bed tv all the essentials for a pleasant stay The lounge area with complimentary refreshments was particularly appreciated as was the chilled purified water on each floor I wish all hotels offered this It certainly made up for the lack of mini bar in our room Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and will almost certainly book again 
119834,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, THE RECEPTION TEAM ARE INEFFICIENT UNHELPFUL AND CANNOT DEAL WITH ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE CHECKING IN OR OUT IS A MAJOR THING, THE ROOM AND HOTEL ARE AS USUAL VERY GOOD
119835,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The room number 425 which looks over Ave Maria Lane was extremely noisy throughout the night with constant deliveries possibly but sounded like clanking scaffolding and there was traffic noise too not from Ludgate Hill but Newgate Street If you re having a disturbed night you ll hear St Paul s Cathedral clock chiming every 15 minutes too The bed in that Small double room was less than 4 6 , The hotel is very convenient clean and warm 
119836,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The heater was difficult to set up , Newly furnished Very good facilities Nice bedroom comfortable bed spacious bathroom Coffee tea and cookies offered for free for guests at the lobby very kind 
119837,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The walls are wafer thin so you hear even the slightest conversation and all else from rooms either side This is not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel , Location
119838,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing everything superb if this place had a pool would be a dream hotel, Wow factor all the personal touches make a special difference e g Ice machine chilled water even empty bottles to fill to use A washing machine and tumble dryer a fresh bean coffee machine all complimentary Bed is comfy and very clean

119841,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Soundproof from outside and inside low temperature in the room , Location Bistrot La Cote Room size Hot and cold drinks and fruits always available in the lobby 
119842,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The rooms were very small for a superior room There was no bath and the room was old and tired and needs a desperate refurb Also the walls were paper thin and every draw and wardrobe door our neighbour opened was horrendously disturbing for us and a lie in was impossible We came back from our four day stay absolutely exhausted The sofa bed was dangerous with sharp edges and was extremely uncomfortable , Free water fruit nuts and complimentary guest facilities room with a vending machine There are lots of places to eat so no need to book b b
119843,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Costs of hotel was taken at time of booking and again at check out took a couple of days to get money back , Location for a small double room the size was good air con that worked and quiet location

119845,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The bed is way too hard The cost of breakfast at Cote is ridiculous at 14 Two doors down the road at Garfunkels it is 6 , The location was superb and the cote restaurant was excellent for an evening dinner 
119846,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, In my personal circunstances I needed a freezer to keep breastmilk frozen but there was not a freezer in the Hotel the small refrigirator at the room doesnt work well for this purpose , The location is perfect to walk around The small kitchen at the room works very well traveling with kids
119847,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Not bad but disappointing TV bereft of catch up services such as BBC IPlayer 4OD , Ease of checkin check out Chilled water dispenser bottles USB connectivity Conventional coat hangers Coffee Tea lounge
119848,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room I was in 356 was in a quirky location along corridors down stairs up stairs and down again Still waiting to receive promised receipt for the stay , Location is superb Good facilities in the room including microwave Much better TV choice than in most hotels Room very quiet 
119849,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Rooms were tiny and the decor and doors felt more like a prison than a 4 The walls were paper thin and we were kept awake all night by a heated domestic next door out of the hotels control for sure m, The location was the main positive

119853,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I didn t like the fact that I paid 170 for a tiny dark closed in and cold room I also didn t like the fact my room was located with a view to the street and all I heard all the night was outside noise , It was useful to have free wifi and unlimited bottled water 
119854,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, There was nothing I would critisise about the venue although we did not use the restaurant or other facilities , The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting central london especially West End theatres and embankment So close to St Pauls and many other wonderful buildings Walking distance to Charing Cross via fleet street 30 mins Lots of very old pubs off fleet street that were rebuilt after the Great fire of London 1666 wonderful beer warm welcome fantastic The hotel reception staff were brilliant and made you feel so welcome Professional courteous but most of all genuinely friendly They really made the visit start off and end on a high note

119859,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We had a problem with the water temperature The water was boiling hot and could not decrease the temperature Since we were staying for only one night and we discovered it at 1 am in the night we thought that maybe the problem will disappear in the morning but unfortunately it was not better on the next day We called the reception and a technician came to repair the temp controller but it took too long and finally we had to leave the room without taking the shower we wanted to profit from the city and not spend our time waiting for colder water The hotel did not make any discount effort We left paying the full price , The hotel is very well located The staff is friendly and helpful 
119860,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Just a bit over priced otherwise fab , Good sized room with comfortable bed microwave and fridge Great location Staff gave us a quiet room by request overlooking a traffic free square Unlimited bottled water and free tea and coffee in the lounge area Friendly helpful staff and lovely late 12pm check out 
119861,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Could have used some more coffee not the decaf variety than just two sachets , Very friednly staff Comfortable room Kept our luggage secure while we went round the British Museum 
119862,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the only downside of the hotel is that it s next to the Cathedral and from 4am the bells chime almost every 15 mins Not a great night s sleep despite a very comfortable bed , the location was great from a postcode perspective as right in the heart of the city the rooms were very modern and bathroom excellent staff very helpful Great value on a sunday night
119863,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Nothing , Very friendly helpful staff and a great location right next to St Paul s Cathedral As breakfast is not included in the rate for the room a good option for us was to go to one of the many local supermarkets for what we wanted 
119864,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The area is less trendy than say staying nearer to Picadilly Circus It s a business hotel chain so decoration is boring Expensive breakfast cross the street and get something cheaper , We booked the small double room but it s actually decently sized we expected it to be smaller Location is good considering the area we had a view to the St Paul s cathedral We informed the staff about a problem with the shower drain when we got back at night everything was fixed already Complimentary water bottles

119869,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No one told me how to operate the lift that is until a guest showed how The instructions in the room stated that the air conditioning controls were in easy reach of the bed It was about 6 feet away , Air conditioning that worked effectively Most hotels keep room far too hot but because of the effective air conditioning room temperature was reduced to a normal level
119870,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, The room was clean The staff was kind When I went downstairs with my 22 month old the man just stopped and talked to her which was nice that was 5am in the morning I would go there again

119875,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, A mini bar in the room would be nice I also find the place a bit too pricy given the rooms are quite old fashioned , Quiet location during the weekend close to the metro and a walking distance to many places Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby Helpful and friendly staff Fast and reliable wifi 
119876,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Parking is complicated If you drive a big car the nearest parking is not close by , Excellent breakfast restaurant Have breakfast upstairs in the Cote Brasserie instead of downstairs Friendly staff and a great location 
119877,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The fact that it takes the A C system 20 mins before it stops is a little strange especially as there s no instructions anywhere telling you , Location facilities and ease Plus the French restaurant downstairs excellent 
119878,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Air con takes 20 mins to turn off and is noisy even on low fan Room booked for 3 people but only 2 towels No minibar and no late bar Had to go to corner shop for night cap , Good position Quieter at weekends Kitchenette Nearby corner shop Good value Well appointed Great shower well designed

119881,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, a nice smart comfortable room location is great with bus and train stops close by a very nice place to spend a night and not too expensive for one or two nights didn t take the breakfast option as a little pricey and there are plenty of places nearby 
119882,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Don t know if this was because we checked in early to alternative rooms but both rooms smelt of cigarette smoke, Helpful friendly staff We were able to check in early and also leave our bags after checkout to collect later 
119883,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Required to pay 20 per night on a card which takes 8 days to be refunded if you don t spend it at the hotel , Great location very nice welcome and the room was lovely with a comfy bed Free bottled water and tea coffee in the lounge

119890,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Upon arrival you will be asked to pre authorise your credit card with an extra amount on top for alleged expenses that you might incur even though there is no minibar in the room This is a nonsense as the hotel has your credit card details and is protected in any event If you do not agree they will not register the check in Reception staff were in don t care it s just my job mode This is a surprising policy for a supposedly higher level hotel It is far from a welcome to treat the guests as if they are potentially bad debtors In the interior it is a throwback to how offices looked in London in the 1980s The bed although described as a King Size bed was too narrow for two persons Sound insulation is non existent so you will have plenty of chance to hear lovers making love lovers making war children crying and the cleaning ladies cleaning Aircon is a noisy ancient system that continues for 40 minutes after you switch it off but you will need it to stave off the chilblains There was a table stand only on one side of the bed Normal practice would be to have one on each side As a final bit of context I have never before given a negative review and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but St Paul s Club Quarters will not get another visit , Good location Efficient cleaning ladies 
119891,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Lack of Wheelchair accessible or regular toilet in reception or lounge A fridge would of been helpful in all rooms , Friendly staff disabled shower with shower chair Krishna is very helpful

119896,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Starting to look a bit tired rooms need to be re assessed for the modern traveller a few amenities not needed and other could be supplied in their place , Central London really easy to travel around and hotel staff have a great knowledge of the area without them we would have got lost 
119897,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, N A, Like all the CQ hotels we stay in the kitchenette and fridge in the rooms are a godsend for travelling with young families St Pauls is a great location as is Lincoln Inn Field Fab hotels
119898,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Room was front facing and St Paul s chiming was heard throughout the night so not a restful sleep, Staff couldn t have been more helpful I really liked the on screen check in check out system

119901,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Fridge in room very noisy Breakfast in Cotes Brasserie was very disappointing and one had to be sent back and then came out cold Waitress couldn t have been more helpful though , Central location room of a good size 
119902,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Location right next to St Paul s so all good there Room clean and adequate no thrills but did the job Sky sports on TV so bonus as didn t realise it did have No condiments in room communal ironing board and very noisy at night in the corridors as the rooms are packed in very close together probably didn t help having a group of women crying in the hallway but tough to fault the hotel for that Reception staff lukewarm and slow to check in and out ,No Positive
119903,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Not CQ s fault but I didn t sleep at all because of St Paul s Cathedral clock chiming on the hour and every half hour drove me mad even with earplugs Bed was comfy though, I was surprised as to the quality of the room and extras which you wouldn t get in a Premier Inn and which are more expensive 
119904,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, It is not a luxury hotel The bedroom was cold and the heating was not working We could hear everything that happened in the room next door , Great location and friendly staff 
119905,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s,No Negative, The Hotel was very clean and tidy the room was advertised as a small room there was plenty of space for a one night stay with a great view of St Pauls Cathedral
119906,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Overpriced like every hotel in London , Location is veeeery good You can see St Paul s from your window and hear it btw Mind if you don t like bells Metro is close Sainsbury s and M S food store are right behind the corner Everything is close It s perfect Room equiped with frige microwave teapot tea bags and coffee Breakfasts additional payent served in the the separate cafe where you can get either from the hotel lobby or from the street 
119907,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I think this is a basic comfortable hotel The location pushes the price up It is not high end luxury that their website would have you believe , The bed was large and comfortable room was clean and it is a great location for city Everything worked wifi good too Staff I encountered were all friendly and helpful 
119908,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, When we got in to bed it was wet on one side we peeled back the sheets and the mattress was extremely stained and wet Presumably the person using the room before us had wet the bed and the maid hasn t mentioned it and just put new sheets on Pretty disgusting, We had to change room in the middle of the night The gentleman on the desk was extremely pleasant and helpful he called us when we got into the new room to check everything was ok for us 
119909,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, i believe it is a good location if you re planing to stay the CITY OF LONDON However for me i didn t like the location and i d like to stay in place closer to the Hyde park , big room and very comfortable 
119910,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, No bad experience, Staff welcoming hotel offering generous facilities good speed complimentary wifi return incentives for guests location excellent 
119911,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The only complaint really was the loud slamming of the fire doors being in close proximity to our door it felt like people were entering our room in the night But really I would rather be safe with closed fire doors than burnt alive so not really a complaint , The member of staff on reception who booked us in was the first impression and he was superb The cleaners I saw every mooring were bright and cheerful and very friendly 2nd floor The coffee machine water and water bottles being free and very nice were excellent The biscuit barrel was never empty I was impressed with the lobby Also like was the beer machine wife suggested small bottles of wine possibly 
119912,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, the personel at the reception not as kind as I expected , I liked the facilities and the position of the hotel very easy to reach and well connected to public transport and walk distance from the central london area

119914,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Poor breakfast so I recommend you to find a better place outside the hotel for breakfast There are several nice places nearby , Friendly staff nice room except you could easily hear the other guests next door shower talking 
119915,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Terrible room layout which involved enduring a sink in the hallway and a toilet in the shower or was that a shower in the toilet either way it was dirty tiny and horrible The bed was very small yet when I got out of bed I hit my knees on the wall and this was an expensive Suite really How does this place get four stars Even in Manhattan it would only get two In a word Terrible , The location The staff tried hard in poor conditions 
119916,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I didn t like the fact there was nowhere open to eat on our return at 1030pm after a show could have had room service or takeaway but wanted a nice meal at a table There wasn t a bar either so nowhere to just have a drink and chill We weren t able to go out to pubs as we had a 12 year old with us , Nice quiet and clean hotel Free bottles of water were a nice little extra 
119917,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Quite loud air conditioniers in rooms so at night it is too loud Our rooms was on a six floor to street side and it was still noisy in a room because of non soundproof windows Rooms already needs some renewal Bed blankets in autumn and winter time i think should be more warm Poor breakfast compared to price , Great Location bus station just outide the hotel tube station 3 minutes walk Thameslink City railway station 3minutes walk with direct trains to Gatwick Airport or other destinations We liked free water bottles in each floor near elivators free coffe softdrinks some snacks in lobby area Good WiFi in rooms Room s size is good

119920,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, breakfast at GBP 20 is a bit costly considering that you will get a hearty breakfast for GBP 6 in a nearby coffeeshop, well situated next to St Paul s Cathedral and loads of cafes nice room welcoming staff
119921,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, The walls can be a bit thin as we heard neighbouring guests returning to their room late at night and moving around the only problem really , The location of this hotel is excellent I ve stayed here before for a wedding and this time for a theatre trip The rooms are very comfortable and clean with good sized bathrooms Good desk space and facilities Great for local transport 
119922,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, I booked this on an offer for 127 a night instead of more than 300 I ve been to better hotels in London for less than what we ve paid and the room would never be worth 300 The so called Standard Queen Room was a very standard double room with cheap carpet floor and a bathroom that reminded me of a gym Instead of an upper storey room we got one on the ground floor where the main view from the window was the wall of the building The wifi didn t have any password protection so didn t seem too safe to use Considering the 300 price tag and the very positive reviews we were expecting something much more luxurious , Lobby with free coffee and free printer 
119923,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Need a small fridge in the room , The location in the City was perfect for me and business meetings The staff was very helpful internet was fast and the availability of a printer was perfect Also the restaurant in the hotel was wonderful and a great selection for breakfast Each floor has available ironing boards irons purified water etc 
119924,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, We were 3 in the bedroom and my daughter had to sleep on a convertible sofa This means there was no space left in the room The bathroom is very small for this type of hotel and could have certainly be cleaner We did not take the breakfast there as the price was much too expensive , Location is very nice very close to a large number of pubs of all types from classical to more modern Free coffee and tea machine 
119925,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, What is there not to like , Location was Fabulous not far to the Tube Great views from the seventh floor room of the top of St Pauls whilst laying in bed Lovely comfortable room Great Staff I will Definitely go back

119933,Club Quarters Hotel St Paul s, Everything was good except the clock bells that ring from St Pauls Cathedral every 15 mins and every hour lowers the quality of sleep while staying there Walls and doors between rooms are thin we heard door banging open and close from other guests during our sleep , Value for money and good clean comfortable stay For what you are paying the staff is courteous lounge area is quite comfortable and there is free wifi Good location to St Paul Cathedral and Bread Street Kitchen
