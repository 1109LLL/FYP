164259,Strand Palace Hotel, The cleaning of the room was not super well We found hair and used soap in the bath One day we found the wet towels that we used the day before If you are OCD like us you will be a bit disappointed, The location is great Behind you is the covent garden and the market changes every three days and you can walk to Piccadilly Circus Metro is a walking distance You can walk as well to charing cross station Couple of blocks away Big Ben and Buckingham palace is not far at all by walking
164260,Strand Palace Hotel, Our executive room was gloomy and brown with minimal natural light quite small for the extra cost It looked out onto concrete walls A slightly larger executive room was available but only on payment of a supplement and the view was the same Breakfast could have been a treat but it was quite bland and served in an over crowded drab backroom Also one lift wasn t operating for two days causing delays so we used the stairs a lot On reflection we I may have had unrealistic expectations for a room in central London However like many visitors to the capital staying here was meant to be part of a special occasion for an important anniversary Overall the hotel was fine no real cause for concern just a little underwhelming , Great location and great coffee Some staff were friendly and helpful Gin Bar was very nice 
164261,Strand Palace Hotel, That the room was very basic there was no coziness about it I paid extra for an executive double room expecting more comfort and a bigger room but was really disappointed We have stayed here quite a few times but doubt we will return , Location of the hotel 
164262,Strand Palace Hotel, Far too noisy workmen and deliveries right outside if window was closed room was too hot window open ridiculously noisy , Position of hotel near local attractions bars shops restaurants
164263,Strand Palace Hotel, No bath got small daughter beds really uncomfortable, Excellent breakfast rooms adequate for a short stay Lovely bottle of Presecco in the room as wife s birthday 
164264,Strand Palace Hotel, No air con in the room in July was tricky One lift out of action so getting luggage downstairs took ages, Perfect location decent sized twin room great shower
164265,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very loud The bed was hard and the breakfast was not fresh and to small The food selection was very small , The room was very clean and the size was also good 
164266,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms were so small It was advertised as a cosy double but it was more like a very very cosy single There was no air con in the room and the rooms got very stuffy and warm quickly didn t affect us a whole pile because we were out most of the day but we were lucky the weather was mild and not roasting Also on the last day house keeping came at 9am to clean the room despite us not having to be out until 12 She came back then again at 10am for which I got annoyed , The location is unreal it without doubt would bring me back to the hotel 
164267,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning in a room that overlooked a service courtyard so hot and stuffy There was a fan but it just moved the hot air around Everything else was excellent , Staff were very friendly and helpful Fabulous location Decor in public rooms excellent Breakfast 11 out of 10 
164268,Strand Palace Hotel, The room upgraded was small too warm and perpetually dark due to extensive scaffolding work Faced an internal courtyard and needed lamps on all the time Like being in an inside cabin on ship Lifts are a joke No aircon no fridge no iron and not 4 star , Location
164269,Strand Palace Hotel, I have stayed here many times and will stay again on this occasion however the breakfast choice was not quite as good as previous stays No mushrooms no hash browns price supplement for eggs other than scrambled That said what was on offer was good, The location Short walking distance to either Covent Garden or Charing Cross Tube Stations Good choice if you are going to the theatre Shaftsbury Avenue Leicester Square Covent Garden all within walking distance Price Reduced At around 120 a night this was excellent value for a West End located hotel but check as prices do vary Staff Always accommodating
164270,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was extremely small and the view out of the window which was facing the front of the hotel was just a wall so no view really The receptionist told us we had a front view like we were getting a treat The room facilities were also very limited tea and coffee with a TV Pretty much all I can say about it , The location of the hotel is ideal for visiting Covent Garden and is only a 2 minute walk to the piazza 
164271,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms are quite tiny and couple with complex layout of some rooms 315 for e g leads to no space to walk around No air conditioning in this heat is killer The GBP20 early check in is a scam I can understand if that if someone wishes to avail of that in advance it s fine But if someone is at the property at 10am and the room is available who charges money for early check in then , Location
164272,Strand Palace Hotel, Very little although air conditioning would have been good to have, Very comfortable and well provided room There was construction work taking place at the time but it was limited to office hours only so no real interference or impact Staff were always very helpful and professional
164273,Strand Palace Hotel, haven t seen a tinier room no Air Con and the window doesn t open the view was some construction material the interior of the room was also very poor more like a storage ,No Positive
164274,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was too hot bed was a bit uncomfortable, Great location I understand the room was small but it had no air conditioning and was very very stuffy I stayed in the Z hotel a few weeks back the room was smaller but had air con very comfy bed
164275,Strand Palace Hotel, There was construction happening right outside my room I don t remember getting any notice of that and I woke up after my first night to a loud team of workmen just past the open windows If I had known about the construction I would not have booked that room , The staff was excellent after the horrible travel experiences leading to London Lovely 
164276,Strand Palace Hotel, Hotel bars lacked atmosphere and were more like libraries , Excellent location Directly across the road from the Savoy Other theatres and Covent Garden on the doorstep too 
164277,Strand Palace Hotel, There was scaffolding outside the window which blocked all light from coming into the room Rooms were also a lot smaller than the website let on , Location 
164278,Strand Palace Hotel, Expensive for what you get the shower didn t drain at all and I called the front desk but no one fixed it Also called for a bathrobe and that took too long so I cancelled it needs serious improvement on service Significantly better places if you pay a bit more , Location is the main sell
164279,Strand Palace Hotel, Help with luggage was a consistent problem , One of the elevators was out so getting downstairs with bags in the morning was difficult and the bag porters were always MIA Rooms were smallish and fine nothing fancy The hotel smelled a bit like smoke 
164280,Strand Palace Hotel, In London it s hot during summer and there are no air conditioner or nice broad windows for ventilation in the hotel Very suffocating Though the staff was very nice and helpful they changed my room within a few minutes but even on the 3rd floor it wasn t really working , Nice and friendly staff
164281,Strand Palace Hotel, The night we stayed was a hot one so we found it difficult to sleep At the breakfast it was a bit noisey and rather crowded But the service and food was excellent , We eat in the restaurant on Tuesday evening and the food was excellent We have stayed at this hotel in the past and we like the service and location 
164282,Strand Palace Hotel, First night stay in a room close to main road with noise coming from police sirens and noisy traffics No aircon in my room just fan , Convient to excess to everywhere Covent Garden just 5 mins walk
164283,Strand Palace Hotel, there were not water bottoles on the first and second night although I asked staff So on the third day I bought one bottle at bar Then I got them This is one of examples Although I asked staff I could not get their service , Accessible room
164284,Strand Palace Hotel, For the amount of money we paid for one night for five people the rooms were very ordinary Our rooms were very pokey on different floors and very hot with only tiny little windows looking out on to scaffolding It would be nice to have a top sheet on the bed as it gets very hot with a doona but is nice to have a cover , The best feature of this hotel is its location We were only back in London for one night having stayed earlier in the month in an apartment Given the cost of other similarly located hotels in London the price is ok but it is exorbitant compared to apartments It is very easy to access Covent Garden tube and catch the Picadilly line straight out to Heathrow so it is worth staying here for the convenience of access Rooms are clean Breakfast is what you expect in a large hotel buffet style and good to be included in the price 
164285,Strand Palace Hotel, Booked a room not realizing it was smaller than a college dorm Twin bed unsoft mattress Had to pay 40 pounds a night more for a double bed No Air conditioning just a fan Walls were paper thin, Staff was friendly Gin bar was nice
164286,Strand Palace Hotel, I paid for to have my room upgraded to a air condition room and that was way over charged for what was at best very poor working system if it was working at all the room was always warm This hotel would be fine in the winter or during cool weather but if the weather was hot it would be very uncomfortable Also for reason know only to the hotel the room bed had only a very heavy blanket on the bed with only the mattress sheeted so you only had one sheet not two as in most hotels , The hotel staff was very nice and helpful and when ever I needed help they helped me out 
164287,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning in our room that s just not acceptable in any clinste, Very nice older hotel in the heart of westminister close to everything
164288,Strand Palace Hotel, Walls are quite thin and room was very hot Had to use fan which was already in the room but this was a little noisy , Very good against what was expected for cost in central London 
164289,Strand Palace Hotel, Hairs and dust behind the bathroom door Would ve taken a second to clean , The quality of the room and the location plus friendly staff made it a great stay 
164290,Strand Palace Hotel, Bar could serve a better range of bottled beer husbands comment , Comfy bed good sized room tea coffee facilities nice toiletries great view over The Strand Very short walk to Leicester Square Trafalgar Square Really central location Friendly staff at the hotel Lovely breakfast 
164291,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was poor where we sat half the listed products on the menu were not available later we saw people walking to another area for an improved choice Scrambled eggs seemed to be powder not fresh which looked more like porridge , Great location
164292,Strand Palace Hotel, The lifts as others have mentioned were quite slow as one wasn t working Our room felt quite small even though only 2 of us were in there The bed was a bit hard and the bathroom was really small At one point the bathroom couldn t have been more than half a meter wide which meant we bumped ourselves constantly trying to get in or out of the shower There was also a huge amount of construction going on on our floor and outside the building It was extremely loud and would have been nice if we d been told to expect noise when we checked in , The location is fantastic right in the west end with theatres cafes and restaurants all around Easily walk to Trafalgar Square 2 tube stations are close by Check in was easy the staff were nice They held our bags free of charge on our last day 
164293,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning in bedroom at 25 plus degrees degrees bedroom so uncomfortable Would not recommend a bedroom with no airconditioning in summer , Location excellent
164294,Strand Palace Hotel, first night terrible given a no aircon room 216 and next day changed room to 877 but additional fee of GBP40 , the bed small and old no air con only a table fan 
164295,Strand Palace Hotel, The corridors are a maze poorly signposted dimly lit and not very clean The rooms are in better shape but to be honest you only come to the Strand Palace for its central location and relatively affordable price not because you expect anything swanky It s functional that s the best I can say , It s well located Check out was very easy Bed was quite comfortable 
164296,Strand Palace Hotel, There was no air conditioning in the room not fitted but a fan was provided Not ideal but better than nothing considering the hot weather The bar closed at 11pm which seemed very early for a central London hotel , The hotel was very convenient for theatres and Trafalgar Square 
164297,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom is tired and needs attention Tap of bath tube was almost glued with lime and scale It took all my strength to open it Maybe everybody use only shower but it does not mean that bath tap has not to be in appropriate condition 4 star hotel without conditioner in the center of city in hot nights nothing to be proud of With the opened window to noisy to sleep with the closed window too hot to sleep blanket too thick No normal rest sorry , Very central location best for any need in London Friendly and helpful staff 
164298,Strand Palace Hotel, Lifts very slow and one out of action No air conditioning in bedrooms although a fan was provided , Staff are always helpful and friendly throughout each unit 
164299,Strand Palace Hotel, Please see comments above , We enjoyed our stay and the staff were very kind and helpful towards us However we found the heat last weekend perhaps could have needed air conditioning in the rooms and windows a fraction open more although a fan was provided The rooms could also have more hooks as there was few places to put clothes except in the wardrobe and this wasn t very big when we had evening dresses and suit 
164300,Strand Palace Hotel, The first day I had to bath instead of shower because I couln t manage to make it work as soon as I told them they came checking it turned out it could be turn on but it required strength even if no longer needed they changed it so to make it more confortable for me , The best part was the treatment Everybody was super nice and helpful Also the detail of always providing two water bottles was appreciated
164301,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing except a longer stay , Everything Only there for one night taking in a couple of Westend shows Could easily walk to the theatres from The Strand Palace
164302,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed was not comfortable had sore back each morning Also room was very hot and uncomfortable due to weather and lack of air conditioning , Location ideal
164303,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning This was almost unbearable in London s summer The table fan provided little respite from the stuffiness of the room , Location was excellent We watched 3 shows and it was a breeze walking to the theatres especially Lyceum getting food before and after the shows Covent Garden is a stone s throw away Tube stations are reasonably close by It takes 10 15 minutes to walk to Charing Cross Embankment Covent Garden stations 
164304,Strand Palace Hotel, Uncomfortable chair in the room The step up to the shower was very high and not being very tall was a bit of a struggle to the hand grip on the far wall to help get in also felt unsure about getting out safely while still trying to hang on and place foot on the floor, Bed very comfy Fan in the room helped as it was extremely hot outside
164305,Strand Palace Hotel, The breakfast choice was excellent however the pre made yellow bread crumbed hash browns were on offer as usual elsewhere sometimes baked fairly hard We stay in plenty of hotels in UK and abroad and on cruise ships and the modern way for offering potatoes nowadays seems to be saut ed sometimes with mushrooms or onions mixed in delicious We realise that some people do actually like the pre formed hash browns but perhaps the Strand Palace could provide both to appeal to all their customers Not a complaint but a helpful suggestion , Reception staff in particular were excellent and other staff too were very good indeed We were given an upgrade to our room reception were good and helpful about our enquiries for directions and luggage advice The staff in the restaurant for breakfast were also helpful and agreeable 
164306,Strand Palace Hotel, Dirty room very dated dark and dingy no air conditioning and then to top it off a pair of dirty knickers left previously in the wardrobe, Not very much apart from the location
164307,Strand Palace Hotel, They advertised my single person room as a cosy room but it was really very very cosy in the sense that it was just big enough to have my single bed and a little desk , Excellent breakfast and right in the center of town next to convent garden en near Kings College and the Thames 
164308,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms were basic and out of date It s unbelievable that I have stayed in nicer travel lodges The temperature was sweltering There was no air conditioning and all they had was a little fan in the cupboard I payed a lot of money for my room and expected more from a hotel located on The Strand , When we arrived we were greeted at the door and the lobby looked very modern 
164309,Strand Palace Hotel, I did not like the initial room it was tiny no air conditioner and the temperature on my arrival was above 90 degree very noisy and they were doing construction in the back and in summary I will not let my dog sleep on it, I did like Guest relation manger Manish Raware who upgraded my room for 320 pounds for 4nights
164310,Strand Palace Hotel, We stayed during the possibly hottest summer in UK and there was no aircon , The location is great we are close to key places like Covent Garden Trafalgar Square Leicester Square and etc 
164311,Strand Palace Hotel, The AC control was not the easiest to figure out, Breakfast was very good with friendly and efficient staff We had little cookie treats left for us each day plus coffee tea and hot chocolate Phone calls within London were free and wifi was great Location of the hotel for seeing or walking to attractions was wonderful
164312,Strand Palace Hotel, No aircon in the rooms in June and the windows had to be locked Big hotel with average service and average buffet breakfast, location was 100 perfect just near all shopping of Covenant Garden 
164313,Strand Palace Hotel, The view of our room was of the scaffolding due to the building work they re doing to the back of the hotel and I was woken up by the builders in the morning , The room was nice the bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful The staff were also very friendly and there was no fuss checking in or out 
164314,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was tiny barely enough room for 2 extremely narrow single beds No air conditioning and a window that wouldn t open Window was filthy and looked out onto scaffolding with strip light immediately outside and rubbish visible Room was grubby claustrophobic and a disgrace for 250 , Not much except location
164315,Strand Palace Hotel, The smell fragrance when you walked in every day was awful the lifts were not all working and were being worked on and slow The room was tiny and the construction scaffolding banging outside my room off putting The food in the restaurant was the worste we had in all of the UK And no ice makers on any floor but the first w broken lifts made ice hard to get each day Charging for the ice and having a machine that only would take OLD coins non of which I had made it impossible to get any , I liked the location it was walking distance or a short Taxi ride to everything we wanted to see in London
164316,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was small and was without windows natural sunlight , Great location in Covent Garden near numerous restaurants cafes pubs and sites of interest all within walking distance and also close to metro Decent restaurants on site in the hotel 
164317,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, This time I had booked a room for my daughter and her friend who came to stay one night in London after been working volunteer job in Africa for a month I had told her to ask for early check in because they arrived at approx 8am after been travelling for 24hours and late check out the day after because they had a very late flight back to Iceland and you where able to meet that inquiry for extra payment Thank you It was good to know them been able to rest rightaway after this long trip and therefore have more time to enjoy London 
164318,Strand Palace Hotel, The single room was ridiculously small and although I had been told that would receive an upgrade if I paid extra when I arrived and indeed had paid the extra no upgrade to the room had been applied , Food was hot a freshly cooked 
164319,Strand Palace Hotel, From the picture posted on the website I thought the room was a little bigger but it didn t really matter because I was out a lot and I got to do a lot for this very convenient location During my four day stay one of the elevator was out most of the time Also I am not sure how tight the security in the lobby , So conveient a short walk to Royal Opera House Coventry Garden Market National Gallery and 15 minutes walk to the British Museum and National Theater and London Eye My room is quite comfortable with air conditioning Theaters and restaurant are all round the hotel 
164320,Strand Palace Hotel, Room very small stuffy no air con no view at all out of window just breeze block wall partner kept awake both nights because of bed light didn t work over bed First breakfast was stone cold ,No Positive
164321,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a room which we booked only the dat before however it was like a building site outside the window and at 8 30am in the morning builders working in an adjoining room started work banging and drilling so I made a complaint at reception when checking out If you really value mine wife s custom then feel more than an apology from reception staff is required , The locatoion was the most important thing 
164322,Strand Palace Hotel, Cooked breakfast was cold scrambled eggs looked more like porridge executive rooms were the size of a basic double and bed uncomfortable the only good thing was the location was good for the area we needed,No Positive
164323,Strand Palace Hotel, I know London is expensive esp in Summer but felt it was expensive , Spacious room and food layout of mirrors etc for getting ready Very good breakfast hot buffet was hot and good choice plenty of other food also which was of a good standard 
164324,Strand Palace Hotel, No parking facilities No a c in bedroom Noisy construction work starts early 7 30 am We had to lug our bags about 50 meters to the front door because it is on a bus lane and we did not know about the side entrance , Efficient professional service No frills well equipped bedrooms except for no a c 
164325,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was much smaller than expected with loud construction going on outside the window There was no air conditioning so I had to keep the windows open but that meant that there were bright work lightes at night and loud working noises in the morning , Location was fantastic 
164326,Strand Palace Hotel, Room dark and rather poky and small No air con Electrics fused and lighting was not fully restored during our stay Poor value for money Like an airport No character Crowded Miniature lifts and one out of action , Location The shower 
164327,Strand Palace Hotel, The room didn t have air conditioner just a cheap fan that didn t work Smelly noisy room Had to keep the windows open due to the heat Had to use ear plugs to sleep The carpet was tore down The closet was a joke Hugely overpriced ,No Positive
164328,Strand Palace Hotel, Shower was a bit hard to control and very noisy Everything else was perfect , Ideal location for our trip to a show at the London Coliseum My teenage son and I just wanted a comfortable peaceful nights rest Staff at reception were lovely just what we wanted after a long journey We didn t use any other facilities The view of the busy street was great 
164329,Strand Palace Hotel, I had to change the date of our stay because I was unwell at the end of April when we should have been at the hotel When telephoned to change the booking I was told that our stay would cost an extra 130 but that this would now include breakfast which we hadn t originally asked for As I currently have to take a Fat Free Diet until I can have an operation this seemed ideal as I would be able to choose from the menu the things I could eat However when we booked in we were informed that this was not correct and breakfast was not included We could have paid extra for it but having been told that it was to be included decided that 930 was enough to pay , The d was comfortable and the room was clean and well appointed 
164330,Strand Palace Hotel, Hot noisy room No room service even though I paid for breakfast I was told if I wanted it bought to my room an additional 9 95 fee would be charged, Location
164331,Strand Palace Hotel, Each year my wife and I have an annual trip to London for a show and site seeing In the past we have stopped at the Trafalgar Sq Thistle and Ramada Edwardian This year we decided to stay at the Strand Palace which was a big mistake Even though we paid significantly more than our previous trips our room was tiny and had no air conditioning There were hotel repairs going on by our window which required leaving lights on all night As we could not sleep we complained and were moved to another room at 11pm This room was even smaller We will not be returning, Handy for the shows 
164332,Strand Palace Hotel, room had no air conditioning and if window was open you could hear street noise all night Bed was okay not great although sheets were nice bathroom was adequate did not like amenities soap shampoo The Carvary restaurant was Terrible Staff was rude food was overcooked and buffet looked like it was out for days, Sheets were okay Location is wonderful Staff always nice
164333,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was too small for a double bed and one occupant was stuck against the wall with no reading light and no bedside table It seems that this was originally intended as a single room Also we saw people go directly from the street and upstairs and then leave again without entering a room This was a little unnerving , The room was clean and the bathroom facilities were adequate 
164334,Strand Palace Hotel, Price discrepancy between Booking com and actual hotel Booked on site on arrival to London through website for 318 USD for 2 nights and ended with charges of 315 difference of 90 No early check in room size a little small, Windows that open held bags in secured area fresh fruit at front desk location central to everything
164335,Strand Palace Hotel, Very disappointed in room Very small no electrical outlet in bathroom except for razors No window that opened except in bathroom Very hot no air conditioning,No Positive
164336,Strand Palace Hotel, Very disruptive reconstruction work just infront of my window I needed to leave the hotel on the last day at 11am from 9 am was impossible to stay in the room Given no aircondition in the room it was not as well possible to open the window and get fresh air due to the noice and the dirty stuff coming in from outside Unacceptable for the price they charge , Great location some of the staff at reception were very helpful 
164337,Strand Palace Hotel, The Palace is well worn very busy and holds hundreds of guests It needs updating with dingy corridors and dorm style room configuraitons It is typical London small rooms older furnishing like being in your grandparents house But be careful as they overcharge given the post code of the Hotel but if you book late the rates drop significatly since its really not comparable to the Savoy or other 5star options , Bedding was great breakfast was top notch staff were freindly overall a fine stay 
164338,Strand Palace Hotel, The Gin Palace could have been a little more welcoming , The excellent information happily and readily given by all members of staff A credit to the hotel reference staff training and staff recruitment 
164339,Strand Palace Hotel, Very hot in the room No air con A fan was supplied but did not do the job, Staff were very friendly and efficient We had a lovely big walk in shower Location is brilliant all theatres and cafe restaurants around 2 minutes from Covent Garden square The place wasn t uber posh but had pleasant decor and I felt comfortable
164340,Strand Palace Hotel, Very hot room No window to open Fan was provided which did help but could not sleep well as I did not think it advisable to leave fan on all night Hot drinks from bar rather over priced , Excellent location for Royal Opera House Clean quiet room Exceptionally courteous and helpful staff Very enjoyable carvery lunch Very good room rate from Booking com 
164341,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing, The location was fantastic and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Strand Palace and would recommend it unreservedly 
164342,Strand Palace Hotel, I loved everything about the hotel except for the hot stuffy room at night Central air would have made a world of difference in the comfort level in sleeping at night The windows did not open enough to make any difference in the temperature level of the room , The staff was amazing Everyone from the front desk bell hops doormen and especially the maintenance man was super friendly and helpful The location is also great 
164343,Strand Palace Hotel, Basic room no lock on bathroom door Had to ask for some bathrobes to use , Central location clean friendly staff Main hotel areas very nice and high quality 
164344,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing, Carvery restaurant excellent service food and price Room comfortable Very relaxing atmosphere Gin palace lovely atmosphere Breakfast had lots of options and availability
164345,Strand Palace Hotel, The bedrooms could do with air conditioning instead of a fan so uncomfortable to sleep at night the heatwave didn t help matters We stayed here 10 years ago and think maybe its time for the rooms to be updated , Location fantastic Covent Garden around the corner most staff very friendly good breakfast We took in a show which was only 10 minutes walk to the theatre Lots of attractions also in walking distance
164346,Strand Palace Hotel, They tried to put me in an Executive room which had the sound of men drilling shouting and banging just outside the window How they expected guests to tolerate that plus the scaffolding outside the window makes the room insecure , Breakfast is good
164347,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, I stayed at strand palace hotel for a few days in June Certainly not worth it Although it is very well located the rooms are extremely small carpets all over the hotel and NO air conditioning in the rooms which made our stay very unpleasant considering we had some days with temperature over 30C Breakfast was very good although payed separately 12 pounds per person day Elevators very slow took the stairs most of the times even though I was staying in the 5th floor Very expensive for what it offers 
164348,Strand Palace Hotel, Small rooms no air conditioning no fridge staff wasn t helpful at all doing the minimum job , The excellent location is the only thing I liked about this hotel that s it 
164349,Strand Palace Hotel, No Aircon with temperature 30C and above shower temperature not consistent hot cold every 5 6 seconds wooden panel at windows can t be shut completely which disturbs sleep only stairs at the main entrance of hotel so I had to carry my heavy luggages up , Good location
164350,Strand Palace Hotel, Where to start From the room that made me feel like Harry potter cramped room tiny single bed excessive heat to the holiday resort feel of the canteen sorry I can t call it a restaurant and to finish it off the amazing lack of air conditioning throughout the hotel it really is the worst I ve stayed in for a long time , Location was excellent for my work and was the only plus factor 
164351,Strand Palace Hotel, for breakfast the choice of cereal could have been greater but it s really nitpicking , the location is perfect I thought it would be noisy but my room was very quiet The staff was always smiley and helpful
164352,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning room 35 C degrees hot Renovation in progress and paint fumes in the room Sound insulation was so bad I woke up in the morning multiple times when the alarm clocks and phones of neighboring rooms rang I was expecting at least average comfort for 200 pounds per night but this was an disappointment ,No Positive
164353,Strand Palace Hotel, My room wasn t sound proofed and the head of the bed was right up against the corridor wall I was woken up all through the night and early morning by guests walking and talking in the corridor through paper thin walls Every time someone ran the shower or went to the toilet the water pipes made loud clanging sounds through the night There was no air conditioning in the room either and the room was so unbearably hot I hardly slept anyway , Helpful and friendly staff Good shower and great location Buffet breakfast was ok 
164354,Strand Palace Hotel, Very humid and hot no air conditioning and very small room especially for the price definitely couldn t fit two people, The internet ran pretty well and the staff 90 percent I met were nice
164355,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very small very noisy and the view through the window would have been straight into another room if it wasn t for the scaffold and the builders walking round , The location was close to the majority of the sites and close to the theatre and the Thames 
164356,Strand Palace Hotel, confusion at breakfast We were seated in a room to side of main area where there was a cold buffet and very small selection of hot food It was only when we went in search of toast that we realised we could have accessed a much better selection This caused confusion for several residents and extra work for staff who dealt with the issues Having stopped several times it s the first time we ve had this problem, Sry pleasant staff and environment 
164357,Strand Palace Hotel, We had to park in a train station 30min away from the hotel but this is because you have to pay to drive into the city It s not the hotel s fault though Regarding the hotel everything was positive , Amazing place Very clean comfy bed affordable price for such a great location in London Close to major attractions and places of interest Lovely 
164358,Strand Palace Hotel, There weren t even any towels in the room I booked 5 rooms supposed to be twin but 4 were twin and one with a double bed so two grown men not related or gay had to share a bed The Strand is the worst hell hole we have ever stayed in and the cost was daylight robbery They should be ashamed , Nothing
164359,Strand Palace Hotel, Room 107, The single room was a disappointment From the website I thought I was booking a standard room it was very small airless and stuffy to sleep in with no air conditioning Perhaps the website ought to include a note about the smallness of the single room 107 so that others are not caught out 
164360,Strand Palace Hotel, Cozy was an understatement Hate a bed that is up against a wall One of the lifts was out of service I booked in dollars online but was charged a different higher amount at the hotel The carpets in my room felt a touch sticky , The location was great For a central London hotel it was incredibly quiet and the rooms were easy to make dark at night It was mostly clean Convenient kettle with tea and coffee fixings Comfy bed 
164361,Strand Palace Hotel, I have to stay here when work commands but I ve said it before and I will say it again Booking com should remove this property it seems to me that if you book through booking com you get given the nastiest little company rooms always looking inwards onto piles of scaffolding anyone could climb into your room from there and there a bags of stuff sandwich wrappers bags of rubbish etc left by I presume workmen I d recommend you find somewhere else because the strand palace as far as using a booking engine like this is absolutely awful, Location is good for the office
164362,Strand Palace Hotel, It takes quite a lot of people and the rooms are pretty small We got a room with a view to the Strand and it is constantly very noisy as the windows don t isolate very well Overall I feel it is a bit too pricey for what you get like most places in London , Good variety in terms of breakfast both cold and hot buffet Staff was nice and helpful The location is also very good and well connected 
164363,Strand Palace Hotel, Can t really find a fault , Everything in the hotel was A1 the location off the hotel was exellent for all the sights special places London has to offer was easily accessible really nice bars cafes restaurants heritage off the city close to hand bit pricey but I understand it s central London and you pay for that extra special hotel location 
164364,Strand Palace Hotel, The room we stayed in was tiny and the facilities were very modest I didn t even bother to turn on the tablet sized TV , The location is excellent Covent Garden is around the corner Perfect for enjoying London s entertainment options and walking back to the hotel 
164365,Strand Palace Hotel, Poor choice of cereals for breakfast, Location is perfect Staff without exception polite and helpful The room was basic but very clean with comfy bed 
164366,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing to report very happy , Location was ideal for our theatre trip plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby if you didn t want to eat in the hotel Hotel and rooms were spotless comfortable and relaxing and there was free wi fi throughout the hotel 
164367,Strand Palace Hotel, Some areas of the hotel are quite dark but overall very good Lifts were not all working so took a little while , Great that there was 24 hour room service we enjoyed a great Club Sandwich at 2am 
164368,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was unfit to be rented out , The room was a construction site window did not open no air conditioner Should not be allowed to stay in it by law I should have been told about the construction site outside my window and no air conditioner The staff on the front dest was rude when I complained about it I wanted to move away but you had taken my money 3 months before I arrived I will never book again online with booking Com Com Back to flight Centre for me I made an error with one day extra I contacted you and you didn t get the same price as the other 3 days They wanted 750 for one night outrageous ripe off Today I am returning for 5 more nights not looking forward to it Make sure you don t take my money out of my MasterCard again I paid every hotel on this trip and you or some other company s have charged my MasterCard again I have to now go home to my bank and work out why this error has been made by Hotel booking company s 
164369,Strand Palace Hotel, Room and beds were way too small for the amount of money we paid for the 2 x nights For the price we paid we also expected air con and a bar fridge none of which was present The room was very hot and all we had in the room for any relief was a cheap little fan , Location only
164370,Strand Palace Hotel, Noise level was loud due to busy street, Great choice in breakfast Breakfast was hot and fresh Water was hot for shower with good pressure Bed was very comfy room was very clean
164371,Strand Palace Hotel, Felt the price was a lot for a single and quite small room where the outlook was scaffolding , Loved the position as close to all I wanted to see in central London 
164372,Strand Palace Hotel, Food was poor Restaurant staff not helpful Waiter Manger rude when I told him I had been waiting 10 mins for a menu room small but ok because I had only booked for 1 night and went for cheapest option, Excellent location With the exception of the evening manager in the restaurant the rest of the staff were very friendly and helpfull
164373,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom was small toilet handle was loose due to being constantly hit by the toilet lid No Air Conditioning in this day and age Really , The breakfast was excellent good choices and plenty available Staff were extremely attentive 
164374,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and at check in we were upgraded and when we returned to our room later a complimentary bottle of fizz in an ice bucket had been left for us Great service 
164375,Strand Palace Hotel, Like the majority of large inner London Hotels the bar prices are high Breakfast service is hectic and rushed If you book a cosy room then do not be surprised when you get a very cosy room , The Strand Palace strength is its location Trafalgar Square Covent Garden and the Thames are only a short walk away You are also at the cross roads of the London Underground system with access to multiple lines only a few hundred metres away the rooms are clean and tidy and the staff helpful 
164376,Strand Palace Hotel, I arrived about 13 30 and was told a room would be ready in half an hour I went out and came back at 16 00 only to be told I hate to wait another hour I was not pleased and the receptionist found a room which was ready , The bed was very comfortable and it is good to have a room designed for one person 
164377,Strand Palace Hotel, Quite a lot unfortunately The difference between the reception area and the bedrooms is huge I would compare the rooms to that of a Travel Lodge nothing wrong with that apart from you re paying three times the price Had my room changed twice as there was mould on the shower and lightbulbs hanging out of their cases The executive rooms aren t any nicer they re just bigger Our view in all rooms was of a brick wall My partner and I went to the Carvery restaurant on the Saturday night We were kindly provided with some gluten free gravy but it was incredibly salty and unfortunately ruined the meal We informed the staff and they were disinterested Then on the morning of check out which isn t until 12pm the maid came into our room at 11am without giving us a chance to say that the room was occupied , Good location nice decor in reception 
164378,Strand Palace Hotel, Really strong perfumed smell in the entrance and I think the walls are made of paper as you can here every conversation in rooms close by , The staff were brilliant 
164379,Strand Palace Hotel, The concierge was the most grumpy rude and unhelpful person I have ever come across whilst staying at a hotel He was a young foreign guy and not like the traditionally informative and willing to help type of person you d expect The bed was incredibly uncomfortable too twin beds pushed together with no effort to disguise the lumps in the mattress where they met I hate that , The location for what I needed was perfect
164380,Strand Palace Hotel, no fridge in room booked executive room which should have allowed us into covent garden dining room for breakfast where you order your food with extra choices available however we were shown into main restaurant and told to help ourselves to buffet breakfast I know the covent gdn dining was open but not doing ordered breakfasts I think we still should have been in there if only for the spaciousness and tables with lovely cloths etc the people who were allowed that privilege I can only think that their money must have been worth more than mine or maybe they thought we were hillbillies I have stayed in this hotel many times and thought I would treat ourselves to executive for second time but very disappointed eating arrangements , cleanliness and location
164381,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff were simply rude no other word for it and it left me speechless , 277 a night for an Executive Room and no Air Conditioning Really Even a 49 a night Travel Lodge has Air Con think I ll book in there next time instead 
164382,Strand Palace Hotel, I booked a cosy double room It was definitely cosy if not a little dated The room was overlooking a courtyard I think but that couldn t really be seen due to the scaffolding all outside the window which made the room really dark The windows wouldn t stay open making the room stifling hot but there was a desk fan and we used rolled up towels to prop the window open , The location was great So close to the sights and a short walk from Covent Garden Staff were pleasant and we were able to check in earlier and leave our bags The room was smaller than expected the bed pushed up against the wall so no chance of falling out a nice stay and all In all a clean and tidy room with complimentary tea biccies and water 
164383,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was so small even claustrophobic no window very hot Thank god that i requested bathtub prior but there were some hair still in bathroom No window could be opened the window was towards backyard no air too hot At least fan was in but no AC , Location was excellent Everything in walking distance 
164384,Strand Palace Hotel, On my second day at breakfast I was put into an inferior dining side room no table cloths no staff the man who put me there was very patronising called me darling twice obviously thought he could dump me as I was alone One of the reasons I go to this hotel in an executive room Is s so I can use the executive dining room which I enjoy I did not take breakfast in the room he put me in ,No Positive
164385,Strand Palace Hotel, One member staff while waiting for my airport transport after my check out offered to bring my luggage to the side doors to wait for my transport when I realized that he had put me standing outside for my 30 to 40 minutes waiting time for my shuttle to arrived but previously he had done the same to other customers as to clear the main entrance hall where to say there is seating for waiting But everything else was great service and professional Thank to all Staff Members, It was my 5th stay and congratulations I enjoyed my stay
164386,Strand Palace Hotel, Reception Staff were unfriendly and arrogant Yet again got my invoice address wrong When I asked why booking directly on their Website was always more expensive than other Websites the Lady at desk didnt seem to care Charged for early checkin and late checkout Yet again got a room with obstructed window in room with scaffolding from construction being done outside , Clean Rooms Nice scented air conditioned air Lobby 
164387,Strand Palace Hotel, No AC in a small room with a window that can t be opened for security reasons The room was unbearably warm and it wasn t even that warm outside Had I not prepaid I would have moved out immediately Otherwise good hotel as would be expected , Nice breakfast good location
164388,Strand Palace Hotel, Small lifts small room the view from the room all scaffoldings As for food non appetising calamari served in a small bowl at 7 30 scrambled eggs at breakfast looked raw , Water bottles changed with new ones coffee milk and tea re fills the next day Excellent location Friendly staff 
164389,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is well situated for tourists and is good value for central London Check in and check out were very efficient and there was no queue for breakfast which was plentiful and varied 
164390,Strand Palace Hotel, My partner is quite a lot younger than me and the check in girl asked twice if we wanted two rooms and once if we wanted twin room as if we had somehow made a mistake booking a king size room We don t mind a comment occasionally about our age gap but the fact this girl asked 3 times in a short time upset my partner None of her business at all For reference we are age 40 and 23 , Bed was comfy room spacious
164391,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms are a bit dated and don t have air conditioning Our window opened but right onto the Strand which is a very busy and noisy road , Very convenient for Covent Garden and attractions such as the National Gallery and Trafalgar Square 
164392,Strand Palace Hotel, I couldn t say anything bad about my stay I was only here for a business meeting and then away again I didn t have time to analyse everything it met my needs at the time and that was important to me , The staff were absolutely wonderful They couldn t do enough to ensure I got my car in time for my flight 
164393,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed was lumpy and uncomfortable No aircondition in the rooms First room was on the 1st floor and window could not be opened probably because of scaffolding and work being done outside We switched rooms Second room was a few floors up but still not able to open the window facing the scaffolding Therefore we woke up the next morning sweating buckets and no air to speak of window could not be opened We switched rooms for the third time There the window could be opened but unfortunately the bed was still lumpy The bar on the right was ok but please tell the staff to change the muzak and lower the volume and relax with the cold air blowing down on the guests No wonder very few guests hang out there it used to be very busy there all the time And what is the idea of keeping signs directing guests to an Indian restaurant but only when standing in front of the door to the restaurant do you realize the restaurant is closed a sign on the door , Very acommodating when we asked for an upgrade for a fee 
164394,Strand Palace Hotel, As there wasn t any air conditioning we needed to leave windows open Therefore traffic noise was problematic , Excellent location with extremely helpful staff especially the concierge 
164395,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a few warm days and there was no cross ventilation and no air conditioning This could be a real problem if you visit in a warmer month than May , The location was accessible to many London attractions 
164396,Strand Palace Hotel, Room to small you had to get out of the bed one side only bathroom to small you had to lean to one side to have a shower very uncomfortable, Room clean and basic comforts
164397,Strand Palace Hotel, Two things to keep in mind only certain rooms have air conditioning others have fans in closets When the weather is very warm and humid that s a problem Also Strand Avenue is a very busy and noisy road with lots of pubs and drinkers And they get very loud very late And a general comment for Americans British people drink coffee with milk if you want cream you have to work at it At the hotel they understood that to be double cream then you ll get something equivalent to what you use in the States , Full English breakfast was very good Free newspapers provided in lobby which is nice Staff was very pleasant as well and location is fabulous as far as convenience to Trafalgar Square and other landmarks Walking distance to Piccadilly Circus Churchill Warm Rooms and Westminster Abbey as well National Art Gallery and Portrait Gallery are at Trafalgar Square only a five or 10 minute walk from the hotel 
164398,Strand Palace Hotel, The staff argued stating that we did not have a room booked for 2 people even after I showed them the booking com printout with the reservation details They were not even going to give us towels for the 2 people in the room at first Rooms were even smaller than expected given the photos online , Nice bathroom and location
164399,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms are quite small and besides there is construction which is going on outside in the internal side of the building, Very friendly and helpful staff good breakfast clean and well organized rooms
164400,Strand Palace Hotel, One of the lifts was out of order during the whole weekend , Superb breakfast with a lot of choice to suit all tastes Friendly staff Clean rooms Close to many attractions 
164401,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very warm and the air conditioning didn t make any difference We used a fan to cool which was in the room so they must be aware of the air con problem The bar staff were overrun at times and could of explained or apologised to customers who had become inpatient , Location is great breakfast was good Rooms were clean King size beds were very comfortable We got a free upgrade which was nice 
164402,Strand Palace Hotel, Shower taps need descaling horrid smell from drains the new booth seating is so unfriendly the older decor made more sense New menu card room dining not advisable limited choice of average food Tea cakes were cold from fridge so cream in the cakes was There were no more small tasty affordable snacks like the crab cakes of tandoori salmon or tatty etc Pity You lost 15 customers who went to eat elsewhere daily for 3 days , location
164403,Strand Palace Hotel, The bedroom was basic No air con apart from an electric plug in fan inside the wardrobe No mini bar or fridge Walls are are of poor quality We woke up on numerous occasion from hearing people walking past talking or the closing of doors This hotel needs better sound proofing Unpleasant musty smell in the corridors A makeover would not go a miss , The reception area staff and location are the only things going for this hotel 
164404,Strand Palace Hotel, the price of breakfast was 19 which was a disgrace and the prices in the caf that was part of the hotel was even worse 2 50 for a slice of toast ridicules We will definitely not be using the hotel again,No Positive
164405,Strand Palace Hotel, Great location close to the Savoy Hotel and river Thames , The room was too hot there is no air circulation it was one of the hottest days in London I should have asked for a fan No air conditioning 
164406,Strand Palace Hotel, We booked a cosy double and it certainly was cosy Not much room to move around or get ready but we managed There was also only 2 powerpoint sockets in the room Could ve done with another 2 or 3 Would definately book this hotel again because of the location and it s good value for money although I wouldn t book a cosy room again , Excellent location and helpful staff Food amazing Gin Bar was lovely We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
164407,Strand Palace Hotel, The noise when trying to sleep, Booked a cosy room so was expecting a compact room which was fine costly but again knew I was paying for the location Had poor nights sleep though due to street noise shutters on windows but didn t seem to help noise of pipes and stream of light coming in through the door Staff were fine no complaints 
164408,Strand Palace Hotel, Price , Excellent location and the staff were friendly and efficient Small room standard single but ok for me Tea and coffee facilities and the wifi was very good at 30 50Mbbs Good bathroom 
164409,Strand Palace Hotel, Didn t agree with the 12 5 service charge added to bill I realise it was optional but you don t always look at your bill in detail just the end figure then you have paid it without wanting too ,No Positive
164410,Strand Palace Hotel, The Room First Allocated was the size of a Janitor cupboard with a shower that due to age and decay would not switch on We asked for a change of room and got one which was a vast improvement The quality of the food in the carvery was unbelievable and not in a good way We planned to eat breakfast in the hotel but after our first experience with their best efforts at cooking we wisely decided to eat out , Location is brilliant
164411,Strand Palace Hotel, The room that we had in the first night was the smallest for two persons that I have ever experienced With paying some extra we got a better room for the following two nights That was a decent one However because there was no air conditioning it was hot to sleep If you are reserving a room in this hotel better to check what kind of room it is , The location is good in the City area The breakfast is good 
164412,Strand Palace Hotel, As above, The room was ridiculously small You should not have to climb over your partner to get in and out of bed Nowhere to put anything not even a glass of water
164413,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was OK The fruit was awful but the rest was edible , Room was nice It was a good size especially for a big city hotel bed was very comfortable No AC so it was a little hot but there was a fan The hotel is very centrally located so we walked to everything There are lots of nice restaurants and pubs right around the corner Plus it is in the Theater district so if you had tickets to a show you could walk to it 
164414,Strand Palace Hotel, I was disappointed that as someone who has stayed at the SP when visiting London on previous occasions no recognition was allowed for that I was placed in perhaps the worst room in the whole place on the top floor looking out at scaffold and workmen able to look in No mention was made of the early morning banging I was out during the day evening No doubt had I been a name of influence more consideration would have been given to room allocation , The location of the SP is perfect really for West End shows and a good percentage of the history of London 
164415,Strand Palace Hotel, Hotel needs some renovation so it is more business style than leisure , good place to stay for one or two nights for business good location and easy to accommodate And very good price for such location and service 
164416,Strand Palace Hotel, Reception staff unfriendly Told when booking in room was a small double No indication on line it was a small double Offered upgrade when booking in but subsequently none available Room suitable for single person only no bedside table partner had to climb over to get in and out Workmen right outside the window on scaffolding drillling and banging so had to keep shutters closed Room not suitable for purpose All the above mentioned did not represent value for money at 200 per night At no time were we given prior warning and an opportunity to upgrade in advance if this was the case we would have done so, Housekeeping very helpful when i needed an iron Breakfast good lots of choice
164417,Strand Palace Hotel, Old hotel that needs renovation Small rooms with low ceiling completely inadequate comfort level to price Small single bed The view from the window towards patio with construction work I could also hear the people staying in the neighbouring room at all times , Breakfast OK
164418,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very attentive and their service was top class The morning breakfasts had a wide range to choose from The room was clean and comfortable We would definitely stay there again 
164419,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very small It was more like a cell with sliding shutters instead of curtains It was the noisiest London hotel we have ever stayed in , The downstairs was pleasant
164420,Strand Palace Hotel, There was a very long delay checking in as the card machines were not working this caused a huge delay in checking in and carrying on with our business activities , The rooms were very nice clean and comfortable Staff were helpful and friendly Breakfast had a variety of choices hot and cold which was very good 
164421,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to use shower for cold water as cold tap in bath did not work Some of the breakfast items are left out to long and dry up , Location to work place was close 
164422,Strand Palace Hotel, Being changed twice for the room I booked and not being refunded, Nothing I was charged twice for the room I had booked thought booking Com and now going to take legal action against them
164423,Strand Palace Hotel, Common courtesy is to notify your guests that there will be screaming electric saws just outside their window first thing in the morning If I had known I would be assaulted by this noise I would NOT have reserved I cannot recommend this hotel while it is still under repair , Excellent location
164424,Strand Palace Hotel, As a twin room the area around the beds was a little snug Perfectly fine for overnight but would have been irritating on a longer stay , The left luggage facility was a real bonus Even though it was our day to check out did not need to carry heavy backpacks as we did the sights Made our last day a real pleasure 
164425,Strand Palace Hotel, Unfriendly and unhelpful staff horrible coffee very expensive for what you get no conditioner very small gym Thin doors could hear everything going on in corridor and room across hall No central heating or AC No wheelchair access stairs only into hotel , easy access to conference
164426,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed had a very firm matres and you could hear next door, The location was very good walking distance from main attractions rooms were not to the standard that you would expect for 4 but it is the facilities that give it the rating The staff were excellent The food was also very good
164427,Strand Palace Hotel, It could have been cheaper but realistically for the location the price was good for London The bathroom was small and some of the hotel interior is a bit dated although the room itself was fresh , The staff gave me a quiet room as requested It was very clean and the location is fantastic Plenty of local restaurants and bars Lashings of hot water 
164428,Strand Palace Hotel, Room too small for two medium sized but elderly adults Lavatory shower room very small Room situated at rear therefore subject to delivery collection noises at 6 00 am Otherwise quite quiet Food and service good, Location centre of the west end availability of taxis
164429,Strand Palace Hotel, During early check in I was placed in an area that was being remodeled The area was noisy and it was difficult for me to get rest The rooms were small and not very comfortable , Proximity to LSE
164430,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, We loved the personal touch of the gift left for my husbands birthday and the birthday wishes on our arrival by staff all of the staff where wonderful it made our stay extra special as we where attending the Queens Royal garden party at Buckingham palace and to exit the hotel and have Philip and Marco looking after us was wonderful Thank you all for making our time at Strand Palace hotel most memorable We will always book there when ever we visit in the future as we have in the past we have never been disappointed 
164431,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was 250 for an executive suite and it was smaller than your advertised standard room Terrible room for the cost 18 for a single gin and tonic , Not a lot
164432,Strand Palace Hotel, Not a thing , The concierge services were outstanding Any questions were quickly answered and excellent suggestions to make our trip better Staff were quick to assist us at anytime Check in out was pain free Location location location great for walking about in central London 
164433,Strand Palace Hotel, Room extremely tiny With the three pieces of luggage you had to constantly move things around It Looked out over ongoing construction Adequate for sleeping as the hotel location was excellent You wouldn t spend any time in the room , It is all about location The Strand Palace was perfect for sightseeing getting to the Tube eating and shows Walking distance to all the travelers needs 
164434,Strand Palace Hotel, the size of the room and bathroom curtains , the bathroom fittings were dated bathroom curtains are dated these days the price was high for the size of the room it was small
164435,Strand Palace Hotel, We made the mistake of having a drink in the Gin Palace It was advertised as happy hour two for one but unfortunately and not advertised there was no happy hour on Friday nights Two very mediocre gin and tonics 33 A bit extortionate even for London , As we checked in the receptionist spotted it was my birthday the next day When we got back there was wine and chocolates in the room as a gift from the managment 
164436,Strand Palace Hotel, Walls were a little thin so you could hear hairdryers TVs in other rooms , Convenient location good to have late breakfast and check out on Sunday Very helpful staff 
164437,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was like being in a prison cell It was clean but very small and we couldn t open the windows as the view we had was of scaffolding from floor to the top off the hotel court yard which made us feel very claustrophobic and not wanting to spend time in our room , Great location The hotel staff were professional and friendly Great selection on the breakfast menu 
164438,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing loved it all , Staff were very helpful I asked if the 2 rooms offered had low level shower was offered appropriate room immediately Was warned about Street noise but as l rely on hearing aids this was not a problem 
164439,Strand Palace Hotel, Only negative is that there was no dresser or drawer storage in our room Our rate was good so not really complaining about that too much , Location of this hotel could not be better easy to walk to many attractions Bus stop is extremely close tube stations within easy walking distance and cabs available constantly Staff friendly and helpful 
164440,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed It was tiny and pushed up To the wall It should at least be king size I had to shuffle down the bed to get to the toilet and get a drink of water Even banged my head on the wall , Cleanliness
164441,Strand Palace Hotel, That I wanted to change date of hotel stay because my daughter had different hols to me and I didn t realise I sent 3 emails to them they didn t reply and yourselves tried rang bit they wouldn t budge ,No Positive
164442,Strand Palace Hotel, In the cheap place not the hotel dining room I liked the quality of the porridge and coffee the service and the fact that I did not need to book in advance , On arrival I was told that if I booked breakfast that evening it would be cheaper than booking it in the morning Then I discovered that there is an alternative breakfast place without leaving the hotel where breakfast was very much cheaper I ate my breakfast in the cheap place and it was excellent 
164443,Strand Palace Hotel, On arrival we were told the room we had requested was unavailable and could not be provided for us as the hotel was overbooked After we complained the very helpful manageress sorted us out with a very adequate alternative Annoyed however that booking com had offered the rooms online when obviously the hotel didn t actually have them We realise it can take time for the system to update but we had booked over 24 hrs ahead The hotel is rather dated and in need of a facelift modernisation to ask the current tariff for a room , Breakfast was v good and all the staff we met were v polite and helpful
164444,Strand Palace Hotel, Only negative was that the tea served at breakfast awful and provided in your room not very nice , Welcoming staff Comfortable room and bed Public areas clean and modern Breakfast fine 
164445,Strand Palace Hotel, Walls are quite thin if you are a light sleeper pack an earplug , Comfortable room excellent location cleanness helpful staff Would stay here again anytime 
164446,Strand Palace Hotel, To do little variation for breakfast three days the same in my case if iwould stay at atrand once again i may have breakfast only on day since now i know that there are few food options, This what i didnt like Very noise Special when neiborgh room close and open doors And their mobile rings very noise at night in addition the light from the hall come under the door making the room like ther is a light on 
164447,Strand Palace Hotel, I ordered omelette for breakfast and it was the worst omelette I have ever had bacon was reallky rubbery but tea and coffee was piping hot also toast was really nice, Excellent staff at reception and in the restaurants I asked for our rooms to be close together and near the lifts and my requests were put into place without any problems Food in the Indian restaurant was really good 
164448,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Although we had a basic double the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was fine with a shower and bath The staff were very efficient and friendly 
164449,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, There was not much to complain about here The room was smallish but not much different from other European hotels While we appreciated the hotel buffet breakfast I probably would not book it again and try to find alternative cafes It is a great idea for a business traveller however 
164450,Strand Palace Hotel, I booked a single room 837 which was absolutely tiny and was positioned next to an industrial fan so I requested to be moved The single room they moved me to was bigger and definitely less noisy , Staff were extremely helpful and polite
164451,Strand Palace Hotel, 2 defects for maintenance ROOM 519 the left hand bed headboard light had a trapped wire hanging below the fitting and the connection to the shower electric towel rail had been taped up health and safety issues The only other point was when approaching our room on saturday afternoon we witnessed the housekeeping supervisor virtually shouting at a member of staff saying she was not doing her job properly and implying she could be dismissed When we said we wanted to go into our room the supervisor told us abruptly to return in 15 minutes surely this matter should have been dealpt with behind closed doors not in front of guests I found our room on both friday and saturday excellent with beds correctly made one of the issues being shouted to the housekeeper by the supervisor Other than this i found everything excellent and will definately stay here again next time we return to London , Quietness of room very friendly attentive and professional staff quality of all the food especially the restaurant location and services offered 
164452,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was cramped and small for two people I would of expected more for the price it would of been 19 00 each for 2nights for breakfast so would of been a extra 36 00 on top of 445 00 we had already paid , London
164453,Strand Palace Hotel, Room service was poor forgotten items chicken salad delivered without the chicken no one returned with it despite telling us they would my wife ate alone as I waited No butter with toast cutlery missing salad under hot silver dome so all limp and ruined on arrival Disappointing as we ordered room service so a treat , Location clean room attentive staff
164454,Strand Palace Hotel, I requested a street view but unfortunately we were stuck with a two by six window that faced on to scaffolding and we had to rely on electric lighting most of the time this let the experience down considerably two out of ten because of this cheers, Food excellent breakfast second to none
164455,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff needed training Poor English in restaurant Room very small bed against wall No light above bathroom mirror difficult shaving Extracter fan in toilet not working Queues for breakfast Bit of a bun fight getting food Definitely not four star Would not stay there again , Situation Cleanliness
164456,Strand Palace Hotel, The staff at reception could be a bit more welcoming a bit gruff on check in , The room was clean well furnished and relatively large for London city centre hotels The hotel has been refurbished and the bathroom was modern and well appointed
164457,Strand Palace Hotel, Worst coffee ever for 14 pounds extra charge for expreso elevator quite crowds forget about check out you better do fast check out dropping key and hope all is fine ni iron on room on call , Only Location 
164458,Strand Palace Hotel, We couldn t check in on arrival just before 3pm and waited with a free tea coffee until the room was ready as my Mum was tired after our journey Then the room was made up as a double not a twin as requested The beds were also quite hard , Staff were friendly and attentive They even left a bottle of wine and chocolates in the room when they found out it was my Mum s birthday 
164459,Strand Palace Hotel, The shower was excellent a good size but the bathroom overall a little small Whilst everything was OK I think the hotel price is bordering on a little too high even for London as compared to other similar accommodation , The hotel location on The Strand is ideal for all the London evening venues such as theatres and Covent Garden The overall room as was very good size and the bed very comfortable 
164460,Strand Palace Hotel, Maps of London were 2 for the price they could hand out free maps like every other hotel in London and the concierge was a bit snooty and wrong on his advice Bar very expensive but not out of line with central London, On check in they did not have my size room available so they put me in an executive single instead of a cozy double While it made the bed smaller I got breakfast included and a 15 voucher to use at the restaurant bar so it was good for me Location is excellent multiple tube lines within walking distance as are most theatres Great shower 
164461,Strand Palace Hotel, We had an issue with the radiator in our room in the middle of the night but management dealt with it to our satisfaction , Location was excellent Food at Indian restaurant at the hotel was amazing Breakfast was very good Service was brilliant 
164462,Strand Palace Hotel, I cannot remember having a smaller room or double bed ever in a London hotel Also bed very hard and uncomfortable and this was supposed to have been an upgraded executive room I dread to think what the standard rooms were like I also think being asked for an extra 20 to check into a room earlier than 2pm two and half hours when the room is already available is not good ,No Positive
164463,Strand Palace Hotel, How this hotel has the nerve to charge what it charges is beyond me Perhaps the location is enough to con people into thinking it is lixury but believe me it is not Our room was an internal room looking onwards towards a structure of scaffold and rubbish Anybody could have climbed in through the window as ithat area is obviously accessible otherwise the scaffold or whatever it was wouldn t be there The room felt like a student halls room dark enclosed tires shabby and uncomfortable and had definitely seen better days It certainly seems that if you book with booking com you are punished by being given the worst possible rooms because I certainly hope this was a one off does hole room I would not recommend this hotel Pay a bit more and shop around, The girl on the desk was training but was efficient and happy 
164464,Strand Palace Hotel, The Gin Palace although very well furnished and comfortable would be a more inviting place and somewhere you might stay longer if it wasn t so pricey most gins 12 14 a go glass of wine 8 75 Shame,No Positive
164465,Strand Palace Hotel, COSY ROOM WAS MORE LIKE A BOX WITH A SMALL BED WHICH WAS UP AGAINST THE WALL MAKING IT VERY HARD TO GET OUT WITHOUT DISTURBING MY WIFE THE ONLY WINDOW LOOKED OUT ON SCAFFOLDING SO HAD TO KEEP SHUTTERS CLOSED ALL DAY,No Positive
164466,Strand Palace Hotel, I couldn t check in at the mentioned time Had to wait for additional two hours for the room to get ready The room was on the 9th floor and was too noisy because of the undergoing works The shower water temperature was not hot enough I left my room at 9 00 came back at 15 00 room service was not done Annoying sounds going on and off in the middle of the night from the heater 2 stars are more than enough for this hotel ,No Positive
164467,Strand Palace Hotel, The bar in the hotel gave me a double martini when I hadn t asked for one and then charged me accordingly , Central location for theatre land good restaurants nearby staff pleasant and helpful
164468,Strand Palace Hotel, I liked it all , The room was the perfect size for one person en suite bathroom excellent Internet outstanding location near transportation and major attractions eg Covent Garden Westminster Abbey National Gallery 
164469,Strand Palace Hotel, Cosy was a good description of the room very compact especially the bathroom perhaps a little too boxlike but clean and tidy Too much time spent waiting for lifts both up and down Only 2 operating of the 3 installed through the stay and with 8 floors and 50 rooms on each it was sometimes necessary to go through 3 passes to get a lift Hopefully the one locked off was temporary Bar snacks were small expensive and took a while to be delivered, Room clean and tidy nice quiet at night despite location in heart of theatre land Breakfast was terrific constantly replacing the food and not allowing it to become cold or tired looking Very soft and comfortable bed
164470,Strand Palace Hotel, Requested quiet room Noisy building works outside room dark as window covered by scaffolding Changed room Could only offer main road Hot stuffy as no air con Opened windows but major traffic noise fumes Overall very disappointing , Location
164471,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was like a kettle market Shower cubicle small Porter walked with me for cases yet I carried them , Great location fir the theatre Great cocktail bar
164472,Strand Palace Hotel, The noise hardly got any sleep Which was a shame because we have stayed her 3 times before and not had a problem It was staff and deliveries chatting As I say if we had been on a higher floor we wouldn t have heard it We did ask to move but hotel was full , The location is brilliant the hotel and food is first class 
164473,Strand Palace Hotel, Location of the room and there was a waste line which was concealed behind a wall in the room so there was always the sound of a tap running water Was generally a lot of noise around the room Check Clerk mixed up my name with another guest and allocated me to wrong room which had a later check out date that took forever to change Asked for a late check out after a 4 day stay and had to pay 10 pounds per hour extra Then got locked out after 12 00 noon as the Clerk ever extended the access to the room Apologies with no consideration, Great location Easy access to theatres restaurants etc
164474,Strand Palace Hotel, Directions to the room were not clear at all I have no idea how they number the rooms but it s like a maze I wandered around various corridors for ages I objected to being charged 20 for early check in I didn t request it it was just that the room was ready when I arrived there s a difference As usual single rooms were stuck at the back with a view of 4 walls 4 90 for a cappuccino in the bar was a bit much and lukewarm Bathroom was very dated all the fittings were tarnished , Breakfast was good value in comparison to other hotels and there was everything you could possibly want on the buffet Comfortable bed and room very clean Most of the staff were excellent I was able to leave my luggage there free of charge after check out as my flight was in the evening 
164475,Strand Palace Hotel, The bar area wasn t so tidy tables and bar needed a bit of a wipe , Lovely treatment at reception checking in and out the man in foyer was very helpful 
164476,Strand Palace Hotel, The double bed was close up to the wall so made it only accessible from one side or the bottom You had to be quite agile , Excellent position for central London 
164477,Strand Palace Hotel, The bedroom and bathroom were extremely small with very little room to move around The quilt on the bed was far too small for two people to share , The breakfast selection was good apart from the choice of cereal 
164478,Strand Palace Hotel, A device charge was adders to the meal we had without telling us It was more than we would have left as a tip as it was a self service restaurant We then had two cocktails in the bar and they added yet another service charge for one drink , Small but nice room Value for money
164479,Strand Palace Hotel, My cosy room on this occasion was much more cosy than previous stays Info from computers at Reception always seem to confuse the staff there , Location Complete and fuss free breakfast 
164480,Strand Palace Hotel, Only a few rooms were marked as executive rooms and appeared larger on the floor plan Our room was supposed to be executive but it seemed to be an ordinary room with a few extras squeezed in Not happy about this When queried at reception I did not get an explanation just a curt your room is executive , Loved the executive breakfast room The hotel position was excellent for visiting the sights and nightlife 
164481,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, This such a fantastic hotel in a wonderful location Everything is in walking distance such as Covent Garden Leicester Square etc so there s no need to catch the tune This was our second time staying here this year and will always be our hotel of choice 
164482,Strand Palace Hotel, One of the three lifts were out of order which made waiting times for the lift quite lengthy and my bedroom shutters were broken, Great location really good staff 
164483,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to ask to move rooms because of noisy air con unit outside first room Pizza I ordered up for room service was very average Don t like fixed shower heads, Room clean Easy to operate TV Water nice and hot Staff pleasant
164484,Strand Palace Hotel, Great location The hotel was clean and comfortable although the decor needed a refresh and the room was small I probably wouldn t stay there again ,No Positive
164485,Strand Palace Hotel, Bedroom mediocre for a four star hotel Lifts very slow which prompted me to use the stairs healthier at least Couldn t get coffee at the bar early in the morning and was directed to breakfast so I left the hotel for a nearby coffee shop where I could sip my coffee and read in comfort , Location was excellent and the lounge facility comfortable Staff were very friendly 
164486,Strand Palace Hotel, Room tiny Bed hard window locked shut so room was stuffy Renovations occurring and I wasn t told Room did not appear to have been well cleaned as I found rusty screws on the floor near bed , Location and staff were good 
164487,Strand Palace Hotel, Stay here often Tried booking direct on Strand s Website but I got an error that booking was currently not possible Went to booking com and got a room immediately Negative Room s windows were screwed shut and could not open to draft out the hot and moist room Construction site was blocking the entire window view Some strange motor or plumbing sound was happebing through wall of bathroom that woke me up several times during my three night stay Reception staff at checkin was not very warm and not welcoming and appeared if I was bothering him during checkin Condition of Rooms Carpets in Halls is not 4x Star Outdated Room 159 is tiny 6m Sq and for The price of 180 per Night too expensive , Positive Room was very clean and kept clean 
164488,Strand Palace Hotel, Small poky room for an executive room Coffee machine not working and not labelled which coffee pod was which anyway When speaking to the staff it was like everything was too much as they were busy, The hotel room was darkened by scaffolding at the tiny window We moved rooms after we expressed that this was not good enough for an executive room The coffee machine did not work so we went to sainsbury s for a jar of coffee There was no bathrobe provided and they said they had run out of them I have stayed in better travel lodges for a lot less money and a better service 
164489,Strand Palace Hotel, The length of time queuing to check in , My room was opposite the lift Nice and easy to find And plenty of food locations nearby for dinner and lunch 
164490,Strand Palace Hotel, Scaffolding directly outside window Double bed against wall so clambering over partner to get in out 1 towel in bathroom for 2 occupants Paper thin walls heard next door all night, No positive commment
164491,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very small with no air conditioning so got very hot at night Windows said they opened but had in fact been screwed shut , Check in and out were excellent and staff polite and helpful 
164492,Strand Palace Hotel, I was put in a single room on the first floor directly over the entrance on the main road Very noisy and uncomfortable requested to be moved which the hotel did accommodate at 12am , Location
164493,Strand Palace Hotel, Had a fire in the basement while we were there and had to wait outside in the cold for 1 5 hours It s not the hotel s fault but it was a special occasion and we were never approached by the hotel staff for any kind of compensation , We can t stress enough how great the location of this hotel is Walked the whole time to Covent Garden and Soho There s a central bus stop across from the hotel that you can get anywhere with and the tube is a 5 minute walk Perfect location and really nice hotel 
164494,Strand Palace Hotel, Overall interior of hotel needs updating looking a bit worn inside old wood paneling old carpeting that looks dirty Prices a bit high for value even with AAA discount I found better discounts later on but it was too late to change reservation No breakfast included in price , Room itself was clean bathroom modern and clean Room also good space for two beds two people and suitcases 
164495,Strand Palace Hotel, Construction work happening and was very noisy including plumbing noise Only was able to sleep for 5 5 hours before the construction work started Staff offered me 20 off my next stay however nothing for this one , Location is great staff friendly
164496,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel and staff were brilliant Very helpful and cheery staff Breakfast was lovely so much choice Location brilliant as easy access to everywhere Rooms clean and modern My sister and I had great time celebrating her 50th birthday Definitely will stay again 
164497,Strand Palace Hotel, Quite a long queue for check in but staff very polite and helpful Scallfolding outside the window made the room very dark , Bed very comfortable and our room was very quiet at night we were on floor 6 at the rear of the hotel 
164498,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff at the door dont even help to carry lift the luggages As they dont have a ramp you need to carry it on the stares Even leaving the bags when we check out theres another stares the staff just walking beside us dont even ask if we need help , The hotel near to shops
164499,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was too hard to sleep Like concrete Didn t like queuing for breakfast Would have liked veggie sausages , Staff and surroundings excellent Hotel amazing Loved it 
164500,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast lukewarm and restaurant seemed disorganised Tables not being cleared quickly , Room good size comfortable bed all the expected facilities 
164501,Strand Palace Hotel, Single room slightly bigger than Harry Potter s birthplace Under the stairs and a lovely view of a scaffolding erection outside the bedroom window , Polite staff Clean Hotel
164502,Strand Palace Hotel, Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night We had to evacuate for an hour Things happen but they never communicated to tenants about what was going on It was handled poorly and in an unprofessional manner , Some staff were great others were unfriendly and unhelpful 
164503,Strand Palace Hotel, The fire alarm we had to leave the building and wait over an hour to get back in it was not good, It is a lovely hotel and the staff were friendly
164504,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel was old and it would show on some parts The standard room was quite small and I m not sure how it s got 4 stars though Remember to bring a power adapter or you ll have to buy one , Location was excellent The executive rooms are quite all right 
164505,Strand Palace Hotel, Room tiny especially bathroom toilet jammed between bath and wall Noisy machinery outside room If this was an executive room I d hate to see a standard room Not what I expect for 250 a night , Breakfast excellent staff friendly helpful Excellent location for Covent Garden and theatreland 
164506,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms are not air conditioned so you re somewhat stuck with the unfashionable option of opening the window if you find the room too warm as we did when we arrived This also lets in the street noise The bathroom was perfectly functional but felt a little dated As is often the case with these larger places we found a large variation in the water temperature between morning and evening While it was not cold in the morning I couldn t get as hot a shower as my partner had managed the evening before Therefore I would suggest if a hot rather than comfortably warm shower is your preference wash before you go to bed rather than after you get up in the morning We were unfortunately disturbed by a housekeeper at around 9 30am We hadn t hung a do not disturb sign out as we had assumed that given it was our check out day and check out was at noon it was unlikely that the room would be attended early In big hotels this kind of thing sometimes happens but if you fancy a lie in it might be worth putting that sign out to ensure no one comes knocking , This is our second stay at the Strand Palace Hotel in the last few years Both were pleasant comfortable stays The hotel is vast some 780 rooms and all are up to the same standard while they re certainly not top of the range they are perfectly comfortable and come with everything you might wish for Our room was front facing looking down from the 3rd floor to The Strand This lead it to be somewhat noisy The Strand never really gets quiet even over night so we were thankful for the good thick windows and shutters rather than curtains which helped to keep both noise and light out The bed typically of this kind of hotel two singles zipped together was large and comfortable There were tea and coffee making facilities and the TV had plenty of channels The location of the hotel could not be better for access to central London nightlife bars tourist attractions and the West End This also means there is access to a wide range of restaurants to take breakfast lunch and dinner within a short walking distance so you need not be tied down to the hotel s own offerings That said there is a good selection of in room dining options with a more modest 24 hour menu if you just can t be bothered to go out one night As we had an afternoon in London planned on our first day we were grateful for the prompt check in at 2pm although if you do arrive on the dot of 2 then expect to queue for a few minutes and following a late night before our last day we were very happy with the 12noon check out Additionally as we had spent nothing extra during our stay we found the rapid check out just drop your keys through a letterbox very convenient 
164507,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms shabby Views poor Lighting in rooms very poor to do hair make up etc Bathrooms very cramped Check in long queues Overall reception area poor Dated and scruffy looking Not a welcoming area , Location excellent
164508,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was ideally situated for our stay with comfortable beds and the breakfast was of good quality The staff were polite and helpful Raymond the concierge deserves a special thanks as I had a problem with Madame Tussaud s that he resolved 
164509,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to queue to book in noisy workmen and ugly view of scaffolding out of window walls very thin so woken by neighbour having shower at 6 am , Great location clean excellent breakfast
164510,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was unbelievably tiny Breakfast was poor For a vegetarian I was ill served The fruit salad was tasteless and made with much unripe fruit I doubt if the kitchen tasted it to check Cereal selection was so limited Coffee was insipid So you can see I was not impressed , Only location Staff were helpful 
164511,Strand Palace Hotel, The scaffolding right outside our window, The room we were given to begin with was not good enough for the amount paid We asked to move and they relocated us so that was good
164512,Strand Palace Hotel, I really like hotel Some areas need refurbishment in corridors upstairs for example, The cosy rooms are small but you know that when you book We had lovely food served in bar at 11pm on Tuesday night This was excellent service
164513,Strand Palace Hotel, Lifts were poor 2 3 out of order for a time Leaks to the ceiling showing it s age a little Although engineers working on problems straight away , Location of the hotel perfect for us a short walk to the themes Leicester square and Charing cross station Breakfast staff and service was amazing beds were comfy and room very clean 
164514,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was a bit on the small side but not a major issue as only used to sleep in , Great location only 15 min stroll to Westminster and right next to Covent Garden Good breakfast choice Able to leave cases at hotel beforehand and after checking out to allow us to go out sightseeing without dragging cases around 
164515,Strand Palace Hotel, Noise from the adjoining room Music loud talking and banging doors until 3 00am on one night Also a strong smell of cigarette smoke from this room , Location and the breakfast Friendly staff at reception 
164516,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was on the small side with no view, Great location for the West End Theatres Covent Garden and sight seeing along the Thames We only ate breakfast and some bar snacks but the quality was good
164517,Strand Palace Hotel, Construction work outside the window of the room wass extremely noisy and disruptive The work started early on Monday morning and woke us This disruption spoiled what would have been a pleasant stay ,No Positive
164518,Strand Palace Hotel, No view from the window just the back of the hotel roof air con units Bathroom was very cold mainly due to the draughty windows and no heater , Great location and friendly staff Efficient check in and check out 
164519,Strand Palace Hotel, Small gripe the pillows were harder than we re used to or like Think that the plates should be warmed , The location was perfect close to the theatre Covent Garden and lots of other amenities The staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was very clean Lots of choice at breakfast 
164520,Strand Palace Hotel, We choose a Cosy room because we didn t need much space and were planning to spend our time out and about We had seen the pictures and did appreciate that the bed was against the wall We didn t think this would be a problem but didn t appreciate that for the person next to the wall it would be difficult to get in or out of bed without disrupting the other My impression was that it was a single room with a double bed put in it Overall perhaps a little too small but that is our mistake we had seen the pictures D cor is showing signs of age throughout Largely well maintained it is showing its age as looking dated rather than poorly maintained or poor quality Gin Palace prices are a bit high at c 15 for a G T , Very very friendly staff great Gin Palace bar with excellent choice and service excellent location room and bathroom clean although bathroom showing wear and tear Good value stay for Central London in school holidays 
164521,Strand Palace Hotel, I thought for the price we paid for the Executive Room it would have been a bit better The room had scaffolding outside although I understand that the hotel needs to be maintained it felt a bit unsafe as the window lock where broken The bathroom was clean but a bit shabby , Located in the middle of the Strand great for the West End and theaters The linen and towels where clean and fresh The staff where very nice and attentive and overall appearance was very nice
164522,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was described as cosy but it would be more accurately described as small and almost claustrophobic That may be what I booked but if do it was inadvertent Definitely too cramped , The location was great and the breakfast was excellent 
164523,Strand Palace Hotel, I didn t like the knock on the door at 9 and 10 check out was at 12 as I hadn t got in till 6 am Next time I ll know to put on the do not disturb , Location was fantastic as I was seeing Lion King There are local pubs and lots of restaurants in the area Walking distance to Cov Gardens etc I d definitely stay again
164524,Strand Palace Hotel, there was no fridge in our room something we have come to expect in good hotels as the normal we were surprised we did not have one, loved the location ideal for our planned schedule
164525,Strand Palace Hotel, 2 lifts out of order that was pretty crap , The room was excellent for once the online publicity pictures were accurate The single bedroom was more than comfortable with excellent facilities Best Blackout Blinds I ve ever had in a Hotel I am planning to book again for my Christmas Vacation 
164526,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , The room was silent whoopee staff so pleasant Comfort all the way hey and so close to all the major sights The local restaurants of every nation were on the doorstep 
164527,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , The room was cosy and comfortable the fixtures were sufficiently modern and the place was very clean What I loved the most was the central location It gives easy access to numerous entertainment options and tourist attractions For a hotel in such an excellent location it is quite reasonably priced and the service was exceptional 
164528,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel needs renovation We had an inner room with window but it would be better if there hadn t been one Two out of three main elevators were not working , The hotel is perfectly located and this is what matters most After all you shouldn t spend time in the hotel room while in London 
164529,Strand Palace Hotel, Room still slightly small but didn t really matter for one night stay , Upgraded and the bed was most comfortable also added discounts Ideally situated for our theatre visit 
164530,Strand Palace Hotel, Tired very tired rooms three lifts with one out of action for over a month Evening meal steak was terrible , Reception staff and restaurant for breakfast
164531,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , Liked the very helpful friendly and lovely atmosphere Full of life and energy Didn t opt for breakfast this time but will with my next stay Very quickly found theatre tickets Will be back on my next trip to London 
164532,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The location is great close to the city and close to the west end all of which are walkable The staff are also friendly and helpful I will definitely be back 
164533,Strand Palace Hotel, I wish the price were a bit lower though I recognize this is a very expensive city I would be much more comfortable paying closer to 150 160 than the roughly 200 I did pay per night , I like almost everything about this hotel There personnel are friendly the concierge is excellent the hotel is extremely well located and all the services were just very well executed 
164534,Strand Palace Hotel, The double bed was against the wall so the person on that side me had to slide to the end of the bed to get out not so convenient especially in the middle of the night Also no side table because of the position so nowhere to put water book etc , The location was excellent and room quiet and comfortable Staff very good Would use this hotel again 
164535,Strand Palace Hotel, I have been staying at this hotel for nearly 6 years and whilst it remains a constant its prices continue to spiral up , It is central and conveniently located to where I have business
164536,Strand Palace Hotel, Can t say there was anything we didn t like , Extremely welcoming Breakfast was amazing And to top it off we had a bottle of presecco in our room for my husband birthday from the staff 
164537,Strand Palace Hotel, Kept up by noisey neighbours until early in the morning Called down and were told security couldn t hear anything so nothing was done Cozy room is indeed cozy But it has everything you need , The location and the breakfast were spot on 
164538,Strand Palace Hotel, Rather noisy as near the lift and sound insulation from corridor wasn t very efficient The view from the window was rather grim with a frosted lower half and wooden shutters for privacy but to be fair we did ask for a quiet room away from The Strand , Very comfy room with everything one would expect from a good hotel ie water provided robes slippers tea coffee making tray easy to use shower with bath mat already in room usually have to ask Was upgraded to an executive room which was a treat 
164539,Strand Palace Hotel, Not really that much to do with the hotel itself but there was construction noise in the morning considering the hotel s location that s hardly a surprise Still it s an older building and if You re very sensitive to noises from rooms around You consider bringing ear plugs I didn t find the sounds to be much of a bother but mileages vary , I loved everything about the Strand Palace maybe that s because I ve never really stayed at a higher class hotel before but from the moment the attendant opened the door and carried our luggage the couple of steps upwards to the lobby I fell in love with the place The lobby is spacious and even with bigger groups of tourists it didn t ever really feel crowded Check in went smoothly and the signs on the walls will help You find Your room quickly We had to wait a short time for breakfast on the first morning outside of the restaurant seating area but I like that better than standing around with a loaded tray hunting for a table and the buffet was really offering pretty much all you could ask for All in all I can really only recomment the Strand Palace Hotel expecially if You re sight seeing and want a lot of the major attractions of London within a bare hour walking distance Btw we had room service on our first night because we were winded from the travel and the food was just awesome 
164540,Strand Palace Hotel, Bit busy in the peak time e g Morning lifts crowded You can hear the guests in the other rooms but not too much , Great location lots of rooms Cozy room just as the name small but not cramped just cozy Not spacious but has adequate amount of storage space for 2 3 days Desk space a bit narrow but tolerable Bed comfortable 
164541,Strand Palace Hotel, Small room Could hear conversation of people in the adjacent room Window which was screwed shut looked out onto courtyard which was a building site with scaffolding and walkways right up to the window Really not value for money , Convenient venue
164542,Strand Palace Hotel, Pillows werent the best One not enough but two was too much and a tad too much traffic noise but I d defo stay again, Everything staff were very friendly hotel was clean and nicely decorated Perfect location for a theatre show Walking distance to all major tourist points We walked up to Oxford Circus shopping When I stay again I ll check out the Indian restaurant and bar 
164543,Strand Palace Hotel, It is quite expensive but I guess that is London On the second night I stayed on the 7th floor ceiling was low especially in the shower for a 6 3 man , Location was great comfortable beds quiet 
164544,Strand Palace Hotel, evening meal in the carvery was not up to much Food was cold didn t eat much and therefore worked out expensive Would not eat here again, Location was great room was comfortable staff were helpful and friendly Would stay here again
164545,Strand Palace Hotel, My room was windowless which gave me a closed in feeling , For my needs The strand Palace Hotel was ideal for my theatre night The breakfast was very good This hotel is right in the middle of a lot of attractions 
164546,Strand Palace Hotel, Let us know about the Comedy Club at the time of the booking so we could have got tickets as they were sold out by the time we discovered it , Great location National gallery and a host of theatres within a stone s throw An Indian Restaurant separate coffee shop Cocktail Bar and Comedy Club on site Lovely comfy bed powerful shower Amazingly helpful staff who couldn t do enough for you 
164547,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel presentation was good in the front reception areas but could do with some serious attention to maintenance in the room we were in on the 4th Floor The room was described as an Executive Room but we have had better quality at well known budget hotels for a lot less money , The hotel was well placed for sightseeing around London All key visitor attractions were within walkable distance The breakfast offered by the hotel was of good quality and the staff were attentive as were the front desk services staff 
164548,Strand Palace Hotel, Terrible please that needs a massive refurb and staff that actually want to help rooms are sooo small and look like something out of a museum, this hotle is a good location but that s about it
164549,Strand Palace Hotel, Building work going on outside hotel so scaffolding attached to hotel and daytime noise Minor point but TV stopped working Was soon replaced though Free Wifi wasn t great , Hotel in in an excellent location right on the Strand and close to Covent Garden and Leicester Square Very efficient check in and friendly staff 
164550,Strand Palace Hotel, Shower gel had already been opened and part used Service in restaurant at breakfast was inconsistent with no milk jug offered to us but was to others , Overall high quality of the hotel and its facilities Enjoyed Rock the Strand in evening in Lounge Bar 
164551,Strand Palace Hotel, The cosy double bedroom was poky and depressing Also no good for twin beds Realised why it was comparatively cheap Big anonymous hotel , Location brilliant The doorman 
164552,Strand Palace Hotel, Very tacky outdated hotel located in the center of one of the most touristy areas in London The Covent Garden tube station is within walking distance however is the busiest in the city so beware Not many other tube stations nearby which was somewhat of a hassle If you re looking for a more authentic low key London experience I wouldn t recommend staying here ,No Positive
164553,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast croissant was stale but this is a very minor fault, We booked a comfy room and expected it to be really small but it was very comfortable and we didn t feel squashed
164554,Strand Palace Hotel, Far too expensives for what you get Room is small and the bath system is old school and horrible There s some renovation right now so we didn t open the windows as the view on men at works during the day and the views on the construction at night is not very nice The breakfast is something rella special you have to wait to be seated more than 5 minutes until 10mn but in the same time i saw lot of tables free The breakfast system doesn t works I asked for a hot chocolate i received hot water with chocolate I didn t know London was in war with someone , The location
164555,Strand Palace Hotel, the size of the room and of the bed much too small and no bedside cabinet on one side as the bed was against the wall, the service from from the bars was very good as was the bar snacks
164556,Strand Palace Hotel, Room terribly hot as window had shutters not curtains which stopped air from open window Unhelpful info re gin palace two for one as turned out to be cocktails only Only two small milks in room , Friendly reception staff Quiet Room had everything one needed Great location for theatres Daawat Indian restaurant excellent 
164557,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was tiny Smallest I ve seen outside of Japan But it was fine for our purposes as we didn t spend a lot of time there The TV was at a right angle to the bed and impossible to watch from the bed as there was a gap of about a foot between the bed and the wall so you couldn t even sit on it sideways to watch to comfortably , The location is really excellent particularly for theatre goers The breakfast is really extensive but expensive at 18 95pp We had ours included in the booking so we used it but I highly doubt we would have paid that for what we ate

164561,Strand Palace Hotel, The room we were originally offered had a view onto another wall and had scaffolding outside with workmen banging etc We asked to be moved and they offered us the only other executive double which was better You would think the better rooms would not look out onto a wall We ate prior to going to the theatre It took 45 minutes to come and was pretty awful in quality, The location is perfect close to all the major sites and the river The room was fairly quiet considering where it was The bed was huge and very comfy There was plenty of choice at breakfast

164577,Strand Palace Hotel, No Daught beer at the 2 bars There is a sports bar on the corner of the hotel and you can book drinks to your room but not conducive to a relaxing drink returning to the hotel late , Very central location for everything in london clean with mostly friendly staff some of the breakfast crew could do with cheering up Breakfast was also very nice Room was small but adequate it was a cosy double but really only good for one person

164582,Strand Palace Hotel, We have stayed here several times and this time enjoyed a room up grade Service and cleanliness were fine as usual and the central location is ideal for visiting The only difficulties were the usual ones 1 breakfast can mean either a wait to get into the dining area or a walk in crocodile formation round to the adjacent restaurant 2 like most large hotels you won t get hot breakfast food unless you are very lucky as at best the food will be lukewarm , Accessibility speed of check in check out
164583,Strand Palace Hotel, Not much shelf space in the bathroom If hotels are serious about wanting guests to re use towels then there needs to be enough decent towel rail space to hang them on , The shutters on the windows were great to block out street noise through the night despite being on the Strand in the front of the hotel it was really quiet Breakfasts were really good with lots of choice

164586,Strand Palace Hotel, The price of drinks in the bars was extortionate 14 00 for a gin and tonic and 5 60 for an insipid cappuccino all this does is make you look elsewhere when if the prices were realistic we would have used the bars more instead we drank in other places , Hotel was very clean and staff very helpful Excellent location for sightseeing and theaters

164605,Strand Palace Hotel, A cosy double was too small including the bathroom Was fine for one person travelling for business and staying for only 2 nights however for 2 people it would have been cramped , Food in the restaurant both for breakfast and dinner was really good as was the service

164609,Strand Palace Hotel, The most disgusting treatment by reception staff Despite being surely making a reservation in advance my colleague was kicked out to another hotel as the reservation for him was canceled by booking com this is not true Moreover a cancellation fee was charged by the reason that my colleague was not arrived on the day After that we protested but the hotel does not accept their mistakes they only explained various contradictory reasons , good access
164610,Strand Palace Hotel, The room is a little bit smaller as compared to some other hotels but generally everything is great and the house keeping services are excellent , The hotel is clean and the location is great as it is right in the city centre of London 
164611,Strand Palace Hotel, We saw 4 rooms during our stay and have to say the final rooms allocated were far from perfect in comparison to what we had already seen We were a family and ideally we were requesting 2 rooms next to each other They found this combination however one room was absolutely tiny especially the bathroom with faulty faucet and the other room had a door that didn t close easily , Absolutely excellent location close to trains and buses or within walking distance of a variety of tourist attractions museums etc The restaurants on site were good breakfast was good too Overall it was good and somewhere we re likely to return to but ensure the room set up in advance

164615,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Reception staffer Stephen was a pleasure Housekeeping and concierge also lovely The bar team in the Gin Palace whilst efficient were not at all engaging Didn t detract from my overall experience though Internet in room was super fast Loved the midday checkout so practical And unlike the last time I stayed this trip I had a room right away from the Stand road and it was blissfully quiet room 916 newly renovated lovely 
164616,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was too small for the price we had to pay , I liked the colour in the room I like that the shower was cleaned and that the staff was helpful and smartly dressed especially the men at the entrance of the hotel
164617,Strand Palace Hotel, View from our room 394 was a builders site with scaffolding at our window we had to keep our wooden shutters closed all the time or we had workmen looking in at us we couldn t stay in bed after 8 30 and we couldn t have a nap in the afternoon due to the noise of the work taking place , Location staff were friendly Carvery was lovely

164623,Strand Palace Hotel, Very noisy traffic and shower cubicle very narrow , We stayed in one of the Executive rooms which were of a good size and well appointed however our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking The Strand and owing to the large amount of emergency vehicles sounding their sirens throughout the night our sleep was very disturbed Owing to this disturbance although the bed was huge and very comfortable we did not feel very refreshed when awaking I think this should be pointed out when booking and patrons should be given the opportunity to choose the location of the room front or rear 
164624,Strand Palace Hotel, I lost my hearing aid from the room The reception were completely unhelpful when I asked if a hoover bag could be located and I could check it The tables in the restaurant for breakfast were clean but sticky It was noticed that tables were only wiped with a damp cloth between sittings ,No Positive

164637,Strand Palace Hotel, We booked the 2 course carvery and whilst the carvery itself was satisfactory the dessert choice was poor and the fruit salad we chose was to say the least unadventurous I guess for the price in London it was an acceptable meal but sadly didn t live up to the level of the rest of the hotel , A pleasant place to stay for the night and very convenient for the theatre Staff were friendly and welcoming and room although a little small was clean and comfortable 
164638,Strand Palace Hotel, A slow response to our phone call when we were attempting to sort out our room when we had waited sometime at the queue in reception , On arrival to our room we discovered a twin which should have been a double Although it took some time to get through to reception it was quickly sorted and we were moved to another room and upgraded We were impressed with the way in which staff dealt with their mistake

164701,Strand Palace Hotel, The staff were came across as literally there to do a job The whole building feels dated I went to my room after a late check in unpacked got ready for bed and then noticed the window was not locked and easily lifted open and there was an adjacent window that I considered accessible The room was also cold as there was no heating other than a small plug in radiator that was giving off a bad smell There was no forewarning of either issue and when I called to swap rooms and suffer the inconvenience of having to re pack and get dressed again this was not an option A suggestion of sending up a maintenance man was put to me but it had already gone 2300 hrs I was a lone female and there was no guarantee of when he would turn up so I hardly slept a wink and am still out of sorts as a result ever since Will not be going back again ,No Positive
164702,Strand Palace Hotel, As above, Excellent location Comfortable stay I stayed in a standard twin Comfortable clean and functional but didn t feel special There was no bath the lights were very dim which made the room look a bit gloomy and there was no complimentary hot chocolate Perfectly adequate for staying for business reasons but I wouldn t have booked this place for a romantic trip away The best thing about this hotel is the gentleman who helped us with our baggage in the lobby He was very friendly helpful and approachable

164725,Strand Palace Hotel, I did not like the look of the eggs or the bacon so didn t eat these I wish you had the little individual pots of Marmite , The room was very comfy and the staff were very polite I have been before on business which is why I came back

164727,Strand Palace Hotel, Room slightly small , Plenty of staff in every department Quick service in bar for food and drink Plenty of room in foyer area Buffet breakfast quality excellent and very efficiently presented 
164728,Strand Palace Hotel, Could have been a handwash in the bathroom not just soap or shower stuff , We upgraded to a standard double for an extra 10 at the suggestion of the receptionist who booked us in when she explained that the cosy double would have been right up against one wall so difficult for one person to get out of bed without disturbing the other 
164729,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast more reasonable priced which is why I opted out, Very helpful and friendly staff especially Mitko and and older door man who was in afternoon evening
164730,Strand Palace Hotel, Our bathroom was freezing we had a faulty electrical socket and our breakfasts on Sunday were appalling , Staff friendly and courteous and the main areas of the hotel were warm and very comfortable

164732,Strand Palace Hotel, I would never stay here again We were not able to check in for several hours as the computers were down The lobby was cold and full of very unhappy guests It was January and the heating in the room did not work but the staff did not inform us of this upon check in We requested a room change but were told we could not because of the special booking price A tiny portable heater was provided which made no difference The duvets were paper thin more for summer than winter No chance we would ever be confortable in the cold dreary room We requested to cancel our booking so we could find a more suitable hotel The hotel said we must call Booking com They said only the hotel could refund our money I offered a compromise and pay for one night of a two night booking The manager refused So we left the hotel with our bags on a cold rainy day and found a decent place to stay 430 wasted They can keep my money I will keep my dignity , Absolutely Nothing 
164733,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms small and very dated Paying for the name and location clearly Bar too small with insufficient seating Gin bar service was very slow, Restaurant Staff were friendly and efficient Communal areas were reasonable Proximity to Covent Garden Theatres and attractions is good
164734,Strand Palace Hotel, Hotel was a bit tired looking and the bathroom was in desperate need of modernization Hotel and Gin Palace were a bit lacking in atmosphere Hotel is perfectly adequate but I think with a bit more effort it could be very special Not sure if I care for shutters instead of curtains in the bedroom That s possibly just a personal preference , Location was excellent Bed was large clean and comfortable Tea making facilities were good and bathroom toiletries also good Reception staff very nice For the location we would go back but I would ask if they have a room that has been refurbished if possible 
164735,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a room with a particularly noisy shower air in the pipes and a radiator that was broken However staff were apologetic and helpful , Excellent facilities in a truly fantastic location Hotel interior although dated was beautifully clean Staff generally helpful and polite 
164736,Strand Palace Hotel, The breakfast tables were very small we like our space and with coffee and tea pots side plates and main plates it was all too cramped , John at Reception was brilliant and gave us a warm welcome 
164737,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed The shower Not up to hotel standard I am afraid The mattress was lumpy and was starting to collapse Lets put it this way it wouldn t pass as a guest bed in any ones house The shower was fine if you were under 5 ft I am 6ft4 and my head was against the ceiling pressed against a down lighter with water spraying every where Not great is an understatement , location and staff very good
164738,Strand Palace Hotel, I did not eally like the bed based up against the wall and I did say I was worried about the chair not been safe, The whole weekend was great the breakfast was spot on although the pre flask of tea did taste stewed

164741,Strand Palace Hotel, Small room uncomfortable and small bed but as I say it is a central London hotel and you get what you pay for, Location A central London hotel at a realistic price
164742,Strand Palace Hotel, The service in the Resturant is poor We had to wait every morning in a que to be seated as not enough space and moved to a different Resturant on one morning because of lack of space In the second Resturant there was no white sugar on the table as all had been used We are tea drinkers and would not use brown sugar When I asked the waitress for whit sugar she informed me they had run out of it I couldn t believe my ears A hotel Resturant running g out of white sugar eat 8 20 in the morning She eventually went to another table and return with two packets of sugar The breakfast staff certainly could do with more training We had to request them to bring us tea Any other hotel we ever stayed in the staff always came and asked if we need tea coffee and if everything was ok Not here Makes a difference to the guest even if the food wasn t great it makes one feel welcome and the guest then overlooks some shortcomings in a forgiving manner We pay for good service and we work hard to be able to travel and enjoy The staff in reception and especially the Concierge Steven was lovely and we had a good laugh with him , Cooked breakfast was not appealing to the eye Eggs definitely wouldn t touch and I like eggs Rashers where tough hard to the bite Only tried this once and not all 
164743,Strand Palace Hotel, Gym was not easy to find but not really time to use it anyway , Temperature was easily controllable with simple radiator control and opening window Easy walking distance for plenty of attractions beat the tube strike Plentiful and varied breakfast 
164744,Strand Palace Hotel, No sound proofing in rooms bring ear plugs To check in and out there s a massive queue At breakfast you re asked if you d like a tea or coffee then you ask for a cappuccino and they tell you you ll be charged The room was cold and there s no mini bar Overall I would avoid this hotel , Location hash browns were delicious 12pm check out time
164745,Strand Palace Hotel, Extremely small cosy room Bed could only be accessed from one side Moved to next level Small but workable , Room problem dealt with promptly Good breakfast 
164746,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was dated and shabby as I work In the city the location although wonderful for theatre goers wasn t really an asset for me I found it very commercial and although the staff were friendly enough I found other guests totally miserable barely able to utter a good morning And funnily enough I haven t experienced that at other hotels in London I wouldn t stay here again not a nice feel The room service food was average presentation rubbish the poor man seemed overworked to say the least ,No Positive

164750,Strand Palace Hotel, Was unable to sleep due to faulty air conditioning unit within the room which staff were unwilling to assist or relocate The manager only got involved upon leaving the hotel and was also was not helpful and only used my negative experience as an attempt to try and get me to pay to stay again Do not stay here , Looked very nice

164754,Strand Palace Hotel, We were a little shocked to find the bar very expensive we spent 20 on two baileys liqueurs which we thought more than necessary , General all round efficiency everything we needed for a relaxing weekend 
164755,Strand Palace Hotel, Cold rooms but could turn up heat myself except from the bathroom A bit crowdy for breakfast with lines for waiting but when finally there the breakfast is nice , Enjoyed the area and closeness to everything specially for us and the theatres close by and the good shopping in Covent Garden Spacy single room 
164756,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel states 4 star but service and facilities more 3 star Had booked Executive Double however the room was not good very dark and tiny window faced a wall and constant hum from hotels air con units The room next door had Executive label whereas our room did not making me wonder if they had added a coffee maker to a standard double as hotel was full It did not match images of executive room I complained and was told no other executive doubles available and got the feeling that this was because I had booked via Bookings com rather than hotel direct It took 45 minutes to get an alternative room a standard not executive double which was better as faced front of hotel this confirmed my feelings about the executive double room they gave me being a re labelled standard room because they were full I then had to argue for a refund on difference in room price waiting to have it credited back and benefits of executive room booking all disappeared once I moved rooms no record of me on breakfast list tried to charge for newspaper and no 10 discount which was supposed to be applied on food drink in hotel , Location excellent for theatres and food at hotel good generally clean if standard for any hotel 
164757,Strand Palace Hotel, I was happy with everything there was nothing in particular that would warrant a negative comment at this point , The overall presentation from reception area to the room was very inviting and nice
164758,Strand Palace Hotel, Checking in at reception was a very slow process especially if you arrive before your room was ready Others were queueing because their room wasnt ready at 2pm Our teenage daughter was with us in a separate room and we had pre asked for her room to be close which they ignored but changed when asked again , Convenient value for money was quiet despite being very busy Breakfast was good value too Rooms were clean and functional no bath in double or kingsize room though showers were good 
164759,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location and the quietest hotel I ve ever stayed in while in central London Absolutely no traffic noise whatsoever it was worth requesting an upper floor quiet room while booking

164764,Strand Palace Hotel, Some rooms were pretty loud as I heard a lot of complaints from other occupants in the hotel Our room faced the main road which is loud however once you shut the wooden blinds the noise virtually disappears Plus the wooden blinds allow for the room to become very dark which makes it easy to sleep in late , Perfect location Couldn t be any better

164772,Strand Palace Hotel, The extract fan in the bathroom was ineffective causing the water to condense on the walls then run down creating a large pool on the floor thereby causing a slip hazard The view was of a dark internal courtyard overlooking the loud air conditioning units The queue to check in was too slow it took 30 minutes before being served only to be told my room wasn t ready and to return later to collect my key even though it was nearly 15 00 I went for breakfast to be told by a staff member the restaurant was full and I should go to the other one I then spotted a colleague in the same restaurant and entered only to find the restaurant over half empty and not full at all , The bed was OK The room was clean and functional

164775,Strand Palace Hotel, The only thing that put me off a little was the price I d say I stayed during NYE , I didn t use the any of the hotel facilities bar gym etc but room facilities were all working kettle haitdryer shower nespresso machine was definitely the best nespresso machine s are only in the executive rooms only room size was really good I m a short person there s a vending machine on each floor by the lift so very handy indeed staff was extremely friendly and helpful other than all that I enjoyed my stay 
164776,Strand Palace Hotel, I was staying in a single room which I considered to be quite small Overall the hotel was a little old looking and could benefit from a refreshment , Location location location Ideally situated for those who like to wander around Trafalgar Square or Covent Garden are only a few minutes walk away and easy access to soho For longer distances the area is very well connect through the tube line The personnel was very kind and helpful

164782,Strand Palace Hotel, Arriving to find they had over booked the hotel and promptly pushed into a small cold room Attitude of checking in person poor which seemed to flow up to the manager , Location
164783,Strand Palace Hotel, I had a room with window towards The Strand Heavy traffic and a lot of noise I think for this category of hotel I would expect sound insulating windows on this side of the building , Excellent english breakfast

164793,Strand Palace Hotel, Room had no drawers for clothes and was quiet small and because we didn t book direct we didn t receive a 15 voucher and a bottle of prosecco which we had when we stayed before, Excellent location pleasant staff always clean very quiet bottled water in room
164794,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was 349 and we were wakened every morning very early due to noise of deliveries below one morning 4 30am to what sounded like empty bottles being put in to recycling lorry not impressed as were on a break and wanted a longer sleep in due to the noise this was not to be it would need to be another layer of glass on Windows to make it better sound proof our bathroom floor was also very tired like and needs a bit of attention, The location for the theatres is fantastic Charing Cross underground very close

164798,Strand Palace Hotel, It is pricey but this is London Occasionally you can find a room for under 200 Pounds then its worth it Reception had to print my invoice out 8 times until they finally got it to use my current address and not the old one from 1 year ago , Location Right behind Covent Garden Comfort Great Hotel Great rooms Very Clean Cleaning staff very helpful 
164799,Strand Palace Hotel, They over charged me The agreed rate was 165 They required me to pay over 200 So there was some failure of communication between yourselves and the hotel I had not taken the details to London and couldn t remember offhand so I paid the increase The hotel would no doubt say that we had breakfast on top which is correct but only because they told us it was included in the rate , handy location
164800,Strand Palace Hotel, The Breakfast Dinner lounge needs facelifting wooden tables feel a bit sticky although clean , Great Location Good Breakfast Express Checkout

164804,Strand Palace Hotel, Price for the room is rather high and there s no view to mention or a really large room to make this up But this is London An obvious persistent stain in the further clean sheet shouldn t have been there and the sheet taken out of circulation , Early arrival but the room was ready very welcome after the flight to London Also we had early departure 3 days later and breakfast was available from 6 30 Good breakfast and polite service from the staff all the time 
164805,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was a cosy double small would be a better description The cooked breakfast could have done being a bit hotter , The location is excellant
164806,Strand Palace Hotel, The breakfast staff is overeager to remove glasses from the table When coming early to breakfast it is annoying to be placed at an unsteady table infront of the exit from the street When pointing out the unsteady table the servers solutions was to put something under the leg instead of offering us another table there were las than 10 persons in the restaurant We did get another table when we insisted but we should have had to have the discussion, Excellent and clean room Excellent service Nicebreakfast Papers and magazines in the lobby Very helpful porters desk

164813,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was a little hard for my liking Breakfast was very busy although handled efficiently, The location was excellent for Buckingham Palace The Mall Trafalgar Square and the shows The staff were very helpful We were given a free upgrade to a larger room which we gratefully accepted 
164814,Strand Palace Hotel, The whole hotel needed refurbishment and was dismal The mattress and pillows were like rocks Bedroom walls were thin and other guests were noisy We couldn t sleep The shower had inadequate power We complained and were offered a discount if we stayed again so they did try to make amends but I won t be staying again ,No Positive
164815,Strand Palace Hotel, Noisy with no effective sound insulation between rooms or between the room and between the room and corridor Decor is looking pretty tired and everything is slightly worn around the edges , Very good location nice fast elevators and the room was cleaned well The wooden shutters on the inside of the windows were very effective and the bed was comfortable

164817,Strand Palace Hotel, The toilet paper was only 2 ply people fold it over and use 4 times the amount with 3 ply people use what they need Also I would like hot chocolate powder to be made with boiling water in the rooms please no one drinks caffeine last thing at night Why don t the bathrooms have an expellair switch They certainly do not work automatically I loved the mens shoes in the GR display but why no prices The sign said 50 off but 50 off what , I love the Strand Palace Hotel so much atmosphere and personality Breakfast is a feast so much choice so much food The porridge once I d found it down a hole was delicious quite excellent Thank you Mr wonderful Maitre Di for fetching me some honey to go on it Nothing was too much trouble in his restaurant 
164818,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was nothing like the advert that enticed me to go ahead and book Not sure how it could be charged or called an executive room We would have expected chairs not taking turns to sit on the one available which was really uncomfortable The room was drab again nothing like your advert it was not worth the money at all we would not like to have seen a standard room if this was the quality of Executive The window casement was broken and so the top part of the window kept slipping down safety sign a bit ironic really We would not recommend these rooms to anyone who is planning to spend any time in the hotel better off sitting in the foyer , The executive breakfast was very good Staff friendly courteous and helpful Really close to all the major sites 
164819,Strand Palace Hotel, Everything The service facilities staff , Staff abrupt and not facilitating Rooms cold and dirty 60 min wait for breakfast before being sat down Very dissapointed

164821,Strand Palace Hotel, Short wait to get a seat at breakfast We would all like things to be cheaper but the early deals are good value , Location is excellent for Westend and museums and all transport For the size of it the service seems to be still personal 
164822,Strand Palace Hotel, Windows need double glazing rather than the totally opaque wooden shutters , Comfortable clean room and excellent breakfast All staff encountered were friendly and helpful 
164823,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing The whole event was great , It s central position to all the theatres and Covent Garden which is only minutes away There are an amazing number of Bars and restaurants within only a few minutes walk as well
164824,Strand Palace Hotel, The interior d cor of the shared areas of the hotel is a little tired and the room d cor was outdated cheap e g bathroom and tatty The biggest problem was noise coming through the paper thin walls and from the corridor too as the door had no seal around it so sound came in easily , The breakfast was good value for the quality and the Indian restaurant that is part of the hotel was really good The staff were very helpful 
164825,Strand Palace Hotel, Signs for lift could be more visible on corridor walls not just at immediate turning Bed next to wall not convenient more suited to single travellers, Breakfast at 12 a head offer excellent value very central and easy to access from Waterloo Not as luxurious as the address suggests but great for the Savoy Theatre and not as expensive as the hotel Thank goodness hotel didn t have air conditioning as I find it difficult to sleep with it on a little more milk and coffee would be appreciated
164826,Strand Palace Hotel, There was no view out of our window because they had a brick wall built in front of our window which sucked , It was just across from the savoy theater which was perfect for me and my mum as we were going to see dreamgirls and we didn t want to travel in london at night The beds were nice and firm 
164827,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very small and the bathroom was not the cleanest it could have been It was very expensive but guess you re paying for location rather than comfort , The location was great and easy 
164828,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was extremely small for the money and bed was against the wall making it very difficult for that person to get in and out I was marching in the Remembrance Parade and am trying to book again for next year but am told I cannot , Location and hotel overall 
164829,Strand Palace Hotel, As a frequent customer there is still a problem with accessing the lifts at peak periods they seem to bypass floors That s why I prefer to stay on lower floors , Staff at check in were very helpful in finding an alternative room when booked room was not immediately available even at 2 00pm 
164830,Strand Palace Hotel, Reception staff very slow at check in and out Upgraded our room to one where all night road works were taking place had to change room at 12 30 at night Staff in lounge bar miserable not welcoming or friendly and the coffee was luke warm Overall disgraceful hotel , Good location and public areas
164831,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very masculine the tap was lose and the glass in the bathroom had mouldy in the bottom for the price the quality was poor but maybe you had to pay more because of the location the drilling outside till 3am was awful but not the hotels fault but the early morning hoovering after the late night was very disturbing I guess they cleaners had to do their job but not slit if sleep for this pricy room, The location was excellent 
164832,Strand Palace Hotel, I appreciate that it was a single room but quite cramped possibly too much in there for the size of the room , Location was brilliant very reasonably priced for the area Hotel facilites were excellent bar prices were very competitive 
164833,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom only has a towel radiator and never really heated up making the room cold when using the bathroom , The staff were brilliant Very friendly nothing too much trouble Made you feel welcome Location is excellent for getting around London Food in the Carvery very good
164834,Strand Palace Hotel, For a 4 star hotel it worthed as 2 or 3 stars and was very outdated The room I got was old and smelly old heating almost no amenities not even a glass to drink water The bath was full of black spots in the joints The guy in the concierge desk throwed me a magazine with a map without a word when I asked for a map really rude No worth the money at all I would not recommend it unless you only care about the location , Location is perfect and really close to Convent Garden 
164835,Strand Palace Hotel, Found the receptionist on booking in very condescending and blanked my partner throughout the booking in process Cosy room is just that small and the shower is of no use to anyone over the height of 5 10 simply too low Bed was uncomfortable and small double , Location was perfect for Westend theatre and Covent Garden Excellent facilities around hotel which is situated directly opposite the Savoy Theatre Dreamgirls is an amazing show Also went to School Of Rock and The Play that Goes Wrong simply hilarious and all within easy walking distance of hotel Very friendly doormen and room service was good value and tasty Covent garden eateries are less than a 3 minute walk away and Maxwells Nachos are a must Great location with friendly staff 
164836,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, It s in a perfect location for theatres shopping and Covent Garden The room was spacious comfortable and clean The food was of high quality and presented perfectly
164837,Strand Palace Hotel, Check in and out Slow Sometimes see extra staff members wondering around when there s a queue for checking out but bearable Hotel Hotel could be updated Rooms nice and warm because of shutters Emergency vending machines selling essentials and snacks, Great location Organic toiletries regularly topped up Reasonable selection of food but better outdoors Something for everyone here 
164838,Strand Palace Hotel, It was very dusty and generally didn t feel very clean The bed was just OK and the sofa bed was terrible The temperature in the room was hard to control due to there only being a radiator which was quite filthy , Loved the location and we had quick responses to housekeeping requests 
164839,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing major just the Gin Palace room could have been warmer , Location perfect as not very far to walk to anywhere i e Theatreland Covent Garden London Eye and great for shopping We were given an upgrade from standard room to king size room Perfect for our weekend celebration We had a room over looking the Strand no issue with noise just normal level to us Entrance reception signage all easy to follow Gin Palace was very nice although a little cool in this room Restaurant for breakfast was excellent as was the choice of breakfast Staff extremely friendly and helpful Loved every minute of being in this hotel and would recommend it to friends and family 
164840,Strand Palace Hotel, The picture on the booking site is quite deceiving The pictures potray it as very eclectic young colourful and morden but that is far from the truth The decor is quite old and smells musty almost like a nursing home, It very close to main atractions of london very com
164841,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a standard room The bed was small We were upgraded to an executive room on our last visit and the bed was larger Also our room 291 appeared to be located next to a plant room which had a water tank which was constantly filling up The noise was significant , My wife was taken ill during the night and subsequently had to be taken to hospital The night staff were excellent Two staff attended the room very quickly and one checked my wife phoned for the ambulance and stayed until they arrived He also checked her regularly until the ambulance arrived Unfortunately I did not get his name but he certainly did all the right things on behalf of the hotel We thank him for his attention 
164842,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was extremely small windows were very dirty Over priced for the facilities not a 4 star hotel more like a 3 star, The location of the hotel was perfect Not far from the main attractions 
164843,Strand Palace Hotel, For the price I have had better breakfasts not that it was bad but I have had better and for the price I feel it should have been really The coffee was hot black but completely tasteless The window of the room was boarded with shutters at the sides and only the centre section would open which was a bit prison like The bathroom extractor did not work and the quilt was a bit on the small side only just fitting the bed Overall it was all ok as a 3 star hotel not a 4 as advertised and for the price it was not really up to it , The location is what you pay for with all that was required within easy walk of the hotel this being the main point of this hotel overall The WiFi worked as advertised which is rare in hotels these days and there were tea coffee facilities in the room 
164844,Strand Palace Hotel, The only two negatives I have for the hotel is that there was a lack of storage space for clothing and this was for a 5 day trip It s definitely not suitable for a long stay as there is nowhere to put more than a few days worth of clothes Secondly this gripe wasn t with the hotel but the room service We ordered two desserts and a cheese board on our last night usual rooms service prices overpriced The ice cream while not made in the hotel was fine The cheesecake was acceptable but not the quality you d expect and also came with strawberries not the stated raspberries small thing but we re allergic to strawberries but the issue really was with the cheeseboard It came with none of the accompaniments It was supposed to come with chutney quince jelly and cracker It was only the cheese that was delivered We called twice and asked for the missing items but they were never delivered to our room , Very cute cosy room if a little warm but the radiators were adjustable Good shower and extremely quiet I d requested a quiet room on a higher floor we got number 899 The location was fantastic right in between Covent Garden and the Thames and the hotel manager was kind enough to welcome us with a bottle of Prosecco and a hand written card for my partner s birthday We got a good rate and pre paid through this site We were ultimately pretty happy with the experience 
164845,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast Pork excludes Jews and Muslims among others from eating suasages etc Maybe alernate with beef turkey for example Coffee was very good though , Your location is unbeatable The rooms and staff are of a high standard and your Indian restaurant is excellent 
164846,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff weren t too friendly when we checked in Inconsistent customer service The breakfast was disappointing , Location was great The Hotel was lovely and the bed was comfortable Very hygienic and cosy 
164847,Strand Palace Hotel, It s right on the main street and very loud late into the morning hours which kept me up Traffic is terrible so don t plan on taking transportation Everything should be done by foot or walk to the nearest subway If your luggage isn t heavy that shouldn t be a problem The rooms are outdated and quite small Bed isn t very comfortable and the shower is a step up which I imagine would be too short for a taller person I m not sure how this is a four star hotel It seemed like almost a college dorm room I was renting , It s ideal if you re going to do touristy things such as site seeing and head out in London for the first time Walking distance to great restaurants and night life Price was lowest for the location 
164848,Strand Palace Hotel, The cozy room was a single room you needed to climb over each other to get in or out of the bed as it was against the wall Did get a better room for an extra 30 per night , The location of the hotel makes it easy to see the sights and close to many theatres Good value meals in the restaurant Great coffee shop 
164849,Strand Palace Hotel, As above good wrvliked everthing else , Bed very comfortable only one problem we had no heating in room for our stay reported it but no one came That was the only problem we use hotel every year 
164850,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , A very comfortable hotel with very helpful staff We will be using you again The position is very good as well A couple of satisfied customers 
164851,Strand Palace Hotel, The double bed was narrow The breakfasts were very standard with few fresh vegetables and limited selection of cheeses, The location is excellent and the room was spacious 
164852,Strand Palace Hotel, The wardrobe was far too small our clothes barley fitted in It took 1 5 hours to have an iron and ironing board delivered Breakfast is overpriced, The location is excellent for us the room although very small was adequate but a bit over priced
164853,Strand Palace Hotel, Very Expensive drinks large ish glass of wine 9 very nice G T 13 Breakfast was too expensive so we went elsewhere , Location Friendly Staff
164854,Strand Palace Hotel, Headroom in shower a bit tight but not a real problem paid about 60 more than I did earlier in the year for the same room short stay, Ideal location very central room was quiet and dark bed was comfortable and a proper shower cubicle 
164855,Strand Palace Hotel, Bedroom layout double bed against the wall access in and out of bed at night was impossible without disturbing your sleeping partner no bed side tables for reading matter or glasses cups etc not acceptable in this day and age at the price charged , The location close to Covent Garden and theatre world 
164856,Strand Palace Hotel, On Monday we did not have to leave the room until 12 midday but the builders started drilling at 9am it was so loud we had to leave such a shame , Absolutely great location and the check in lady was so helpful
164857,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing but price , The location is definitely the reason of the choice 5 minutes to the river and 20minutes to most of the sightseeing sport Restaurants shopping and theaters around in minutes as well The room is small but very clean and well facilitated The staff here is helpful and nice The hotel provides speedy checkout 
164858,Strand Palace Hotel, The only light that worked in my room 528 was the bathroom light I had to leave the door open or sit on the toilet seat to read my book I came back around 12 30 pm and it seems nothing had been done with the light after I rported it , Breakfast great Location great 
164859,Strand Palace Hotel, the walls between the rooms are very thin be ready to wake up when there is a wake up call in the room next door , Friendly and helpful staff Excellent bed and good wifi The location is very central and works for both pleasure and business 
164860,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Superb location for seeing the shows and sightseeing in London Cozy rooms are small but not tiny and the bed was comfortable Everything was as it should be
164861,Strand Palace Hotel, Shower made a weird noise and a It too powerful and don t cater well for certain dietary requirements so we are elsewhere , Bed was very comfy and sheets very soft Room warm and perfect temperature Wow factor when walking into reception 
164862,Strand Palace Hotel, Had a double executive room but seemed very small , Excellent location Good to have the espresso machine in the room Express emailed check out easy to use and avoids the madness on reception All the staff were very helpful and pleasant 
164863,Strand Palace Hotel, nothing significant to report , strategic location very professional personnel at all levels the management of the hotel is very much involved in observing the quality of the services provided to the clients congratulations 
164864,Strand Palace Hotel, Because the hotel was busy breakfast was a bit of a scrum but it was perfectly fine , Good location Cosy quiet and comfortable room Friendly helpful staff Lovely sausages with breakfast 
164865,Strand Palace Hotel, Everything was great A small fridge in the room might have been nice but wasn t really missed as the hotel is so close to a Tesco quick shop and the Marks and Spencer food shop in Covent Garden so that just feels a bit picky , I was delighted with my stay at Strand Palace and hope to return As a solo female traveller I was concerned with safety I found the location of the hotel to be very conducive to popping out and about both in daytime and night I was able to go to theaters at night stroll back The room had been described as cosy when I booked so I was expecting very small but it was a perfect size really quite spacious for 1 The bathroom was a pleasant surprise too The staff were very helpful I also liked the fact that I was in a room on the first floor I felt that was sensitive to my single female traveller status and helped to make me feel safe This was an important trip to me my first alone in an hotel in a major city I hope to come back 
164866,Strand Palace Hotel, There were a few guests who arrived back to our floor very late They were very noisy too , Everyone was very welcoming Our room was very clean and comfortable 
164867,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was a bit musty I reckon because the heat wasn t on I reported this on leaving, Central location Theatre land vey accessible Shopping too accessible 
164868,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The cosy double was perfectly adequate in size for my requirements I had a lovely view of The Strand a comfortable bed and beautifully clean bathroom The staff were friendly and helpful I will certainly come to The Strand Palace again and not only because of its excellent location so near to theatres and so many of the main tourist attractions 
164869,Strand Palace Hotel, My room very tiny was in the first floor and I could hear the noise of an engine constantly much more intense during the night a nightmare , location is the best feature of the hotel Clean and well organized rooms with good use of small spaces Big hotel where one can come in or go out freely 
164870,Strand Palace Hotel, The location staff and hotel were very good However the room I booked I was upgraded but when going into the bathroom from the bedroom you could not fully open the door because the sink unit stopped it opening If I were a larger person you would not get past, The location staff and hotel were very good However the room I booked I was upgraded but when going into the bathroom from the bedroom you could not fully open the door because the sink unit stopped it opening If I were a larger person you would not get past
164871,Strand Palace Hotel, Twin room is dull single beds not queen on wheels so moves no aircon but they supply an old fan The duvet has holes in it Absolutely shocking for over 200 as you have to pay a 20 supplement upon check in So 214 for one night was shocking The Hilton twin room at gatwick airport is stunning compare to this , The location is good for Covent Garden and theatre in strand
164872,Strand Palace Hotel, Noise from neighbouring bedrooms and corridors was somewhat excessive early and late , Particularly liked the location and the general atmosphere and decor was clean and spacious 
164873,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast let it down spent too long under the lamps to keep it warm made some items overcooked eggs could have done with being cooked slightly more little runny on the top, Well located for all amenities
164874,Strand Palace Hotel, The way the price fluctuates on website bookings I paid 140 without breakfast it later went to just under a 100 with breakfast I know it s the website s fault but it makes it difficult to know when to book , The staff are always very friendly and helpful I really like this hotel when I travel alone I feel very comfortable and safe and the location is brilliant 
164875,Strand Palace Hotel, Stayed here a number of times over the years This was without a doubt the worst stay Booked a cosy double which turned out to be a Single room converted into a double by the addition of a double bed against the wall Breakfast was poor and I don t think a member of staff smiled at me across the 3 days , Perfect location for our trip 
164876,Strand Palace Hotel, Very small rooms restaurants and lobby not very well maintained and not clean Check in painfully slow , The hotel has a great location All major site seeing spots and theaters are on walking distance 
164877,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was poor 409 I asked to move and was told they were full Noisy I could hear the conversation going on in the next room when the tv was turned down I had previously asked reception to request they turn their tv down but soon realised it was not because it was loud it was because the wall was paper thin Room was very basic and of a lesser quality than a Premier Inn totally overpriced, Staff were very helpful
164878,Strand Palace Hotel, We requested an executive quiet room but were allocated a room next door to the elevator shaft This meant we were kept awake from 4 30am Shattered when we arrived back home , The location was excellent for us and for where we wanted to visit 
164879,Strand Palace Hotel, Check in is sometimes busy at peak times but efficient Single rooms are small but tidy clean and adequate, Breakfasts are always very good but sometimes a bit busy Free newspapers I have stayed at the hotel many times and have not had any problems Always popular with tourists
164880,Strand Palace Hotel, In fairness the amount paid for the room type was no better than a travel lodge or premier inn in fact I would go as far to say the 2 mentioned have better bathroom facilities and sized bedroom, The staff were ok
164881,Strand Palace Hotel, This hotel has seen better days It is worn down and the rooms and hallways need renovation The whole hotel smells of a weird soap smell which usually means that they are hiding some other smell , The building is beautiful and the location is great with lot s of things to see and do all around you Breakfast was good Room was clean They price was ok and I would stay again but not for a higher price 
164882,Strand Palace Hotel, Long wait for tables for breakfast perhaps sharing a list of peak hours would help, Friendly staff in reception room a bit small but comfy bed and good wifi connection
164883,Strand Palace Hotel, Overpriced for a hotel that needs updating Our room was tiny and had no air con Won t be back You pay for the location of the hotel and not the rooms , Breakfast was nice Staff were friendly Entrance impressive Location was amazing 
164884,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was tiny The breakfast was poor Tasteless bacon and black pudding that would have required a chainsaw to cut No value for money , Well located within easy reach of Covent garden
164885,Strand Palace Hotel, Cosy double rammed up against a wall couldn t swing a cat Had to request another set of towels only to be told they were in the wardrobe Walls paper thin, Reception staff concierge staff in the snack coffee bar friendly and efficient
164886,Strand Palace Hotel, The arrangement of executive breakfast for some guests was divisive The staff could have listened more to our requests and taken on board our concerns The lady on check out had a very bad attitude, The Indian restaurant was lovely 
164887,Strand Palace Hotel, The luxury afternoon tea was overpriced the food was mediocre and the service was not good , The room was lovely The location was amazing I got a pretty good deal online The front desk staff and concierge were helpful and friendly 
164888,Strand Palace Hotel, Only one minor issues Our room had an old internal connecting door that had been painted shut could do with removing this as could hear every word next door said as if in the same room , Breakfast was great room was lovely and warm and heating was instant excellent fast shower although ends up being a bath because of this Fabulous check in with nice friendly reception teams 
164889,Strand Palace Hotel, Very old hotel and small rooms although I stayed in an executive room No mini fridge and no air conditioning but a small converter for heating Keeping in mind that I am a world traveler due to the nature of my job this hotel was by far the worst hotel I have stayed , The location is close to Covent Garden
164890,Strand Palace Hotel, No wash clothes and no sheets or blankets to cover up in bed as we Americans know them Double charged for breakfast each and every day once for downstairs restaurant where I never went and once in my room where I ate all my meals construction outside 24 hours a day made sleep all but impossible , Loved the room service and housekeepers They deserve a big raise 
164891,Strand Palace Hotel, Thought the bedrooms were quite poor considering we paid quite a lot of money for 1 night and were told we had an upgrade can t imagine what the original would have been like ,No Positive
164892,Strand Palace Hotel, Signage for the rooms could be clearer So many rooms a bit of a rabbit warren, All staff excellent Great restaurants and facilities and lovely Gin Bar worth a visit 
164893,Strand Palace Hotel, Dirty there where hairs and trash on the floor The heater didn t work The room was next to a shared bathroom and you could hear literally everything The bathroom was worse than a public bathroom The hole hostel had bad smell We had to live right away because it was horrible and they charged us the two night anyway The photos are a lie , Nothing
164894,Strand Palace Hotel, The reception staff were very cool and to start with not friendly at all a staff member had to come out from the back to book us in even though 3 people were standing behind the counter discussing what seemed to be their social life The hotel was I m sure lovely in its day nut now seems very tired and not worth the 300 a night that we paid gor our room , Location is great and the bar staff were lovely Unfortunately that was all I liked about the hotel but that s just our opinion
164895,Strand Palace Hotel, Carpet all over the place Computers under maintenance for the majority of the stay, Breakfast Location Free and good WiFi Free water and snacks added daily in the room
164896,Strand Palace Hotel, the only thing that was missing was a towel rack in the bathroom and i had trouble with the light in the bathroom the closer i got to the mirror the darker it got , cozy but very nice room the staff was very friendly cozy bed and nice bathroom the breakfast was ok but it was not the best i ever had 
164897,Strand Palace Hotel, When I was checking out the reception lady was a bit grumpy Very different from the helpful and pleasant reception staff who helped me when I was checking in , Location Very central near to all the musical theatres which I am really after Concierge staff was very helpful in helping me get discounted tickets for the musicals Had a lovely stay there 
164898,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very cramped and overheated The staff rushed off their feet as the hotel was incredibly busy The concierge was particularly uncooperative , It was close to Waterloo Station
164899,Strand Palace Hotel, My mattress was not very comfortable not terrible but could have been better , The staff where very friendly and professionally helpful They had local knowledge which helped me to make the most of my stay Even when I signed out the lady offered to get me a taxi and helped with directions to the nearest station when I said that I planned to walk I was very pleased with my complimentary upgrade I specifically stayed near an event on Aldwich so the hotel position is superb 
164900,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing, Check in and check out very good quick and easy Room was ready when we got there at 12 40 very clean bathroom could probably do with updating but shower was lovely and powerful Bed wasn t that comfortable as I prefer a softer mattress Having said that I slept very well Saw better looking hotels for the money I paid but the location cannot be beaten especially if you are going to the theatre Worth every penny just for that 
164901,Strand Palace Hotel, Small room No A C this is usually not an issue in London but I was there during warm weather The room had a small fan which was fine but for a much warmer day it wouldn t have been enough Does London ever have much warmer days I don t know , Low price by London standards Good location near all of the main sights and only one block from my meeting location 
164902,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing to do with the hotel but in future I ll book direct through the hotel as it s no cheaper using one of the comparison sites and the hotel give you a free bottle of prosecco plus a money off voucher for the restaurant by booking direct , The facilities were fine bed was large comfy and clean Staff polite and location brilliant 
164903,Strand Palace Hotel, Had trouble booking in as 2 rooms on different floors despite requesting being close together and telephoning the day before Wasted 1 2 hour to get sorted Staff really need to try harder not rude but just not helpful Disjointed policies Letter for Exec Room given at check in said waiter at bfast would help with Express Check out but they knew nothing Concierge said drop ur keys in box at Reception but there was no box I asked Reception n they just took room keys off me no How was you stay or Is there anything else I can help with Hotel VERY VERY noisy hardly got any sleep Won t be coming back , Location is great
164904,Strand Palace Hotel, Not a friendly welcoming at check in Got a room with very thin walls and a drunk arguing and partying couple next door that was very noisy between midnight and 7 o clock in the morning This ruined my sleep completely Breakfasts the next morning was also a disappointment when it comes to the quality of what was served Overall one of the worst hotel experiences I ve ever had ,No Positive
164905,Strand Palace Hotel, Waiting for lifts but it s a big hotel with lots of guests so that s to be expected, Compact single room with bath very clean and quiet as requested Liked the wooden blinds rather than curtains much cleaner and neater Good breakfast choice
164906,Strand Palace Hotel, the room given was classed as a Executive king the room was awful 101 then put in 802 if I remember awful view light none existent eventually given room 204 a king room much better but told we would not get a refund , The location is fantastic the staff very helpful very nice place
164907,Strand Palace Hotel, Noisy room other guests note people who stay are a bit chavvy made worse by noise on the street that woke us up and staff who really could not care and were utterly hopeless It s not cheap , Clean spacious rooms and a sensible gym Great location 
164908,Strand Palace Hotel, Greasy breakfast choices and a minimal selection of options for those of us who start the day vegetarian , I LOVED Francesca at the desk who let us check in early and suggested we get a larger room than I booked she offered a 30 pound per night upgrade for 20 I appreciated the cleaning staff While I don t normaly tip housekeeping this time I did The concierge service was helpful And I loved the location And I loved the fact that the coffee was brewed and delicious Magda was another stand out employee 
164909,Strand Palace Hotel, Decor a little dated No view from window , Excellent location to Covent Garden shows Centre of London good access to tube stations Embankment and Covent Garden Room clean and good size Great Breakfast Friendly staff 
164910,Strand Palace Hotel, Mixup on checking out with Reception asking me for payment for breakfast added on to my bill when computer showed I had already paid for an added in breakfast This meant that someone had given my room number at breakfast when I was staying alone , Loved the treatment from the friendly young man who helped me in reception on arrival After hearing I was a returning guest he gave me an upgrade without me having to ask 
164911,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms are small There was only 1 plus for watercooker shade phonecharger Not really handy Could do with some freshing up , Location is defenitely a great plus Staff is very friendly and helpful
164912,Strand Palace Hotel, BATHROOM IN MY ROOM WAS MADE FOR A TINY CIRCUS CLOWN WITH NO ARMS IT IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS FUNCTIONALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE IT SITED OUT IN THE HALLWAY OR THE SHOWER, breakfast is pretty good but essential for early morning start on the day location is amazingly useful rooms are clean but one can be given a bizarrely small room that barely has room to walk in others are ok staff is friendly one can send items to print to hotel printer
164913,Strand Palace Hotel, I guess thin walls between the rooms I heard everything happening at neighbors room o , Great location Close to major sights you want to see in London Pretty clean 
164914,Strand Palace Hotel, Every time the toilet flushed there was a very loud noise that lasted for 5 mins and was very disturbing especially in the middle of the night When I told reception in the morning there was no interest and not even an apology Very unhelpful , The bed was comfy Nice breakfast
164915,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was hard the pillows tired the walls paper thin and the room stuffy and poorly ventilated The duvet cover had a hole in it and needed to be retired The checkout receptionist was also quite abrupt which was a change from the check in staff unfortunately A grumpy lady at the breakfast sitting made us feel unwelcome but luckily was made up for by cheerful staff internally , The location was great for the theatres
164916,Strand Palace Hotel, Poor hotel for the price Rooms very basic Uncomfortable beds Queuing for breakfast Sticky tables Cold buffet breakfast, staff were friendly Good location
164917,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was very dark and stuffy and overlooked some huge extractor fans As the room was so warm we had to have the window open which meant we could hear these fans all night , Good breakfast Friendly helpful staff The lobby the bars and restaurant are bright and pleasant areas to come back to after a night out in the West End The location is superb 
164918,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing really breakfast was a bit rushed like we were asked have you finished because we want to clear away this was at 9 15 as it happened we had finished but just felt a big rushed nothing is complain about though to be honest , Location perfect for our purpose Really liked the staff and the room was good value for money in pondon
164919,Strand Palace Hotel, Do not choose COSY room room ok toilet totally unacceptable shower no good can t use due to slanted roof and sitting on toilet roll holder when on toilet NOT GOOD, Location beautiful hotel great staff
164920,Strand Palace Hotel, Small room for the money Didn t receive the vouchers for the restaurant that was advertised Only got the prosecco because we asked on way out and because it was our anniversary , Warm and cosy room Free prosecco 
164921,Strand Palace Hotel, Small room Outlook was a building being refurbished very noisy Hotel quite large got lost a few times trying to find room , Breakfast was very good and service great Hotel position was perfect for us Would use it again 
164922,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning mold phone was left in the room and missing when we returned never to be found Don t know why this hotel had such high reviews on booking com, The concierge Patrick was very helpful Location was okay
164923,Strand Palace Hotel, The breakfast wasn t great But what really Horrified us was the concierge telling us we had 48 hours to pay the congestion charge but we now have a fine as the charge has to be paid within 24 hours so the poor advice from the hotel staff cost us 135 extremely disappointed ,No Positive
164924,Strand Palace Hotel, The room is described as cosy you could just about swing a cat in it There was an old fan in the corner which represented the ventilation Windows were sealed shut and the curtains fairly manky I suppose it being the centre of London you get what you pay for, The location hence the choice and efficiency booking in with a choice of bath or shower 
164925,Strand Palace Hotel, It would be good to have aircon rather than just a fan The beds could be a bit larger too , The location is wonderful close to Covent Garden and various theatres all within walking distance The breakfasts and Sunday dinner were very good too 
164926,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , Bathroom very clean beds comfortables staff friendly and well educated Hotel well located near 3 underground stations and near boats on the Thames 
164927,Strand Palace Hotel, Had 5 breakfasts all luke warm had the carvery cold veg and beef was fatty and raw Had room service soup was cold Queued for breakfast whilst the executive section was empty , Location
164928,Strand Palace Hotel, The size of the room It was tiny even though we had a large double bed One could hardly move We have stayed there before but had a much larger room and didn t pay as much as this time , The location is excellent for The National Gallery the National Portrait Gallery many theatres Trafalgar Square etc Very handy 
164929,Strand Palace Hotel, too long wait at the lifts, the check in disk was amazingly nice Even if I arrived earlier than the check in time my room was already available and the staff super kind
164930,Strand Palace Hotel, My room was quite small a little tired especially the bathroom but everything worked Price is quite high but competitive for its location, Location is superb for exploring central London
164931,Strand Palace Hotel, Only one small issue pillows were vey hard and uncomfortable, Excellent location close to attractions staff very helpful and efficent Room very clean with everything to hand
164932,Strand Palace Hotel, Better bedroom lighting would be good Not keen on the wooden shutters that they do not open fully , Been staying here for over 30 years It s what I want Where I want for London good value 
164933,Strand Palace Hotel, slept on double bed one side against wall no room to walk over to the side there were enough tea and coffee but only 4 jiggers of milk so had to phone housekeeping to let us have some more mirror on the desk was fixed so had to use one in bathroom but no light above the mirror asked for decaf at breakfast and found tea on table when came back and i never drink tea with breakfast , booked the room to go to an event at Trafalgar Square and it was just a few minutes walk from the hotel they let us use luggage store facility after checking out so we could leave them behind to go to Tower of London before going back to Victoria 
164934,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom was small with VERY little room to stand in the shower one of the worst I ve had while traveling through Europe No bar fridge , Breakfast was pretty good Very good location 
164935,Strand Palace Hotel, HOT food , Didn t like the Restaurant as the hot meal was served cold Roast of the Day Loved our breakfast which was served in the other room the service was excellent and the staff were very accommodating Great Concierge 
164936,Strand Palace Hotel, Rm 155 needs repair The bathroom door is broken The shower makes funny sound Breakfast area can get crowded , The location is excellent You can walk to Trafalgar Square Covent Garden Liecester Square etc 
164937,Strand Palace Hotel, The bar prices a bit over the top maybe have a happy hour , Breakfast staff quick to have you seated friendly and efficient Food hot and plenty of choice Reception staff very efficient and friendly Doorman a pleasure Nothing was too much trouble great hotel fab location Would stay here again
164938,Strand Palace Hotel, EVERYTHING except the location HOW does booking com appraise this hotel with 4 starts You are deceiving your costumers This hotel deserve 2 starts at max If you would like to try living in a cave then welcome to this hotel The rooms are extremely small the price is very high very poor treatment from the staff Very noisy and dirty HONESTLY this was the only bad part of my visit to London , ONLY location
164939,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, We only had a couple of questions for staff and on both occasions they were unable to help and made no suggestions as to what we could try next and no apology 
164940,Strand Palace Hotel, I don t think we would consider staying at this hotel again , the receptionist very kindly upgraded us to a better room as the one we were allocated was dreadful small dark and uncomfortable and as we had paid for an executive room to celebrate our wedding anniversary she felt sorry for us and agreed it was not a very nice room 
164941,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was not ready until 4 pm on arrival day Also room cleaning was very late only in the end of the afternoon , Super location Nice big bed Nice bar
164942,Strand Palace Hotel, My room smelt bad so had to move rooms Quite dated and no air conditioning and there was a heat wave in London , Location was great Very nice and professional staff who dealt with my room which smelt bad and gave me a better room thank you The room had a kettle which was great 
164943,Strand Palace Hotel, Executive Room was more like a closet Double Room also very small Ordering sparkling water at the lobby should come in a bottle not a glass, Location is brilliant Indian restaurant one of the best I ve tried Carver very good
164944,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms were much smaller than expected When 2 people are staying it would be nice to have 2 large bath towels and extra shower gel , Rooms very clean and staff very friendly 
164945,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Early check in not a problem didn t even have to ask Nice and cool air conditioned reception lobby Bathroom nice and roomy Breakfast very nice
164946,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning in the bedrooms Not normally a problem but we were there in sweltering temperatures and the fan provided did not provide adequate relief at night , Room was spacious comfortable and facilities at the hotel were excellent Well located fro Covent Garden and the West End All major tourist sites within an easy walk and convenient for public transport 
164947,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was a cosy room I anticipated a small room but I didn t quite understand that meant you could only get in one side of the bed double Apart from this the room was fine good ensuite clean and well presented and fine for an overnight stay , the location was great and the reception staff very helpful
164948,Strand Palace Hotel, We found the bacon at breakfast to be dry and the scrambled egg a little on the sloppy side Unfortunatly the fried eggs had a snotty substance on top which was a little off putting Maybe breakfast would taste better if prepared fresh rather than as a buffet For the price we payed it was disappointing , We loved variety of food at breakfast The tea was great Staff members were very helpful and welcoming Our room was lovely too 
164949,Strand Palace Hotel, Having a quieter room we were on the front very busy, Very efficient service at breakfast staff very friendly and helpful good location handy for everything
164950,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms are small and stuffy You won t get air circulation even if the windows are open and the fan is on high speed it was suffocating Has to switch from a room on the 1st floor to the 6th floor just to get ca little bit more air through the window Make sure you get a room facing the street not courtyard if you decide to stay , The location was within a short walk of several landmarks and london s most popular neighborhoods
164951,Strand Palace Hotel, No air condition in the hotel rooms except in Exec rooms according to hotel staff No information provided about that in advance or on the web site , The location of the hotel 
164952,Strand Palace Hotel, I had an exucutive double room with an air conditioner but air conditioner was whole day on with 16 degree because of their test and it was freezing in the room And I didn t had control to stop it because it was from central system I told to recepeption to turn it off but they responded unfriendly and didn t solve immediately , The location is superb The staffs are in general friendly and helpful 
164953,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to change rooms three times as two too small for 2 people and not air conditioned and consequently had to pay for an upgrade All rooms should be air conditioned and would not stay in the warmer months if cooling could not be guaranteed Our departure was day roads closed for bicycle ride Our lugagge was wheeled to cnr of The Strand and Aldwych to catch a taxi to St Pancras After 20 mins no taxi My travelling companion is 79 and couldn t walk so I returned to porters desk but refused to book one The wonderful staff from the Aldwych Hilton assisted my friend with her luggage and called a taxi for us Very poor performance from Strand Palace especilly more so as I had stayed there at least 25 times Unlikely to stay again given their lack of interest , Comfy bed Good location
164954,Strand Palace Hotel, As in many hotels breakfasting alone was a gamble go to get toast and your table s been reallocated before you return , Friendly helpful staff Air conditioning public areas Plenty of comfortable places to sit 
164955,Strand Palace Hotel, The fact that there was no air con in the room thankfully the weather was very hot for our stay but we enjoyed , The hotel was first class the food was great everything was what we wanted the staff were excellent there was only the one thing 
164956,Strand Palace Hotel, Did not have the feather pillows that had been asked for when booking Could not get into the wifi even with assistance The gentleman had to use his own password , The lobby 
164957,Strand Palace Hotel, The cooked breakfast was a real disappointment it was tired dried out and looked as if it had been sitting around for ages not what we would have expected for the price we paid , Large room sofa and really soft dressing gowns
164958,Strand Palace Hotel, its not their fault as they cannot change the views however i could see this being a problem for some people Also not all rooms have aircon, friendliness location very comfortable
164959,Strand Palace Hotel, Sorry but there s nothing to dislike , I love this hotel the location is absolutely fantastic the rooms are comfortable and I only ever need to use the cosy singles it s peaceful and the staff are friendly It is a very safe place to stay as a solo female traveller 
164960,Strand Palace Hotel, The room we were in wouldn t want to stay in again it was joined with original lyrics by the next door and now only separated by the adjoining door which was just sealed up but no soundproofing we could hear everything from that room to the conversations Was an awful room in that respect Having said that the hotel is great ,No Positive
164961,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, I liked the warmth of the check in staff and in the restaurant The long line up for breakfast turned into a very short wait as it was dealt with very efficiently and cheerfully 
164962,Strand Palace Hotel, The 4 star rating is not deserved by this hotel The staff doesn t pay attention to the guests or does it as a great favor rather than their jobs Your arrival at the hotel starts with you carrying your suitcases up the welcome stairs while the concierges and other staff attending the valet parking and desks My room had a window into the internal ventilation non garden with fans producing constant noise Luckily I was staying in this hotel in September as I don t think it is survivable in Summer due to lack of A C Furniture and bathroom are weared off to the level of a 2 star motel Oh and remember to take flip flops when you are going to the shower Chances are the floor will have a nice big puddle when you finish , Location nothing else 
164963,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed could have been more comfy, Location you couldn t ask for a better one for going out it was close to everything and most places were within walking distance We saw several shows which we walked to 
164964,Strand Palace Hotel, That they didn t leave us towels on the last night and that I felt they treated us differently because we were young in fact they wanted to see our confirmation before even welcoming us to the hotel I felt the staff didn t believe we belonged there I didn t particularly care but it wasn t good customer service, The location was greats
164965,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was fine but some foods were a wee bit tough i e Bacon black pudding , Great location swift checking in and lovely staff Room comfy and good size 
164966,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was 190 our room was like a box Definitely not value for money When we booked on booking com said breakfast included when we got to desk were told it wasn t Wouldn t recommend this hotel, Area
164967,Strand Palace Hotel, V hot night no air con Stuffy room We were told breakfast till 10 30 We arrived down 9 50 and taken to the Idian restaurant in hotel because breakfast room was full In there 10 mins and staff started to clear breakfast away We were then told breakfast finishes at 10 there What we did eat was v poor quality Complained at checkout asked to see manger and told he would contact me later by phone Heard nothing ,No Positive
164968,Strand Palace Hotel, My main complaint would be that the hotel is looking tired and as the majotity of the rooms look inward one tends to shut out what natural light struggles feebly to permeate the bank of air conditioner units, Fabulous location if you are a West End Wendy The Theatre district and restaurants are on your doorstep Being on the Strand you are on most bus routes and the stop is right outside the door I loved the staff I will stay here again
164969,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was pretty chaotic waiting to be seated long Q s for food The rooms are not airconditioned were very hot , Location is perfect the staff very polite helpful Housekeeping is excellent the room was well serviced each day There are computors just off the lobby which I found very convenient to catch up on emails 
164970,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was pokey bed and pillows hard noisy plumbing from the room next door and water seeping up through the tiles making the bathroom floor dangerous , Near the theatre and other popular sights Staff very good 
164971,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful in all areas particularly breakfast service where nothing was too much trouble Room very bright clean had both bath and shower and was of a reasonable size for London Location excellent for a range of theatres restaurants and the markets of Covent Garden It is a very short walk to the Embankment use the steps down from Waterloo Bridge alongside Somerset House for access for a stroll by the River Thames The walk to BIg Ben takes approximately 10 15 minutes but as we passed and stopped to examine Clepatra s Needle the Sphynx and the Battle of Britain memorials on the way it did take us a little longer Lovely way to get to Westminster with much to see both on and off the water whilst walking and a good number of ornate benches on the way just to sit and watch the world go by 
164972,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay The Strand Palace Hotel was clean and comfortable All staff were helpful and professional I thought the breakfast was good value and good quality with a wide choice of food I would recommend this hotel to friends and family It is perfect for theater goers 
164973,Strand Palace Hotel, I would have preferred to have had a room with a view of the outside It was a little sad to think I paid for an executive room and the view was just an internal one , The bed was really comfy and the hotel itself was just beautiful 
164974,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Hotels location is fantastic We really enjoyed our stay the staff were always very pleasant and helpful We would definitely stay there again and recommend to other s 
164975,Strand Palace Hotel, The room i booked was tiny which is fine but was a bit of a shock when opening the door would be good if you were told when booking just how small the room is Also as it s standard in most reputed hotels these days to have a few various phone charger wires available for guests at reception i didn t expect to be laughed frowned at when asking for one when mine had broken not to mention have to go out late night to get one ,No Positive
164976,Strand Palace Hotel, Very happy no complaints, The hotel was very friendly all staff were exceptionally professional yet very comfirtable to talk to The location was superb The little arabic bar man was such a delightful man I would recommend this hotel 
164977,Strand Palace Hotel, No a c no towels pokey room misinformation re case storage overbearing receptionist at second check in 24 8 2016 Revolting view cleaners store room should have been left closed very unsightly , Helpful doorman one friendly lady at final check out 26 8 2016 Room on first stay 8 8 2016 12 8 2016 was fine 
164978,Strand Palace Hotel, When checking in waiting for a while as just 2receptionists were on duty room very small overpriced and overrated 4 hotel Staff very friendly at least something positive about that hotel ,No Positive
164979,Strand Palace Hotel, Cost of drinks in Gin Palace were extortionate I realise that all London city hotels would be charging similar prices The rooms mine was a single was very hot and I had to have the fan on ALL the time I was in the room It was exceptionally hot weather , Staff were all most helpful and friendly Bed was comfortable The concierge office was exceptionally helpful and we wouldn t have enjoyed our stay so much without their help and advice Indian restaurant was delicious 
164980,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was a bit hot I had forgotten there is no air conditioning in England , The room was clean and larger than I expected The housekeeping was top notch and the location was ideal for sightseeing and shopping 
164981,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very basic for an upgrade to an executive room very small and basic shower room which you would expect to find in a 3 star B B Dirty towels and robe left on the sofa after the room had been cleaned There was a few faults in the which should of been picked up before we arrived Very poor for the money we paid , Location is very good and the breakfast was also good 
164982,Strand Palace Hotel, Very hot weekend but no a c in bedroom There was a fan but not ideal , Location was excellent for Covent Garden and London Coliseum where I was visiting Lovely staff Nice quiet room which I requested 
164983,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was quite enclosed and got very hot due to not much air getting through the windows needs air condition or more Windows, Was in a great location as we were going to Lyceum theatre to watch lion king
164984,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a hangar left on our door telling us about a Gin offer in the Gin Palace which was actually closed If it s not open don t promote it , Lovely room 106 beautiful clean bathroom friendly staff no fuss just a great classic London hotel In terms of location brilliant
164985,Strand Palace Hotel, We where really disappointed with the bedroom we had it was a treat night away we got given a queen bed that was made up of 2 single beds and was really uncomfortable with the gap in the middle when your time like ours is so precious you just want it to be perfect but I feel strongly that if your offering queen beds that is what they should be I would of rather had a double bed which would of made our experience staying there more pleasurable I feel the location for what we need was very good the Buffett breakfast was very good too ,No Positive
164986,Strand Palace Hotel, We would have expected an executive room to have air conditioning Also the bathroom was dated and tired looking , Beds were extra comfy room clean and tidy 
164987,Strand Palace Hotel, More toiletries please They were hard to divide between us all but great quality , Location was fantastic central for covent garden Westminster the galleries and the river
164988,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff were all extremely welcoming and helpful Loved the fact that you can actually open the room windows unlike most hotels in London these days Great location and immaculately looked after hotel Stayed there about 10 years ago and delighted to see its maintained its standards today 
164989,Strand Palace Hotel, Lack of air conditioning in bedrooms It was during an extremely hot spell There was a fan in the room but it was extremely noisy A swimming pool would have been a bonus far too hot to even look at the gym , Attention courtesy helpfulness and pleasantness of staff Food and facilities were good Would definitely like to bring my grandchildren there to experience the ambience of a grand hotel 
164990,Strand Palace Hotel, No bedside table cracked mirror cracked sink no fridge Unyielding foam pillows , Lovely Staff cleanliness bed location and great entrance and reception and comfort of public areas
164991,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed and Pillows were very uncomfortable Wall very thin so you can hear the people next to you No air conditioning you just have a fan Cooked Breakfast was not good Buffet service eggs undercooked and food cold Some of the staff appeared unfriendly The wardrobes were not wide enough to hang your clothes without creasing shirts I wouldn t stay there again , Good location good sized room 
164992,Strand Palace Hotel, Bar and Breakfast service very average, Reception staff good the room was OK although we upgraded to one with Air Conditioning it was a surprise that a 4Star hotel didn t have Aircon in every room 
164993,Strand Palace Hotel, Noisy work opposite room and shower screen rather dirty at bottom, Option of which floor I preferred and able to checkin early Bed comfy and good biscuits and 2 bottles of water in room Shutters on Windows helped me have a better sleep as blocked out light Fan in room a godsend as weather very hot 
164994,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was tiny There was no air conditioning and it was unbearably hot , The hotel was in an excellent position to see most of the popular attractions 
164995,Strand Palace Hotel, Wheelchair accessability could be improved There s a ramp to the side of the hotel but the doors into the hotel are very heavy and awkward to try open when on your own with the wheelchair , Location of hotel was very good The rooms were very clean and the staff were very helpful The breakfast was lovely as well 
164996,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing, The staff are excellent If there is anything you want they are always ready to assist If you want to sit and have a quiet moment in the lounge then you can without being pestered The Strand is ideally suited for anyone visiting London Covent garden and theatre land right on the doorstep the river and tourist attractions just a short walk away 
164997,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was poor and the rooms were overly warm due to no AC , They were cheap relatively clean in a great location and offered good value for money
164998,Strand Palace Hotel, The cost could be a little lower However we did get a free upgrade to an executive room for our anniversary , The central location facilities quality rooms excellent breakfast 
164999,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was terrible and expensive Rooms very small no fridge or A C Single bed sit Cleaning staff very noisy at early times in morning Make sure you put the Do Not Disturb on the door if you don t want anyone in your room before 8am Bathroom towels have a very bad odour almost like urine Even though were changed everyday This was over 3 weeks of stay No face washers or body washing linen available Had to buy from Boots across the road , Great location and easy to access all Covent Garden and surrounding area
165000,Strand Palace Hotel, All good apart from the kettle in the room had tea leaves in it and hadn t been cleaned The Dawaat restaurant in the hotel served very tiny portions , The breakfast was a good selection Concierge staff very helpful and knowledgable about London Excellent location with staff who were always polite and willing to help 
165001,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing , Only stayed one night Everything was purfect as usual We were upgraded to a standard double The breakfast was excellent Friendly helpful staff 
165002,Strand Palace Hotel, Very small rooms without air con are VERY hot Lots of road noise if you open the windows to try and cool down Disappointing aspect , Good location good breakfast 
165003,Strand Palace Hotel, We cannot give full marks for everything as we are never in the hotel for long enough We have never chosen to eat breakfast or an evening meal in the hotel Choosing an upgrade for a room has worked for us a bit extra space I would prefer a feather pillow but for one night everything is fine , We choose The Strand Palace because of its location The staff are friendly and informative We only ever stay overnight 
165004,Strand Palace Hotel, It might have been better for my nerves not to have had the fire alarm sounding at 9 00 in the evening for a false alarm but better safe than sorry , The attitude of the staff nothing was ever too much trouble Spotlessly clean and comfortable 
165005,Strand Palace Hotel, Very poor customer service at reception I reached there at midnight wanting some rest Staff took some half an hour to go through checks and booking in Such a poor service honestly I dislike from my heart , Location was good 
165006,Strand Palace Hotel, I didn t appreciate the fire alarm going off at 9pm This is the second time this has happened at this hotel Someone smoking in the bedroom With computer systems these days they should be able to tell which room is the problem instead of evacuating the whole hotel Never had this happen before anywhere else , Location location it is perfect for the galleries and theatres I want to visit 
165007,Strand Palace Hotel, Lack of air conditioning In a 4 star hotel it should be a given If premier Inn can have it why can t you In this day and age it s a must , Great location for the theatres and London city Facilities were great and so was the food and cocktails
165008,Strand Palace Hotel, Service at breakfast was slightly slow no fridge in the bedroom had to discuss advertised discount on food and drinks at check out although it was granted in the end, Comfortable large bedroom warm welcome good bars
165009,Strand Palace Hotel, I cannot work out what the doormen are for They can be replaced by a small wooden wedge or an auto door One of them spends his time yelling at the staff , Everything We always stay here when in London Raymond the concierge is the greatest 
165010,Strand Palace Hotel, It was a hot weekend so air conditioning would have been good although there was a fan in the room which was a bonus and helped , The location could t have been any better
165011,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed is quite small for two people , Very very good location so convenient to the monuments But the area has many homeless around quite smelty The bed is quite small for two people The breakfast is so great typical English breakfast and many choices included 
165012,Strand Palace Hotel, There was nothing l didn t like , The rooms were very comfortable The reception staff were very efficient The hotel was in a very convenient location 
165013,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff were clearly over stretched and a little rushed and impatient , I liked the bath robes and slippers the little extras and the excellent level of cleanliness
165014,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing Our most recent stay was excellent , This hotel is conveniently located in central London It is easy to walk to all the major central London tourist hot spots Underground stations are within a short walk and bus stops are adjacent to the hotel Staff are friendly polite and helpful The hotel is always spotlessly clean Rooms are well appointed and have everything you need for a stay in London 
165015,Strand Palace Hotel, Single rooms tend to be small and with no view I understand the reason for this lack of space in central London Very high price , Efficient and very pleasant reception staff clean modern room comfortable bed good and varied breakfast Always nice to stay in this hotel I like the atmosphere and it is a great location for sightseeing shopping and theatres in London 
165016,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning on what was a very hot August weekend quite stuffy as a result The lifts took ages to come only one ever seemed to be in use at a time despite there being three of them , Fantastic location a few minutes walk from many top London points of interest Very friendly and professional service Free computer printer for tickets boarding pass many hotels charge for this so this was a good plus point 
165017,Strand Palace Hotel, The room It was more like a student room on a university campus than a hotel room No curtains but wooden shutters not solid period ones bed pushed against the wall as this was the only way a double would fit in no air conditioning generally other hotels locally represent better value for money and much better comfort , Location only
165018,Strand Palace Hotel, Wasn t impressed with the breakfast over priced and bacon hard and chewy croissants hard and taste horrible this is the only thing that let the hotel dwn everything else was great, Check in fast and friendly all staff friendly when in and around hotel room lovely comfy clean and quite
165019,Strand Palace Hotel, The perfectness of London is also the downside no need for hotels to even have the ambition to stand out and make an effort room too hot too old bed too small I had a double with my daughter bed was 180cm I am 186cm and 120cm wide and the view of room 892 was just redicoulous way overpriced , London is fantastic Strand next to Covent Garden is the perfect location for my daughter who visited the city for the first time and me as a London resident for many years 
165020,Strand Palace Hotel, No air conditioning in standard rooms be warned if visiting in hot weather Room a little on the small side, Great service and location Good mix of facilities available
165021,Strand Palace Hotel, Room size with ref to bed position which was up against the wall at one side Should have booked a larger room I think Will do so next time , All likes already stated
165022,Strand Palace Hotel, The bathroom was poorly equipped and too small The shower flooded the room in spite of correctly using the curtain in the bath Pillows very uncomfortable , Location
165023,Strand Palace Hotel, I would have loved a small fridge in the room , The staff were welcoming and friendly I needed help with printing out an email that I should have brought from home Reception were happy to print it for me which was a great relief 
165024,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Strand Palace It was our first stay there Everything about the hotel was lovely The choice of breakfast was superb displayed and we l organised We enjoyed the comfort of the lounge for coffee and a cake away from the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden The location was ideal a short walk to Joe Allens for evening meal and a drink in the cocktail bar next door first We are looking forward to our next stay 
165025,Strand Palace Hotel, I got very bad reception people who was not friendly to treat me when I asked a coulp of hours check out They can changed price dramatically and the attitude was very bad Sorry have such kind of memories in this hotel since I am the one ofenly travring around word , The people who worked Conciege and house Maid 
165026,Strand Palace Hotel, The room could have been a bit larger but this is Central London , so convenient for the theatre right in the centre of things Room a little small but had all the facilities we needed Breakfast was good 
165027,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed pillows were very hard the sink was cracked water did not empty from sink very well TV control was not working right some staff did not understand English very well Got different answers from different staff concierge did not have enough information to help you I booked it as a 4 but would only class it as a 3 was quite disappointed Would not recommend it as a 4 to friends , Breakfast was nice good area 
165028,Strand Palace Hotel, whilst the cleaning staff were v friendly the rooms could do with a good scrub especially the bathroom and taps etc with the Strand Palace you are definitely paying for location as the hotel is expensive for what you get I found one of the concierge and one doorman quite rude to guests ,No Positive
165029,Strand Palace Hotel, The room It was described as a cosy room A better description would be a sauna Very hot even with the window open and a fan on , Staff very friendly and helpful Location excellent
165030,Strand Palace Hotel, Could find nothing I didnt like was truly impressed and pleased with the whole weekend experience, Tmy toom was a single and having feared it would be like a box i was pleasantly surprised the room was spacious as was the adjoining bathroom My friends shared a cosy room and likewise pleasantly surprised and pleased at the space I cannot fault this hoyel and the location was the best for all tourist lications we walked everywhere 
165031,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms furniture is quite old and no air conditioning in the rooms and quite loud noise combing through the windows even though they are closed, Friendly staff and great location
165032,Strand Palace Hotel, paying for ice come on what is that all about just add 1 to every room and make it free Had to troop down to the concierge get him to make change troop back up to 6th floor etc , Good location comfortable hotel tried to help when we arrived to check in early but room not ready got changed in the gym 
165033,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel was very noisy in the morning not the fault of the hotel probably more other guests , The location is right in the heart of London My room was ready when I arrived at 10 30 am even though it said check in was from 2 pm and I had been upgraded from a cosy single to a standard single at no extra cost The hotel was far more glamorous than the website suggests
165034,Strand Palace Hotel, Slow check in Extremely small room though it was an economy single so I didn t expect it to be large Windows hard to open , Great location handy for theatres Covent Garden restaurants easy to get to the South Bank Tate Modern and Shakespeare s Globe good breakfast staff generally friendly and helpful Nice new bathroom 
165035,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Staff are extremely welcoming and professional Really made you think you d want to return in the future Fantastic location Covent Garden theatreland and Soho on the doorstep Excellent public transport links buses outside the dor tube five minutes walk 
165036,Strand Palace Hotel, Queueing for breakfast Staff in breakfast room a little lacking manners when you are carrying your food to table Although food good bacon very overcooked , Convenient location helpful and attentive staff and suitable overnight hotel for central London visit Lovely hotel 
165037,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel has been refurbished and I feel a bit sorry that no air conditioning has been installed in the rooms especially because the windows can only be opened a little , I liked everything and breakfast is simply super As I am a theaterbuff the location of the hotel is super Buses and tube are within easy reach and many City highlights are within walking distance Staff are very friendly I stayed at the hotel at least 7 times and I hope to be back soon 
165038,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was rather too firm for me , The room space had been well thought out for a budget room The breakfasts were excellent Apart from an occasional plumbing noise the soundproofing was good 
165039,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extremely polite friendly and helpful The room was spotless and the huge bed was very comfortable There was a great variety of food for breakfast and it was all well cooked and attractively presented We can also recommend The Carvery both for quality of food and value for money We particularly appreciated the way we could leave our luggage with the concierge after we had checked out so that we didn t have to lug it around London for the rest of the day 
165040,Strand Palace Hotel, I had unfortunately used Booking com and made a slight error When I called the hotel one member of staff said I would definitely need to contact Booking com again I tried but could not get a response from them so I called the hotel again and another member of staff told me she could make the amendment after all I was grateful that the second member of staff knew what she was doing Next time I shall book directly with the hotel as they give you incentives when you book through them , My room was changed to a quieter part of the hotel as last time I stayed I was woken up very early by bottles being emptied also this time I did not have an adjoining room which was great as you can hear everything through the walls So I finally got the peace and quiet I deserved 
165041,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, My room was billed as cosy which meant very very small but it met my needs as a single traveler and the value was very good considering that this is a full service hotel on The Strand in walking distance to theaters museums and many shops and restaurants 
165042,Strand Palace Hotel, The parsnips on the carvery were partially burnt My room did not have air conditioning although they did give me a fan When I book through your site I usually get an ordinary room This time I got a single which was rather small although the bathroom was very nice , The hotel location suited my activities I could use the bus across the road to get to most places I wanted The staff were also very pleasant Breakfast was good 
165043,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms adequate in size but beware of lowest price level as rooms are tiny If that is what your budget allows then price is very reasonable for city centre, Perfect location for all London attractions and priced fairly for such a central location
165044,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, very happy and surprised when checking in that we had been upgraded and a request made by a family member to the hotel was met they more than fulfilled the ask A very happy newly engaged couple
165045,Strand Palace Hotel, The place is overpriced for the type of room you get If you are single you are better off in a hostel You will get a better accommodation there The rooms have no air conditioning and are closed off from air making it very hot in the rooms and uncomfortable The beds are saggy and are worse than some hostels Not what I would expect from a so called 3 or 4 star hotel I would avoid this place, Good Location
165046,Strand Palace Hotel, Room on the Strand road side and having stayed before this was the first time we stayed on the road won t do it again at night you can really hear the traffic and did affect getting to sleep, Location fantastic for getting around
165047,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great location for walking around the centre of London and close to Trafalgar Square Handy for museums theatres and shops I ll use it again next time I m in London 
165048,Strand Palace Hotel, Very noisy cleaners early in the morning and kept trying to get into the room Maybe update cleaners on who has and hasn t checked out , clean comfortable and value for money
165049,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was tiny no air conditioning so very warm through the night Everything was in the way of the plugs A double bed but against a wall not easy to get in and out off They call it the Cosy Double don t be fooled cosy tiny , The location was good 
165050,Strand Palace Hotel, Room either too hot or too noisy It overlooked the inside area which had some very noisy fans running 24h With closed windows the room was too hot Impossible to get a good night s sleep ,No Positive
165051,Strand Palace Hotel, not even small refridgerator small windows not allowing the air to circulate not clear information about the services in the hotel booklet long time to wait for a lift, great location
165052,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great staff at breakfast and a wide selection of foods Also the hotel gave my husband and I a Happy Birthday muffin which was in the room for us 
165053,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms a bit small for the price we paid but well appointed I guess if you had masses of luggage it could be a problem This wasn t an issue for us as we were over nighters , it is a very comfortable hotel with bars and restaurants within striding distance The hotel facilities are superb if you are feeling to lazy to go out Location is great
165054,Strand Palace Hotel, The WiFi never worked in my room , The location and cleanliness I was upgraded to a double room from the single room I had booked so making it good value for the centre of London 
165055,Strand Palace Hotel, Very uncomfortable and stiflingly hot I contemplated sleeping in the lobby as it seemed to be the only place that had air conditioning Not worth a fraction of the price it commands , Very close to Covent Garden
165056,Strand Palace Hotel, Room and bathroom too small The cost didn t justify what was probably the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel Other people I spoke to in the bar said the same so it wasn t just our room , Location
165057,Strand Palace Hotel, In order to check in two hours early to our cleaned and ready room the front desk required a 20 pound fee Perhaps worth it but we skipped the option and went to have lunch There s no fee to have them hold your luggage , The breakfast buffet offered a convenient tasty option that was a really good buy The fitness room in the hotel was adequate to provide a good workout in a pleasant setting The hotel is a terrific buy in terms of its good amenities and the excellent location 
165058,Strand Palace Hotel, Ridiculously small room even for London no A C bit too expensive for what you get, Location cleanliness housekeeping staff check in and check out Luggage storage after check out
165059,Strand Palace Hotel, Asked for room to be decorated for birthday Was told it could be possible Asked what time we would be out On our return nothing had been done , Had a gift of breakfast in bed but the pastries were very dry Bed not big enough for a 6 foot plus male 
165060,Strand Palace Hotel, Not being able to open windows very hot in bedroom bathroom, We have stayed here before great location and staff mostly helpful Lady on check in was really helpful as we had a few rooms and she helped sort our booking out Thank you again and we look forward to returning 
165061,Strand Palace Hotel, Room not ready when arrived Second morning breakfast delayed by lack of staff We booked an executive room and felt it wasn t value for money , Location is Excellent Cleanliness is excellent 
165062,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was absolutely airless to the point of stifling although I had an extre night booked I decided to leave one night early as I couldn t stand another night of roasting in hell I had a single room one night facing a wall so changed to a double not much bigger still facing a wall and like an oven Also they were very unbending about changing one night s accommodation for me to another although in money terms it wouldn t have changed anything for them and the room was available it would have made another loyal customer for them it is not great to shoot themselves in the foot by some silly rules that can be adjusted in special circumstances Every customer counts and word of mouth is still the best or worst advert The hotel is called grand but in fact it is a very tired hotel and needs an update badly I would be spending my money somewhere else in the future, The staff were nice but scatty two mornings my tea and gluten free bread took over 20 minutes to get to me not great when you need to be at work
165063,Strand Palace Hotel, small room with very noisy extractor fans from outside our room also the fans generated heat which made our room unbearable to sleep in, location was excellent
165064,Strand Palace Hotel, the size of the room and bed and that it was againt the wall there was no aircon only a fan which was too noisey , the location the efficiency of the staff
165065,Strand Palace Hotel, First room was noisy but then I was moved to another one which was perfect , Nice food cosy room excelente location really close to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square Served by Picadilly Line excelent if you re arriving from Heathrow Airport 
165066,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was good but not great Like many London hotels very busy and they struggle at times to deal with the numbers at reception and in the restaurant , Great location Easy walk to Trafalgar Square or Theatres Lots of restaurants around Had an executive room which was a good size quiet and comfortable This is our second stay and equally as good 
165067,Strand Palace Hotel, There was a heat wave in London and the rooms were not air conditioned It was hard to sleep and impossible to rest in the room We had to hang in the lobby to stay cool The rooms were also very small for twin rooms , I liked the service and I liked the facilities the lobby the restaurant the concierge etc The location was perfect for us 
165068,Strand Palace Hotel, Everything was fine echo the view from the window but that could be changed Perhaps air conditioning could be installed but a fan was provided, Room was spacious and well equipped and very quiet
165069,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms were far to small described as COZY small should be the word not cozy Bath rooms dated as well So for the money I won t be staying again , location
165070,Strand Palace Hotel, We went for an executive suite However this was just a normal room by all accounts Fabulously big bed but some furnishings looking a bit tired and the bathroom was tiny Also for an executive suite the room itself was actually quite small , The location is fabulous very close to Covent Garden and the theatres Easy to get to and great customer service by all the staff who served us Lots of facilities available too The breakfast which came with the Executive Room was very good indeed 
165071,Strand Palace Hotel, For cost would have hoped to have air con in the room A fan was provided but not sufficient to keep the room cool without the window open which meant street noise Bed small and uncomfortable , Super location close to tube and local attractions Good restaurants close by Well presented room 
165072,Strand Palace Hotel, Not a major problem but there was a bit of a wait at reception when checking in and out Another member of staff to receive guests would have been welcome , Clean good facilities pleasant helpful staff good food good location 
165073,Strand Palace Hotel, Air conditioning in room We were there during a heat wave , Location was perfect was right in the middle of everything Walking distance to all places of interest 
165074,Strand Palace Hotel, Queuing up for breakfast or being guided to a makeshift breakfast space is no fun, The perfect location Walkable to all the main sites shopping and right across the best musicals in town
165075,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom very compact shower over bath awkward and not that easy to control water direction Toilet in bathroom needed fixing during our stay poor flush Room very hot , The location near theatres Covent garden is excellent Concierge staff were especially pleasant helpful Very good breakfast Cleanliness A Would stay again if visiting London 
165076,Strand Palace Hotel, Do not rely on the pictures as a guide as the rooms are smaller than pictured Not great value for money in terms of the room but we were not in it that often so it didn t affect us too much , Great central location Very clean and upmarket lobby area and bar restauraunt area 
165077,Strand Palace Hotel, This older property only has air conditioning in the lobby so in summer and warmer days of spring you ll be using the provided oscillating fan and an open window to cool off There is a heating radiator for winter I think my son was a little disappointed that the rooms were rather Spartan compared to the sparkling lobby but a hotel should never be the reason for your travel , Hotel location is terrific and central Covent Garden for seeing London near bridges museums The Eye theatre so much within walking distance and the rest a short cab ride or tube ride away The rooms are clean and well taken care of for an older property Beds are okay 
165078,Strand Palace Hotel, Old fashioned rooms and no air conditioning, Great facilities and breakfast was excellent Female staff member in gin palace was great and dealt with some difficult customers very well 
165079,Strand Palace Hotel, Lower price of the breakfast would have made this perfect or possibly some discount to breakfast places nearby , The gentlemen at the front doors I just love them created a real British feeling and made us so happy and appreciated quests Also the lobby is nice and peaceful a real contrast to one who steps in from the Strand 
165080,Strand Palace Hotel, Room wasn t ready when we turned up to check in and they didn t seem to have a clue why and we waited for an hour to get the room key , Location spot on
165081,Strand Palace Hotel, It was much too hot in the room which was on the second floor With the window open there was something industrial pumping out noise and heat all night just under the window so sleep was impossible There was no air conditioning and when I inquired having booked a single room I was told that there was only air conditioning in double rooms and I should have booked that This was not made apparent when I booked online and also would have meant a significant cost increase in an already expensive hotel Also they charged for ice the ice machine on the 1st floor cost 1 for a small tub of ice I have never stayed in a hotel which charged for ice from the ice machine , The mattress felt good very firm And the towels were large 
165082,Strand Palace Hotel, With being only overnight we did not have any qualms , Stayed in a variety of hotels in past and had the most uncomfortable of sleep the Strand offered quietness and a very comfortable night s rest 
165083,Strand Palace Hotel, 1 rooms were smaller then a prison cell 2 invest in some air conditioning boiling hot 3 had to have a very warm shower as the showers were broken 4 receptionist wouldn t let us check into our rooms unless all our guests we re present we booked 2 rooms as one was a surprise for the birthday boy she was rude until we explained the situation 5 rooms were not ready by the time we got there and this was at 6 pm 6 bed was very small and uncomfortable 7 definitely a waste of 380 00 for 2 rooms wouldn t even pay 50 00 for both the rooms, Lobby was presentable everything else was awful 
165084,Strand Palace Hotel, It s a huge hotel with many rooms on inner courts Because of a late booking we had a room on the first floor with barely any view on the court wall and sunlight next to the maids room quite noisy unless you plan to study Polish 4 star price for a one star situation Check the room floor and situation if you can, Although the chief receptionist was a cold poker face employees were very nice and helpful The gym is a real plus The hotel is well located to visit most of London although you will have to walk a bit for the nearest tube stations Temple and Embankment The building itself is not astonishing and brand new but the room are very well cleaned and bathrooms are convenient and neat It s close to many theaters if you plan to attend shows Covent Garden is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel 
165085,Strand Palace Hotel, A bit noisy with window open but fine with earplugs , Clean and modern Unbeatable location Room was small but perfectly adequate if you re out and about most of the time Good breakfast and pleasant and efficient staff 
165086,Strand Palace Hotel, room was expensive but as we paid for location it was to be expected I suppose , location to convent garden which we love was excellent lots shops pubs and restaurants 
165087,Strand Palace Hotel, Restaurant for breakfast was quite small given the size of the hotel however food was good , Staff were exceptionally friendly we didn t eat in the hotel for dinner but can strongly recommend the gin palace for a nightcap yumi 
165088,Strand Palace Hotel, Found the breakfast area rather crowded and cramped Food just average Charging 5 pounds per night to leave luggage is a joke also having to pay for a map the first hotel ever to do this, Excellent location comfortable beds and clean Friendly and helpful staff
165089,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing all good, There was so much to like about this hotel Traditional feel in a modern setting location close to Covent Garden theatres and the Thames Staff were very professional but also very friendly and genuinely polite Very good value for money including drinks a food that was not part of the booking an absolute gem of a hotel 
165090,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was horrible could of done with more healthy options ie Museli don t waste your money Room was too dark and gloomy , Great bathroom and bath Staff were friendly and helpful 
165091,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was too hot couldn t open the windows wide enough to get some fresh air in so neither of us got much sleep The view was bad into some scruffy courtyard with other windows but that didn t bother us that much I guess we got what we paid for , Loved the location the breakfast and the decor of the hotel The staff were very friendly and polite 
165092,Strand Palace Hotel, Second time to stay here 4th floor is far more dated than the 2nd Smaller old fashioned room Could hear the people next door , The receptionist was very welcoming and friendly The location is great 
165093,Strand Palace Hotel, This Hotel is advertised as 4 star The room we booked was a standard room It was small the bed was small pillows uncomfortable no air con and the room was hot if the window was open the noise from the street was very loud problems with the plumbing very noisy,No Positive
165094,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, It was amazing the staff were great the facilities were very good it was quiet Not to hot and not to cold very good shower Will definitely go back there on our next visit to London everything was within walking distance and if you didn t want to walk buses and trains were very easy to get to I haven t got any bad comments or regrets the whole visit was brilliant 
165095,Strand Palace Hotel, Small expensive rooms 3 toilet repairs in 6 days Maintenance twice tried and failed to solve TV tuning problems friends had similar TV problem Hotel lounge refused to show Euro 2016 on their TV 1 of 2 treadmills and 1 of 2 bikes were down for maintenance , Beautiful hotel with nice staff in terrific location Small but OK fitness center Manager gave us 15 GBP voucher and bottle of sparkling wine to partly make up for maintenance problems but would not adjust room rate 
165096,Strand Palace Hotel, I asked for a quiet room Away from lifts It was away from lifts but it wasn t quiet There was noise from either air conditioning units or electrical unit It woke me up a couple of times I cant put my finger on what the noise was but it did disturb my sleep Left luggage not very well run bit chaotic Little bit dismissive surly , Location and check in lady great Clean room and bed very comfortable
165097,Strand Palace Hotel, Some of the items from the breakfast where cold , The location the availability of the staff Some of the staff on the day of my departure from the hotel went beyond the limit and showed excellent customer service 
165098,Strand Palace Hotel, Lighting in bathroom could be better, Warm and friendly greeting speedy check in Room comfortable and spotless dressing gowns and slippers what a treat Super breakfast lots of lovely fresh fruit
165099,Strand Palace Hotel, the breakfast was okay the vegetables didn t look edible the tomatoes weren t cooked the room was way to hot and noisy, The staff were friendly
165100,Strand Palace Hotel, No air con meant the room would most likely be hot during high Summer , The room was very clean the location fantastic the bath tub was perfect for soothing tired limbs All in all a very enjoyable experience of London 
165101,Strand Palace Hotel, Noisy pipes in the bathroom But they got a plumber Housekeeping knocked really early on the day I was checking out , The bar staff and carvery staff were lovely The blackout shutters on the window made it easier to sleep and the room was quiet 
165102,Strand Palace Hotel, lunch could have been complementary similar to other hotels , the best thing about the place is its location the facility is ok although my room was a bit small but overall i had a pleasant stay and a good experience 
165103,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very hot and only a quilt on the bed Would have been nice to have the option of a sheet instead Other than that the hotel was perfect for what we wanted and was great value for money , Location
165104,Strand Palace Hotel, Older staff disjointed Night staff some trouble with English and basic service Small rooms No AC, Great location close to palace Thames attractions and great pubs
165105,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing, Breakfast is excellent plus bar food although bit pricy but it is London and no dearer than anywhere else Cant fault the hotel and cleanliness of rooms best i know
165106,Strand Palace Hotel, Evening dinner could have been better Told I was upgraded but in reality it was a disability room on the first floor Traffic noise a minor irritation , Breakfast was good Location good for my business purpose 
165107,Strand Palace Hotel, There was no toilet brush in the toilet and only cleaned on 2nd day and bedsheets were not changed for the whole 3 days, Concierge porter service great location
165108,Strand Palace Hotel, More choice of non cooked food Fresh fruit Healthier options, Room very small for two people not value for money Very poor breakfast not worth the money so glad we only paid 10
165109,Strand Palace Hotel, We did ask for early check in due to having tickets to a matinee at the theatre so we could get ready and this was agreed in advance and a payment of 20 was agreed for this but on arrival they had no rooms available for early check so this was cancelled , The location was brilliant walking distance to everywhere and plenty to do and see Hotel was lovely and staff were very helpful 
165110,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was quite basic and small even though we was given an upgrade for the price we paid was hoping for something a bit more spacious, Location excellent
165111,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was not comfy the room cleaners woke me up The bar does not sell good old British pints of beer Only expensive bottle beer at this hotel How can you have a London Hotel not selling British pints of beer , The location and price
165112,Strand Palace Hotel, Cleanness of rooms could ve been better Room was tidy but could use some refresh Facilities like the gym was a misunderstanding with not all functional gear and ppl queue to use it , Location the main option I ve chosen this hotel wasn t disappointed Staff was helpful and understanding 
165113,Strand Palace Hotel, The single room had no a c No access to open the minute window The bathroom was so small it was difficult to move around Bed was hard Room was tired could do with updating, Good size TV in the room It was very quiet considering location Friendly staff
165114,Strand Palace Hotel, The sound insulation was very poor I could hear exactly what was going on in the next bathroom and felt like I was sleeping in the corridor with the noise from passing people Also the solid wooden shutters at the window made the room really dark , The room was very clean and tastefully decorated and the bed was really comfy All staff I came across were polite friendly and helpful

165116,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was a little dated for the price you pay The restaurant manager was a little pushy trying to turn tables when it was not that busy for breakfast I noticed some guests were not to happy with him , The location was perfect for walking and getting around London And the staff at the front desk and concierge were professional and quite personable 
165117,Strand Palace Hotel, Telephone was dead toilet flush is not that good We paid about 300USD night feel little bit overpriced , The location can not be better we could walk many iconic places and access to several lines in 5min walk I am really glad we stayed at this hotel Concierge was excellent

165121,Strand Palace Hotel, Room overlooking the Strand was quite noisy when the windows were open , Was upgraded which is always nice Doorman was very helpful getting me a taxi in torrential rain 
165122,Strand Palace Hotel, Bit on the expensive side for just one but I m worth it , Totally convenient for my trip to Art Galleries and meeting friends Fresh juicey apple available on desk at reception which was a nice touch after walking down to the Strand from Euston Plus I was given fresh water to drink while I checked in 
165123,Strand Palace Hotel, Not value for money Room like a cell No air conditioning If there hadn t been a fan to use I would have left as humidity affects my health , Staff friendly
165124,Strand Palace Hotel, Everything was great, We have used this hotel several times the staff are very polite and helpful last time we stayed they upgraded us to executive room which was great food is also very good
165125,Strand Palace Hotel, Could have done with a fridge in the room but wasn t a major problem , Super location excellent for theatre area Very helpful staff Well worth a stay 
165126,Strand Palace Hotel, Hotel rooms need a make over e g some bathroom fittings were missing and must be at least 20 years old Room was also small , Great location especially for theatres galleries and London sites generally 
165127,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms are very small but they are ok for London standards Lobby decor is very old fashioned with fish tanks , Best location ever near metro station Covent Garden many many many good restaurants expensive and cheap good service for what the hotel is its location etc it offers a GREAT cost benefit relation I would stay in Strand Palace again and will recommend it to everybody

165130,Strand Palace Hotel, The cooked breakfast had been sitting under the heat lamps for too long so had dried out but the rest was great croissants and fruit cheese and ham etc , Comfortable bed cosy rooms are small but not an issue as a base when you re staying in London The 8th floor had a great view of the storms across London too 
165131,Strand Palace Hotel, Choice of room far too small We did not understand how small a cosy room would be Next time we will be more careful Noisy fan somewhere near our room , Breakfast was too cool the first morning I told them Next morning fine Friendly staff throughout Sheer convenience of the location Choice of tubes stations and the contactless card makes journeying on the Underground so easy for northern Scots as well as others I presume Great tailor next door G R Check them out for yourselves Walking is easy around here Covent Garden has lots going on any day and you can always stop to be entertained in the pedestrian area 
165132,Strand Palace Hotel, The queue to get into breakfast , The room was a good size shower was powerful The breakfast fresh plentiful and the scrambled egg so moist and fluffy 
165133,Strand Palace Hotel, Think drinks but pricey and room a bit small toilet squashed behind the door but was ok for 1 night , The hotel is lovely staff very friendly although wasn t sure to tip the porter and think annoyed him But he was helpful and pleasant It s good location for the west end if going to shows and Covent Garden is a short walk away It s quite expensive as in London and thought room was bit small for the price but clean and tidy The man who you give bags too was brilliant and very helpful Couldn t fault the place Great place to go also good was nice for breakfast 
165134,Strand Palace Hotel, Can not understand why when I booked over the internet that I was quoted 20 per head for breakfast which I was willing to pay 80 for four breakfasts on my visa card and when I got to the hotel and said I would like to pay hotel and breakfast in cash instead of my Visa card Breakfast dropped straight away to 10 per head Also I booked an early arrival booking lunch time nothing was mentioned about the extra 20 fee I had to pay until I arrived at the hotel I think you should give better details to those hotel sites internet you have your details on I will stay again at your hotel but will certainly not include breakfast until I arrive and pay cash for them at 10 per head cheaper Mx, Breakfast s was good the room was very clean and nice hotel staff very helpful and pleasant We enjoyed our stay at The Strand Palace thank you Mx

165138,Strand Palace Hotel, 1 Room seemed soulless 2 Breakfast just OK big queue for it on 2nd morning at 9am and so didn t bother went round corner into Covent Garden for breakfast , Location for Covent Garden and theatreland Much cheaper than other comparable hotels in vicinity
165139,Strand Palace Hotel, The staff were not helpful upon arrival when my 22 year old son and I arrived to find we were sharing a small bed together after booking online I realise this might have been my fault although I thought I had booked 2 X single beds They were not helpful in resolving this smoothly and quickly instead focast on charging an extra 40 to 60 GBP We were not impressed and in my 15 years of travel have never experienced this Normally if there are issues on arrival the staff are more than happy to accomodate and move people to assist with their requests This was certainly not the case , The location
165140,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms were far to small for the price that was paid and they were not very clean The view out of the window was poor , The location was excellent 
165141,Strand Palace Hotel, My room was extremely noisy as of the evening till the morning A mad noise like a plane engine This was very bad and disappointing that such nice hotel have such noisy rooms These rooms should never be rented if they are next to super noisy engine rooms , Excellent location at 2 min from Covent Garden and 5 min from Charing Cross underground station Very lively and nice area

165151,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast service was just satisfactory Tables need to be cleared whilst you are still sitting there and getting more to eat as the tables are small and have no extra room for finished dishes , Position was great to walk to most tourist attractions or bus or underground Covent Gardens market behind hotel Also very close to West End Theatres 
165152,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast to be seated in the dark Indian restaurant and tables being set for lunch around us while we were still eating our breakfast , Everything was good
165153,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel charged me for 3 rooms each at 205 for the same night after the booking system crashed without issuing a confirmation and I had to try again Hotel completely disinterested in refunding the 410 extra they charged me after an obvious problem with the booking system Hotel is too automated to care about actual customer service,No Positive
165154,Strand Palace Hotel, although clean and just about airy enough the room is rather small and i would say rudimentary No curtains no wall deorations the shower mixer is identical the one I installed at my home 40 years ago the bath mixer is dated I have stayed at the Strand Palace many many times and i would say room 339 does not live up to the level my past experience , the location is excellent the staff very courteous and efficient breakfast is ample and good factiliteis in the public areas are also very good and the general atmosphere fits that of a busy establisment in a metropolitan city thumbs up all the way

165158,Strand Palace Hotel, On arrival we were met with a queue of people all being told their rooms were not read this was at 14 00 the designated time for booking in and that there would be a wait of no more than 1 hour 1 1 4 hours later I again approached he reception desk only to be told that my room was still not ready I was not happy with this and after a discussion with the reception manager another room was found for me and my husband We are both pensioners and had already had a 3 hour journey into London What we didn t need was this delay without even an offer of a cup of tea coffee whilst we waited Not a good start especially for a hotel of this standing , Great location for theatres Food very tasty and varied Maid who looked after our room excellent 
165159,Strand Palace Hotel, Cosy rooms really are cosy One side against wall web photo misleading, Reception staff brilliant Carmeal spelling might be wrong exceptional on PM Fri 10th
165160,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing was a lovely first experience in this hotel, The most amazing customer service from all the hotel staff It was my 60th Birthday and I was provided with a few gifts from Management really made my stay here 100 Thank you Strand Palace Hotel

165163,Strand Palace Hotel, The price was too much for a single room with tiny window that you can t even see anything It was too noticeable that the very end of the leftover space was used for this single room , Location was great
165164,Strand Palace Hotel, You pay a significant price premium for having so much in walking distance Its your choice Aside from that there was nothing to complain about, Nice building and could not be more convenient Bathroom better than similar London hotels We had a small room described as cosy Adequate by London standards Breakfast was good and good value I ve used many London hotels and this is good In this case we were booked to a theatre and restaurant across the street so location was very important 
165165,Strand Palace Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 6am these things happen and there was very little communication about what was going on where to go etc Breakfast was fine but unspectacular and the staff were brusque one was quite pushy when I said I was on my own and wanted my own table rather than being seated with the stranger in front of me , The room was large clean and remarkably quiet for a room facing onto the Strand Location was excellent I would stay agan

165180,Strand Palace Hotel, My only negative feedback is that we booked an Executive King room with Air Conditioning The Air Con wasn t very good And the fact that they charge extra for rooms with it you would expect it to be in better working order , We were getting married at a nearby venue and many people in our party were staying at the Strand Palace The hotel could not have been more accommodating in the lead up They let us request early check in s and grouped together rooms so that people were nearby each other

165204,Strand Palace Hotel, I traveled with my 16yr old grandaughter We had booked a twin bed room and were given a double bed room Room was very small Also I thought asking 20 for an early check in was a bit much considering the full amount of our stay was taken from my account back in January So after traveling through the night and arriving in hotel at 9 00am we had to wait until 2 pm for our room Only 2 powerpoints in room one used for a table lamp Not great when trying to charge up multiple devices , Location Friendly staff Good food Great shower

165277,Strand Palace Hotel, For a 4 star hotel in such a great location they should be ashamed it could be something special and probably was at one time Looked dirty or perhaps tired and dated would be better words think 70 s Most of the staff could not care less but some were very nice Food not good at all had better meals at the Premier Inn Could not get the heating to work rang for assistance and neither could the maintenance guy On check in we were charged extra an extra 20 to take the room earlier then allocated a tiny room although we had paid extra for a larger executive double room When I spoke to reception I was told that we had been allocated the correct room Eventually but only after being very insistant they admitted they had made a mistake with our room and give me the keys to the executive double we had ordered The new room was unmistakable because of the big brass plaque on the door which said incredibly Executive Double What a scam if we had said nothing about the room they could have resold our room as an upgrade or similar Wont be booking again to stay at the Stand Palace shame because it could be a great hotel , Comfy bed and location Sorry but cannot think of anything else

165283,Strand Palace Hotel, cost of single room expensive If you are put in a single room it should be only half price of that for a double room, everything as it should be staff very polite nice breakfast great location
165284,Strand Palace Hotel, No real welcome or warmth from the staff who all seemed harrassed and overworked Discovering a dirty quilt cover at bedtime was unforgiveable Had to wait for housekeeping to come and change it The bar service was very poor after being ignored for almost 15 minutes had to ask to be served Breakfast service was worse Even in executive dining they use some kind of wipe clean cloth almost like plastic which was so wet when we sat down that we had to use the paper napkins to dry it The breakfast service was extremly slow and the quality was not good Dried up bacon undercooked egg cold beans And tea that was so weak it struggled to crawl out of the pot unaided Not worth the money , The only good aspect is the location near theatres Covent Garden and the Thames Upgraded to an executive room which was a good size but awful view see pic

165299,Strand Palace Hotel, Room 912 is a shocker We paid a premium for an executive room as it was our wedding anniversary The lift noise and a dripping water noise from the radiator kept us awake all night When we complained in the morning we were treated with utter contempt Manish the so called guest relations manager was a complete disgrace keeping us waiting for 20 minutes and then taking 3 internal phone calls whilst attending to us Everyone there are hundreds of hotels on Booking com in London avoid this one , The location is fantastic

165319,Strand Palace Hotel, Two separate blankets would have been nice The room was tiny The check in process was painfully slow but I think it was because there was a trainee behind the desk The charge for an adapter 5 pounds was a rip off plus the concierge selling them was unfriendly , The location was perfect The room was clean 
165320,Strand Palace Hotel, We used the restaurant before our night out and was going to use the deal card from our room door to have the carvery I can t have alcohol and asked if I was able to have a soft drink with it instead of the Ale or wine and was told no I do feel that that should be changed not everyone can have or want alcohol so also it would of been nice to have a bath mat when stepping out of the shower bath as it could be slippery and you don t really want to put your towel on the floor , The beds were so comfortable best sleep I ve had in ages And the breakfast was great All staff were lovely and friendly Couldn t of found a better place to stay I came with my son it was his 18th and he was thrilled with it all Would of stayed longer if it had been possible

165328,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing A suggestion though Perhaps it might be time to think about a staff fund container visible to all guests to which one can contribute instead of giving tips to individuals who are present but those not present miss out , After staying at this establishment periodically for over twenty years and having praised it year after year very little to add The quality of the multicultural staff suggests very good training for dealing with customers from diverse backgrounds Indeed with such drastic cultural changes in staff and clientele it is to your credit that even old dowager and stiff upper types types can still be seen in the hotel And as usual special thanks to the front entrance guardians

165350,Strand Palace Hotel, We did not have the breakfast option and there is nothing that I could fault with our room or the service , The staff were extremely helpful and I was able to move rooms as the original one we had was on the main road and very noisy They found me a lovely quiet room Perfect for London sleeping

165357,Strand Palace Hotel, Very small room Old and outdated bathroom utilities Wind was coming through the window a little bit , Great Location in Covent Garden a lot of theaters and history sites within a few minutes walk Overall clean room Very welcoming staff 
165358,Strand Palace Hotel, had breakfast the second morning of our stay in the executive breakfast room this was very poor compared to the selfservice which was very good value, all sightseeing within walking distance of the hotel location excellant
165359,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The ATM machine in the hotel availability of concierge and luxury lounge Its location is awesome close to metro Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square There are many restaurants markets and stores around 
165360,Strand Palace Hotel, The guy who took our bags when we arrived too early to check in was quite abrupt, A box of chocolates were left for my daughter as I told them it was her 18th birthday
165361,Strand Palace Hotel, that our room window looked out onto a wall also the room was dark this was probably because the window looked out onto a wall , breakfast very nice beds comfy staff friendly and helpful
165362,Strand Palace Hotel, The decor and furnishings in the rooms could do with being up graded We did not eat breakfast there as at 18 95 we found it too expensive , The location is excellent it is a very nice comfortable hotel with friendly staff 
165363,Strand Palace Hotel, Room needs refurbishing Everything seems old and worn out and on the verge of breaking , The best thing about this hotel is the location Otherwise value for money is not so great 
165364,Strand Palace Hotel, The sink in the bathroom was too tiny The room also was very small The building looks very nice from outside and also the reception When I made the booking I was with the impression that it was a 4 hotel however we were informed at the desk that it was a 3 hotel When we got in the room yes you could tell that it was not a 4 hotel , Rich breakfast Very nice location 
165365,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was extremely basic considering the location and also how the hotel looks within the reception area The walls to the next room are also very thin as could hear people talking next door , Very central location easy access to Charing Cross tube station and Covent Garden 
165366,Strand Palace Hotel, I was not impressed with the concierge services After being sold tour tickets and advised that it was cheaper to buy at the hotel I learned otherwise Additionally I was never advised to purchase audio tours and found that I had to do this independently each and every time I was not given steady advice for using the tube or bus system and often found that my own research faired better than what was offered The concierge also did not seem as informed about the restaurants in the area , The location was very central to both the Charing Cross and Covent Garden Tube Stations and short walk to the bridge It was very nice to be greeted by doormen every time we returned to the hotel Very clean 
165367,Strand Palace Hotel, Bathroom facilities look tired Breakfast was poor under cooked eggs and generally not of a standard for a central London hotel charging these room rates , The check in process was swift and efficient very polite staff 
165368,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was noisy I could clearly hear all the time when somebody closed the door in another room nearby I woke up at night several times because of this , The excellent location 
165369,Strand Palace Hotel, Beds a little hard House keeping staff were a bit noisy in the hallway and started knocking on doors to clean at about 7 30 every morning even weekends which i think is a bit early Location and friendly portiers and concierges made it worth the price though , Location is excellent Friendly portiers and concierges Clean 
165370,Strand Palace Hotel, No complaints no mini bar for snacks but the in room cookies were nice , Breakfast was excellent each morning great selection The Wi Fi was good and staff very helpful 
165371,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location very central easy walk to sights restaurants theatres and galleries Good transport links Helpful staff clean room and spacious public areas I had a quiet Cosy Double fine for one person with good walk in shower Wifi worked fine after initial problem sorted out efficiently by help staff 
165372,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very cramped and the view out of our window was of a stained courtyard filled with vents and what looked like aircon units Hardly the dynamic city view we were after, Breakfast was a great selection and very tasty The bed was very comfy and good pressure shower
165373,Strand Palace Hotel, The windows were old and therefore a lot of wind was coming in , Staff was very friendly consierge gave us great tips Location is fantastic and I would choose this hotel again 
165374,Strand Palace Hotel, View was hoping for a view of something strand or Thames had a view of square of other rooms and daylight was way up we must have been in middle of hotel Thought room would have been a bit bigger , Luggage storage as arrived mid am could leave case and go out for the day Big bathroom and liked shutters on window 
165375,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was too small and far from being well designed The corridors were full of dirty trays that remained there after more than 3 hours The lobby was packed with people looking as if they were camping there The bars looked and were served as cheap bus station shops You feel like being in an improvised post emergency accommodation at some times but at the price of a four star hotel , The location is convenient Being a big hotel announced a standard business hotel service that was not at all the actual case 
165376,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Nice clean hotel central for sightseeing and business in London The breakfast buffet was well stocked even at peak times and the staff helpful Both Covent Garden and Trafalar Square are a short walk from the hotel 
165377,Strand Palace Hotel, luggage storage person was not very friendly the breakfast room was not really clean there were food splashes on the walls near my table, Aquariums in The foyer they fixed my luggage 
165378,Strand Palace Hotel, My room was near the lifts and I could hear all the accompanying sounds the room s walls are pretty thin The full English breakfast was average nothing special The vending machine on my floor was out of order for the duration of my stay No fridge mini bar in the room , The staff were helpful and friendly The location is excellent for most of the to do things in the west end of London The sliding wooden shutters really made the room cosy and pitch black for sleeping My room was on the 6th floor and I heard no sound coming up from the city at all The bathroom although small had a excellent shower Free wi fi was good and I got a fast connection 
165379,Strand Palace Hotel, I won t ask for a quiet room away from lifts etc in future as this guarantees that such a request will be ignored Good choice of food for breakfast but it would be a rare treat if for once the so called hot food was actually hot not lukewarm I could do without the overly officious behaviour of the manager in the breakfast area if I visit again , Central location is excellent and hotel comfortable it s better to avoid the budget rooms if you don t want to feel cramped and your wallet can stand it 
165380,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was a bit creaky and the walls were quite thin consequently the room was a bit noisy , Checking in and out were quick and efficient the staff were cheery and polite Room was reasonably well appointed clean and with decent facilities
165381,Strand Palace Hotel, At 82 years of age more help with luggage would have been appreciated , The location Central London on your doorstep and at a reasonable price by comparison with other hotels in the area 
165382,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very hot There was no fan in the bathroom so after a shower bath it was too steamed up and we weren t able to use the mirror , The room was very clean and the location perfect
165383,Strand Palace Hotel, Waitress in restaurant at breakfast quite rude Tea and coffee left sitting on a table waiting to be served not fresh or hot , Location perfect for a quick visit to London The room was small however for a short stay served its purpose 
165384,Strand Palace Hotel, Even though I have requested early check in prior to arrival when I arrived at 7 am after the whole night flight the receptionists told me they cannot do anything and that I should come back around 14 00 when the check in hours starts I was cold and tired and yet needed to wait the whole morning to get accommodation This is not acceptable , Location
165385,Strand Palace Hotel, The shower wasn t nearly tall enough I m 6 3 but even a person of average height would have struggled to stand up straight , Staff were helpful and friendly and the gym facilties were good 
165386,Strand Palace Hotel, Honestly there is nothing I didn t like , Hotel is in the centre of London but we heard no noise We always stay in Strand Palace when we visit London love the location staff 
165387,Strand Palace Hotel, The noise from the street and the other rooms was terribly loud There s no real insulation anywhere so don t expect to get any sleep , The buffet breakfast made up for a bad nights sleep 
165388,Strand Palace Hotel, View was a solid wall Breakfast was extremely busy and quite chaotic , Nice friendly atmosphere Location excellent for Covent Garden and theatres within walking distance for great restaurants 
165389,Strand Palace Hotel, We had a slight problem we asked for clean towels as we had used the ones available but did not get them until housekeeping tidied the room the next morning, the location suited us as we were going to theatres and tourist attractions nearby the room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable 
165390,Strand Palace Hotel, The lounge bar was dated and not overly comfortable Breakfast a good selection but tasteless fruit , Bed very comfortable staff very helpful especially reception and porters 
165391,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was small could only get in one side of the bed as there was a wall tight on other side, Great location very clean and friendly good food nothing was any bother for the staff
165392,Strand Palace Hotel, I was thoroughly dissapointed by my room which I had already to change due to noisy ventilation It was loud cold because of a broken window and a noisy heating Not what I was used to from former stays , For Theatre lovers it s a splendid place to stay 
165393,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very small although it was very clean , Very good breakfast the drop scones in particular were excellent Location is fantastic for the theatres Covent Garden Leicester Square etc 
165394,Strand Palace Hotel, Queue 20mins for breakfast queue 20mins to check in queue 20mins to check out rooms very small hotel is dated and ageing, Location great for Covent Garden wifi good
165395,Strand Palace Hotel, Walls are as thin as cardboard The people in the room next door won t need to use a telephone to speak to you you ll be able to hear what they re saying through the wall , Great location for central London 
165396,Strand Palace Hotel, The basic room was pretty small with the bed right against the wall Not much more to say as generally good for the money , Fabulous location near to Covent Garden Trafalgar Square and all the theatres The hotel was warm clean and cosy Breakfast was very good fresh food with a good choice 
165397,Strand Palace Hotel, Booked a double room although small the room no bigger than a glorified single room the double bed was one side stuck to the wall it felt like we eere in a kiddies bedroom , The clenliness and location were good
165398,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing really , I loved the bed Overall the hotel is very comfortable and the staff pleasant and helpful I was particularly impressed when I had inadvertently left my door ajar in mid afternoon when a member of security staff knocked on the door to check that all was well I am also a big fan of the excellent fish buffet at lunchtimes something which together with the location of the hotel will tend to draw me back in future AND it s a terrific breakfast 
165399,Strand Palace Hotel, That although we asked quite in advance a room we booked and paid the executive one with a view they gave us a room with a small window looking to an airway The explanation provided by reception was that there was no availability however why they didn t inform us earlier about it Also it was not possible for them to fix a lighting fixture that it was not working properly , Staff willingness to provide help and support 
165400,Strand Palace Hotel, Food service was very poor Took so long to take order we had to leave and eat elsewhere they didn t take our order Breakfast is far better at a Premier Inn Bed was like a rock Slept poorly For some reason it took a lifetime to check in I have no idea why , Main entrance looked impressive It then went downhill The man on the door was the best thing about the entire hotel he was great 
165401,Strand Palace Hotel, The room didn t offer anything that a Travelodge wouldn t Our room 433 also used to be an interconnecting room and the door had been sealed up but the sound proofing was poor , The location
165402,Strand Palace Hotel, Restaurant food was typical hotel standard which was neither good nor bad Service in the lounge bar was appallingly slow I m afraid to say with several people complaining really could do with hiring a proper bar man woman , Room was possibly a little on the small side but still more than adequate for the price vending machines for after hours purchases concierge in lobby had great information for local attractions but best of all was the superb location for theatre and Covent Garden area Definitely will use this hotel again 
165403,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast could be more interesting and would like a faster check in, Great position short walk from Covent Garden and the river 5 mins from Trafalgar Square Very clean modern rooms reasonable size and bright Breakfast ok but not spectacular very busy at weekends so bit of a queue for check in 
165404,Strand Palace Hotel, The price of drinks in the bar I know people expect to pay a bit more in a hotel but 13 80 for a double vodka and tonic and a coke is excessive, It was my wife s birthday and our wedding anniversary and I had mentioned this when booking So it was a pleasant surprise that it had been noted and a box of chocs and a bottle of bubbly were in our room to greet us 
165405,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Very impressed with welcome and standards of hotel And good value for money Had a fab day with my family and ended the night in the comfort of your hotel Thankyou

165407,Strand Palace Hotel, I specifically requested a non Main Street facing room yet was allocated room 155 which is so noisy it is akin to sleeping outside in the street I had two nights very bad and constantly broken sleep In my opinion this hotel should not even charge for this room as it is unfit for purpose as I doubt anybody could get a good nights sleep given how noisy this room is ,No Positive
165408,Strand Palace Hotel, bed was like a brick for near 300 2 night stay room only Double bed against a wall so one had climb over Supposed to be a hotel not a caravan Paper thin walls could hear conversations and sanitary Very noisy customers either side 6ish hours sleep in 2 nights Rang reception got no response ,No Positive
165409,Strand Palace Hotel, If you get a room on the 2nd floor located over Strand street the traffic noise is so loud it is impossible to sleep during the night The windows of this 4 star hotel are absolutely not sound proof ,No Positive
165410,Strand Palace Hotel, Cooked breakfast according to my wife, Staff were professional courteous and friendly Hotel immaculately clean and all aspects delightful to the eye 
165411,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The hotel location could not have been better so close to everything Transit stops right in front of the hotel and was easy to navigate There was also a money exchange store beside the hotel which was very convenient Within walking distance to many restaurants 
165412,Strand Palace Hotel, The staff could be friendlier and more helpful Especially the front desk staff they were the worst and the cleaning people seemed nice enough but nobody spoke English so getting an iron board was a challenge , The only thing I liked was the location was convenient They should remove the word palace from their name nothing palace like about it 
165413,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was plain Wooden shutters meant that the view from the window was restricted which was a pity as we were on the 8th floor , The hotel was centrally located 5 mins walk to the theatre where we had booked a show Beautiful Carole King fantastic Just around the corner from Covent Gardens The cocktail bar was a nice place to sit and have a drink 
165414,Strand Palace Hotel, when we check in they give us a room in first floor which facing window towards inner walls but they have changed as we request to change, location is perfect you can walk to may touristic locations without taking any bus or subway many places to eat and drink around hotel
165415,Strand Palace Hotel, Staff on check unwilling to help me with an incorrect booking Diverted me to a cash phone to call Booking com without any help Slow check in line Dated hotel It was as though I had gone back twenty years , location
165416,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Location is excellent You can walk to many sights or the buses stop either outside or just around the corner Tube a 5 minute walk Hop on off is also just around the corner Great
165417,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, I loved the location You step outside and you are close to the sights theatres restaurants shopping The staff from check in through check out were fabulous friendly and very helpful especially Raymond concierge 
165418,Strand Palace Hotel, Small rooms Avoid the executive breakfast room at all costs The saddest room Prepared to order means that the waitress goes in to the general breakfast room and fills your plate from the buffet Stale bacon cold eggs and so forth Do your self a favour and book a different hotel in the same area , Great location 
165419,Strand Palace Hotel, Because it s such a big hotel it can get crowded at the check in desk and breakfast lounge , Great location all you need for a couple days in the city 
165420,Strand Palace Hotel, They need more reception staff I had to wait about 25 minutes and the queue behind me was huge They only had 2 people on and that s not the first time I ve experienced this , They gave me an upgrade which was nice
165421,Strand Palace Hotel, The scrambled egg didn t look very appetising and tasted worst Ask for poached , Restaurant staff very accommodating My husband prefers poached eggs we asked the restaurant staff if he could have poached eggs they were poached to perfection 
165422,Strand Palace Hotel, Room very small and it wasn t the smallest one available at that bed very small and could ve been positioned better in the room as the bed was pushed against the wall so you felt you were squashed into the corner of the room No extractor working in the bathroom and had to shut the bathroom door at night otherwise it made the room like a fridge , Location of the hotel was just what we needed for where we had booked to see shows and sightseeing cleanliness of rooms Staff were eager to please Breakfast was good for value of money 
165423,Strand Palace Hotel, Long wait at checkin only to be told no rooms ready and this was at gone 15 00 Did not get key to room till 16 30 Which ment we where not able to make our booking for evening meal at 17 00 before going to show no evening meal Next morning breakfast average asked for gluten free bread as I am coeliac did not arrive So fruit beans and egg for me cost 10 00 staff very poor knowledge of coeliac or even what wheat was ,No Positive
165424,Strand Palace Hotel, One side of bed against wall so no bedside table or light switch to one side of bed and ingress egress awkward For one night not critical but rather surprised in what was believed to be a good quality hotel This last happened to me in a dodgy b and b in Oban about 46 years ago , Location great Staff all very pleasant and efficient Room quiet as requested
165425,Strand Palace Hotel, charging for early check in given the room was ready cosy room was adequate but one side of the bed was against a wall so a little awkward , the location was perfect for our activities and the environment was very pleasant we had a nice lunch in the on site indian rest 
165426,Strand Palace Hotel, It does feel like an industrial like hotel in terms of the number of tourists it caters to but this boils down to a question of the number of bedrooms , Impeccable location Good housekeeping services Professional staff 
165427,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Great location Cosy room was just that BUT perfectly adequate for me and my husband Tasty breakfast could have been better with a little more choice for continental breakfast 
165428,Strand Palace Hotel, Not much the hotel is great and we alwasy stay here when we visit London We are repeat customers , It is such a great location Can get to everywhere and by walking Everything is near by Renovated rooms an dthe bathrooms are great wonderful showers

165431,Strand Palace Hotel, The towels in the bathroom were rather rough, The ease of booking in and the speed of the lifts The general friendliness of the staff at all times of the day and night 
165432,Strand Palace Hotel, Eating facilities were good as was the choice but the meals as expected are pricey , Location as it s within walking distance of Londons theatres Chinatown The Staff were very polite and helpful and overall the hotel was spotlessly clean and comfortable Our room was small but well maintained with no late night noise so we got a good nights sleep Will definately be staying here on our next visit to London 
165433,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location for theatres and restaurants The staff were all very helpful we found their service to be excellent The gin palace is a great place for a quiet drink The buffettbreakfast offered great variety of food all tasty Overall absolutely perfect for a weekend theatre and shopping break I can t wait to return

165435,Strand Palace Hotel, The cafe on the ground floor did not serve what they said they served on the menu on the wall No Iced Coffee because they had no ice Yet the bar would have had ice Perhaps , Very helpful at reception and particularly helpful concierge when we wanted to book last minute for an evening theatre show 
165436,Strand Palace Hotel, The room insulation needs improving I could clearly hear the next room using their bathroom The Carvery Restaurant was quite frankly bad value for money The quality of the food was no better than the average pub carvery and twice the price , The staff were excellent and professional and very welcoming The Indian restaurant was really good The Consierge Sev was really kind and helpful when I was having trouble logging on to the WiFi He showed me a good method to get logged on when having problems 
165437,Strand Palace Hotel, room was cold when we arrived walls where we stayed in room 470 seemed very thin as could hear next door very clearly Not noticed this before when we have stayed , Location of the hotel is ideal for covent garden and the theatres Staff on reception very helpful as were the door staff and concierge Staff at both indian restaurant and the bar accommodating with our food requests as we are vegan vegetarian 
165438,Strand Palace Hotel, As a treat we tend to like to order breakfast up to the room but this isn t an option at this hotel which is a shame , The location is great and the cosy rooms are a great way to get a cheaper room especially if you re not going to spend much time there The rooms was plenty big enough for a night or two 
165439,Strand Palace Hotel, Their were no twin rooms left at check in due to a large party we were offered a king upgrade but couldn t take the one bed offered to us due to age and comforts of individuals Waited til a room was found Otherwise all else was fine , Staff really stepped up to help find a cool storage area for our flowers for 24 hours the duty Manager and the Security staff were excellent and made ALL the difference to our stay thank you those people Great location too 
165440,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast could have a greater choice room was on the first floor and it was very dark and small , very nice accommodation in the heart of London go here backbone bus lines and near the metro I recommend to all the cost is higher but everything you round the corner napeoti is possibly a small Tesco 
165441,Strand Palace Hotel, The check in was kind of slow but we really did not care about that Our room was not ready so they gave us a free coffee and sparkling water in the lounge , The breakfast was excellent 
165442,Strand Palace Hotel, Could do with more electrical sockets in the bedroom very limited considering todays technology requirements Wifi although was available wasn t that adequate The very big downer was the breakfast certainly not worth the 18 00 charged Previous reviews have said that the toaster needed urgent attention as it was very poor at doing the job well it s obvious that this hasn t been addressed as it only churned out very dry bread claiming it was toast defies trades description act Breakfast accommodation and queuing was like a holiday camp not impressive Generally feel that the Strand is going on its historic reputation need bringing up to date, Standard of the room was adequate No air conditioning in the room so it was fortunate that we were able to open the bedroom window otherwise it would have been stifling to sleep the bedroom overlooked the courtyard below so fortunately wasn t too noisy from street traffic Friendly and very personable staff
165443,Strand Palace Hotel, Overcharged by 920 and still waiting for the refund told it will take a week Yet it took them 5 minutes to clear out my bank account leaving me massivley overdrawn and bank charges daily which hotel have said they are not refunding Disgusting Rang hotel 8 times now left 6 messages for manager to call me but he hasn t , The young chap in bar whose service was lovely 
165444,Strand Palace Hotel, There was a very cold draught from the window and even with blinds closed it could still be felt The room was warm but it was not so pleasant sitting by the window and seemed uneconomic , Lovely clean white linen my favourite 
165445,Strand Palace Hotel, The beds are extremely hard and I found very uncomfortable, The location is perfect so exploring London Rooms clean reasonably quiet for such a central location 
165446,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was a lot smaller than the images made out also the view from our window was very poor maybe stait that the room u r booking has a poor view , Location was great and the holtel facility was very good
165447,Strand Palace Hotel, The restaurants were very busy at breakfast and there was a bit of a queue nothing too bad though Rooms at the front have a bit if traffic noise but have got shutters , The check in staff were very friendly and helpful The location is fantastic as are the restaurants and the food 
165448,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to use the fan as opening the window due to location was far too noisy, They cosy double was the perfect room for an overnight stay with complimentary water in the room being an added bonus
165449,Strand Palace Hotel, Very very cold in the bathroom Windows do not isolate properly just 1 glass very old never saw such old windows in such good hotel Heater absolutely insufficient for heating the bathroom , Bed breakfest location of the hotel very good The stay in this hotel in warmer period should be O K 
165450,Strand Palace Hotel, The pilows are not comfortable, Loved staying at this hotel I was on my own for a week and I have nothing to complain about Only one slightly negative comment the pillows could be more comfortable I had 4 for myself but they were all quite hard 
165451,Strand Palace Hotel, There was nothing to dislike about the hotel we enjoyed our weekend stay very much , it was a celebration of my parents Diamond Wedding Anniversary the hotel staff decorated the room which was lovely they also left a card for Mum Dad congratulating them very touching The staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough for us We would definately stay at The Strand Palace Hotel again Thankyou All 
165452,Strand Palace Hotel, Rooms were small and not very comfortable Prices in the bar were expensive 74 for 3 drinks avoid the Gin Palace bar , Location for London s West End is superb Staff in general were polite and helpful 
165453,Strand Palace Hotel, My toast did not arrive until after I had eaten my breakfast the papers did not arrive on either day minor point but worth mentioning I felt , The staff in the lounge bar particularly one lady were wonderful and she always has a smile on her face She was at breakfast too lovely person The room was nice the shower fan did not work though 
165454,Strand Palace Hotel, Noisy Initially we had a very noisy room outside airco blowers ventilation fans the window was litterally vibrating After complaining we moved to a less noisy room in the same price category but there was still quite some noise from the street , Excellent location for a short city trip Very friendly staff 
165455,Strand Palace Hotel, my room was on floor 9 which was quiet but decor was scruffy and decorators woke me up at 1am as i don t think they knew i was sleeping there so not their fault, location
165456,Strand Palace Hotel, Well don t you dare bring in coffee from an outside shop Starbucks Eats Pret a manger into this hotel You will be promptly asked to go outside or get ride of it Then you will be told that it is like that everywhere HOWEVER we tested 6 other hotels in the area and all of them told us that outside coffee was permitted on site What they call a business center is no business center at all It was 3 computers 2 of which did not work in a hallway alcove Not recommended for business travel , The location is prime with lots of shops restaurants in the area Also easy walking distances to many touristic areas 
165457,Strand Palace Hotel, Everything was good, Room much quieter than I expected in a London central location A pleasant surprise Bed nice and comfy too Was good to have a nice selection of gluten free food too

165462,Strand Palace Hotel, I can t think of anything we only stayed one night everything was more than satisfactory, Very comfortable rooms warm great location for our needs very courteous helpful staff lovely breakfast
165463,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was very different from those advertised Much smaller with a view of the back of some air on unit The bar prices were excessively high , The ability to leave luggage securely both before we checked into our rooms and after we checked out This made our weekend much easier Thank you

165543,Strand Palace Hotel, The small room is really really small Not sound proof at all I could hear everything from the next room including someone snoring and people walking up and down the corridor The toilet is almost obstructing the panel door of the shower cubicle and it would be very difficult for an obese person , the location was good
165544,Strand Palace Hotel, With two women sharing the bedroom the complimentary shampoo body wash etc needed doubling Better organization for breakfast in the dining room felt like being in school when taken in crocodile fashion around to 2nd dining room, Snacks in the caf excellent Al staff friendly and helpful Ambience of hotel excellent Facilities fine

165548,Strand Palace Hotel, Too long to book in The hotel needs to think about actively offering people with access issues a quicker means of booking in I told staff I couldn t stand for long periods because of a long term knee problem however I was told I had to wait 20 minutes to check in as a large group had arrived Really sad because the hotel was lovely Maybe the hotel could suggest it s busy check in times in advance , Nice room Great location Very comfy clean bed for the weekend 
165549,Strand Palace Hotel, The standard room is very small for two Luckily I was alone I would appreciate some extras like sleepers or sewing material Wifi was satisfactory , I loved the location the staff and the cleanliness The room at the back was very quiet although kind of claustrophobic 
165550,Strand Palace Hotel, Single room was small On enquiringly about staying a second night the same room would cost 270 , Room was ready early when I arrived at 11am Hotel was quiet Location is great very central First night was a bargain around 100 Able to leave luggage all day complimentary Free wifi 
165551,Strand Palace Hotel, The WiFi was worse than when I stayed last year It isn t free and available throughout The WiFi couldn t be accessed from my room and only very slowly and intermittently in the foyer and bar In addition a speed of 7 Mbs is pitiful for an operation like the Strand Palace to be giving customers in this day and age The reception staff have a plan of which indicates rooms with limited WiFi so if the problem is known about why not do something about it , The location is great and the staff friendly and willing to do those extra little things to help you The quality of the food is very good as well 
165552,Strand Palace Hotel, We had the cosy double room I m 6ft 4 and I was happy with the room until stepping into the shower in which I had to crouch in because the shower ceiling was so low and couldn t physically stand up straight in I knew I was getting the costly room but didn t expect the shower also to be part of the cosy package , I really liked the lay out of the hotel and felt really welcomed when walking in greeted by a friendly face each time 
165553,Strand Palace Hotel, Design of the Hotel Rooms Very dated not tastefully renovated Bathrooms are ridiculous small Overall very bad lighting furniture and interior is very weak Stains on the carpet Breakfast in the morning was crowded felt like a typical tourist hotel with standard food Quality is okay Very Disappointed There are way better Hotels in central London for the same price Never stay there again , Location is very good room size okay Checkin Checkout friendly 
165554,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Nice place Very central don t have to travel far at all to find what you need Staff were very accommodating and pleasant Particularly Francesco who was very friendly and helpful when we checked in Breakfast was very good also

165557,Strand Palace Hotel, Single rooms incredibly small so much so the bathroom is a hazard Constantly hitting back or side on door handle getting in and out of bathroom, Great location Decent little gym

165559,Strand Palace Hotel, Not really bad but it was quite a long queue to check in on Saturday afternoon not all the stations were manned , Excellent location Professional and friendly staff from doorman to reception staff Modern clean spacious room Thanks for the upgrade from Cosy Double to Standard Double
165560,Strand Palace Hotel, I have visited the hotel before and this time I have found out several things I was not happy with Breakfast has deteriorated a bit and there are short cuts in the butter and marmelate range and their qualitiy no taste flavor Stale apples on offer Only one type of tea now available in the rooms The consierge would give only the option to pay 65 UK pounds for a taxi to Heathrow when I discovered that there are other services so that you can pay as little as 18 UK pounds for the same trip Furthermore unwilling to keep your name and or help you find another hotel visitor to share the taxi cost I stayed 6 nights and if I had not asked for a change of sheets they would not have done it Horrible brand of shampoo and body cream and terrible packaging no pleasant smell bags do not stand on the shower tray and they make a mess when squeezed What is wrong with a broad bottom bottle to stand on the rails of the tray rather than always slipping through the rails and landing on the shower floor Irritating not to be able to switch TV channels without the big screen showing and to have to do it mannualy each time , Best service at the luggage desk and the smilling porter 
165561,Strand Palace Hotel, The taps in the bathroom on the bath could do with being replaced The pillows also were a little hard , All the staff were very helpful from the guy on Reception to the Door Man
165562,Strand Palace Hotel, All good although we used the restaurant on a previous visit and that wasn t great , Well appointed hotel in a great location Great value with a decent sized room for London and perfect location for sightseeing less than 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden Piazza 
165563,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Local to theatre Adelphi and also Trafalgar Square 10k Winter Run on 31st Jan starting in Trafalgar Square but still close enough for Covent Garden and Theatreland Plenty of bar space and seats in the lobby

165565,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The room was clean the staff friendly We didn t have breakfast there so I can t comment on the food The location is very central and convenient 
165566,Strand Palace Hotel, The bathroom was like a fridge extremely unpleasant after getting out of a warm bed in the middle of the night No hearing whatsoever didn t have time to complain as checking out there was a queue otherwise I would have aired my views, Being upgraded to executive was lovely added extras in room definitely made me smile Breakfast was top class excellent attentive staff in the executive dining room 
165567,Strand Palace Hotel, In the foyer while enjoying drinks the maid came round and polished the tables we were using Not a bad thing as the place is spotless but not very pleasant with the spray when you are relaxing and catching up with friends Everything else was excellent this was a minor point in a great weekend , An excellent location for the money Great facilities The staff were very pleasant The room sizes were generous for the location 
165568,Strand Palace Hotel, the rooms are noisy with both street noise and corridor noise everything works but the bathroom equipment is on the old side Carpet could be a little cleaner For an average motel these points would be ok but for the price of this place still cheap for London one expects a little better or maybe this is just central London prices who knows Also the information the guys at the baggage hold gave us about public transport was incorrect , great location comfortable bed
165569,Strand Palace Hotel, The bathroom was very small Drying space after taking a shower was awkward The noise transference from the next door room was upsetting as next door neighbours carried on talking very loudly until gone 0130 the morning we both had important appointments to get to that day Every word was audible We were unable to use the shaver socket in the bathroom Reported this and reminded twice but no action taken no feedback so for the three days of our stay the socket remained unmended The organisation at breakfast was poor appreciate that the hotel is large and there are a high number of people to get through but it was pretty chaotic The beds could do with more comfortable mattresses and the pillows were hard and lumpy , Facilities clean and the hotel is in an excellent location for Covent Garden and theatre land 
165570,Strand Palace Hotel, The room had a small bathroom and the hotel corridors looked tired in definate need of redecoration , Good location nice sized room that was clean and modern Comfortable bed free bottled water 
165571,Strand Palace Hotel, The average quality price is expensive on my point of view , This hotel is very well placed Very central and we can go in every well known place by walk 
165572,Strand Palace Hotel, I couldn t find fault at all other than we were not offered complimentary newspaper and the couple next to us were But if we had desperately wanted one we would of asked , The whole experience was pleasurable location room dinner and service We were able to leave our case the following day would definitely stay there again 
165573,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent our room was a good size considering where we were located I particularly liked the wooden shutters which blocked out both light and noise The breakfast was excellent and only 10
165574,Strand Palace Hotel, Double room very pokey small bed stashed in a corner was given a small dark room and when I complained was given a very slightly less small noisey room , Location is good
165575,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was small and cold with a terrible view out of the window and wooden curtains, For the many sights around Covent Garden the location could not be better
165576,Strand Palace Hotel, On arrival our greeting from the receptionist was clipped and verging on unfriendly She didn t make us feel welcome and wasn t very helpful or understanding at all We expected a warm cheerful hello at the very least We had travelled over 300 miles to be there , The doorman was cheerful and helpful Everything worked in our room but it felt and looked very tired and old The hotel could do with a big injection of money to bring it into the 21st century The location was excellent for Covent Garden and the theatre we were going to 
165577,Strand Palace Hotel, took a while to answer phones at reception but i expect they were very busy more staff needed maybe , great customer service and very spacious and clean
165578,Strand Palace Hotel, More time to stay there , Perfect location for everything to see and do sight wise and entertainment wise also has the feelgood factor gained from a top quality hotel 
165579,Strand Palace Hotel, Very busy at all times at reception breakfast elevators etc The room was quite small , The hotel is at a very central location and the premises rooms are well maintained and clean 
165580,Strand Palace Hotel, The reception area is fragranced with something strange and the lighting is horrifically ugly but I guess it s just not to my taste , The reception staff were friendly and the concierge was fantastic he brought me an ironing board at midnight within no time at all The room and bathroom were spacious and spotlessly clean I also appreciated the tea coffee making facilities especially the biscuits and complementary water Breakfast is adequate for the price 
165581,Strand Palace Hotel, in need of a facelift the corridors were shabby and carpets dirty sweet wrapper on floor in my room bed and pillows very average bathroom very tight and poorly ventilated towels quite old shampoos etc a bit on the cheap side attached sports bar quite uninviting uninspiring, gym was quite good small but enough new and useful equipment check in worked smoothly at a busy time changes to room layout from twin beds to a double make for night 2 of my stay as promised
165582,Strand Palace Hotel, Woken up by cleaning staff by knocking on the door and entering the room , Concierge was very helpful for the few extra things we needed for the room and in directing and informing us on best travel options 
165583,Strand Palace Hotel, The cleaners opened our door to clean the room at 8am whilst we were still in bed didn t think we d need to put a do not disturb sign on the door that early in the morning when we would be vacating the room that day anyway , Excellent location room was very spacious comfortable 
165584,Strand Palace Hotel, Nothing it was lovely, The location was brilliant easy walking to Covent Garden and the theatres Our room was very comfortable and clean Breakfast was excellent we were in the executive restaurant and had table service this wasn t extra it came with the room The staff were very friendly and helpful Overall a really great stay 
165585,Strand Palace Hotel, Their policy of charging 20 per room to enter it early if it happens to be ready when you check in early is disgraceful Also do not order a paper on a Sunday as they always deliver it without the magazines yet charge full price , Brilliantly located 10 minutes from Charing Cross station Comfortable and quiet room and free water provided 
165586,Strand Palace Hotel, There was a lot of queueing checking in checking out and for the concierge Hotel has been given a makeover since my last stay Felt as a result it had lost a little character, Location was the most important factor
165587,Strand Palace Hotel, Beds were rather hard Service at breakfast a bit haphazard other customers were directed to our table on both mornings so we had to move, Very friendly doorman Excellent location Pleasant bar area

165589,Strand Palace Hotel, Carvery Very poor dried up veg etc and very slow service Complaint gave me a refund but will not dine there again , Pleasant room with all facilities
165590,Strand Palace Hotel, I would have preferred additional wall sockets and more readiness for help in terms of providing adapters to different electrical outlets Hotel management should consider changing upgrading the hairdryers that lack practicality and mobility hairdryer is stuck to the wall and will function as long as one keeps his finger pressed not very ergonomic or practical , I loved the location with proximity to theaters to Covent Garden I loved the sort of vintage grandeur of the hotel 
165591,Strand Palace Hotel, Old tired hotel which lacked the basics Rooms are way badly designed especially when they are so small Uncomfortable beds and toilet shoved into the corner of the bathroom so that it couldn t be used properly, Only good point is central location
165592,Strand Palace Hotel, Queue at check in but to be expected I suppose as it was 2 2 30pm There was also an enormous queue to be seated for breakfast which although looked horrendous when we first arrived went down really quick Paid a really high price this time we have stayed before at this hotel before a lot cheaper nothing going on in London so not clear why was so expensive, Loved the location staff were polite and knowledgeable Breakfast was very good Lots of choice all fresh lovely old building Room was nice 
165593,Strand Palace Hotel, Huge hotel with outdated rooms en horrible soundproofing single glass windows duct tape to minimise the draft Extreem ventilation noises in our room on the second floor kept us awake for the first 2 nights , The location was good The staff was very sympathetic and arranged a much quieter room for our last night there Far from the ventilation system and with a window that opens Woken up only at 7 8 AM by the sweet sounds of water pipes rattling and duct taping in a room further down the hall 
165594,Strand Palace Hotel, Hotel was clean but small points missed The underside of the bathroom tap was covered in toothpaste and the previous guests saliva toothpaste , Free upgrade Large room adequate facilities
165595,Strand Palace Hotel, expensive bar food and drinks but it is London Tv position in the room to the left of the bed bending your neck to watch it , location was excellent bed comfortable
165596,Strand Palace Hotel, The bed was to hard and the pillows as well No shelf at the bathroom to set your toilet bag Have to set it on the floor , Good breakfast Location is good close to shopping area in Covent Garden Nice but quit expencive bars at the hotel Good service we got changed room because we were not happy with the room we got first It was tiny and had a bad smell from the bathroom I came back to my room after breakfast while the cleaner was there and she would not let me into the room before she checked my key Very good 
165597,Strand Palace Hotel, The room standard twin was the smallest I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world Impractical room and bathroom , The location staff and cleanliness of the hotel was very good

165601,Strand Palace Hotel, I asked three people about getting breakfast in my room Three answers but it wasn t solved I was left waiting for someone to bring me a door card to the room Which they didn t I went to bed Woke up no time to go to the dining room for breakfast so asked for refund on breakfast fee and had to get breakfast on the move , Really high overall standard for the price 
165602,Strand Palace Hotel, inner sanctum of hotel derelict looking and requires face lift window of room looks out onto this Booking com failed to inform hotel of cancellation of a room which caused us delay and misunderstandings , excellent position within easy walking distance of many of the capital s attractions Staff friendly and helpful Rooms comfortable and clean 
165603,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast price should be half what it is so we didn t have breakfast at the hotel Plenty of local places for this , Highly convenient location in the West End Nice check in staff Allowed an early check in and then stored our luggage until the afternoon for free after checking out 
165604,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was a bit cold due to a breeze we couldn t stop the mirror in the room is directly facing the bed under the tv bit weird for me, Great location 5mins from Charing Cross train station and Covent Garden 
165605,Strand Palace Hotel, Perhaps the duvets were a little too hot But that is our only complaint, Everything was absolutely fine Staying here made our special weekend break even more special Thank you to you all 
165606,Strand Palace Hotel, Terrible check in and check out delays Useless wifi on three different devices I tried it was hopelessly slow Give the breakfast a wide berth esp the fruit juices if thats what they are , Not much apart from the location

165610,Strand Palace Hotel, Check in very slow long queue and then room wasn t ready We felt room was very small for twin beds and the ensuite even smaller although it did have a good size shower cubicle Duvets were not wide enough to cover us once in the beds and room was draughty due to very old window frame despite a wooden shutter being placed over it , Location of hotel superb Liked the touch of having doorman Luggage storage very efficient liked that we could leave luggage on day of departure until we were ready to catch train home Liked 12 noon checkout 
165611,Strand Palace Hotel, bed was a little hard as too were pillows outside our room was the service lift for staff facilities a little noisy could do with hot chocolate in the rooms as well as tea coffee, perfect for the west end beautiful hotel would stay again just not in same room staff excellent very clean and fabulous idea with the shutters lovely shower room all round good experience
165612,Strand Palace Hotel, Can not find any fault with the hotel or staff always perfect, I have been staying at the Strand Palace for a Pre Christmas trip with my son from the age of 12 and we still continue the tradition at this great hotel now he is a 24 year old man We have always had a comfortable and enjoyable stay We enjoy the quality food and excellent customer service from the cheerful and obviously committed staff It is a joy to return each year 
165613,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was very small and not what we booked we got a queen bed instead of two singles and it virtually took up the whole room The booking was for my wife and her sister and they managed but not what we asked for The room was opposite the laundry and piles of sheets were everywhere including at the entrance to the room, Staff were friendly and even checked us in early for free location was perfect breakfast was good
165614,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was smaller than expected and it was odd to have a bed against the wall , The hotel was ideal for where we needed to be the staff were lovely all areas neat and clean 
165615,Strand Palace Hotel, The only bad thing is that the walls are paper thin We could quite easily hear into the room next to us when they were speaking at a normal conversational level , The location of the hotel was excellent Right in the heart of the west end You are a short walk from most West London attractions and an easy walk down to the City if you want to head down that way Most theatres are very close by and it s in a great location for Soho 
165616,Strand Palace Hotel, The receptionist when sorting our room said that the one he was allocating had a bath rather than a shower which we said we were happy with When we got to our room it did not have a bath Not a complaint merely an observation We were happy either way , Location We were going to the Vaudeville Theatre and were delighted to find that the hotel was only a few hundred yards up the road Breakfast was very good too

165619,Strand Palace Hotel, The room was smaller than expected even the shower curtain seemed to make the bath narrower than a normal width , Recommend the breakfast and carvery 
165620,Strand Palace Hotel, We dont stay in London very often so our comparison is based on country stays and the odd stay in London we thought the room was very nice comfortable well decorated clean and tidy However the bathroom was looking tired and worn That said the shower was great but needed two towels to mop up leakage round the side of the curtain , The situation of the hotel is excellent Great staff in hotel and restaurants

165623,Strand Palace Hotel, Just a little bit more attention to cleaning the bathroom would have made this almost perfect , The fact that I keep coming back is testament to its friendliness comfort location and general wellbeing I was upgraded to a lovely double room with a view of the Strand a bit noisy all night but I could have closed the shutters
165624,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed was a little to hard and the room was smaller that I expected considering we book an executive room With a view of a wall Breakfast although I requested to have the full English breakfast but with no mushrooms this would be forgotten, Location is good staff were very helpful and cheerful
165625,Strand Palace Hotel, The hotel bar was awful The cappacino u had was very expensive for a coffee but we where in London so expect it to be a little more expensive but when I pay nearly 7 for a coffee it would be nice for it to be hot a taste nice Then we had to wait another 15 mins just to get a replacement which wasn t much better I thought the decor and furniture was tired and for the prices charged i would expect a higher never of quility either that or put the prices down and I would have had a different expectation of the place ,No Positive

165637,Strand Palace Hotel, The rooms were small Each floor had vending machines and the lobby had a lounge bar both of which cheapened the place The staff at reception weren t particularly friendly or engaged , The hotel is located in the heart of the theatre district I was traveling to London to see a play so this was perfect It s a vibrant location either way It s great to know you can walk 10 minutes to Covent Garden 
165638,Strand Palace Hotel, Room was small and double bed was of the smaller size access from one side only One of us being tall the bathroom washing area was cramped Optimising number of rooms for maximum return has benn prioritised over space comfort Felt like slightly larger than student hall room , Location and modern facilities breakfast room comfortable and staff friendly and welcoming 
165639,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room had an adjoining door with the next room which was locked but we could hear all their conversation and they could probably hear ours Mercifully we all went to bed about the same time so the noise didn t end up being intrusive but it could have been , The hotel is wonderfully central and remarkably quiet given that it is on the Strand Our room faced onto the Strand but the excellent wooden shutters blocked out a lot of the traffic noise Also comfortable twin room and lovely bathroom 
165640,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location all you need Warm comfortable fantastic breakfast Clean everything you could ask for for a successful base when holidaying in London

165642,Strand Palace Hotel, On the down side Our room was bijou and dark had wooden blinds cutting out all light and was hot On the plus side it was quiet If you opened the blinds to gets some air then it let in the light versus curtains which would billow but still keep out the light , the location was perfect for our trip as we were at a Wedding over the road and wanted to do a bit of Christmas shopping whilst we were up and catch up with friends The doorman was very helpful

165646,Strand Palace Hotel, My standard single room not the smallest size was pretty small Fine for one night if not for a long stay , I needed somewhere to stay near Trafalgar Square and the location in the Strand was perfect There was a big breakfast buffet 
165647,Strand Palace Hotel, Expensive for a single room but I suppose its because its London where some things are over the top cost , Close to Covent Garden and the theatre I was seeing a show at 
165648,Strand Palace Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable so couldn t sleep very well Very basic and I didn t think it was very good value for money, Very popular hotel so was listed on most boards locally

165661,Strand Palace Hotel, Lack of towels in the bathroom make sure you ask for more at the reception Also our room looked out onto the inner courtyard hence we could see into other rooms from our window so ensure you get a room at the front of the hotel , Perfect location for the West End right next door to the Lyceum Theatre for Lion King Also in great walking distance of Covent Garden shopping area bars fantastic restaurants 
165662,Strand Palace Hotel, Shower was broken and dripped all night disturbing our sleep Walls were thin so we were women by the thrashing around of the cleaning staff in the next room at 8am No air conditioning No fridge or mini bar No ice bucket It was the most sparse hotel room I ve been in ever I would never recommend , Location Period

165667,Strand Palace Hotel, nothing really only that we had a executive room so told to have breakfast in the executive breakfast room Do think there was far more choice in the main breakfast room so would eat in there in future , location was great staff very helpful Executive room very large 
165668,Strand Palace Hotel, I would have expected a little more to the room for the price Bathroom was clean but looked dated It had a feel of a premier in to the actual room compared to how luxurious the rest of the hotel looks, A great location a short walk from Charing Cross and right around the corner from Covent Garden and some fabulous restaurants
165669,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Excellent customer service and superb location we normally lose too much time using the tube not this time whilst staying here as there is so much within walking distance Room bigger than expected compared to other hotels and the reviews I read on here before staying we had room 706 
165670,Strand Palace Hotel, They had trouble finding our double booking on computers when we booked in Be nice if windows were double glazing Very noisy during the night , It was a beautiful room What made it even better is the management put a bottle of wine in my mums room when they were informed it was her birthday Very nice surprise thanks
165671,Strand Palace Hotel, Initial encounter of staff with particular issue on bookings this actually turned out to be poor communication between Booling com and hotel, Location

165673,Strand Palace Hotel, The main door was locked when I arrived at 12pm to check in after a party It took quite a while for me to find someone to let me into the property, Bed is very comfortable Staff are very friendly competent and very helpful 
165674,Strand Palace Hotel, Had to wait for over an hour to check in Had to leave our luggage with the porter as we had dinner pre booked and checked in later in the evening Worst Customer Service ever experience never even said sorry that we had been through this experience Also if you have already checked in online they dont ever go the the quick check in desk so everyone has to queue up in the same queue , Location

165676,Strand Palace Hotel, When the booking was eventually sorted out we were told that it only included 1 breakfast despite the booking having been made for 2 people We had to pay the extra so that we could have breakfast together The fault for this was it seems with Booking com and i would appreciate your response , There was a problem with the check in but it was handled expertly and with friendliness when our booking didn t show up on their computer 
165677,Strand Palace Hotel, Room wasn t cleaned on second day at 1500 so housekeeping had to chase up so we had to vacate room while it was cleaned Not enough staff on bars so long waits poor service , Location of hotel Excellent breakfast staff
165678,Strand Palace Hotel, The room we were given after an upgrade was close to the lifts which did detract from the quietness expected , The location was ideal for visiting central London 
165679,Strand Palace Hotel, A really small point but the toilet roll holder was under the sink and not convenient for use had to remember to get some paper first Could not see a reason for this but found it just a little odd , The hotel is in a great location for Covent Garden and theatres The room was comfortable and very quiet The staff were helpful 
165680,Strand Palace Hotel, Although it was meant to be a double room it was actually a single in reality with only one set of towels etc The bed which was hard uncomfortable was flush against the wall so one had to climb out of the foot of the bed during the night if required Never again ,No Positive
165681,Strand Palace Hotel, Restaurant was fully booked we had to eat across the road you would think that guests staying at the hotel would have priority , Great Location for Covent Garden and Adelphi Theatre

165683,Strand Palace Hotel, Would like more than 2 teabags per 24 hours Also a slightly larger duvet Slight droning engine noise audible from room 460 day and night Some kind of air con unit Windows not double glazed , Friendly and helpful staff Excellent location Relaxing bar comfortable seating 
165684,Strand Palace Hotel, Cocktails were very expensive , Great location really friendly helpful staff room upgrade for an additional 20 which was worth the extra money Would stay again

165686,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful at all times location was great overall it was an excellent stay rooms were imaculate we had breakfast which was worth every penny will definitly recommend
165687,Strand Palace Hotel, Check in staff unaware of accessibility request made on booking for walk in shower room with bath had been allocated causing delay at reception after long journey on train A suitable room was found for us so we were much relieved 1st floor needs better sound proofing as road noise spoils the experience , Location eventual room layout 
165688,Strand Palace Hotel, Very small room Noise like someone drilling into the room until I turned off the heating Heating had been left full on with both windows open behind a net curtain Not worth 174 wish I had read more reviews before booking , Complementary water and biscuits Modern but small bathroom 
165689,Strand Palace Hotel, No parking Wafer thin walls it seemed Radiator wasn t getting warm Executive room Expected a bigger bed , Location is the key Staff efficient Food lovely 
165690,Strand Palace Hotel, We liked everything but for the benefit of others There was no bath with this room just a double sized shower There s also just a small window with no view , A well placed lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff We stayed in an Executive King Room 679 which was surprisingly spacious considering other reviews with a wonderful comfortable bed The room had a very quiet and efficient air conditioning unit and so for the first time ever on the first night of an hotel stay we slept like a log Little extras like slippers robes etc made it extra special Breakfast was great too with a good choice on offer We got this room at half price which was excellent value We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definately stay again 
165691,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent as it was near to Charing Cross station and also within walking distance of Covent Garden and surrounding theatres and attractions

165759,Strand Palace Hotel, The cosy room was cramped I did not expect this in a 4 hotel There was of course no view Despite the info given on the square footage which will not mean much to some people prospective travellers should be warned , The hotel was ideally located The concierge did a good job in advising on things to do 
165760,Strand Palace Hotel, Far too expensive Bordering on daylight robbery 400 for two nights in a tiny little room Cynically priced to rip off travellers to London There were no frills and we literally just used the room to sleep for 8 hours at 16 per hour Very poor , The staff are friendly and professional and the location is ok

165770,Strand Palace Hotel, Although the que to check in was long all desks were staffed and they went down quickly THe actual check in process was long winded for us We were a family of 6 occupying 3 rooms Each room needs individual check ins although they were all booked at the same time , Location was superb for convent Garden and theatres Everything we visited was in easy walkable distance Clean modern hotel

165772,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff were efficient and professional but still friendly The hotel and room were well maintained clean and tidy I ll stay again it made a special weekend a bit more special
165773,Strand Palace Hotel, However another example of the LondonNewYorkTokyo effect That is where every inch of space is maximised Result The toilet was in such an awkward position it required one to sit side saddle to er vacate hangar two If you know what I mean , Perfect for short term stay Great location Room single was very compact quiet clean and staff were extremely helpful

165778,Strand Palace Hotel, On Saturday a slight problem with shower water pressure no doubt due to the hotel being very busy , Always stay at the Strand Palace as it s our perfect location being within a walking distance of the major attractions Plus good bus routes to East and West and plenty of passing cabs when required

165784,Strand Palace Hotel, The single room is very small You can hardly move around The Mask bar was closed all the days of our stay They tried to overcharge us on purpose at the lounge bar 50 pounds instead of 35 but we figured it out The breaksfast is poor for the price you pay at the hotel , Very good location 
165785,Strand Palace Hotel, No ventilation we felt ill with the stuffiness plus noisey nights we did complain it was logged but just forgotten Nice hotel but inconsiderate management we were promised discount if we stayed again ignored no reply s to e mails really disappointed it s no way to treat customers l m sure we will receive better service in another hotel , Good location
165786,Strand Palace Hotel, Housekeeping staff spoke very little English Check in staff were almost rude , Door man was excellent very friendly and helpful We were 4 lady friends 3 from USA and 1 from Paris unfamiliar with London His help was splendid Also very good quality toiletries in the rooms Location was super

165789,Strand Palace Hotel, High price for basic hotel, Excellent location The rooms are clean and quite spacious I like the shutters on the windows that keep out the street noise Wifi works well 
165790,Strand Palace Hotel, The size of the room was seriously small for a double the bathroom was a joke The whole hotel needs renovating , The only thing that stands out about this hotel is the location walking distance to the london eye covent garden and more 
165791,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast could have been hotter tea served was luke warm Complained and piping hot pot of tea brought within minutes, Location excellent for Theatres shopping tube stations
165792,Strand Palace Hotel, Obviously very popular with large groups and the lobby gets mobbed meant I had to wait 20 minutes to retrieve my left luggage had to wander around the back corridors and eventually find someone who summoned attention not great when you have a plane to catch, Nice corner room quiet despite central location and lots of windows nicely finished with shutters 
165793,Strand Palace Hotel, The only downside was that there were only two sachets of milk in the room on arrival lol , As my wife has difficulty walking convenience for theatre land was very important as it was a surprise visit for her birthday The service you provided from the doormen to the receptionist to the catering staff was first class

165796,Strand Palace Hotel, Booking com made a mistake and booked us in twice Your hotel was very unhelpful even though we only booked one room so NOT our fault I had to pay the cancellation fee Both you and Booking com blaming each other no one taking responsibility Was told the next day by your receptionist that I hadn t been charged a cancelletion fee But can see on my bank statement that I have Now Booking com are reneging and saying that I only had one room booked Great so who s going to refund the 179 17 to me Absolutely disgusted with the treatment It was my first wedding anniversary and you ruined it ,No Positive
165797,Strand Palace Hotel, Very noisy room no proper sleep for 2 nights Wifi in room rubbish Executive room no fridge Very expensive for what we got Although so called refurbished room pretty ordinary , Location is very good The only other positive was that it was clean

165799,Strand Palace Hotel, TV wasn t very big and accessing regular TV programs and or films wasn t easy An updated guide and movie access should be implemented When people are on site for days chilling with a film becomes important to get out of work mode , Friendly staff awesome room

165801,Strand Palace Hotel, Expensive for a very small room Poor ventilation very noisy both from the hallway and adjoining rooms plus whining motor noise all night Not traffic some kind of pump or refrigerator motor from an adjoining courtyard Paid 20 on arrival for an early checkin but if the room is ready it should simply be made available its too expensive already Landing early from long haul flight no fun waiting until 2pm for some rest Bag collection from storage was painfully slow and a charge of 2 to store ur case for the day Cash grab an included service everywhere else Building generally tired inside needs a lick of paint and fresh carpets in hallways , Great location close to national rail and tube Charing Cross Great for covent garden and markets Handy to have computers with printers to print forward travel docs Excellent free wi fi 
165802,Strand Palace Hotel, Breakfast was overpriced and very mediocre No lighting near dressing table mirror and fixed flex on hairdryer did not reach far enough So very difficult for ladies to do their hair and make up , Excellent location Very clean nice size room standard double also very quiet in rooms despite busy location on the Strand Staff very efficient and friendly 
165803,Strand Palace Hotel, I booked through Booking com and registered myself and two children When we got to the hotel they had only registered two people and the room we got did not fit an extra bed so all three of us had to sleep in the same bed the first night The remaining four nights we were able to upgrade the room to a larger room so they could fit in an extra bed and I had to pay for the upgrade It was probably booking com s search engine that was to blame I had prepaid the hotelbill but when I checked out the receptionist asked me to pay for the stay again I m glad I was awake enough to remind her that I had already payed or it would have been a really expencive stay I was very happy with the hotel exept for those details ,No Positive
165804,Strand Palace Hotel, There is a lack of wow factor It is a pleasant and comfortable hotel but is quite pricey for what it offers , Comfortable room and very good breakfast
165805,Strand Palace Hotel, small room for price but it was nice, nice big hotel around the corner from covernt garden less than 10 minute walk to London eye bar and eating looked good but did not use
165806,Strand Palace Hotel, It could have been cleaner Considering the room was supposed to be executive size I didn t think it was very big The room was pretty dated Very disappointing overall given the name location reputation of the place , That it was right on The Strand not much else 
165807,Strand Palace Hotel, Not being able to have a twin bedded room as I requested on my booking as I had a 90 year old lady my mother with me so even though bed was comfortable I could not sleep , Breakfast
165808,Strand Palace Hotel, I ve stayed in other hotels in the area for approx 40 60 cheaper if I m honest so I was a little disappointed with the cost the late normal check in time The room was very basic I was also woken up at 8am by the housekeeping staff talking very loudly in the corridor evidently they realised this some 10 15 minutes later as one of them shushed the other , The hotel is in a fantastic location The check in staff were friendly It s very helpful that early check in was available for an additional 20 but still a pain to pay extra mainly because normal check in is late afternoon The room was fairly big for a central London location Good place to stay if you just need a bed it s a big hotel so rooms are available with short notice 
165809,Strand Palace Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly the hotel was beautiful and near to everything we needed It was just a pity we only had an overnight stay next time we will make it longer 
165810,Strand Palace Hotel, The reception staff is very busy we qued for about 30 minute before served by a lady Though I have a booking for two room in one booking through booking com but she told me that the confirmation must be different This is rediculous statement That is not appropriate to say like that , Restaurant staff concierge staffs are very helpful The checkout is efficient and the recpetion staff is very helpful when I ask for access to computer and printer 
165811,Strand Palace Hotel, Thought cost of breakfast quite steep 18 per person, Very welcoming and helpful staff when checking in All staff very pleasant and greeted us with a smile 
165812,Strand Palace Hotel, breakfast was good but restaurant was very crowded and noisy not suitable if you prefer a more leasurely start of the day , great location for theatres and general sight seeing room was comfortable enough although somewhat bare looking compared to the grander exterior nice breakfast 
165813,Strand Palace Hotel, the quality of the room was below my expectations for an executive King room The walls were so thin we could hear the woman next door laughing and then coughing all night The check in procedure really needs looking at too The queue to check in was about 20 people long and was taking between 5 10 mins each time Very frustrating after a long journey , Apart from being on a busy road the hotel is in a great position for sight seeing it a theatre break Breakfast was nice too 
165814,Strand Palace Hotel, Felt more like a Travelodge than a supposedly 4 star hotel small rooms ugly decor bog standard hotel features Nothing exciting whatsoever Not worth the premium , Great location 
165815,Strand Palace Hotel, Being moved to a lower standard room with no bath dangerous looking taped up wiring on the towel rail and a broken shower cubicle Having our belongings packed up and moved to another room in our absence No attempt by check out staff to offer any discount or compensation Breakfast was good but the atmosphere was akin to a production line with guests rushed to table service rushed and impersonal A friendly good morning costs nothing , Location
165816,Strand Palace Hotel, The room did not have a fridge and for people who like COLD drinks that was disappointing , The location was terrific we were able to walk catch a bus or a tube train to most places that we wanted to go to Also the room was pretty good but the bathroom was not designed very well 
165817,Strand Palace Hotel, The check in and breakfast staff were a little abrupt The room was super tiny but clean and comfortable Due to London being busy the hotel was a lot more expensive than usual so I expected more , The location is great The concierge staff were excellent with travel plans and theatre tickets

165821,Strand Palace Hotel, We had purchased the breakfast deal for our first morning When we returned that evening our room card would not work and we were told that was because we had not purchased breakfast for the next day Strangest scrambled eggs I have ever experienced , Great location reasonable room clean 
165822,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was obviously a single room that had a double bed added so we so short of space the bed was against a wall meaning one of us had to climb over the other to get in and out also there was no room for a bed side table so our glasses alarm and phones had to go on the floor where they are easily damaged As a regular visitor to the Strand Palace we were disappointed,No Positive
165823,Strand Palace Hotel, The room allocated 712 was far too small for two adults One side of the bed was pushed up against a wall making it difficult to access and the bathroom area was very limited This would have been more of an issue if the weather had been inclement , Hotel was used for a theater booking and the location was ideal for this and other attractions within our two night stay 
165824,Strand Palace Hotel, 218 excl breakfast for a tiny single room Have stayed in London many times but never got such low value for money , The room was really really clean including the bathroom I m very fussy on hygiene so this is a big compliment from me 
165825,Strand Palace Hotel, I booked a larger room and it was very small Goodness knows what the smaller rooms look like View was horrible over a dirty inner well area looking at other rooms across the way , Superb location and good value During the week anyway I tried to book again on a Friday and it was too expensive for the services offered However for London I think it is good value overall Free wifi was good and we appreciated the 15 00 voucher per room which was spent on cocktails 
165826,Strand Palace Hotel, Our room was a corner room on floor 5 which was very small We have stayed before and the bathroom had a bath and the room was very spacious but this time we found the room was small quite dull with no bath, The location of the hotel is excellent The onsite facilities are great

165829,Strand Palace Hotel, Went to the coffee shop in the morning to get coffee to go on bus tour The girl was just opening the shop and said it would be another twenty minutes which was not a problem One of the male staff members pointed us to Starbucks which we appreciated We got the coffee and we re waiting on the bus tour to arrive As we were drinking our coffee one of the male staff members told us we couldn t drink coffee from the outside in the lobby and that we would have to drink it outside We explained that we had tried to buy from the hotel coffee shop but couldn t So we would went outside and stood in the rain and waited for the bus Unbelievably rude treatment Will never go back ,No Positive
165830,Strand Palace Hotel, Wifi was too slow to use and kept dropping out Room was very standard for the price we made Huge problem at Reception upon check in as they didn t accept our over the internet payment pre check in which had been confirmed on the internet earlier Concierge nearly lost one of our bags but fortunately my sister found it in the foyer Definitely expected more , Location was great 
165831,Strand Palace Hotel, Size of the rooms we stayed in an executive room and it was very small no fridge in any rooms Food in restaurant was not great and overpriced , The location was fantastic walk to everything Close to train station restaurants shops and the river 
165832,Strand Palace Hotel, Although we paid more to have an executive room with air conditioning we were disappointed with the size of the double room The bathroom was very small and the positioning of the shower curtain around the bath made it very cramped After reading their description of these rooms we were expecting a bit more space The view was of three walls and windows which was not such a big deal but when a room is classed as executive your expectations are raised Adding bathrobes slippers etc to a very average room does not make it executive , The hotel is in an ideal location for visiting many tourist attractions in central London and within walking distance of lots of theatres The executive breakfast room was less crowded than the larger dining room and the food was cooked to order 
165833,Strand Palace Hotel, A lot of the smaller single rooms don t have a bath only a shower , Fantastic location for a Theatre Break Staff incredibly friendly and helpful and the breakfast is fab

165836,Strand Palace Hotel, Noise of traffic We were on first floor and had asked for quiet room Didn t complain as we were only there one night and they had upgraded us without asking to a king size bed Perhaps a higher floor would be quieter Room compact and shower no bath But clean and comfortable Good choice , Close to theatre tube river and great restaurants
