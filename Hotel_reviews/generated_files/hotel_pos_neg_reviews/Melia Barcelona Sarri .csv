280434,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Room Air conditioning control didn t work and the AC unit was noisy Bed to small room view poor bathroom needs maintenance , Reception staff service good
280435,Melia Barcelona Sarri ,No Negative, Upon arrival at the hotel check in was very quick Our rooms were clean but were a bit small The hotel doesn t have a pool and does charge extra for the spa but that didn t bother us as we spent a lot of time outside of the hotel enjoying the sights in Barcelona The location of the hotel is a bit out of town but there are plenty of taxis around that will charge you 10 Euros for a trip into the center of the city Overall the hotel is good vale for money and offers an excellent service The breakfast is nice and the staff within the hotel are very friendly and helpful 
280436,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Surrounded closely by strip clubs especially walking at night disturbing Can light over vanity in bathroom hanging out Tub would not drain Leather headboard had many worm white spots Table was stained where coffee maker water kettle sat I did share concern w staff about quality of room and they did state they would have changed my room but we were here 1 night and once we unpacked and noticed things we just felt like it was too much trouble , Nice staff They were very helpful w restaurant suggestions and Internet issues 
280437,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Rooms need some renovation Definitely not a 5 star hotel most of 4 star business hotels provide the same or better services , Big nicely planned rooms Nicely located 
280438,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Did not realise hotel catered for tour busses Breakfast was not real good as the tour bus people barged in and ate everything Got seated next to make your own coffee machine and was too noisy , Club room was ok 
280439,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Many staff members do not speak or understand English it was hard to communicate with them when we wanted to put a few request such as a mattress for our baby cot What disappointed us the most is that they offered us deflated and molded floaters for our 7 months old baby girl when they pride themselves as a 5 stars hotel When we requested to have a new one since we were staying several days there the staff asked us to go buy and get our own definitely not the type of service i was expecting from the Melia hotel chain , Our room was very spacious and clean The inside pool was amazing However the location is a tad far from the downtown area which takes about 15 20 minutes by bus To be fair the hotel is close to several bus lines which brings you to different touristic locations 
280440,Melia Barcelona Sarri ,No Negative, I booked a room with city view and it s truly awesome you can see the great view of Barcelona And the breakfast is great If I had the chance to come to Barcelona again I will definitely book this hotel again 
280441,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The hotel is not right near the centre of the city though shopping is nearby The room had an issue with a smell from the air conditioning vent though it was eventually fixed , We enjoyed our stay in a Junior Suite and the staff were very keen to help Breakfast and evening tapas at The Level were worth the extra money and provided a nice place to relax There were a few conferences on site so other dining venues were crowded 
280442,Melia Barcelona Sarri , I got three unpleasant experience this time 1 Hotel changed the wifi password after two days we lived in without any notice And when I found to call them at 9pm 9 20pm nobody picked up the service phone 2 The last day I finished breakfast on 8 30to go back room the key cannot open due to their set up Just can go down to fix it 3 When check out they charged 48euros more by mistake After we checked with them they refunded us I suppose this kind of things may not happen in such a nice hotel , Nice location nice room nice breakfast and small but well functioned GYM 
280443,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The hotel was a bit far from the touristic attractions Approximately 30 min away by bus Nearest metro station 10 min walking , Amazing facilities Very clean hotel Nice staff 
280444,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The hotel is getting old they are trying to keep it up to date but for a 5 star hotel i expect everything to be perfect and it was not perfect At the time of booking we were happy to see that there is a Spa but when we wanted to use the Spa facilities we were told that it is 15Euro per person per day in addition to our daily rate It was not mentioned anywhere during the booking process that the Spa will cost us extra each day The other downside is that the Hotel is about 40 min walk to La Rambla But is only 6Euro for a taxi , The staff was super friendly 
280445,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Room was tired carpet quite stained area round the bath needs attention Only 1 channel on the TV in English, Staff really friendly and helpful breakfast selection excellent
280446,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Upon arrival the room allocated was not good Broken headboard damaged ceiling , I was relocated in a up to the par room The staff at the desk were helpful
280447,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The fact that there is a swimming pool and you have to pay to use it as this is a 5 star hotel and you pay 5 star prices it should be included, Location was good
280448,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Location means tube is necessary which is only a minor drawback as a trip to anywhere is only 1 euro , Bed was great and the shower was amazing although the middle setting that shoots water at you was a bit startling at first The hotel staff were very helpful with suggesting things to see and how to get around the city by tube Bath robes and slippers are provided which is a plus Our room was on the 14th floor and had a nice view due to being so high up 
280449,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The carpet from halls to rooms was dirty and threadbare It needs replacement so badly that the slippers provided are a necessity I wish the room was darker at night Pillows were too thick and hard Mold on shower floor The elevator system is ridiculous , Great bathrobes and slippers however the slippers were necessary It was very quiet in the room a surprise since the surrounding streets have heavy traffic 
280450,Melia Barcelona Sarri , I mina gon r det ett medel 4 stj rnigt hotell Har sv rt att se detta som 5 stj rnigt efter att ha varit g st p n gra Hilton och Sofitel s har jag h gre f rv ntningar p ett 5 stj rnigt F nstren r inte isolerade vinden ylar genom springor och biltrafiken l ter mycket Termostaten i rummet var trasig vaktm staren gl mde sina nycklar i d rren St derskan gl mde sitt kort i d rren k nns inte s s kert Helt pl tsligt knackade det p d rren och en person i hotellkl der skulle fylla p vatten i minibaren men hon hade varken vatten eller vagn med sig och vi anv nde aldrig minibaren Frukostbuff n var okej men inte mer baconen var f r tjocka och d ligt tillagade ggr ran var f r vattnig och annansen var h rd Br durvalet var tunt och ostskivorna var tjocka och skurna med kniv Som sagt med 5 stj rnor f rv ntar jag mig h gre klass och kvalit , Lobbyn hissarna och personalen i receptionen 
280451,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Nothing to say, This is the fourth Melia hotel that i have stayed at and the total service continues to be faultless and generous I will continue to use this chain of hotels as it is by far the best and consistent series of hotels It is always reassuringly excellent 
280452,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Walls had writing on them and mini bar prices very high would have bought alot if they were even 2 or 3 euros cheaper but 8 euros for a bottle of heineken , Comfy bed great shower good air con
280453,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Very poor tea and coffee making facilities just 4 small milk pots in the room and 4 coffee sachets we had a coffee on arrival and again when we came back to the room at night and then nothing left for the morning Mega expensive breakfast mini bar and room service astronomical maybe ok for business men but not recommeokded for ordinary visitors to the city, Comfy bed lovely bath and bathroom
280454,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Very expensive Would have expected executive level for the price we paid We were told access to executive lounge was 90 euros pp , Location was good Staff very helpful Parked the car for us underground Though it was 28 euros for 24hrs But hey central Barcelona The bar on the ground floor was really pleasant and comfortable We had delicious tapas for lunch Best ever Meatballs with squid Eggs and ham and potatoes So tasty The room we had was lovely with a great city view All in all we loved it Just would have liked executive level I think Barcelona was very busy at the time So the price reflected that 
280455,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Upon booking time I highlighted the fact that I was coming to celebrate my girlfriend s birthday however nobody ever did anything at all not even a small card left in the room Then upon check out time I was not even asked if I enjoyed my stay Very frustrated ,No Positive
280456,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The air con in the gym was not on in the mornings , The hotel and staff was excellent I recommend using the service offered on the level Attention to detail and friendliness of the staff made our stay better than expected Hugo and Marlos was excellent The breakfast every morning was amazing and even had gluten free options for my partner The king size beds and view of the city from our room was incredible 
280457,Melia Barcelona Sarri ,No Negative, The room was lovely The bathtub with bubble jets was amazing The hotel was a bit out from the centre but nice area with many beautiful restaurants nearby Restaurants around the hotel were higher quality more reasonably priced and less touristy than the centre The staff were only too happy to recommend places to eat and how to get around The metro is very efficient easy to use and quick to get around the city Closest station at hospital clinic was about 8 minutes walk from the hotel Plenty of nice caf s on the way to the metro where we had croissants and coffee for breakfast High quality hotel at very reasonable price 
280458,Melia Barcelona Sarri , room was not checked and ready expensive upgrade misrepresented definitely not worth the money night duty front desk staff rude and inexperienced paid for 5 star hotel as advertised got more like 4 star business hotel,No Positive
280459,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The use of trainees at the front desk is a concern For example we wanted to use the express checkout which we understood meant checking out the night before We did this through a trainee who did not seem to understand the process she only checked us out for the nights we had already been at the hotel so we had to checkout the next morning anyway to pay for that last night no time savings at all in addition the trainee told us our boxed breakfasts would be delivered to our room at 6 00 am yet they went to the front desk We would have appreciated having something to eat , The breakfasts were awesome many choices including omelets made to order 
280460,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Expensive food choice in restaurant very limited and outrageously priced They charge for WIFI if you are not a member I asked for a large bed and I got a single bed, 24 hour gym although little equipment in it Staff is smiling all the time
280461,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Nothing It is a well run and nicely appointed hotel , The front desk was wonderful I regret misplacing the business card of the man who was so pleasant and helpful We were made to feel most welcome and all of our questions were answered Our room was very nice We appreciated the beautiful flowers in the hotel and the wonderful Sunday breakfast We were very pleased with everything 
280462,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Nothing it was a great stay and I look forward to staying there again , The staff were really nice and made my son and I really welcome i will defiantly stay there every time we come to watch Barcelona play 
280463,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The fact that the closet and luggage storage were combined In addition the division between the closet and the bathroom was just a cork board with a gap in the middle , Clean cosy rooms and comfortable beds Quiet location 
280464,Melia Barcelona Sarri ,No Negative, The staff and breakfast were wonderful All staff were friendly and extremely helpful in planning sightseeing trips getting an adaptor etc loved my stay and would go back again 
280465,Melia Barcelona Sarri , We were disappointed that onlyoneaccess to the spa was included with the extra amount we paid for the level , The Level option was fairly expensive but we were happy with what we paid 
280466,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Music a little bit too loud in the lobby bit of turmoil during breakfast , Great rooms excellent offer on breakfast perfect and very fast invoicing process kindness at reception and efficiency in the breakfast room 
280467,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Here are the points that I am very disappointed The shower door were missing and the door supports were sharp and were left there this might have caused injuries The bath door had a problem in closing and it is moving freely instead of closing The air conditioning was not working The iron board was in an un acceptable condition And the most disappointing I had MOLD in my room this is outrageous for a 5 hotel MOLD is a danger for health and can cause health issues ,No Positive
280468,Melia Barcelona Sarri , A bit far from the city center 2km or 3km away from touring spots It s recommended to buy a T10 ticket , Spacious room Separated shower and bath The bath is cool Can redeem traveler check without commission fee 
280469,Melia Barcelona Sarri , This hotel was rated as 5 stars but in my opinion was closer to a 4 or 31 2 star hotel , Location was excellent Near bus stop and shopping around the corner
280470,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Located not too close to the Metro but good enough 15 20 min walk The check in was too slow and I had to change the room as it didn t have a double bed as reserved , Excellent breakfast efficient elevator system nice view from the room 19th floor 
280471,Melia Barcelona Sarri , I was a bit disappointed that the hotel staff didn t try to make an effort to see if they could also accommodate a late check out for me when I asked As I was only staying for one night and my long flight back to South Africa was leaving at 11pm in the evening it would have really made a big difference to me to have a bit of a later check out than 12pm , Really comfortable hotel bed was heavenly and bedroom was really quiet Loved the spa bath and massive shower I was on my way from Ibiza and really happy that the hotel accommodated an early check in for me because my flight from arrived really early 
280472,Melia Barcelona Sarri , There was absolutely nothing we didnt like, My girlfriend and I have been traveling together for a while now and we both agree that this stay at the melia was probably the best experience we have had in a hotel amazing The staff where incredibly helpful and the food was amazing It is worth every penny to upgrade to the Level room for access in the lounge free food and drink you get your moneys worth 
280473,Melia Barcelona Sarri ,No Negative, The service was excellent from the time we checked in Daniel Caberra at the door helped us with the process and the other Daniel at the reception was the just as great Polite fast and pretty friendly We LOVED our stay The service is fantastic they made our stay so much more enjoyable 
280474,Melia Barcelona Sarri , Honestly nothing The best hotel experience I ve had this far Well done to your team at Melia Barcelona Sarria , Absolutely Everything Such a bespoke property with true five star standards offer incredible value From the pleasant aroma in the lobby pleasant staff all staff to encountered spoke English with no problem amazing bedroom plugpoints next to both beds anyone impressive bathroom figuring out how the shower worked was daunting at first but easy enough to navigate Breakfast was also a great experience Cava on ice certainly helped elevate the holiday flair plenty of various standard options including some Asian choices too 
280475,Melia Barcelona Sarri , The car park was very small and hard to manoeuvre a 4x4 around Use the alternative car park for the hotel , The room was nice the hotel staff were friendly and attended to my enquiries very effectively and professionally The hotel was located within walking distance of the city bus tour so we used it as a form of transport as well us for sightseeing
