236057,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent location very chic hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was a little smaller than expected but a small price to pay for a great hotel and Cool sky bar would definitely return 
236058,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The fact that we were charged 12 5 service charge on every round of drinks in the Sky Bar even for 2 bottles of beer where the service was to take the tops off the bottles unreasonable in my view ,No Positive
236059,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing really, The freshly baked chocolate chips cookie that I got on check in was a lovely touch and made this hotel stand out from others I have used for work Also the fact that I could open the windows for fresh air was a big plus
236060,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, It s v v v expensive which is hard to justify given there are cheaper hotels nearby , Lovely hotel have stayed here twice and fab service and experience both times Great location Fabulous rooftop bar 
236061,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The sky bar is the most expensive bar I ve ever seen , Location is great A two minute walk from Tower Hill tube station Breakfast has every option you could possibly want 
236062,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our room was clean but the common areas hallways seemed run down the concierge was also not the most helpful, Easy to access the tube and many local sights
236063,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Concierge was extremely helpful and full of positive energy Tony and his colleague helped collect a box so I could FedEx items back to the U S all I had to do was pack and provide my account number and address THANK YOU They were also extremely knowledgeable of the city and surrounding areas Provided excellent The concierge provided excellent transportation directions to various areas Again THANKS Front desk was aware of my arrival from the another country and had a room available for me to check in upon my arrival from Manchester The gal at the front desk was very hospitable beautiful smile and suggested a great place for a traditional English breakfast All the staff I met are keepers 
236064,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The worst experience was at the sky bar lounger where it felt that I am being paid to have a drink The attitude of the bar tender was not at all acceptable I had expressed checked out and have not received my invoice yet Its been 5 days already No Pool, The breakfast spread was amazing Metro access to walking distance The sky lounge is a one time must go place View 
236065,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The picture of the rooms are deceiving and our room was disappointingly smaller than I expected the queen bed was very small for 2 Our room looked out on Pepys street and not hotels fault but noise from building work opposite We came back from breakfast the next morning to pack to move rooms as not one available on arrival to find the maid tidying the room and making our bed for us She was very lovely but we couldn t get her to understand we didn t need it and wouldn t leave We were moved to King room facing inside bed much better intrusive view from other rooms No coat hooks not many hangers 4 night stay or drawers the mirror over the desk is too high TV on apple mac has no programme guide The air conditioning panel has a cover but it doesn t cover it side view so when in bed shone in my eyes Key card needed to use lift is temperamental Sky bar gets very busy with external visitors and struggled to get seated to eat Service charge is still added to drinks bill if you buy for the bar The carpet in the corridor on level 5 is rucked up in places and come away from the join causing me to trip , The staff are always willing to help and very nice Daniel on front desk was very helpful and moved rooms for us Breakfast very good roof bar has an amazing views great cocktails 
236066,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The price of drink in the hotel lobby 13 for a glass of wine and 5 50 for a small Heiniken extremely expensive whne you consider that in Witherspoons the same would cost half of that The breakfast while grand could have a bit more variety for teh price The English breakfast got a bit boring on the third day A bit of white and black Irish pudding would be good a few kippers possibly , Location ideal for access to Underground 
236067,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing Everything was quite good , Very nice excellent hotel Very courteous and friendly staff well designed nice restaurant inside hotel with a great choice of organic and natural products a natural and relaxed atmosphere sunlight everywhere spacious rooms great lobby and excellent breakfast

236069,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, the view from our room looked straight out on to a brick bridge not very pretty I m sure some people got good views but we were obviously just unlucky , Bar on the 12th floor was great lovely views etc Warm cookie on arrival was also very nice although we checked in separately at different times and only one of us got a cookie Room was clean and fine 
236070,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Drinks quite expensive , The room was spacious clean and well equipped with a lovely shower nice toiletries and complimentary water The breakfast was superb fabulous omelettes on offer excellent variety of food and the staff were first class friendly efficient and welcoming On arrival the queue for checking in was quite long it was Friday but staff came around with complimentary orange juice nice touch Reception staff processed our 6 rooms relatively quickly The hotel is very handy for taxis never had to wait also the underground is only 100 metres away Great transport options 
236071,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Arrived early room not ready told it would be ready for 15 00 that was no problem Went back after 15 00 room not ready and it would be over an hour they then changed our room to a disabled one got to room half eaten chocolate left in the fridge Next day room not made not by 19 05 given 6 complementary drinks but we only wanted things right as we had paid for which was not cheep , good location
236072,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, On returning to the hotel late in the evening we wanted to have a drink to finish off the day The lobby bar was empty and being vacuumed so we headed to the SkyBar which we found very disappointing as whilst not crowded offered limited seating and music was so loud we could hear it from the lift As it was mainly couples in the bar the loud music seemed unnecessary We left without having a drink as did other people who were in the lift with us One other annoying feature was the lifts failed to recognise that you had inserted your key card and therefore on a couple of occasions didn t stop at out floor loads of people were complaining in the lift about this , A warm welcome and a cookie on checking in was a nice touch The staff we came into contact with were polite and professional We would definitely revisit the hotel 
236073,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Poor coffee as usual and long wait to check in although this was down to extra security measures, Well appointed rooms including Apple TV Modern bathrooms and large rooms

236077,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Long queue at front desk should have known before that we can check in online to save time upon arrival booking com issue not enough parking space at hotel BUT public parking The Minories available close 5 min walk really easy no check out receipt still waiting on it , Cookie at arrival and fresh drink Bed was really confy and good great furniture in bathroom Apple equipment in room was very good 
236078,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Key cards kept stopping working drinks in the bar very overpriced and service charge added onto everything The Natural restaurant is also very overpriced and food not that good Far better food and drink available only a short walking distance away, Perfect location for seeing the sights and secure underground parking was a bonus although cost 30 per night

236081,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The cleaning staff kept knocking on my door to clean after I specifically asked not to be disturbed twice That was annoying , The woman who hosted the breakfast was an absolute delight Pleasant friendly and just made it enjoyable to be there Forgot her name all I remember is she wore glasses unfortunately Was 24th June 8am if you want to give feedback 
236082,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our room was located directly opposite the gym so there was little privacy when we had the curtains open there were guests on the treadmills staring straight at us through the window The room was also a lot smaller than I anticipated , Bed was very comfy and breakfast was amazing The sky bar was also very nice for drinking in the evening a great view of the city 
236083,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We checked in at 3 30 and our room wasn t ready should have been ready at 3 I was annoyed as we had afternoon evening plans and we weren t able to shower and change before we left We had to leave our bags with the concierge , The hotel was clean and modern and in a great location a few minutes walk from tower hill tube station

236089,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We booked this as it had been described as luxurious and because it was a special birthday We had wanted luxury so didn t mind paying more than our usual Premier Inn choice We were really disappointed in the low standard of the room and had to upgrade to a King We felt that the Premier Inn at Euston was better and felt really let down , Restaurant breakfast choice
236090,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I would have liked a bath The Tv was too quiet , The room was very comfortable and the view from the bar was stunning The hotel is also close to the underground and many interesting places a

236094,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, It was my partner s very significant birthday and on booking I had requested a room with a view of the river if at all possible as I wanted everything to be perfect On the 6th July 2 days before arrival I received an email offering champagne chocolates rose petals etc at a cost to help celebrate I skimmed it and didn t think any more about it On arrival I was told no rooms with a view were available and I had been sent an email to that effect which I didn t think I had and even if I had how would I cancel and rebook another hotel in London so close to the travel date The receptionist spoke to someone on the phone and asked for executive access I presume to make up for the disappointment I think she was told no and instead gave us four drinks vouchers which we used We were given a small room with a view of an office building on the fourth floor or the option to wait five minutes till 3pm for a room on the 7th which she said also didn t have a view Today I have checked for an email saying no rooms with views were available and couldn t find it By chance I re read the email about champagne and chocolates received on 6th and buried in the middle is general information saying no rooms with views were available but I had missed it It would have been much better to have explained this at the time of booking so as to avoid great disappointment and no option to rebook anywhere else 2 days before arrival time at the height of summer in London For 269 I expected a little better treatment or advanced warning to mitigate disappointment on the day , Comfortable beds pillows very clean bedding large towels quiet Nice plain carpet in hallways no swirls to make your eyes crossed Staff helpful fast and efficient especially at breakfast Wide choice at breakfast fresh and plentiful range very little wait even at peak time

236096,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The shower tended to leak onto the floor because of the design of the shower which led us to using extra towels Wish the trash cans in the room were a little a larger , The staff at the front desk and management were very nice The executive lounge staff were exceptional and they had a lot of nice food offerings during the day The bar and restaurants were nice and the location was primo

236099,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We went out for the morning afternoon on our first day and by 3 30pm ish our room hadn t been cleaned The staff came around while we were getting ready to go out for the evening but were only able to leave fresh towels and bottles of water I felt that the bartenders in the Sky Lounge could have been friendlier and more welcoming , We forgot to pack toothpaste so we called reception and they sent us up a little complimentary tube The staff on reception were all very friendly and we got cookies on arrival which was a nice touch 
236100,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The so called room upgrade for my girlfriends 21st seemed useless the room was a lot smaller than when I attended a year beforehand and I even paid more this time Also as pathetic as it sounds we weren t offered anything extra and weren t even given a cookie upon arrival like everyone else , The staff were very helpful when approached with an issue Quick to get everything sorted 
236101,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, More check in Check out front of house staff quite a jam up checking in ad out, Hi this was an excellent experience thank you The staff bar none were exemplary and friendly professional and on point Two x tea bags in the teapot for one this is a small thing but very welcome and shows real attention to detail

236103,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We have been overcharged for the room Although we have managed to sort it out during check out but 200 pounds is still being blocked on my credit card and we left a hotel over a week ago Our pyjamas were hijacked by cleaning staff It took us two days to free them To sum it up we have been expecting a little bit more , Large room good location very helpful staff in the breakfest area

236110,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The staff in the restaurant was rude we were aware we had to pay for breakfast and out of nowhere without us asking he approached my boyfriend and made us aware we had to pay We went to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and him making that comment was uncalled for One of the cleaners were also rude as I was trying to explain to her I just walked out of my room and left one bag in there and she accused it not being my room when she saw me walking out of it , The room location and rooftop bar 
236111,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I was charged 25GBP extra per night as a deposit which i do not still why This was no mentioned anywhere in the conditions Really small rooms , Quiet You can have a proper sleep

236116,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I am very disappointed that no one saw fit to inform me that I would need to pay a Congestion Charge for having driven to the hotel especially as the concierge arranged my parking and knew I had not visited London before This has turned into a very costly mistake for me ,No Positive
236117,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The room had all the facilities you would want from a hotel I especially liked the computer tv great sound for listening to the radio channels Breakfast was great a very good choice of continental or full English My only problem was that we sat in the lobby which wasn t the problem but the cooked food wasn t hot and the plates were cold But we all enjoyed our breakfasts both mornings On our second morning we had a very nice young in training waiter called Daniel who was very attentive to our needs We have stayed in quite a few hotels in London over the years and I can honestly say this is one of the better ones by far

236126,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Being offered the choice of a cookie I didn t really want one but felt I had to have it I d rather say no and a donation go to charity , Everything Rooms very quiet Pillows and bedding fantastic Staff extremely helpful

236132,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not a big issue but i would have preferred to have the room service menu in print in the room , The staff was very polite and helpful I had a couple of issues that had nothing to do with the hotel itself but had to be resolved and the staff was extremely forthcoming informative and professional 
236133,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The bed was super comfy Room and bathroom nice and spacious the sky bar is one of the best hotel sky bars I ve been to definitely recommend having a cocktail on the balcony over looking the city Staff very professional knowledgeable and helpful I needed to find a hair dressers for a blow dry and the concierge was extremely helpful Would happily stay again

236136,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room was VERY small for being a King size room dated rugs were dirty bathroom immensely small using room key for elevator was cumbersome because cards wouldn t work had to have new cards made twice view was fishbowl of everyone else s room staff required us to use them for our luggage transport obviously wanted tips no restaurant on site staff hurried you along didn t get the feeling you were a customer more like cattle Apple TV was a pain couldn t scroll through to see what shows were on had to back out of a channel and try another prepaid room and was double charged at time of registration plus this property had a major identity crisis 1 Name on booking com DoubleTree Hilton another when they sent a reminder registration Best Western and a 3rd name when credit card charged name I never heard of it was like a bait and switch you pay for a Hilton property are given the expectation of a Best Western and wind up with something you never imagined overall would not stay here again , Only thing I liked was the location because my husband wanted to go to the Tower Of London Don t misunderstand the view from the property was zero view of anything but other people s rooms Hello peeping Toms 
236137,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, As with all London hotels drinks in the bar are hugely overpriced , Friendly staff from reception to housekeeping Great location near underground station historical tourist sites and great bars and restaurants 
236138,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I would have thought that robes should have been provided The TV Apple computer was not practical as it took too long to load up sometimes froze picture and could only be switched off manually at the back a separate TV is the answer , Very comfy bed sky lounge great good breakfast with quality produce 
236139,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, We liked the Nature restaurant however the chairs could have been a little more comfortable considering my age 73 Breakfast was very good so were the beds 
236140,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Drink prices but expected, There were 5 of us in total and 3 rooms My brother was visiting from New Zealand The rooms were a lovely size we had an accessible room but still suited us fine My brother was upgraded due to noise issue which was appreciated and vouchers for wine and free breakfast the sky lounge is lovely The situation of hotel
236141,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, All good , The car parking concierge Mr Yuri He s the man very good service friendly and also gave me a VIP drinks card to resume at the sky lounge 
236142,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room furniture a little on the spartan side I had to do some work but it wouldn t bother most people , Good location and easy to get to You just need to remember there s a Hilton Tower Hill and a Hilton Tower Bridge The Sky Lounge is pretty good Very pleasant and efficient staff I liked the breakfast and there s enough choice 
236143,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bathroom is a bit outdated for the price the sink did not drain well and the loo flush required a lot of effort to push The apple computer tv is also a bit limited , Super helpful professional and approachable staff very comfortable bed breakfast was worth the extra money It was very quiet 
236144,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There are no help call points in the bathroom if you got locked in you are trapped our door handle could be easily pulled out The view from the room was awful overlooking the atrium would suggest asking for a view of the outside or it feels claustrophobic Breakfast was ok had much better though , Beds were very comfortable
236145,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Drink prices and the associated restaurant, Huge king size bed air conditioned room great shower Lovely roof top bar albeit a little pricey and very pleasant staff

236147,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The staff were amazing Could not do enough for us and made us feel like royalty which we certainly aren t The only staff I found not so good was the barman in the sky lounge who made me feel a bit like we shouldn t be there That said though everyone else we encountered were wonderful and made this treat for us truly a wonderful experience Would definitely choose this hotel or a hotel in the same chain when visiting London again which I am next year with my daughter to come and see Hamilton 
236148,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We checked in early in the morning so we could leave our overnight bags for the day but on our return at the end of the day when tired we had to stand in a queue for half an hour with all those checking in for the first time who like us earlier were completing forms by hand what is that about in this computer age when bookings are made online Also it would have been nice if we were told how to make the lift work throughout our stay we came across people stuck going up and down in the lift because they couldn t make it stop at the floor they wanted , Biggest plus was the air conditioning which worked very well Bed and pillows comfortable Breakfast enjoyable Nice touch was the cookie given on checking in

236199,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Issue about which card I used to reserve room Embarrassing misleading and unnecessary Also Booking com failed to clearly state that breakfast was NOT included, Location and overall
236200,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Re the vouchers for 5 that are available if you forego housekeeping A good idea in principle BUT the hotel needs to make it more clear as to when and where these vouchers can be used The voucher says that it can be used in the Sky bar as well as 7 lounge area where breakfast is also served However it transpires that the vouchers can not be used against the cost of breakfast in the 7 Lounge The voucher should say this , Sky bar Size of rooms Reception

236205,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Rooms may have a bit too much furniture in as floor space is a bit limited in the exec double rooms but manageable Exec lounge on ground floor is a bit naff and had a better experience in the sky lounge despite having to pay for the wine no reason why you could not run the free drinks thing in the lounge using your hotel key card , Great location and superb sky lounge Great breakfast on offer Quiet room and a comfy bed and good wifi for work stuff 
236206,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Hotel carpark was very difficult to get into and my husband curbed his alloy wheels on his very new car I tried to cancel my booking for 2 rooms 5 minutes after making it I was told that I would still have to pay as it was less than 24 hours before we were due to arrive So they would only charge for one room I said we would still honour the booking and go after all I was still charged for the cancellation although it was eventually sorted out They said as a good will gesture they wouldn t charge me for the cancellation When I hadn t cancelled after all this was more than a little annoying Especially after ruining the alloy wheels in the car park , Rooms comfortable and clean Beds comfortable wifi good

236210,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was supposed to be 59 off but I don t believe that to be true due to how plain and basic it was We paid 150 with the discount but didn t end up sleeping there as it was such a depressing feeling room We came home by cab as our house has a nicer feel And it was my birthday treat we had a nice meal at gaucho and came home , The sky bar
236211,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 3 oclock check in would be better earlier and a earlier check out as bags are being stored for you so no need for room after 10 00 on check out day, Love the fact that even though check in wasn t until 3 we managed to check in early Also baggage storage was great so we could explore without carrying heavy bags around 
236212,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not as nice as other Hiltons I have stayed in room very small and basic but I think for the price and location this is to be expected in London Also paid for a King Room but was 2 single beds pushed together which was poor , Breakfast was nice high quality of food Good location close to Tower Hill Station

236221,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Asked the hotel to make an exception on reserving a parking space due to the value and required quick access to items in the vehicle to be given the standard response about first come first served then when we arrived they told us ah it s fine to just park your car here no problem shame we d already made alternative arrangements The bar staff seemed a little disinterested to say the least , The location of the hotel is great right next to tower bridge near enough right in the city Great place to explore from Not a lot of bars etc right next to it but that s not what I was there for on this trip Check in was quick and easy and the gentleman at reception was extremely polite and helpful Nice and clean and comfortable bed 
236222,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, cold buffet breakfast eggs beans all luke warm I also asked for de caf tea bags twice but none appeared and 2 wine glasses Staff member came up to the room with tea bags but not de caf and no wine glasses I went to reception after phoning twice and got my own tea bags and wine glasses I also expected more in the king suite we were in The bath was small and the room not as luxurious as portrayed on the web site disappointed and would not pay for a suite again as feel no better than a double room, location for the tower of london tower bridge and the walk to the Tate Modern is excellent Staff are friendly
236223,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The bed was great breakfast very good only complaint it states that the room is soundproof yet we could hear the Girls in the next room talking kept us awake for quite a while also you could hear people walking past talking

236227,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast wasn t great thought there was room for improvement the serving tools was all mixed up and the bacon wasn t really fit for purpose , Yes the hotel was great I really enjoyed my stay parking was excellent the only downside was the breakfast thought things had been around longer than they should have been i e bacon it was a shame but it wouldn t stop me from staying again 
236228,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Leaving the bags was quite a hectic process perhaps everything is a big close to main reception which makes it slightly confusing as people queuing for reception and leaving luggage When we checked in the second time and the room was ready we were greeted by a different receptionist who said that as my husband was 70 a room next to the lift had been allocated The implication was due to his age rather than it was an amazing room This was disappointing , The location of the hotel is ideal easy access to everywhere Breakfast was very busy but staff did a great job to run an efficient service Food was very good Room was comfortable I had a planned a big surprise party on the river and informed the hotel When we checked in and left our bags we were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist who was excited about my husband s birthday and implied that they were going to allocate the best room they could We went off rather excited about the room 
236229,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The check in is a 15 00 3 p m which is a very weird time and in most situation not convenient at all At least you can still leave your bags at the front desk , We had a room on the 10th floor The room was clearly recently renovated so everything felt new It was very clean and I rarely say this There s what you need bed small desk a chair without all the unnecessary things like a bed cover that you don t what to do with The breakfast was quite nice The hotel is 2min from Tower Hill station so it s very convenient The classic welcome cookie is very good

236231,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff were completely inefficient complete lack of communication in fact I would go as far as to say complete disregard for communication prior to visit during visit and after visit Made promises they did not keep , Location
236232,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Waited 20 mins to check in which after a long journey was disappointing Prices of the drinks especially in the rooftop bar were ridiculous, The hotel was immaculate Great location Choice of bars were great and the rooftop bar terrace was excellent but very expensive
236233,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was very small for the price , The location of the hotel to historical sites in London It is also two blocks from the underground which helps connect travelers to the rest of the city 
236234,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I asked for some extras to be out in the room as it was for my boyfriends birthday but when we went to the room nothing I had asked for was there I was very disappointed as I was assured it would be in the room, Daniel on reception was fantastic We went for my boyfriends birthday and he made it extra special the shower was amazing And so was the pillows The fridge In the room was a nice touch too

236236,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The 4 lifts at peak times had large queues and stairs not next to the lifts Lift system not sensible at all Have to put card in slot in lift to access bedroom levels then press button Even then it didn t always take you to the level you needed we were on level 10 we ended up going back down again despite pressing the button lift was often full but stopped at every level going down And sometimes up Frustrating You can request not to have housekeeping and then you get a voucher for the bar Great idea but they still came in and changed the whole bed and did the housekeeping then knocked on the door for an unknown reason the day of departure rather early Strange Also changed the bar of soap each day Why What a waste Keep it there , Very comfortable bed and nice room The executive lounge facilities were fantastic strong coffee or tasty hot chocolate and food snacks Glad I chose this option and well worth it Was also be able to grab a take away coffee before heading out the door too Staff very friendly and helpful and welcome cookie the best I have tasted warm too Very clean hotel and good layout with lots of space to sit Would come back again 
236237,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The fact that the breakfast was not in the price , Didn t have breakfast cost in with the room Expensive to buy if you just want a light breakfast

236242,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Lengthy check in due to receptionist taking phone calls while serving me Very loud air con Empty minibar , Apple television with internet access was a very nice touch Very clean
236243,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Check in and out was very laboured with lengthy queues each time and members of Hilton Honours being taken out of queues and prioritised Perhaps they should have a separate check in desk to make them feel special and the majority of the other guests wanted Lifts were also poor and the use of cards for bedroom floors made matters worse With many stairwells between floors the extra security measure appears unnecessary One lift of four was out of action both days to make matters worse , Great location within very short walk of underground stations Breakfast was excellent and rooms spacious and well equipped 
236244,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The hotel took 50 out of my account without informing me why It was apparently for admin fee that was refundable but I haven t received it, The hotel took 50 out of my account without informing me why It was apparently for admin fee that was refundable but I haven t received it

236246,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent place in alone on opposite Tower Bridge The hotel was brilliant breakfast was really good but busy the staff cold not do enough for you and the position was fabulous for the tube as th Circle line was 100 metres away and took you everywhere 3 day a Oyster pass the way to go for the tube
236247,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Friendly staff location very handy for Tower Hill Tube DLR Line plenty of places to eat drink near by Excellent London Marathon Hotel early breakfast route passes the Tower Of London Tower Bridge two minutes from Hotel
236248,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Horrendous bar prices , Just excellent customer service all through great breakfast food quality very good front desk very helpful loved the warm cookies on arrival just a great experience We have stayed here once before some years ago enjoyed it then its still very good 
236249,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Didn t have connecting rooms ready so we had a long wait while they sorted it and then we ended up in a small room while the kids got a suite , Helpful staff nice welcome with freshly baked cookies good breakfast selection well located 
236250,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Pillows were not good for me apparently you can ask for others but I didn t know that until check out , Nice touches like having a computer in the room although this doubled as the TV and the screen was a little small good sized room and nice toiletries not the usual cheap tat Quiet at night Also the breakfast was excellent and we were given a cookie on arrival slightly random but nice 
236251,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Computer screen is a little small to use as a TV shower heat was temperamental Drinks at the SkyLounge bar are extraordinarily expensive , V large and comfy bed friendly staff who offer quick and professional service No TV but an iMac in each room which has TV enabled as well as the limited use of the computer if you need it Air con was very effective 5 bar voucher if you refuse turn down service Free cookies at the reception desk SkyLounge bar is beautiful 
236252,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, air conditioning wasnt up to the task of cooling the big room iMac doesnt have an HDMI port so cant use streaming services , free wifi nice bar on the 12th floor

236254,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Expensive parking rate , Very friendly staff and clean atmosphere The Sky Lounge is a convenient place to have a relaxing evening in a stylish surrounding 
236255,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The rooms are too small and bathrooms are really tiny , The sky lounge is wonderful Night View of Tower Bridge is amazing from sky lounge Staff is really friendly We spent most of our evening time at sky lounge 
236256,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, They never mentioned how to use the lift with my key card so it took several goes to work it out The Mac Book instead of a TV doesn t really work it is very far away from the bed and the screen is small my speakers weren t working and when I tried to use it as a computer it said that the wireless keyboard and mouse weren t connected despite the keyboard and mouse not being wireless and being connected so I gave up and used my laptop but the wifi was very good , The receptionist that checked me in was very welcoming and we ended up having quite a lengthy chat which was lovely The room was really nice The bed was very big with lots a fluffy pillows I slept like a baby I loved all the choice of teas how all the soaps etc are provided in the bathroom and the ironing board iron and shoe polish cloth came in very useful The bathroom was very clean and spacious but the toilet doesn t flush very well The breakfast had lots of choice the fresh fruit was really nice The hotel is 2 min walk from Tower Hill station and right by the Tower of London my meeting was in Westminster so the tube journey was about 15min They let me leave overnight bag in their cloakroom from 9am 6pm after I checked out which I was grateful for 
236257,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only two faults for me in the bedrooms there didn t seem to be any extraction from the bathroom which meant smells pervaded everywhere The second was the breakfast the tea and the hot food was lukewarm at best and cold at worse , The biscuits on arrival were great the staff were really friendly perfect location
236258,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I am allergic to lavender and they have lavender in all of their soaps etc so I had to use my face wash to wash my hands When I asked if they had any alternative the response was No That s it Not even a Sorry we ve left poison in every possible toilet , The bed was very comfortable 
236259,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Roof top bar would have preferred a more relaxing experience to enjoy the view not banging music, Great location next to Tower of London quieter than other areas I ve stayed in
236260,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, the staff were extremely helpful we had an issue with the shower access and they immediately found us a new room that fit our needs will definitely use this hotel chain again 
236261,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff very unhelpful found staff to be abrupt Concierge wasn t helpful at all 30 to park car then struggle with luggage no offer of assistance 4 rating is laughable never again , Clean tidy
236262,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The rooms I would compare to a premier in other than the mac computer the beds was terrible there was no comfort in it what so ever me and my partner hardly slept and left by 8am the next morning we was going to stay up London for the day but had to go home as we had no sleep , The sky lounge bar was a really good asset 
236263,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The scrambled eggs were soggy The seating was really tight for breakfast and the volume of people that come I think its understaffed during busy time Calling for guest service help before checking in was impossible to get ahold of them because they are so busy so some tours I was unable to do because I didnt know who to get information from due to hotel guest services to busy, breakfast was good Staff was polite enjoyed the welcome cookie
236264,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Views from the bedroom were pretty ordinary poor but that didn t matter to us , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was superb just 3 minutes from the tube It s a great central London location 
236265,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing All good , The cookie on arrival was delicious The rooms were absolutely spotless I felt like I was the first person to ever use the shower So clean everywhere The location was perfect Staff were all so helpful friendly smiley 
236266,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, They couldn t cope with breakfast dining room was too small to accommodate the guests the waiting time was very long Any more than 2 guests and they had a meltdown , Sky lounge
236267,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, air conditioning was quite noisy housekeeping banged on the door at 8 15 am There was a ong wait for the lifts every time I used them and lots of people coming and going past midnight visiting the Sky Lounge , The location right by the Tower of London is ideal for business and leisure I was able to enjoy the view from Tower Bridge while walking to my meetings Very handy for tube and buses south bank restaurants etc Delighted to find an ironing board and iron in the room as well as a free bottle of water 
236268,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We supposedly had a deluxe queen room and it was nice but to be honest it was no bigger or any better than your average travel lodge withthe exception of a few handy toiletries , As you walk in the lobby is very impressive and you immediately think you are going to have an amazing stay The staff are welcoming but at the end of the day for us it was the room that counted and it was disappointing
236269,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The only tiny criticism was that the music in the Skylounge was rather too loud for a venue where people were primarily conversing rather than dancing The fantastic view over the Tower of London and Tower Bridge meant that i didnt really mind the music though , Staff were amazing the standard of service was very high nothing was too much trouble Breakfast was excellent as well 
236270,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was very very poor for the price Cheap furnishings no TV A computer monitor that had limited channels I understand after staying there it was a business hotel but the quality of the room was 3 star at the very best very disappointed and as it was a holiday week we had no choices or I would have refused to accept the room Extremely disappointed I have stayed in Doubletree and Hilton this was not even Motel 6 room wise Everything else was acceptable restaurant for breakfast was okay , Location
236271,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Disappointed to pay 125 for a very late booking and to be given room designed for clients with mobility issues This would never be an issue if advised at time of booking but gave a feeling that filling a room was more important than client experience ,No Positive
236272,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Rooms were clean staff all very helpful The hotel sky bar is excellent but pricey but what do you expect in London All rooms have an Apple Mac in them which is handy for making plans in the city and checking the maps for your trip 
236273,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, we had to ask for our room to be cleaned the next day It was done quite fast when asked however after a full day site seeing and coming back aprox 4pm I would have thought it should have been cleaned by this time lifts were a nightmare There was four lifts two broke during our weekend stay They were very unpredictable you would be waiting a while and then multiple time would go past you Many people trying to squeeze into a lift as they had been waiting so long Still really enjoyed our stay just a few things that could have been improved , I liked how it was so close to the tube lots of places to eat and tower bridge Room on arrival was clean was given complimentary drinks as it was our wedding anniversary and had great views from the roof top bar Cookie on arrival was a nice touch 
236274,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, View from room adjacent building below scaffolding Price of drinks include service charge No toilet paper in bathroom crumbs of food on chair , Great location Roof terrace with great views
236275,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Big issue was that we were given key cards to an occupied room We walked in and were shocked to find open bags and that definitely affected our stay What if someone walks into our room at any time Also the bed was small , Excellent location good staff modern fit out
236276,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Indecent haste to clear our breakfast table when we had not finished our meal but had gone back to buffet for something more to eat This happened on each day We returned to the table and had to reorder beverages and cutlery We found this rather annoying as we could not relax because the breakfast was otherwise excellent We felt the pricing was rather steep for tourists with no company to pick up the expenses tab We would love to stay there more often but could not afford to do so , Staff excellent and very attentive Reception welcoming and efficient Our room was just about perfect for our needs and very comfortable Location ideal for a tourist due to the proximity to the Tower of London The views from rooftop bar superb 
236277,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Long queue to check in no bath no staircase wait for lift all the time the view out of my window, I liked the bar on the top floor I like my Mac in the room and its sound system
236278,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Confusion with payment when leaving money was paid at time of checking in but staff were saying he would charge our card again when checking out You have to pay an extra 25 a night just incase you use room service this should be completely optional and they don t serve pints of beer in any of there bars just all bottles which is quiet annoying especially when you like a pint , The skybar was excellent great views of London at night and by day location excellent just next to tube station and close to Towerhill plenty of bars and restaurants close by 
236279,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only gripe is there were no rooms with city views Minor however , Perfect location able to get anywhere in London in no time at all Rooms were comfortable and immaculately clean Skylounge was stunning 
236280,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We had a party of 20 booked in to the SkyLounge for lunch and it was really really disappointing The staff were lovely but totally overstretched The food was disappointing Caesar salad a romaine lettuce sliced in half and sprinkled with a hard boiled egg and some dried up chicken Long long wait for drinks which arrived in fits and starts We had booked in advance and therefore the size of the party was known before we arrived I do feel that if a restaurant can t cope with a large party size they should say so , Rooms and room facilities were just what we expected although one of the rooms was an internal room and very hot Reception staff were lovely and very helpful Location and views are good 
236281,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Everything was top notch , Lovely staff Crisp white sheets on a comfy bed and everything we needed in the bathroom loved the Crabtree Evelyn toiletries Breakfast was very good lots of choice hot cooked food too and no soggy toast in sight Delicious croissants and pastries and an excellent bread selection too To top it all the view over London from the Sky lounge is fantastic 
236282,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was super comfy The rooftop bar was amazing you got a great view of London The staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the warm cookie you got on arrival 
236283,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No complaints, Spacious comfortable room with temperature controls Small refrigerator in room very welcome for storing drinks Easy access to tube and around the corner from Tower Bridge and Tower of London Amazing breakfast with loads of choice 
236284,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Would like a little more tea coffee etc in the room Having to use room key for the lift was a little irritating , The welcome cookie was delicious The room was clean and comfortable Location was perfect for sightseeing trip The rooftop bar was a nice touch 
236285,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Waiting times at check in were too long We were asked to the counter but the receptionist ran away and asked us to wait Guests that were behind us in line were then served before us by other receptionist , The warm chocolate cookies at check in were great 
236286,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Sky bar was quite expensive however we happily drank in there most of the weekend, Rooms were perfect for what we needed Sky bar is lovely and amazing views of the city 
236287,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lifts were a bit of a pain to operate and the volume on the i mac wasn t very loud in our room but other than that a brilliant hotel , Brilliant friendly staff food excellent and a nice quiet hotel and comfortable rooms 
236288,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 1 member of bar staff at skylounge arrogant and rude The guy that shakes the cocktails loved himself and let our experience down unfortunately, Everybody was amazing made us feel so welcome Sky lounge bar views spectacular Food amazing worth every penny Location perfect
236289,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Huge queues for breakfast Fortunately we got up early 7 30 hotel did warn in advance but did feel a little rushed as you could see the huge queues waiting On a Sunday there is the option of skipping breakfast and paying 10 to have brunch in the sky lounge which includes mimosas Which I think if I went again I would do instead , Fantastic location clean friendly
236290,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No food or room service after 11pm No view hard to find even sat nav failed to get us there and we hopped into taxi , Breakfast great Staff nice very efficient Rooms clean neat 
236291,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Pillows were rubbish Avoid breakfast in the executive lounge not much choice food wasn t that warm slow turnover Eat breakfast in the main restaurant yes it s busier but much better, Great hotel stayed on many occasions Fantastic bar great rooms modern clean feel
236292,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No comments on this one as everything was perfect , Absolutely helpful and very friendly staff from the reception area to restaurant Spotless rooms and perfect location Made our stay very enjoyable bearing in mind it was both our birthdays An amazing experience like we haven t had in a while The building is very beautiful and the sky lounge is stunning But Definitely the staff adds up to an already magical stay Thanks for everything 
236293,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, N A, Having an iMac in the room was nice as we were able to check our emails and watch our YouTube playlists as well as having access to the regular tv channels
236294,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, check in and check out far too slow, Lovely hotel in an excellent location Bed really comfortable great night sleep Breakfast excellent huge choice and great for kids
236295,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Rooms were spacious and comfortable staff were attentive and the breakfast was amazing Couldn t fault it everything was great Location was good too as 2 min walk from the tube station 
236296,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room was far too hot and the air conditioning wasn t very good We upgraded to a queen room but couldnt tell much difference from the standard room , Love the location and the roof top bat
236297,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was awful Very poor quality and limited selection for the money The size of the restaurant is far too small for the volume of guests resulting in very long queues and waiting time just to get in When you do get a table you are practically sat on your neighbours lap By all means stay here but book room only and eat at one of the many quality restaurants in the vicinity , Nice warm cookie on check in was an unexpected treat 
236298,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Like a lot of London hotels now seems to be geared more towards lone business travellers than couples families Only small niggles such as volume on the computer TV didn t work not bath etc Everything was very compact no sense of space , The room was very clean staff were very polite and helpful and the breakfast was excellent Hotel is in an excellent location right by the tube 
236299,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Despite the security provided by card key access to guest floors via the lift elevator a person with intent can easily piggy back a ride or use accessible staircases Not good bearing in mind the recent tragic events in London , The pro activeness of staff in their immediate recognition that Saturday morning breakfast was becoming really busy and opened a second breakfast facility without hesitation 
236300,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Check out took a wile Someone and used our room number to pay for their drinks on the rooftop bar and we has to stand was ages with the receptionist checked threw all the recipts to make sure we hadnt signed it Its ridiculous that someone can even get away with doing that bar staff should be more careful Also they hold money on your bank card even tho i was paying cash and it can take 15 days to go back into your bank account , The roof top bar during the day when it was quiter less potentious people durying the day Large comfy beds Free cookies Very close to tube station 
236301,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Ideally placed hotel to visit Tower Bridge and the Tower of London Lots of restaurants around Our room didn t have the view but up on 12th floor in the bar the views were brilliant A lovely hotel 
236302,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Smoking on the roof top bar there should be a non smoking zone for those who do not wish to smoke , Very conscientious staff and even an iMac in your room to help you plan your trip Hotel is located 1 minute walk away from Tower Hill tube station so easily accessible 
236303,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The location was absolutely perfect for what we needed however for a tourist there to see the sights I would not recommend it Brilliant if you are on a Business trip Just beware that on weekends the area surrounding it is extremely quiet and some shops are not open at all It is very close to the tube station however it is a bit of a trek if heading to Oxford Street Leicester Square as the tube line it is on does not go there directly , We loved the free cookies on arrival The rooms are very modern minimal and clean It was less than 5 minutes walk from Tower Hill train station and the Tower of London The staff were very friendly and accommodating The hotel had a lovely swanky feel to it and the views from the Skylounge were lovely 
236304,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I didn t like the 12 5 service charge When I buy two royal mojitos costing 26 and then have to pay 12 5 on top of that is just scandalous I don t like tipping and not because I m tight it s just that I believe you should pay your staff a fair amount and not make them work harder for tips to make their wages better Just my opinion , I loved the views from the sky bar It made our stay that little bit more special as it was romantic 
236305,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Lovely hotel great location beside the underground Love the warm cookie on arrival as we were hungry breakfast was ok My partner had a fry which he said wasn t great I had the porridge which was terrible But loved the fresh fruit and pastries The bar on level 12 is beautiful with great views but didn t enjoy it as it took us 25mins to get a drink and it was not that busy We had to watch the barmen show off for an unnecessarily long period of time while they made cocktails Would not go back to the bar again as a result of this 
236306,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Would have preferred more of a wine selection in the Executive Lounge Maybe some rose Also no ice machine on 9th floor, Ideal for me as get train to Fenchurch Street station Not far from underground so easy to get anywhere 
236307,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room was very small for the price and it was very warm to warm to sleep , We were allowed access to our room early We had complimentary drinks due to a request not being carried out 
236308,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only downside was bag misplaced for a few moments due to being separated from other luggage and view from hotel looked out to a scaffolding where buildings outside could see right into room, The bed was really comfy and staff was really professional Amazing views from sky bar well worth price of room
236309,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent service as we were upgraded to the executive room Got free access to the executive lounge and breakfast The staff on reception made the stay exceptional for my partners 30th 
236310,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was an extensive amount of breakfast items available however the staff didn t appear to be able to keep up with the demand on the hot breakfast buffet This meant that we had to wait 10 minutes to get any eggs to go with our English Breakfast by which time the rest of the items were cold , Check in and check out process and the general customer service experience was great They clearly train their staff to a very high standard 
236311,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The sky lounge nice views but definitely overpriced poor cocktails , friendly and helpful staff clean and comfortable rooms and definitely the location 
236312,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing really , Breakfast was amazing The widest selection of food I have ever come across in a hotel and of the best quality too The rooms were so clean it was like everything was brand new and had never been used The location was perfect 
236313,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Allergens not listed on items available at the breakfast buffet so unless I asked someone which isn t easy at a busy breakfast I couldn t eat all of the food , Good clean facilities
236314,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The bar staff in the sky lounge are rude no thank yous no eye contact threw my change on the counter payed for a late check out only too be woken up at 9am by maids banging doors in the corridor When I asked the lady too stop banging doors she looked at me didn t apologise and walked straight into another room For the price we paid for this hotel the service was very poor and will not be staying in another double tree Hilton again and will be sure too pass on this info too friends and family,No Positive
236315,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not really anything to complain about perhaps the operation off the room card security on the lifts could be more intuitive , Very comfortable fresh modern hotel convenient to public transport Great breakfast Faultless wifi 
236316,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our room was overlooking the middle of the hotel which was a slight shame , The breakfast was absolutely wonderful Could not have asked for a better meal The beds you sink into they are so comfortable 
236317,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was nothing about the hotel I didn t like , We liked the options available to us at the hotel the terrace bar the restaurant Unfortunately the restaurant was closed when we got back from the theatre on our first night and nowhere else near the Tower was open either 
236318,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Good location excellent breakfast and friendly staff husbands birthday and were given a free upgrade and drinks voucher Would definitely recommend this hotel 
236319,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not enough night life near by , Large rooms for London and breakfast was great so better to get it included Easy transport underground nearby Quieter area near London Bridge Walking to Shard and the Walkie Talkie Some shops near by 
236320,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Location of room Next to gym and overlooking pub opposite Very noisy in early hours of morning Plus early morning alarm from the fitness freaks in gym ,No Positive
236321,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Your Executive the same size of travel ladge double room your executive should upgrade window was dirty , Sky lounge view was lovely The breakfast was 10 out of 10 thanks to the front line staffs that go the extra mile for us to make it possible for i and my families because we all vegetarians 
236322,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not enough staff on to deal with checks in and check outs Also soon afterwards my credit card was compromised after its last use at the hotel , location
236323,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Would be great if the hotel offered a spa as well, The roof top bar was a great experience and all the staff were very friendly would have no hesitation in coming back
236324,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The elevators are VERY slow and two of the four were inoperable during our stay There were very long queues to get to the rooms Prices seemed high for the quality of the room , 12 th floor lounge is nice
236325,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room was too small bathroom even smaller Room service menu was poor and didn t have what we wanted available Apple TV was small too quiet and hard to use , The hotel will hold your bags for you if you have a later train home than checkout
236326,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, It wasn t worth spending more and upgrading the room essentially the room was no better than premier inn and only a shower very business trip rather than romantic break I questioned whether we had been booked into the right room We d previously stayed in a standard room which was bigger and better , Great location friendly staff good room service options 
236327,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lift system was very confusing to begin with, The relaxed way you can get breakfast without queuing at the restaurant we had bacon rolls and coffee out by reception in comfy chairs
236328,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The Lifts Oh goodness The lifts were a nightmare 2 out of 4 were working It was an absolute pig to go up and down In the end took the escape stairs only to find out you need a key card to get out of the stairwell Met people in the stairwell who couldn t get out Eventually piggy backed a staff member and got out through the kitchen Advised a manager who was mortified Not the best experience Oh and if there s a Party going on in the Sky Lounge a warning would be good as we had planned for a quiet cocktail after a long evening only to be greeted by loud music and drunken women Gave up , The staff were professional and friendly They behaved like a team Henk checked us in and he had excellent customer service skills Well done Henk 
236329,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, had a very small room which is not what I was expecting due to the cost of the hotel, The breakfast is never good in that hotel and only stay there due to the location
236330,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 2 out of 4 lifts out of order for 2 days long queues to use lifts No signage for stairs As in business area many shops restaurants bars shut all day Saturday Sunday , Nice hotel excellent Sky bar Good location for sightseeing Tower Bridge Tower of London 
236331,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 2 out of the 4 lifts were broken and we were waiting up to 20 minutes on a lift that wasn t packed full , The welcome service was excellent Upon arrival we were greeted with a choice of soft drinks and a cookie Overall 11 10 for cleanliness 
236332,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Elevators needed to be repaired maintenanced a lot quicker due to high level volume of people at hotel , The hotel is located just minutes from the Tower of London and Tower Bridge which can also be seen from the 12th floor Sky Bar It is a nice clean and comfortable property Rooms are decent sizes and very comfortable The Reception Manager Charis Athanasopoulos was such a pleasure He was so helpful and patient with all of our transportation and tour questions Very knowledgeable about London and the surrounding area Would definitely stay here again 
236333,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lifts There were 4 lifts but only ever 2 working and always spent ages waiting for it to stop at our floor floor 7 it seemed to skip us all the time so ended up travelling on every floor just to get in it The key cards were very temperamental which was a pain as you need these for the lift to work , Perfect location only a 3 minute walk to Tower Hill underground Hotel was very clean and rooms to a good standard plenty of shops bars and restaurants close by Sky lounge has amazing views but rather pricey but then that could be as we are from Cornwall and not used to the prices 2 drinks set me back 25
236334,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There were 4 elevators in the hotel but still you had to wait a very long time And many times the elevator was too crowded so you had to wait for the next one It would also work better if the hotel would have a separate elevator to the skylounge for non hotel guests , Location of the hotel is perfect Near the DLR and Underground station but not on the noisy side of the street The room was quite big and clean Nice bathroom Each day you get one complimentary bottle of water per person The skylounge is very nice with a very nice view 
236335,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 50 of the lifts were faulty which ultimately lead to long delays waiting to access them Since we were on the 7th floor this was less than ideal , The Staff were really friendly and helpful The location is ideal for accessing London quickly 
236336,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We paid for a queen room and ended up with a room no bigger than a double room We expected a little more from the room for the price We didn t receive a very good welcome from staff upon check in , The hotel is in a perfect location the sky lounge bar is amazing overlooking the Tower of London and tower bridge whilst enjoying a cocktail is what London is all about 
236337,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast was cold 2 lifts out of order Being on the second floor meant that the lift was always full by the time it reached us Stairs not clearly sign posted and not the best to carry heavy cases down Not an issue if your happy to wait 20 30 mins for space in a lift or in no hurry , The cookie on arrival was nice

236405,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Shower door was a little small for a big guy and the single bed a little on the small side, I thought the whole staff from reception to room service bar and restaurant were a credit to the hotel very pleasant and very smiley

236533,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The pillows on the bed were to soft to what I usually prefer there wasn t much selection on alcohol in the executive lounge I don t drink beer or wine and that was all there was to offer the room was lovely but it seemed a bit average for the money I paid for There was no view from the room but there was nothing anyone could do about that because of the area, I loved the overall hotel the area the staff breakfast and the executive lounge the views from certain point in the hotel and the staff were very helpful and friendly and there was a personal touch to check in with a cookie the rooms were clean and the rooms also included a big tv and a mini fridge I enjoyed the heating controls also It was a special surprise for my partner which made a massive change to where we normally stay

236537,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The fact I went for breakfast at 10 15am and after I d had some cereal there were no sausages or fried eggs Waited for 15 minutes to see if more would be brought out Then when they weren t at 10 40 I asked someone and was told that the kitchen was closed and that I could have a fried egg and sausages but it would take 15 minutes to produce Ridiculous and not what I d expect from a hotel such as this , Rooms very clean and tidy Beds very comfortable The skylounge is a must for a drink

236540,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There wasn t much to fault I would say the only thing that wasn t for me was the feather pillows but I could of changed them if needed so not really a major issue , The roof top bar is in a perfect location to look out onto londons best sites the staff at the Hilton and the breakfast was spectacular I recommend this highly especial for young couples We will definitely be returning 
236541,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The rooms and lodging floors were clean and functional nothing to complain about but much too Spartan They were almost dorm like in their appearance This brought down my overall perception of the hotel , The vestibule lobby and public areas were first rate The staff was excellent and made the experience at the hotel worth the value I paid for the added breakfast and it did not disappoint At 15 lbs per person it wasn t cheap but it was a good value and worth the price I was glad my wife and I got down for breakfast early because the line that had formed by the time we finished our breakfast was very long I was only in London for a day because of problems at Heathrow However the location of the hotel is right near the Tower Bridge and allowed me a chance to salvage something out of a miserable experience by allowing me to take in a few sights in my limited time 
236542,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There are not enough elevators for such a large hotel prepare to wait for a free elevator Compared to the Angel Islington Doubletree the room seemed smaller but for London standards it s still a good size, Good location next to Tower Hill Station frequent service into central London Easy access from London City Airport to Tower Gateway Station by DLR Sky Lounge bar is a must visit Friendly staff and good breakfast Fair price
236543,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 21 50 for breakfast is way overpriced no parking available even after other guests checked out didn t have us on list for breakfast so had to stand there while they checked embarrassing Was told on checkout room price had increased after I had paid so had to stand there and argue the fact with reception more embarrassment in total cost over 430 for 4 people for 1 night , Sky lounge
236544,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Poor wi fi connection in room and not much better in lobby There were a lot of very noisy young children who were running around first floor lobby unchecked for a lot of Sunday afternoon , Reception and concierge team excellent We were looking after a tiered wedding cake delivered ahead of our arrival with their prior agreement They helped us look after it and deliver it safely to the wedding reception venue 
236545,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Lack of standard in room amenities like shower cap toothbrush vanity set slippers etc etc Not value for money, The staff Is extremely friendly and service is excellent Check in and check out was smooth and speedy 
236546,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The location was a bit out if the way for us as we spent most if the time in theatre district and oxford street Also don t get mixed up with the other double tree as we did We booked and stayed at tower bridge double tree but initially arrived at London Bridge double tree We had quite a trek with a suitcase after the staff advised we could walk to the tower bridge hotel , Comfy bed warm room Didn t really use the facilities of the hotel as we were out and about all the time and back late to hotel 
236547,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was the usual scrum at these big hotels serving buffets Tea was weak and tasteless Coffee poor A stressful experience poor and expensive at a whopping 21 Nowhere near as good as you would have at home , The cookies on arrival are a nice touch 
236548,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The check in service was extremely slow and despite having requested foam pillows in advance the pillows in the room were still feather which I am allergic to It took hours to get them replaced and I had to queue again at check in to remind them , The room
236549,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Day before arrival we had the option of cancelling booking and I asked via email rather than cancel and rebooking Could I switch to new offer I saw which included breakfast After an email trail between hotel and booking com It didn t happen and I finished up paying for breakfast on top of cost which was disappointing albeit it was a lovely breakfast but I left feeling cheated, View from 12th floor sky lounge was amazing
236550,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The bed was really comfortable and the room was very spacious, A larger bottle of shampoo conditioner and shower gel would be good only really enough for 1 shower each 
236551,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Expensive breakfast we didn t take We carried electric adapter with us otherwise impossible to charge mobile phone No electric outlet in the bathroom , Central location close to Tower and City of London Nice welcome wich warm chocolate cookie at 2 h in the night Clean Tee and coffee facilities in the room nice and necessary I Mac system computer TV nice Helpful staff 
236552,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room especially walls were filthy I informed stuff about that but they did nothing I expected more from Hilton Hotel Price was too high for standard like this I do not recommend , Good localization and varied breakfast English and continental 
236553,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast waiting staff My wife allowed her tea to go cold so asked for a replacement using English Breakfast tea The girl brought her EB tea but decaffeinated so further request for standard EB tea Girl then had to go away for 5 mins to find some EB isn t unusual surely Organisation of breakfast buffet was sensible but crockery was hidden away where it wasn t easy to see Toasting machine far away from hot buffet BUT no plates by toaster Cereal dishes were only at the far end of the cereal area so half of the diners approached from the wrong end and couldn t see them , View from the Sky Lounge seeing Tower Bridge the Shard brilliantly Wonderful outside area too with even better views Hotel is about 300 metres from Tower Hill Underground station Couldn t be better 
236554,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The cost of the parking GBP30 p day Main restaurant on Ground Floor stop serving food at 10pm and for central London this should be a bit later we obviously had an experience of arriving slightly after 10pm and missing out , Bed comfortable restaurants and bar were good cafe staff friendly 
236555,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We ordered a cooked breakfast one morning and it took over an hour to arrive luckily we weren t in a rush and when it did arrive the food wasn t that great it definitely wasn t worth the money , The location was really convenient the hotel itself and the rooftop bar was beautiful and I ve never seen a view like it The hotel was always clean and the bed so comfy The cookie and complimentary drink on arrival was also a lovely touch Loved it would stay again 
236556,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing It was perfect for what we needed , The hotel was exceptionally clean and felt very modern and inviting The reception area is lovely The breakfast was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable from the moment we arrived Warm cookies on check in was a lovely touch as well 
236557,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff treated people very differently dependent on look Told us we hadn t paid for breakfast when we had And couldn t find our baggage after checking it in , Breakfast was lovely proximity from underground station 
236558,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We were charged 620 by mistake as a deposit for incidental damage and was told 50 would be taken Could not sleep as there was a strange clicking sound coming from the hall in our room of a night which sounded like a key being inserted into the door Staff did not seem to know what they were doing , Breakfast was lovely and in a perfect location 
236559,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lifts Having to use the room key was hit and miss at best And it wasn t brilliant when you didn t need the room key , The bed was very comfy Hotel was well located for the tube and touristy things

236561,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The bath robe caused my wife to have a serious allergic reaction and she spent a very rough night wondering if she would need to go to A E for treatment The customer care line could only advise me that I could get a taxi to the local hospital in 5 10 minutes if I needed to and didn t seem to be interested otherwise, The room was standard had everything needed nice bathroom
236562,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, for a medium to high price range I would not expect for the sinks to be broken the double bed to be two singles zipped togeater aswell as the douvet that s not to say it was not good quaility just expected better I also guess there was a staff shortage on the roof terrace bar , Very nice location and staff really helpful and friendly Tower Hill tube a minutes walks 
236563,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff where not very helpfull We had booked things to do on the night and missed them because they couldn t get us checked in had to wait ages no apologies or nothing to help our wait , The room was nice comfy and tidy but overall didn t enjoy my stay 
236564,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was chaos at the reception desk at all times It was the worst check in and check out I have ever had at any hotel The staff was friendly and efficient but there was no clear guidance on who to help next so the guest were frustrated The gentleman waiting behind us during check in even got rather nasty about it We avoided the reception whenever possible because of it I suggest someone relook at the efficiency of the current process , Very clean and staff was very friendly 
236565,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing, Everything from checking in the receptionist was lovely obliging and we checked in early This was very helpful as we have travelled a long way Thankyou to all the reception staff Checking out was equally good Our stay was amazing thankyou to everyone at Double Tree Hilton Tower Bridge for all your help and support
236566,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The prices of the cocktails in the sky lounge 26 for two The queue at breakfast was ridiculous and food not very hot and price of a taxi from the station was 27 50 , The staff were very professional Hotel very nice 
236567,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, To be honest I would have preferred firmer pillows in some hotels Iv stayed there is usually one in the wardrobe I didn t ask though either as it was only 1 nights stay, The reception area was beautiful Lots of comfy sofas x also the staff waiting on at breakfast are the friendliest we have encountered in London and we ve stayed at quite a few places 
236568,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Location I thought I d booked Hyde park hotel through booking com as we wer going to winter wonderland and shopping I didn t realise until I checked booking confirmation on the day Bed was very hard and room was cold even with heating on Ordered food using room service and it was cold and not up to standard it was returned without eating , Lovely clean hotel and friendly staff 
236569,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The hotel wasn t very warm we got an upgrade to an executive room after a disagreement the only difference between the rooms really was a larger television Included with the upgrade was access to the executive lounge where we had breakfast which was not as good as the standard breakfast was nearly cold , The bed was really comfy so we had a really good nights sleep 
236570,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The view from the room and the sky lounge bar are brilliant rooms were very comfortable nice big tv and there was a train station 2 minutes walk away that will get you anywhere you need to go in the city
236571,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Although the room was non smoking it had obviously been smoked in as it stunk of stale cigarettes There was a service charge re the sky lounge which I missed when I checked out although only small it annoyed me , Excellent breakfast but pricey The sky lounge is a brilliant place to enjoy the extensive and impressive vista and is lively at the weekends 
236572,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Doubletree has to take a bit better care of the maintenance of the rooms In our room the cover cap of the shower valve fell off and the hook for the towels in the bathroom fell off as well And also the carpets are really not clean any longer , Staff is very friendly and flexible As our room was very smelly another visitor smoked in it some days ago they transferred us without any problems to another room Location is great for the Tower Tower Bridge area 
236573,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Was surprised to have to queue to get into breakfast The food was cold and not replenished quick enough for demand Such a shame , Lovely hotel great location Love the SKYLounge on 12th floor Staff very helpful attentative Rooms comfortable 
236574,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We arrived around 1pm I do realise the rooms are not ready until 3pm and that wasn t a problem but a member of staff who booked us in actuality said without my asking if we would like to wait in the lobby they would make us a priority I took that to mean the room would be a little early so we ordered some drinks and it got to 3pm and I went to the counter to ask if the room was ready and it wasn t I was told it wouldn t be long we waited until 20 minutes past 3 and still we weren t called it was my daughters 21st birthday and I had a meal booked on the other side of London so we had to leave and book our bags in as time was running late for our meal we also had to ring the restaurant to say we would be late as it took 45 minutes to get there I don t know what time the room was ready as I never got the said call I do feel it is unexceptable that a room is not ready at 3pm that I have paid for The room was very basic for the price breakfast was nice but expensive also , The beds are very comfortable the staff at breakfast time are very friendly and helpful 
236575,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was a big let down We were seated quite quickly which was good but the 1st day we arrived around 9am the coffee was cold that was put on the table and food was cold in the buffet also a lot of the food had run out and was not refilled On the 2nd day we arrived near the end of breakfast my thoughts would be that even arriving at that time there would still be food available this was not the case All the hot buffet was gone and luckily enough I had ordered eggs so my husband and I had to share my eggs and use the French stick as that was he only bread left It also took me three attempts to get tea and coffee Not what I would expect for the price we paid and the standard of the hotel Very disappointed, Loved the bed Pillows and duvet were fantastic We even when and bought our own when we got home 
236576,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, sky bar too expensive no draught beer in ground floor bar the hotel didnt really encourage you to stay and drink in the facility, breakfast hot cookies on arrival sky sports in rooms friendlieness of staff

236578,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Very small rooms Sky Bar had two parties booked both nights which meant we couldn t get a seat on either night Being charged 12 5 service charge when we had to stand at the bar was ridiculous It s your job to pay the staff not mine , Location was next door to the tube stop Sky bar had great views 
236579,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The bun fight to get breakfast The breakfast area was very poorly designed and laid out causing question to get food which had a knock on effect as people then had to cue for tables, The staff
236580,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, My parents called and asked for a tray of desserts saying we love you be brought up to me and my fianc s room and it was a beautiful tray with lovely desserts We really enjoyed the thought the staff put into it 
236581,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The information was very limited about the hotel what s available bars etc most places give you that information in the rooms The lifts were terrible we were given no information about them upon leaving we had to take the fire exit after waiting 20 minutes we d had enough queuing for breakfast was not very good but when we did get breakfast it was good value for money, The hotel was lovely in a great location very clean comfortable 
236582,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not your fault but it s a bit of a pain when the circle district line as often happens is not running , Despite the hotel being exceptionally busy we still experienced a high level of service from very pleasant staff 
236583,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room service was bad ordered a coffee that was lukewarm then ordered chilly and jacket potato worse my partner had ever eaten half of the music channel on the tv never worked and we paid for late check out and 3 different people knocked our door and 1 lady try to come in our room and the full English breakfast was poor and the toiletries was half full good job we had our own, The lady on reception on check out was very helpful and the waiter that brought the breakfast to our room was nice
236584,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Just at breakfast sauces etc to go with hot food were positioned at the beginning when collecting your hot plate , Position was ideal for us tube bus taxi river boat Loved it we were literally 2 minutes walk from the Tower of London nicely tucked away Pleasant staff clean and comfy rooms 
236585,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Check in time was 3 so we dropped off our bags as we were early had lunch next to the hotel and went back at 3 15 still not ready Staff apologised but didn t seem genuine Had to change rooms as we were given a double room and not a queen room , The breakfast was the best I ve had in a hotel Scrambled egg to die for Such a wide and good selection of foods to set you up for a day in London Room was clean with all the things you need for a weekend

236589,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The English of most members of staff is poor they didn t seem to understand a lot and were unable to answer the simplest of questions No information was given by check in staff no check out times we had to find out where breakfast was for ourselves DO NOT pay for the executive club lounge not worth an additional penny We ve stayed in various hotels worldwide with club access and this one doesn t offer any kind of service or comfort more like a cheap bar than a lounge it only offers a happy hour for two hours with excessively limited alcohol wine or beer tough if you drink neither and food which was rammed to the rafters probably because it s so tiny If you re looking for a luxurious relaxing break DO NOT stay here the revelling in the corridors at 2am and the stream of one night stands leaving the hotel at 7am is enough to put paid to that , Breakfast staff were helpful despite the vast queue to get in 
236590,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, That we didn t stay for longer , The bed was so comfy Lots of room in the actual bedroom good facilities too safe fridge iron kettle the check in was easy check out a little longer but only because computers down so we had to pay by cash

236592,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I felt the bedroom was a little plain and bland Just lacked character , The location and facilities of the hotel were great The views from the rooftop bar were amazing 
236593,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Paid a lot of money for an executive room and it was extremely small not at all what I expected for 289 My partner and I tried to use the executive lounge but again it was extremely busy and a very small room so we couldn t sit down anywhere My stay in the Liverpool at the Hilton there was by far better value for money and it provided more of a selection of canapes and drinks available in the lounge Overall a very expensive night for a disappointing stay ,No Positive
236594,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, See above, Great comfy bed the executive lounge wasn t executive On several occasions people were tailgating to gain access to the free food and drink The drink consisted of white wine and larger Unfortunately my wife went without as she doesn t drink either 
236595,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not enough choice of newspapers and other reading material, The cleanliness of the rooms and the efficiency they were ready every day As a lonely travelling woman felt very safe 
236596,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast at around 20 per head was very poor quality and had a value of no more than around 7, The room was excellent comfortable well equipped and clean
236597,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Poor service from the front desk things were not explained too well Was given a cookie upon check in which was half eaten , Bed was really comfy and room was kept to a high standard Enjoyed the sky lounge and the area of the hotel 
236598,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Leaving, The whole package really I always used Hilton hotels when I was working and they have not lost their edge I was at the Tower of London that evening so it was spot on for me This was my second stay at this hotel As Arnie says I will return 
236599,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Great hotel with a fantastic location minutes from the nearest tube station and a view that overlooks Tower Bridge The hotel reception area is nice and the staff were great 
236600,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Had a king room but felt it was not big enough to b a king room and felt itbwas aimed at the buisness sector more than the leisure sector, The view from the sky lounge was fantastic and the staff were very good
236601,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The executive breakfast area was poorly staffed and as a consequence was not a good experience, Great cookie on arrival clean and modern interior nice staff on check in

236603,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I m only splitting hairs here as loved our stay The towels weren t that fresh, Great location right next to Tube station Very helpful staff we paid a bit extra for bigger room which was well worth the money 2nd time we ve stayed in Double Tree both excellent Love cookies 
236604,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was dark and dingy we only had two lamps one of the others bulb had gone I could barely see whilst getting ready I had to do my hair and make up with the wardrobe open as there was a light inside of it which was brighter than anything else in the room We weren t very unhappy about this but when we tried to tell a member of staff we were hurried along due to there being a que the room was quite depressing and I was very disappointed The sound on the tv did not work We would have opened the curtains for more light but there were so many other rooms facing us that they would be able to see in to our room We usually stay at double tree hilton hotels and I booked the tower hill hotel due to the fact we had always had such good experiences with them I just felt like we were just another number at this hotel and wish we had of gone for somewhere else now , The cookies on arrival were good
236605,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 1 double queen bed is definitely not suitable for a family as advertised by booking com also the hotel wouldn t allow us all to stay in the room anyway Booking com did organise a complimentary pull up childrens bed for us as no family rooms were available Room service was delicious but language barriers meant we were over charged and had to negotiate 3 visits to our room by the waiter going back and for to his manager to agree that we didnt have to pay for their mistake That was frustrating after a long day with tired children , Very high standard hotel Free delicious cookies 
236606,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The staff were extra friendly the hotel itself was amazing and the breakfast was unreal Planning to go back at Christmas and cancelling our original hotel

236608,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The toaster in the morning was useless didn t toast the bread, The chocolate cookie at checkout was amazing The location is first rate Our room was large and well equipped The Sky Bar was fantastic if a tad overpriced In Scotland a glass of wine is never more expensive than a liqueur Lovely breakfast but a new toasting machine is required 8 people queuing for toast is not acceptable 
236609,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The pillows was to soft and the toilet kept running after being used Not much of a view for a special birthday , Got two free glass of bubbly while waiting for our room to be ready And two free drinks as it was my mums birthday

236611,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The hotel was busy but poorly organised and did not represent value for money We had arranged to park in the car park but the process was long winded and staff unhelpful such that we couldn t get in or out We had booked an extra bed for our daughter but this never arrived Staff were not forthcoming with either an apology or a solution , Staff were smiling and friendly
236612,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Over crowded at breakfast Waited too long to be seated Would have been nice if there was a swimming pool But overall it was a pleasant stay, Location was very good Breakfast was great Amazing views from the roof bar

236616,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The noise of the heating air con overriding the TV which seems to be very low volume difficult to hear even when the volume stated it was 100 , The bed was comfortable but the pillows were divine I suffer with neck problems but had such a wonderful nights sleep so much so I would like to know what make they are so I can get some for home 
236617,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The carpet on the 8th floor could do with a clean its abit scuffed however it was no bother , We checked in with Tania she was really welcoming and very bubbly considering it was quite late at night i don t know how she managed to be so cheerful We were given a quick talk through of the hotel the exec lounge skye lounge etc The free cookies and free complimentary mini bar in the room was a nice touch I have to say Overall we enjoyed our stay and we will be back again 
236618,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Slow check in with few staff working at the reception desk Some of the staff behind the desk were having a discussion with each other and were unable to help guests so we had to wait quite a while which was an annoying start to our visit , Very comfortable bed Enjoyed view from the Sky Lounge on top floor although did not stop for a drink in the bar area as it was very noisy 
236619,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room a bit cold even on heat setting We paid for executive upgrade to include Full English Breakfast c 21 each we felt this was misrepresented as in the executive lounge this was just toast bacon sausage and scrambled egg not worth it especially as some great eateries close by better and cheaper Sky lounge bar not really for guests unless you re 20 years old and like deafening music perhaps Friday night regulars , Just a one night stay and very clean and comfortable room service good ground floor bar a nice comfortable contemporary space
236620,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, It s in a business area so there wasn t much of a local neighborhood feel to the place , Modern professional feel adequate staff on duty multiple attractive gathering areas in the lobby assess to restaurants in and close to the hotel The room was small quiet and comfortable Convenient to public transportation business and tourist sites and shopping Deal pricing made this a good value for being in the Tower Hill area of London

236628,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was very simple we got the invalid room There were some scaling in some parts of the bathroom which did not give an impression of cleanliness The pictures suggest wooden floors the room had carpet which could be an issue for asthmatic people the overall state of the carpet was good my spouse is asthmatic and it was a surprise for us as we only had a couple of nights we were not too picky on this detail The guest service agent had booked us a taxi he suggested us a taxi but booked a private car with a driver to London Heathrow Airport with a fixed price of 75 but once at Heathrow we got charged 83 not a nice surprise , Location is great Breakfast is good The staff is polite and discreet WiFi works once you get proper instructions 
236629,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing excellent value for money , The hotel location was ideal for exploring the London Tower The Shard London Bridge and along the embankment and so close to the tube station Tower Hill The hotel room catered for our needs and much more the breakfast had so much choice also make a point of dining at the simply natural restaurant which is apart of the hotel and explore the sky lounge is was awesome Will book again

236631,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Unfortunately Tower Bridge was closed during our stay which caused a massive traffic jam en route to the hotel from Heathrow costing 110 Pounds by taxi, No complaints at all about the hotel Friendly staff great facilities and great breakfast
236632,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only Merlot on offer let s face it that is a woman s wine why no Shiraz , The happy hour was great the wine choice could have been better
236633,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, They didn t accept my request to decorate room for my boyfriends birthday I would have been willing to pay for decorations or brought them myself if I had known before hand, The rooftop bar was lovely and the rooms were very clean and tidy The location was perfect for visiting The Shard and the staff were very friendly
236634,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Rooms and bathrooms are very small according to American standards But clean and functional None of the rooms have a view All windows are covered with a business building right in front There isn t much around this particular neighborhood for tourists although the metro station right next door makes it easy to get around I had an issue and it was addressed and resolved quickly but there was some back and forth about how to satisfy make up for it I didn t like the back and forth But again staff hotel manager and guest services were very kind and friendly and took good care of us, Management staff and guest services are GREAT Probably one of the best I have ever seen and I ve stayed in many 4 star hotels Open buffet breakfast was satisfying with several good quality food choices Made to order omlets were also a big perk Hotel location is very conveniently next to a metro station Although many tourist sites are 20 30 min away the station being right next door is such a big perk 
236635,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, This must as well be a student room or dorm Clean as it is a new building But bare poorly serviced and uninspiring And giving guests chocolate chip cookies at the reception and then asking about it on the feedback form That has to be the biggest hotel joke of the year , Clean
236636,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Air con was loud we had to report it The cost of cocktails in the sky bar was high , The bed was so comfy we loved the Mac and the sky bar was fab Breakfast was great too

236642,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was no access to any stairs and we found ourselves waiting around for lifts and even when they arrived we still sometimes got stuck going up and down as opposed to the desired floor we wanted , The location of the hotel and the friendly staff Also the cookie upon arrival 
236643,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast was expensive we choose to go to Weatherspoons around the corner that was much more reasonably priced , The fresh cookies given when you check is a nice touch 
236644,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The hotel from the outside and the inside lobby was impressive however don t be fooled as the rooms themselves do not fit with the 4star rating and are clean but average which should be reflected in the price We have stayed in other 4star hotels in central London which are much nicer Marketed as a deluxe queen the room and bathroom were bland with bare white walls and beech coloured furniture and there was no ceiling or wall lighting just table lamps Bed was a normal double with cheap duvet and pillows so don t expect a deluxe queen size The Sky Lounge bar has great views over London but is pricey and when settling your bill the staff assume that you are automatically going to pay the 12 5 service charge even though you haven t been waited on at all Cocktails with service charge are around 13 , The location was great with several bars and restaurants in the vicinity Situated within a few minutes walk of both Tower Hill underground station and Fenchurch Street rail station Staff were really helpful and friendly

236655,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room had everything we needed but there were no luxurious touches to make it stand out in comparison to cheaper hotels and the d cor in the room was like a budget hotel Cocktails in the Skylounge were 12 15 There was no one serving in the cafe when we wanted a coffee , Our room was clean and comfortable The location was great right by the Tower London Bridge and Brasserie Blanc where we d booked a meal Breakfast was really great loads of choice and very tasty The Skylounge was relaxing and classy The heating in our room wasn t working but when we told reception they got it fixed quickly

236659,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Upon arrival to the rooftop bar with my girlfriend we were standing waiting for a drink for roughly 25 minutes To add to the sting somebody entered the bar and the staff attempted to serve them immediately after they finished the coctails that took them 25 minues to make I had to actually stop them request to be served myself I will add that the bar was more or less empty whilst this happened Staff non apologetic and rude upon me confronting them The money you pay as well is very steep when you consider the rooms are barely scraping average I assume the pricing is based on their location facilities like the rooftop bar , Fantastic location a beautiful rooftop bar 
236660,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff were very rude and unhelpful The booking was in my partners name however I had the booking confirmation and also had pre paid on my own card which I also had with me yet I was not allowed to check in Then the reception staff undercharged me and were very rude about this to my partner even though it was their fault not impressed and wouldn t go back ,No Positive
236661,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Sky bar great, Breakfast menu amazing but dining room too small for size of hotel Disappointed waitress blamed customers attending at same time crammed into dining room like a school dinner expected more comfort considering top price paid
236662,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bigger more luxurious room, Considering we spent nearly 200 for one night the room was very basic The room was small with a small double bed which wasn t comfortable and the duvet was very thin and not cosy at all 
236663,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, On arrival we paid out bill in cash or tried to We found it difficult to pay with SCOTTISH STERLING This had to be verified by three people before finally being accepted If that wasn t bad enough we then ate in the restaurant on a different day and again had difficulties paying with SCOTTISH STERLING I would expect this from s two star hotel in the 1970 s not in a Hilton Hotel in 2016 , The hotel was ok close to underground and plenty taxis available outside hotel

236667,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The price of the Sky Lounge bar I understand the standard of the hotel but for a Malibu flavoured liqueur with coke and a corona it s understandable as to why my jaw dropped when I got told it would be 18 00 for the 2 drinks , FANTASTIC HOTEL Absolutely beautiful amazing breakfast and the staff couldn t have been nicer To top it off getting an I Mac in our room was a definite highlight 
236668,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was nothing to fault The only problem we had was the Central and District tube line was closed all weekend so transport needed rethinking , Our stay was excellent from the reception to checkout made all the better by very friendly staff Our room was much more spacious than we expected a walk in wet room type bathroom with fold down shower seat and grab rails most welcome as my husband is disabled The TV Mac was very useful for planning our excursions and finding out local landmarks The in room kettle and tea and coffee was really welcome as was the inclusion of a fridge to keep items cool a nice touch and most appreciated The check in warm chocolate cookie was a surprise and very tasty although I must confess that as it was warm the melted chocolate on my fingers found its way onto the bedspread I m sorry about that Breakfast was busy but seated very quickly by smiling helpful staff There was a wide section of fruit and cereal along with full English and toast croissants and rolls This full selection of tea coffee and juice was also available The complimentary magazines and newspapers was an added benefit I don t think I can write anything detrimental about our stay we have weekends away at least once a month a and staying here was one of the nicest and most memorable of the last five years We both had a wonderful relaxing time and I wish to thank all the staff we had contact with for that 
236669,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The tube was not working over the weekend so it caused us a lot of nuuscence and money using alternative modes of transport , Vacuity to tube station and attractions

236697,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, One of the bar staff was a little rude We came back from breakfast to find that the cleaner was already in our room We hadn t even checked out , The roof top bar had the most amazing views

236705,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was worst we have had in such a long time only option of eggs was scrambled which were sloppy and under cooked bacon sausages swimming in grease and beans were stone cold on both days we stayed we had a woman sitting next to us on her own in an overcoat shoving lots of food in her pockets on both days We wondered if she had walked in off the street We were meant to have an upgrafe but this didnt happen we were very dissapointed and wont go back to Hilton Sorry to say , Bed was comfy but room was exceptionally small
236706,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not too keen on the door card having to be used to access lift but I assume it is an added security measure, The hotel was clean and well cared for Rooms were very comfortable with everything needed for a pleasant stay Choice at breakfast was fantastic
236707,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Looks like the hotel is being renovated the room was great but the corridors definately need updating , The location is fantastic so close to the Tower of London the Tube the Thames and the hop on hop off bus tours Even walking distance to St Paul s Cathedral
236708,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I paid for bed and breakfast Although my room was very nice breakfast was a disaster We queued for ages which I can understand but the food was vile and inedible The melon I had was past its best and the scrambled eggs were cold and not cooked I will not pay for breakfast again at a Hilton after this wxperience,No Positive
236709,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Was like gastapo trying to check in and out with the straight faced staff not people friendly atall Overrated prices on drinks at rooftop bar The fact I made a complaint to manager Pino Dispinseri about the towel I used and didn t realise it had blood stains and dirty brown stains on it until I dried myself YUK and nobody had the decency to get back to me about it speaks volumes of the way they care about their guests Our room card stopped working and my husband had to go through a security check to have it re swiped , Location Rooftop bar 
236710,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, too few staff in the breakfast room meant that were not able to keep up with clearing tables which left guests waiting to be seated, The breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful
236711,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The view from our room was of a railway bridge which is disappointing for a hotel of this star rating However whilst there was a queue for breakfast the actual food was of a good standard with an acceptable choice of food We visit London quite regularly and we have had better deals at other five star hotels Our experience is that we can get better accommodation for this money , The location near tower bridge was great However when we got to the room we were cold and could not get any heat out of the system In addition we were unable to increase the volume on the tv to a level when we did not have to sit right next to it to hear it However when we raised these issues with the staff they quickly came and adjusted the tv and brought us a heater and that was fine 
236712,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The wait to get in for breakfast but fair play the staff came round with fruit juice while you were waiting , Lovely breakfast order the poached egg s soft yum yum

236714,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast room is far too small the lifts are very slow better options for dining would have been good , The checking supervisor helping checkin at 2pm on the Friday 9th Sept was fantastic sorry didn t get his name the other staff were always polite the diamond status benefits in the exec lounge were very good thanks 
236715,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I would of thought that a Queens suite would off been a bit larger it felt like a standard room, Fantastic breakfast selection and the Sky bar was great although they closed off the veranda at 10 30 why 
236716,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Sky lounge thought it would be a quiet place to have a drink snack Unfortunately it was extremely noisy we could hear the noise from leaving lift full of hen parties So left and used lobby cafe Food not great in Natural restaurant attached to hotel should have used room service , Bed very comfortable

236721,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Seemed unorganised at all times Had to join HH members for the 3rd time as unable to find previous registrations Asked for ID again after already checking in and having taken credit card details and storing our luggage Due to having to go back as room not ready when initially arriving , Comfortable bed Clean room Nice bathroom Good facilities
236722,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Need a bed sheet as well as duvet for comfort and cleanliness Most hotels don t provide one I ve never understood this Breakfast the scrambled egg was too moist it would have been easier to eat it with a spoon Overall breakfast was great , so convenient to all parts of London a stylish entrance and good size breakfast room polite staff on check in Loved the complimentary water in room

236728,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Quality of English breakfast was not up to scratch for this standard of hotel some items undercooked and restaurant too small for the numbers appreciate busy time but better to wait than get poorly cooked food, Location staff very attentive and clean
236729,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, A couple of staff members walked into our room without knocking when we first arrived The rooms were very nice but basic , Great location Comfortable beds Lovely breakfast The sky bar and the food there was fantastic Stunning view 
236730,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing, Great location for all popular sightseeing places comfy bed great shower super roof bar terrace great views Tower of London tower bridge the shard and gherkin breakfast plentiful and fantastic choice to set you up for the day had a superb weekend 
236731,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The only comment I would make was the breakfast area was far too busy in comparison to the other parts of the facility , Loved the spaciousness of the hotel Nothing was too much a very relaxing weekend The restaurant was truly amazing 
236732,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I was continually disturbed by the cleaners who didn t seem to understand that I was working away in my room and didn t need any house cleaning Some guests may appreciate having the beds made by someone else but it s not something I needed and after saying once that I didn t want it I would think they would have got the message and left me in peace This was the only downside to an excellent stay , The room was well kept nice bathroom and excellent shower The bed was particularly comfortable and having an iron in the room was of use 
236733,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Earth shattering bar prices Couldn t afford more than one drink which was a shame guess you are paying for the view, Great location immaculate rooms great breakfast friendly staff Great roof bar
236734,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Some of the pictures were misleading and gave the impression that you can see the Thames River from the hotel s rooms This was not really so The back entrance access is not very inviting To be fair there isn t anything extra special about the hotel for the price paid , The view from the 12th floor 
236735,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room and bathroom are quite small but comfortable Watch your credit card for extra charge at their bar that you didn t make , Excellent location Make sure to check out the lounge on the last floor awesome views 
236736,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The only criticism I could make is that there were no tea coffee available in the room either for that late night after drinks or that early morning rush all though it s available in room service it s nice just to make your own , All of the hotel staff were so nice and a pleasure to talk to all with excellent knowledge and all to egar to please which made our stay even better than expected excellent location and would definitely stay again and would recommend to all my friends 
236737,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room we were staying in was a little disappointing as when we looked out of the window we could just see other peoples rooms I understand this is the lay out of the hotel , Very clean and tidy staff were welcoming and helpful Also LOVED the sky lounge bar Amazing view and all over a lovely bar 
236738,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, That breakfast isn t included in the rate of the room considering its 115 for a one night stay , Sky Lounge Bar was amazing Beautiful views of London on the sunny day we stayed 
236739,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I was there for conference and the air conditioning wasn t really working in the meeting rooms , The bedroom was perfect The staff nice Voucher if I decide not to have housekeeping was thoughtful extra incentive 
236740,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We actually found it rather difficult to find the hotel when we first arrived by tube Once we found it it was easy to go to the tube each day for our sightseeing , We found the staff very helpful especially when I needed help with connecting to the internet with our cell phone The hotel was very clean and restful and the room was kept very nice each day There were also some restaurants nearby and it was close to the tube 
236741,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The only issue we had while staying was the TV was very quite you couldnt have the air con on and hear the TV comfortabley the Roof top bar looked lovely from the pictures however we didnt get to see it was we went to have a drink but waited 15 minuets to be served and when your about to spend thirty pounds on two drinks we didnt really expect to wait so long so we left , The hotel was in a brillant location and was extreamly easy to check in and park in the hotels car park 
236742,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Rooftop bars southside one is taken over by non residents and drunks North side bar doesn t seem accessible this should be made residents only , Good front desk service 
236743,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The sky lounge roof top bar was really good although it had a disgusting smell when you first walk in very sicky , The rooms were very spacious and the bed was extremely large and comfy Breakfast was yummy Location was spot on right near tower hill underground station 
236744,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, More tea bags and milk would be good for the tea making facilities, Everything staff lovely Helpful Clean really good facilities breakfast excellent and of course the sky lounge leaving our luggage after checking out excellent will definitely be back 
236745,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room preparation subpar Had to switch rooms three times One hadn t been thoroughly cleaned and checked another had a leaking fridge another had a leaking conditioner , Good location near Tower of London London Bridge historical sites 
236746,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We had to queue for 20 minutes for breakfast They brought us all juices whilst we wait However I have never had to wait for breakfast in a hotel before so they struggled to accommodate for all of their guests at popular times We booked this hotel knowing that the Sky Lounge was part of it It was packed and we could not reserve a hotel beforehand either so we ended up standing , The rooms were very comfortable and spacious Modern en suite was nice Breakfast had a good selection of choice The Sky Lounge had beautiful views of London 
236747,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only one minor point The breakfast pots could have been cleared quicker When returning to our table after eating fresh fruit the dirty pots were still on the table when we bought out cooked breakfast back to the table the same happened again when we returned with out toast , Great prompt service at the reception on arrival and departure Knowledgeable staff member who recommended a restaurant close to the theatre which we were booked to see that day Good size clean and comfortable modern room Great roof top bar with fantastic views Excellent stay will definitely stay again 
236748,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was a mix up with room service breakfast on our last day but I found the hotel staff very quick to offer apologies and do their best to make up for the error , Service was excellent We discovered shortly after we arrived that my son was allergic to the down in the bedding A call to the front desk resulted in a quick resolution with housekeeping immediately replacing all the bedding The location is excellent as well So close to wonderful sites tourist activities and train and Tube stations that made navigating London a fun part of our stay I would stay at this property again with no hesitation 
236749,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The sky lounge was smelling like vomit for all night we couldn t even have a drink for more than 2 minutes The check out was 30 minutes excessive time And we ordered the queen room in the top of the hotel and they gave us the second floor , I loved the bed and the commodities
236750,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 1 I was given incorrect information about opening times for the sky Lounge was told 2am so when me and my partner turned up they closed the terrace within 5 mins of us being there This was a special treat for his 30th birthday and that was the reason I chose this location because the views were phenomenal absolutely pointless as we couldn t even take one picture 2 When I was given the wrong times I was also told that all restaurant were closed but we had access to room service great idea until the bill came up to 76 and the food was microwaved and cold on top of it I wasn t expecting a Michelin star dinner but something half decent I didn t even finish my streak as I got tired of chewing it and it turned so hard it s like I had a ball of plastic in my mouth My chips and steak were cold which is disgusting Finally I asked for the steaks to be medium rare and it couldn t have been further from what I asked for for that anount of money I would expect it to be fresh at least I mentioned this to the person I checked out with and he said thanks I ll pass it on to the kitchen What kind of service is that He couldn t even looked or sounded bothered by it at all It s very upsetting as we didn t feel valued at all 3 I called reception and asked a simple question but the operator ended up laughing at me as if I was asking him something pathetic There was so much sarcasm in his voice and it was simply rude I asked if the sky lounge would be playing any football on the morning we checked out he laughed and said no no no it s not that kind of a bar we most definitely won t be playing the football and he carried on laughing at me I was so shocked from his response and so disapointed that all I could say is ok thank you , 1 Mickala at reception when we checked in was very friendly and helpful great customer service probably spelt her name wrong so my apologies but I hope you can recognise for a really warm welcome and friendly service she provided us 2 The bed was super comfortable
236751,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Cocktails were quite expensive there wasn t a lot of option on the late night menu the scrambled egg at breakfast was awful, The pillows were amazing the room was very clean cosy view from the rooftop bar was amazing
236752,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, not really a gripe but tried to go up to the sky lounge on the evening of our stay but could not find a seat or table as full of people from outside the hotel would be good if they reserved an area for hotel guests, everything from check in staff to breakfast servers
236753,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing , I liked the warm cookies on check in the beds were really comfy room climate control was great especially in the heatwave The hotel was in a great location very central to everything Room was really clean facilities were excellent Staff were really helpful and friendly thank you very much we had a great stay 
236754,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, For the money compared to the website photos the room was pretty basic, Location the fitness room were great Very clean room friendly staff 
236755,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I wish the gym had been bigger and a sauna and a swimming pool would have been a big plus, The location the hotel is only 2min walk from the underground station you ve got plenty of bus routes in the area and you are minutes away from Tower Bridge and the River Thames
236756,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Very strange unpleasant smell at the sky bar We did feed this back at check out so hopefully no longer an issue, Good location happy with rooms and facilities would stay here again
236757,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Need more staff at breakfast to clear away tables so that the queues to eat could be smaller, The whole experience we have stopped here before and that is why we came back Comfort of room Bed etc and especially the sky lounge with them views at night

236759,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The beds were a little too hard and bathroom a teeny bit too small No vent for hot showers and mirrors steamed up quickly, The fold out mirror above the desk Perfect for make up and hair straightners The Mac computer tv was very useful and easy to use 
236760,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The Apple computer for a TV was trendy Worked fine once you figured how to control the volume from the keyboard , Breakfast was phenomenal Fresh fruit hot selections fresh and delicious Excellent for fueling up before going sight seeing 
236761,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Be good to have a proper handle on the executive lounge door as guests kept leaving it open Breakfast was extremely disappointing My tea was lukewarm and undrinkable and all the hot food was also barely warm Strange that the toaster which appeared to be on a go slow was at the opposite end of the room to the hot buffet which added to the problem The juices could benefit from having ice in them The cereal and fruit area was nice though with a good selection to choose from , The hotel was extremely quiet and the bed was comfortable
236762,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Didnt ask if we had a good stay Couldnt get wifi and tried to call careline but no answer came down at 6 30 for breakfast as the sign said 6 30 till 9 was the best time but didnt open until 7 , Breakfast was really good The breakfast staff were fabulous
236763,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The glasses in the room were dirty The rooftop bar had a very unpleasant smell constantly and staff were extremely rude and not helpful or accommodating , Cookie on arrival
236764,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Hard to fault but being picky could have had more than 2 sugars left everyday so we could have 2 cups of tea , Lovely location 2 mins walk to Tower Hill underground station Warm cookie on arrival Comfortable clean rooms 
236765,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No effort even though it was my birthday and was specified on booking Breakfast in room cancelled as was 40 mins late Poor selection of cooked food in exec lounge , Great bar Good breakfast selction in main restaurant great location 
236766,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The carpet in the room could of done with a clean and there was a burn mark on the desk , The rooftop bar was amazing little overpriced but views are fantastic very close to tube station
236767,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, On arrival queued 20 minutes to be told that check in wasn t done at that desk Debit card swiped as cover for any extras Paid for drinks on room Friday night Saturday afternoon refused to charge to room as no credit very embarrassing Waited 30 minutes for drinks Later Saturday night accepted payment to room Letter then received to say we hadn t paid for drinks settled the bill Dirty pots left in room all weekend , Location was ideal 
236768,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lift was a bit hard to fathom out But it was a very minor thing , The location was excellent near a tube and around the corner from the DLR It only took 30 mins from the airport The room was so comfortable and the staff were very helpful Highly recommended
236769,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Long queues for the breakfasts in the morning but on a note we came down around the most popular time as well , We celebrated our 5th Anniversary and the Reservations and Guest Service made a brilliant job in getting the little extra for us Even helped out to get a hand written card in the room as a surprise Nice job by the kitchen staff with presentation of a selection of fruit and pastries Over all great hotel great location and great staff 
236770,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Operating the lift was not straight forward Dinner was good but the salad was wilted and discoloured chips not very good , The hotel was clean and comfortable Location was great for places we wanted to visit 
236771,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The breakfast was overpriced We decided not to include it to our booking and was glad as the queue seemed long for most of the morning , The sky bar was lovely and a great way to end our evening We were offered an upgrade on arrival along with complimentary warm cookies and the parking was simple 
236772,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Difficult to get to 1st nite of stay air conditioning unit wasn t working so made the nite a very difficult sleep Second nite after requesting engineer to fix the air conditioning My room had a water leak and had to move rooms midnight of our last night No concerns from the staff no help for bags to be assisted in moving rooms No complimentary offers Had to complain to stand in supervisor who seemed unhelpful till I said I know the CEO of Hilton hotels Overall hotel stay was not the best The hotel itself was pleasant but the service given was not good at all and left a bad taste in our mouths , Pleasant at start and location was fine 
236773,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Obviously the location means prices are sky high because they can be 14 for a glass of wine for example Also we left our bags while we went out In return 6 20 Friday 19th August 2916 the man on Guest Services was on the phone Fair enough but he didn t acknowledge us or indeed the large queue that was forming behind He totally ignored us all not even getting a passing colleague over to take care of the now huffing and puffing queue As a result the last part of our holiday was incredibly stressful as we had to rush for a train we d budgeted an hours time to catch and were left with 30 Thanks Hilton and thankyou whoever you are useless guest services man , Great location and very attractive hotel and facilities Be sure to visit the 12th floor bar with great views over the Thames Another nice touch is they give you 5 for the bar if you don t use room service they claim this is for the environment but as we all know it actually saves them a fortune on staff and cleaning PLUS it helps the world as collateral Also if they can t sort out a problem you ll get further vouchers for the bars etc My good side says this is a nice way to keep customers happy my cynical side have you spotted I have one It s tragic says it keeps punters on site where they can keep spending lovely money 
236774,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Wish it had a bath instead of a shower as after 4 days working and being on your feet all the time it would have been a bonus , Bed was comfy Rooms were cleaned to perfection Everything you needed in the room for a business trip Tea and coffee and an iron if needed 
236775,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was so basic and and very disappointing the view was aesthetically horrendous It was for a birthday surprise and I requested a nice spacious room with a good view nope needless to say we got a box room with a view of brick walls and vent ducts , Location breakfast in house bar 
236776,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was a BBQ outside the back and only had 6 customers all day because no signs was put out and as my boyfriend had one he couldn t rate the quality high enough Advertise events more , Bed is so comfy
236777,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Sofa bed wasn t made up no bedding in the room Sofa bed had crumbs and TV remote in terrible experience at roof top bar service was shocking I never got my meal and my husbands bread was mouldy as we were only in London 1day this was were we chose to eat so I had nothing to eat as we didn t have time to then go anywhere else A couple next to us left and never got their drinks We were not charged and received a few free drink and teddies for the kids They re nearly 7 and 8 so weren t impressed with them There wasn t enough toilet roll in the room when I asked a lady who worked there in the hallway she couldn t understand English It s a lovely hotel and was really happy when we first arrived but wouldn t stay at a hilton again We had a bad experience in Manchester a few yrs ago and said never again but as this was a Doubletree thought it would be better , Cookies on arrival lovely family room 
236778,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We had to move rooms because the air vent was really loud and couldn t be turned off TV didn t work on all channels , Location Handy for the tube Nice and central

236781,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, For me and my partner the bed was very firm and made our night sleep quite uncomfortable and sleepless However everybody has their own level of comfort , Staff were very welcoming Location is excellent Positioned almost instantly in front of the tower Bridge making the sky lounge roof terrace bar even better with such amazing views across London

236783,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, position of the bed too close to the wall would prefer king size bed attitude of receptionist when we queried our bill, the reception area is pleasant and a nice place to sit Loved the Skylounge being able to park the car
236784,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The queues for breakfast I booked through booking com and did not receive my Hilton Honours points very disappointed I also had a hassle when checking in as they tried to charge me 50 more than booking com had quoted me thankfully I had my email confirmation and the receptionist requested I forwarded my booking com email on to her as proof Not impressed made me look foolish when checking in as there was a long queue behind me , The staff were so efficient and welcoming and helpful
236785,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Very loud music from bar made enjoyment slightly more difficult could not hear yourself seal Music did not complimenting the view etc, Liked the view from top bar

236792,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only downside were drinks extremely expensive in the bar bit as we come from the west Country are wages are a quarter of what the locals earn , Lovely clean room well catered for lovely rooftop bar
236793,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lifts were poor Often waiting long times due to people not realising you need to use your key cards every time to operate Also the prices in the bar was extortionate On top of this staff automatically took 12 5 service charge This can lead to poor service as there is no incentive to offer good service , Cookie on arrival complimentary water in the room ice machine available and air conditioning Location was excellent Wonderful views from rooftop bar

236799,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, What spoiled our experience slight y was when are room key did not work and we were met with demands for identification and were then marched to a room where a very polite but slightly embarrassed young man had to show us in and obtain I d before we could access are room paid for in advance with are poccessions belongings and money We did complain it was more to do with who was managing the reception rather than the staff who were all very courteous overall We were given tickets for drinks as an apology I understand security is needed however it was quite embarrassing at the time As we considered the key not working was not our fault however was instructed we had left the key to close to our mobile devices But don t want this to turn in to a complaint as we enjoyed are stay great location and very clean rooms Overall the staff were very kind , On arrival we were checked in by two very polite and friendly ladies We were given the option of a upgrade which was for a reasonable price We were given cookies and free drinks for the sky line bar The hotel is beautiful and the sky line bar fantastic with fabulous views

236802,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Tea at breakfast Water in Thermos just not hot enough to infuse tea , The manner in which the sfaff took a genuine interest in what you were doing Eva reception asked How did you enjoy Service in St Pauls 
236803,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Air conditioning in the room had to be requested on a couple of occasions the rooftop bar prices were extortionate even by London prices 17 00 for a glass of wine is OTT as far as I m concerned , Excellent hotel with nice rooms and great breakfast buffet very handy for underground station less than a couple of minutes walk 
236804,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room stank of cigarette smoke Money was taken out of my account without my permission after I had paid full bill This left me with no money to take my disabled daughter anywhere This ruined our first Hilton experience I still have not received my money back Am furious and disgusted , Good shower
236805,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was overpriced at 21 50 fortunately it was a short walk to Wetherspoons where it cost only 5 Staff were polite but not overly friendly , Short walk to Tower and about 5 minutes walk to restaurants

236809,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Good value for money given location Helpful staff Nice breakfasts Helpfully allowed us to leave our luggage until the evening after we had booked out 
236810,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Check in seemed unnecessarily time consuming leading to queues Took 25 mins between arriving at hotel and getting to room , The views from the Sky Lounge were amazing

236821,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We booked a room to include breakfast having been upgraded room on check in our new room information had not been passed to the restaurant and as such there was an embarrassing wait and conversation with staff when we were told that we weren t entitled to a breakfast This was eventually sorted out but could have been handled better , We were given an upgrade on the room on check in the roof bar had a good atmosphere and great views

236921,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, A complimentary warm chocolate cookie on arrival was just the first part of such a wonderful and thoughtful weekend With gorgeous rooms excellent facilities and an army of staff that were smiley full of care and very attentive we will definitely be staying at Double Tree again No doubt about it 
236922,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Brilliant service from housekeeping I left a toilet bag with expensive skincare products which they very kindly posted back to me received 36 hours after notifying them on Sunday night 
236923,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Wish it was cheaper so we could afford to stay there more often , Staff were friendly Lots of places to sit in the lobby where there s also a cafe Sky lounge was beautiful Location is a minutes walk from Tower Hill tube 
236924,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Unfortunately your picture of the queen room and the size of the actually room are very different It s very Much smaller and in turn we had to pay an extra 50 to get a decent room, The staff were very helpful and attentive

236926,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I cannot think of anything that disappointed me , It can be quite daunting being on your own but the staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel has a really nice atmosphere unlike some I have stayed at in London My room was very comfortable and clean Check in was very quick and you are presented with a cookie on arrival which is a nice touch The hotel is ideally located for tourist attractions and the main line station and underground is a few moments away Next time I have to go up to London I will definitely stay in this hotel again and I have recommended it to my son when he visits London 
236927,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, we paid 199 for a tiny room when we double checked prices night before it had gone down to 139 and hotel wouldn t change price of the room or even upgrade us even though we knew hotel wasn t full some of the staff were quite rude I am on crutches and one bar staff member pushed past me Stayed at Doubletrees before and had much better rooms for far less price than this was and that was at Xmas time bit of a rip off really , the rooftop bar was very good good selection of drinks and good atmosphere
236928,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, They have a very silly and very annoying thing that you have to carry the paper wallet as well as key to charge to your room even though this is less secure for the customer as it makes it easier for crooks to pick up your details and get to your room This is because the restaurant is NOT Hilton s and they don t understand they could do a better deal so as not to upset customers , Breakfast great room great staff great overall very nice but very pricey hotel 
236929,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I thought that the price of breakfast was quite extortionate just as a heads up Natural Kitchen do a beautiful breakfast for quite a bit less money A member of house keeping entered our room at one point with very little warning however she was polite and apologised for the intrusion , The public areas of the hotel were beautifully kept really quite breathtaking Absolutely loved the fresh cookie on arrival I d had a long journey and that made me smile I was disappointed that I didn t get chance to see The Rooftop bar but I m sure it was super special Our room was comfortable and clean The fact that the tube station was minutes if not seconds away was wonderful Really handy and after a late night at the theatre it was very convenient 
236930,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Second key never worked even after being reloaded, Location excellent within walking distance of two stations and one of London top attractions Staff were helpful
236931,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I was not impressed by the room size very small Or the size of the Shampoo and conditioner , Location Sky lounge was stunning a great place to visit at night Cookies a nice welcome treat 
236932,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, A couple of poor issues first having been out all day seeing the sights to get back to the room for a freshen up and rest found the room hadn t been serviced Chased housekeeping who seemed surprised we wanted it done Skylounge terrace is open til midnight yet you couldn t but a drink at the outside bar which closed at 11 30 meaning the bar inside was 4 deep Finally paying for a supposed upgrade an extra 50 on checking what I had booked it wasn t an upgrade may officially complain about the last point Overall good location but many small things need sorting out for the money you pay , Staff were helpful although clearly not enough of them to cope with the volumes of guests
236933,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff rude stole money out my account No tourist spots help Dismissed even when asked for bars open in and around london in am , Room small but comfortable 
236934,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Very noisy air conditioner did ask for a view so was abit disappointed we were on the 5 floor would have like a higher floor, Very good selection in the breakfast Room clean very good shower great location
236935,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, In the reception work many people but there is a mess whom to turn to They booked money when check in on credit card and when we decided we better pay immediately there was still double reservation on the card even when we already returned from the trip They did not release it When we arrived the room was not ready and they did not notice when it was ready even we agreed so in the reception They do not let to enter the Sky bar even with older children from 18 00 in the evening what is that There are very modern Mac screens in the rooms as TV as well but no manual how to use the remote , We liked its modern and new The breakfast was superb 
236936,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The attitude of staff in lounge bar Was told we would have to vacate our table at 7pm this was at 6 55pm as it was reserved There were no notices to advice us of this I think we were picked out to move as there were only 2 of us , Great location very clean comfortable 
236937,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The hotel does NOT have the views specified within the description The rooms are small and bed was not comfy The hotel is not worth the money paid at all and there are several other hotels in the area that are cheaper Not impressed especially as this is a Hilton chain , The location was the only positive
236938,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Another great stay at a Hilton hotel staff extremely friendly and attentive very comfortable bed in a lovely clean room Would definitely recommend the Double Trees by Hilton and we will definitely be back 
236939,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Window would not latch properly poor first nights sleep due to outside noise FIxed with a paper wedge after no joy at reception great second night, Excellent modern hotel with a fantastic breakfast spotless room and a great atmosphere in the sky bar
236940,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Was a surprise birthday present for my hubby Room not ready for 45 mins When had access to room stunk of smoke so had to get moved then caused a rush to get ready for his party , Bed was very comfortable had everything in the room we needed
236941,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Had to wait a full hour for room to be ready Already a late check in of 3pm no room until 4pm Extremely disappointing Customer service gave the excuse of it s a Saturday we are busy not what I expect from the Hilton chain , Lovely hotel easy access to the theatre district

236943,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, More cookies D, The hotel the cookies the breakfasts the room the rooftop bar the friendly staff the location the marathon extras the post checkout bag storage 
236944,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The way breakfast was handled was awful huge queues staff kept removing half filled dishes to replenish making it worse instead of bringing food out to top it up Clearly peak times need more staff for the money we spend surely a few more hours could be spent as the ones in were working SO hard or have an extra room to deal with an overspill This is not rocket science , Location and overall hotel experience
236945,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, 12 12 service charge for a cocktail seemed a bit steep Building works going on next door caused a bit of noise, Early check in warm cookies on arrival bed was very comfortable views from Sky bar were immense secure car park friendly staff location was perfect for my trip Would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again 
236946,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, lifts didn t work mac in the room didn t work staff weren t overly polite not worth the money paid, breakfast being included in the price good choice

236949,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, More information could have been given about how the lifts operate when checking in , Had a king room and although the room was quite basic the bed was very comfortable All the staff were very nice and helpful
236950,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, My room was a little smaller than expected for a queen room the pillows were a little to soft for my liking But not a massive issue , Ideal location as it just a 5 minute walk from Tower Hill tube station The hotel was clean fresh on entering The staff were friendly very accommodating I throughly enjoyed my stay would use again 
236951,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, didn t have much time to use everything , all worked as advertised I have been there ten times or so 200yds from tower hill tube great location
236952,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Although the hotel is in close proximity to the river Thames the Tower of London the London Bridge the more London riverside development and the Tower Hill underground station the view of these London landmarks are obscured by the adjacent buildings The card access system to the lifts and the rooms rarely worked and had to be replaced quite often The latter was time consuming and ate into our holiday time The breakfast was very ordinary , The staff were responsive to the difficulties experienced by us during our stay there 
236953,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I would have liked to have been offered a glass of sparkly at arrival , Loved the double tree Would definitely stay again I loved the complimentary cookie at check in
236954,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, To be honest it is pretending to be posh when its just a glorified premier inn Very expensive in the bar Go to Wetherspoons for a drink and save , Location is good 
236955,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Smoking area outside front entrance Not great walking through on way out , The executive lounge was a plus relaxed atmosphere not stuffy Views were great from our floor 10 and from sky lounge Our hotel of choice for when we are staying in London
236956,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Slow check in check out You don t get Hilton points if you book via Booking com, Great hotel in an excellent location Sky Bar worth a visit as is the ground floor bars
236957,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Took ages to get checked in TV in room had no sound and despite a call to the care line in the 15 hrs I was there no one came to sort it Light bulbs but working in the standard lamp For 169 a night I d expect these basics to be checked and if not at least followed up quickly , Very quiet despite being a busy hotel and central location 
236958,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Tv was on mute and as it was an Apple could not find out how to turn sound back on , Bed great as were the pillows Great to be able to turn air con off and open a window at night for fresh air 
236959,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing really , It was great staying Staff room condition everything was good Hotel was located just 3 min away from subway station and also close to tower bridge 
236960,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The TV in the room is terrible nothing to watch and app does not work on Mac Also Room Service got every order wrong and had to return up to 3 times sometimes to get it right Due to construction all over the area we could not find the hotel as all the roads leading to it were closed And scrambled eggs at breakfast are horrible , Free Executive Lounge with certain room types with free tapas wine coffee and drinks 
236961,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Every staff member from check into check out was excellent except one miserable and rude waitress in the sky bar , Brilliant location we turned up early and staff were very accomodating and helpful The sky bar is incredible for views but a little pricey even for london 
236962,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The a c would not shut down in our room it was complicated and time consuming to get moved The hotel I think would have already known about the problem but I suspect hope that many people just put up with it Breakfast was only OK not the usual standard from Hilton I would say ,No Positive
236963,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Would have preferred a bath but shower was great , Incredibly helpful staff at all levels first class breakfast service with a smile decent size rooms for London and stunning rooftop lounge bar Amazing hotel
236964,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, warm cookies on arrival was a really pleasant treat The room was clean the bed very comfy the roof top bar was spectacular breakfast was really nice although very busy the staff managed to keep control and seat everyone reasonably quickly
236965,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, TV picture quality Could not believe that having such great big TVs in centre of London that there was no HD channels so picture quality really poor Had been watching US Masters in evening and wasn t good to view , The room had a fantastic view bed really comfy and overall layout of room very good 
236966,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our TV turned itself off and we struggled to get it on it was too hi tech for its own good, Really enjoyed this hotel and will stay again for sure great access to everywhere
236967,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Honestly for the price we paid on a weekday this was a great location and exceptional value We did suggest that they could consider putting mats down in the showers as my partner and I both nearly slipped and we are still relatively young and agile That such a small thing stood out really just highlights the fact that everything else about the design of the room and the experience overall was really impressive , The hotel is well equipped The computer air con and fridge in the most basic room on site restaurant and rooftop bar were particular pluses This really added value The location is great and for the price we just thought why travel further to central London when we don t need to We had concerns about noise but there was no such issue whatsoever What really stood out for us was the incredible service from the staff The service from Hilton was just exceptional throughout From a request for my partner s birthday before arrival to the warm greeting at check in to the cleaners greeting us in the corridors and even a chance exchange with a chef in the elevator Every single person we encountered in the employ of the hotel was so motivated attentive and warm I think this really reflects on the individuals and also the training and priorities of the company We were so impressed and will definitely consider Doubletree and Hilton for future stays 
236968,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The sky lounge was very exspensive I guess you can t really argue with it though because it s London but 19 98 for 2 drinks is steep Unless your filthy rich , The location was great Very close to a tube station which was a bonus The breakfast was incredible and 100 worth the money Beds were very comfy and the rooms were clean staff were helpful 
236969,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Shower head not fitted properly so water sprayed everywhere Not the Hotel s fault but had trouble finding the car park entrance because of all the roadworks going on around the hotel , Apple iMac in room which doubled up as TV Free wifi Sky Lounge with views over city fabulous 
236970,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Front desk services not as good as they could be our room was not ready and we were told we would receive a text message or phone call when it was ready this never happened Also on check out the printer would not work so they offered to e mail the receipt to us this has still not been received safety catch on bedroom door broken bedside clock not working correctly alarm kept going off in the middle of the night and key card was hit and miss as to whether it would work the lift all little things but they add up , Breakfast was good on the first day but cold on second 
236971,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I did not like the first room I was given it had a nasty stain on the carpet it was closely overlooked by windows from the building opposite and the air conditioning was very noisy , Most of all the attitude of the staff They were without exception friendly and helpful In particular I would like to mention Bea and Yuri as very exceptional 
236972,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Unfortunately there wasn t a bath would have loved to have been able to soak my feet after a day of trekking around London But the shower was delightful all the same Noisy air con system didn t need it on during my stay but can t imagine being able to sleep with it on during the summer , Location was excellent 2 minutes walk from Tower Hill tube station and just across the road from Tower Bridge and the Tower of London Very clean room Great ambience in the hotel and fabulous Skylounge bar Also in a nice quiet area so easy to sleep at night without any disturbance from traffic outside etc Friendly and welcoming staff who were always polite and helpful 
236973,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No tooth paste brush in the room even though we stayed at executive room , Good breakfast nice service and friendly staffs A little far away from soho and shopping area but close to many other sightseeing attractions such as tower bridge tower of london and shorditch area 
236974,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, noisy air con in the room which you couldnt turn off Volume of people at breakfast made it more of a process than an enjoyable experience too many people in one room , lovely rooftop bar Good service Great location Good breakfast choice and well replenished
236975,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Concierge showed us where we were on the map when we asked for one But give no advice on anything nor did he point out anything of interest nearby We figured it out through the trial and error and got great tips from local tour guides on bus and boat trips that would have been nice to get at the desk on check in And it was quite quiet at the time Otherwise the staff were very helpful , It s a great hotel Quiet rooms Dark at night Great views Easy access to everywhere in London The Natural Kitchen is amazing Great Brunch and Dinner options The cherry blossom trees outside the glass walls are a lovely touch I proposed after our meal there on Saturday night It was perfect 
236976,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Didn t have much of a view we was facing inside didn t have a huge coffee and tea supply in room had to go ask for more, The breakfast muffins are really nice and the cookie when you check in are really nice the iMacs in the room are a good touch
236977,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Personally I was expecting a king sized bed and it was a double It was also a tiny bit too firm for me although my husband was very comfortable The bedding was up to the usual high standard and as everything else was actually better than perfect and I can be difficult to please I would not let this stop me from staying again , Check in was great we got an upgrade so we had a free cooked breakfast a wonderful room with a fab view of both Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and the most enormous TV Lots of large fluffy towels already in the room etc The free breakfast was very good the service couldn t have been bettered we were made to feel like VIP s The staff had the most fabulous can do attitude 
236978,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Air conditioning heating very noisy so choice of lack of sleep due to room temperature or lack of sleep due to noise , Clean comfy room with good facilities Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff 
236979,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Even switched off the fan air con was quite loud through the night In fairness I didn t ask if anything could be done as I didn t notice until I was already trying to sleep so there could have been an easy fix , Great location warm cookie on check in was a nice touch Good selection at breakfast Comfortable room with good facilities 
236980,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We were told our room wouldn t be ready until 3 30 pm We were offered a superior room which was ready at an extra 60 which we agreed to We didn t think the room was very superior and we were given a 30 reduction on the 60 , staff very helpful hotel and room very clean breakfast good
236981,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our room was quiet small for a queen size compared to other queen size rooms we ve stayed in The shower head was broken which made showering a challenge , Great location and views from the Sky Lounge 
236982,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bar prices were way over the top and booked a queen room which had a view of a run down building from our room which was not pretty , The location ideal for trains and buses and the staff were very good at making you welcome and helping with your needs
236983,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We paid to be upgraded to an executive room which was clearly not an executive room It was extremely small and only had 1 of each toiletry Air con was extremely noisy and woke us up , Location

236986,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was great however for a vegetarian fairly poor as there was no cooked option as they only had one type of egg scrambled which wasn t too appetising , The location was excellent within a minute from Tower Hill station The sky lounge was also amazing hosting great views with a range of cocktails maybe a little pricey but worth it for a treat 
236987,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The pillows were rubbish they disappear as soon as you touch them Both myself and my husband woke with a stiff neck We told reception who sent up addional pillows which was an improvement Breakfast was hectic and not that great , The room and bathroom facilities were excellent Very clean The location was perfect for sight seeing and was a 2 minute walk from the tube station Even though it s in the heart of London you couldn t hear any outside noise once in the room 
236988,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, The bed was possibly the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in in the quietest room An undisturbed sleep is just what you need after touring London all day Sound proofing was perfect as were the views from the rooftop bar as we drank Mojito s Staff were very friendly and keen to please 
236989,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Location is fab Staff all helpful and friendly Rooms are large and airy We ve stayed many times and will continue to do so The views are also spectacular

236991,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Friendly reception and a lady at the Concierge was extremely helpful in the evening of my check up day She was on high heel but took the effort to bring my 2 luggages down by stairs from 1st floor However there was 1 male staff who was on morning shift at the Concierge on my check out day He did not smile and asked me to bring the luggages up to 1st floor Well it is probably the norm he could have been more helpful The differences in services created different impressions and experiences Thanks 
236992,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Shower can get very hot , Beautiful newly refurbished property Sky lounge views and bar excellent Natural Kitchen for meals next door and warm cookies to die for at check in or in our case each time we came in 
236993,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our room was located on 4th floor but the smell from our bathroom was appalling to say the least seriously bad hotel sent cleaner up to spray and put bleach or something in toilet n cleaned shower which masked over smell for about 30mins I actually felt so sick from it They said they d move us to another room but unfortunately they were fully booked , Location was perfect and views from sky lounge bar were amazing
236994,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was a delay in checking in Breakfast was expensive The Skybar didn t serve draught beer , Staff were friendly and helpful the room was comfortable and the hotel is in a good location 
236995,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room not available at check in went back on 2 occasions still not ready Requested a bed in our room for a child in advance I was told this had not been requested I then had to show my booking as proof Bed finally put in the room staff not very helpful did not advise breakfast times where breakfast was held Not a good experience with Hilton have used numerous times in the past always had very good service However not on this occasion which was a real shame as it put a dampener on our weekend ,No Positive

236998,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bed was not the best but it was only for one night small shower room , Great in room facilities clean glasses water ice bucket fridge iron safe TV Apple but couldn t get the sound up to actually hear it Friendly staff warm welcome and great location

237000,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Check in was chaotic rooms weren t available even though we explained out tight schedule and requested an earlier check in We were asked to come back at 3pm but at 3 15 our rooms still not available we were once more asked if we could come back later they would phone us when rooms ready After our protests a manager managed to locate another available room this was good but unfortunately it was 3 floors away from the other Bar staff were quite unhelpful rude almost when we asked what beers were available One doesn t expect to have the fridge doors flung open and contents pointed at as a response to a simple question , Break fast was good the staff were attentive and helpful Friendly efficient staff when we left our luggage for safe keeping on Sunday after check out Hotel has a very good location 
237001,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing everything was great , Everything about the hotel was spectacular all the staff were really helpful and they offered a lot of great customer service for a four star hotel The bedroom views were excellent and all the facilities were up to standard 
237002,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, it was quite expensive in the sky lounge bar but again it is something you would expect from a 4 star hotel and stunning views of London the location seemed brilliant via the tube i did look for food places around tower hill however there wasn t any and we had to walk down to st katherines dock so we had a various choice but limited choice of eating places but other than that a perfect stay , the staff were extra helpful in our stay Daphne was also exceptionally helpful and would definitely give credits to her helping us with our luxurious stay and helped us with our queries they also arranged for rose petals to be sprinkled on the bed upon request and was absolutely perfect The room was exceptionally quiet and was sound proof to most of the outside it was peaceful and we wasn t disturbed we was completely blown back by the views from the outside balcony bar leading onto the sky lounge bar the views were absolutely beautiful the room was exceptionally clean was such a good location 
237003,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Skylounge prices were astronomical just when we thought we d avoided London prices we got stung in our own hotel , Very attentive staff no problem too big or small
237004,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room was a little on the small side but to be fair this is evident from photographs so was not a surprise, Staff friendly Location good Housekeeping services were very impressive 
237005,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, was more expensive than i thought for 3 rooms after the 25 service charge considering i booked nearly 1 year before but brilliant location would go again try and get a better deal next time excellent staff , bed was great and comfy
237006,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The price was at the top of the range for the area and it was not obvious that the hotel was better than the competition , The hotel met the four star rating and the location was excellent for my needs The staff generally made an effort to be friendly and useful 
237007,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bed was a bit hard and the lifts were a bit of trouble , Clean and up to date rooms Hotel catered well to our special requests for our wedding anniversary 
237008,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No fridge or tea coffee making facilities in room Tv screen was small was fixed to the desk which was too far from the bed making watching tv difficult Room service too expensive, The bed was comfy room was nicely laid out Cool decor Liked the Apple TV computer set up Ice machine in hall was good

237010,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Tiny complaint The lifts are temperamental , The rooms especially the bathroom were very clean very comfy beds and pillows and an excellent breakfast The rooftop bar was great too super London skyline views and a good atmosphere We were there on a Saturday evening 
237011,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Be prepared to queue to book in it s such a big hotel and not enough staff to deal with the amount of people booking in If your booking as a package with breakfast don t bother The queue was far too long The breakfast area is very small and isn t big enough for the amount of people staying at the hotel , The hotel is very close to the tube station The rooms are spacious clean and the bed was very comfortable 
237012,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, My wife cutting herself on a chipped mirror and a chipped glass Breakfast cutlery and coffee being cleared whilst we waited for breakfast buffet All clearly just one of those things and swiftly dealt with, Staff were very friendly and helpful 
237013,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff seemed to look down on you as if you weren t good enough to stay there the bed sheets had marks on them when we came in looked like blood and the shower was leaking wished I went down the road to a premier inn would have had a better welcome and better room for half the price Also the pictures didn t match up to the room no nice views just others rooms The key cards also stopped working which meant we could get into our room and there was an additional fee of 25 which wasn t mentioned when booking still waiting to get it back , location was close to the tube and comfy bed 
237014,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The long corridors are awful tasteless and bland The queue for breakfast was dreadful Had we of waited we would of been stood there waiting at least 40 minutes with no apology I ordered some tea around 1am when I got in and asked for some biscuits but got told I can have tea but no biscuits No big deal but it s little things like that which would put me off returning , Good location nice sky terrace bar though the outside closed at 12 even though the bar was still busy 
237015,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I had too return 2 cocktails whilst in Sky Bar as the Alcohol was minimal to say the least which was remarkable considering I watched the bar tender make them in front of me he grunted when picked up on it at 12 plus VAT I expect booze in them When checking out the receptionist laughed in disbelief , Rooms compact but had all what you would need 
237016,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We had to queue for about 20 minutes for breakfast the next day definitely don t expect that in a 4 star hotel The breakfast room was a little chaotic too and the service wasn t overly great Not the best Hilton I ve ever stayed at seemed disorganised at times Better places to stay in London for a similar price , location was awesome breakfast was tasty with lots of choice 
237017,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Apple TV was odd to use , Breakfast was excellent in terms of quality variety and quantity Midday check out was good Sky sports in room at no extra cost
237018,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, when I booked I had advised that this was my husbands 50th birthday but the room in which was chosen for him was alful we were over looked by the workman we asked to move and that was not much better but we could not be bothered to ask again as we were only staying 1 night all in all I am not sure I would stay again, Hotel was was clean and tidy but had stayed at the apex hotel 2weeks prior for less cost and was far more superior to the double tree
237019,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The price is steep but you get what you pay for The sky lounge was not the place to go for a peaceful drink in the evening , Fantastic location close to the tube Brilliant breakfast 
237020,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, It was an area I ve never visited before there was nothing I didn t like, Location is most suitable for sight seeing having London Bridge and Tower of London plus boat trips Easy access to tube stations for other locations
237021,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, My husband booked a trip to London for my 30th birthday We had a great time only downside was the location of the hotel there was not a lot of eating places around unless of course you want a pret a manger 
237022,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I have to say we were very disappointed with the breakfast served Yes there was a varied choice available more so than other hotels I thought but the bacon was dry and tough the scrambled eggs were very runny and the pancakes were quite rubbery I asked for a pot of tea and I was brought a selection of tea bags and a pot of not boiling water to make my own The breakfast was the only let down of our entire stay , The pillows were AMAZING I so need to get myself some for home So comfortable The one thing about my trip into London was looking forward to sleeping in the hotel bed The staff were exceptionally accommodating too and nothing was too much trouble 
237023,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing , The room was spic and span as always The breakfast was great a huge variety to choose from with staff always on hand to assist with your questions and queries 
237024,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Rooms small a chair and coffee table added to lack of room to move about in the room The lift operation confused so many people Very expensive stay during the week OK if the company is paying , Location to all you need was excellent Reception staff were very polite and helpful 
237025,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was very expensive the staff could have been more friendly As a young couple we are often wrongly misjudged, Room was clean and functional had everything you needed and the complimentary water and cookies were lovely 
237026,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Cant complain about any think, The check in lady was fanstactic and lovely help with parking wished we had room on other side of hotel just for the veiw but over all really happy
237027,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room is small if you are from the states We did have one bad staff experience, Clean hotel On site food is excellent especially Natural Kitchen Over all very helpful staff Customer service team was great 
237028,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Maintenance service is very poor 3 nights two changes of room for the same reason air conditioning incredibly noisy What I think is very serious it is that there was no maintenance service from 6 pm on a Saturday in a hotel of 600 rooms , The staff specially Ana Mar a reception Very attentive and friendly always offering his help to me and my family 
237029,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing, Fabulous hotel Excellent professional but friendly service Wonderful roof top terrace Best breakfast I ve had in a hotel for a long time I loved the relaxed atmosphere at this hotel Will definitely return 
237030,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, room size hotel information in the room next to nothing no writig paper orpen airbuble noice from the ventiltion minibar empty tv programs very limited no information about restaurant services available menu etc , bed exelent brekfast exelent
237031,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The lifts were a real headache there s 4 of them but only one seems to work at a time trying to fit every call from each floor in at once left us stopping at the wrong floors nearly every time we got in them regardless of us inserting our key card and selecting our floor correctly, Room was good and bed was comfy breakfast was great be early to avoid the queue Staff were all very helpful with directions and info Taxis available from right outside as is Tower Hill tube so getting about locally or into the city on foot by train or taxi is a breeze Mainline railways are a 12 15 taxi ride away 
237032,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, it would have been a nice touch if the staff had put something in our room for my wife on arrival since it was our anniversary i did mention this at the time of booking but there was no acknowledgement , we love the location and the skybar this was our 3rd stay as a couple and we chose this again because it was our 20th wedding anniversary 
237033,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Great location and views particularly from the Sky Lounge The room was a good size and had everything you need for a short stay Would definitely stay again 
237034,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Being told breakfast wasn t in my room rate so didn t have breakfast which I paid for dirty sink in bathroom air conditioning was nosiey last guest food order left in room, Location
237035,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Noise from AC unit when off it had some motor still running so just left it on Trek from Lift to room just saying I m not expecting a new elevator to be built Breakfast was not included and I would not pay the OTT price for a fry or pastries Head out to Pret or all bar one even Wetherspoons if you re really scraping the barrel , Location stones throw from Tower Hill and on Circle District Line Great access to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London Great choice of food outside with St Katerines Dock close by Sky Bar was nice way to round off the night with a beer and cocktail or two Check out Bodeans near by too US style bbq pit attention at check in manager saw us standing slightly confused in front of a mile wide desk and lots of staff looking very busy Redirected us within seconds of arriving Noise from staff access rooms service rooms was a little off putting we were room opposite so bound to be activity Weekends make the surrounds very quiet which I enjoyed If you want hustle and bustle then a train or two will have you in Oxford street in 20 mins Defo will be back at a good rate with breakie included and a room closer to the lifts above floor 6 for a good view 
237036,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Breakfast was very good the service was a little poor Did ask for a city veiw but didn t get one but it didn t spoil are stay , The hotel was brilliant really enjoy it all 
237037,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The service at breakfast could have been a little better I sat with empty cereal bowl and glass for most of breakfast while eating my cooked breakfast , The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful The atmosphere of the hotel was very friendly 
237038,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Drinks a little expensive in the sky lounge but it is London , Amazing hotel will definitely stay again very clean polite staff easy to find very quiet area 
237039,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing , Great location loved the Cookie on arrival very quirky staff extremely polite helpful Room well equipped with Apple Macs Sky lounge is an added bonus and has lovely cocktails Plenty of variety for breakfast 
237040,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We were initially cold in the room Took a long time to get warm Television maximum volume was set too low for older people without the sharpest of hearing plus we couldn t hear the TV at all with the central heating on fan , Loved location public rooms the welcome and the breakfast was perfect Will definitely stay there again We always like to stay in a Hilton by Doubletree where possible 
237041,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The light in our room did not work upon arrival The view was quite poor when we booked we did request a city view but instead had the construction of the Four Seasons hotel opposite not ideal to have builders looking into our room from across the street so had to have the curtains closed for the most part They also offer some yummy complimentary cookies however my boyfriend is Vegan and the cookies contain milk eggs so he was unable to enjoy his one , David was lovely He checked us into the hotel and gave us a nice introduction of what to expect during our stay It was in a very good location to where we had dinner booked that night close to Tower Hill tube station The sky bar was good however perhaps not as high up as some might expect The room was very clean The bed was exceptionally comfortable Lots of amenities in the room Overall a lovely hotel and a comfortable stay 
237042,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The bathroom was a bit cramped, Breakfast was ok got a table fairly quickly buffet food is never as good as proper food but as I say ok Location was good right in the City easy access to the places I needed to get to to work Nice people on reception
237043,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Hotel was great its best feature is the skylounge with great cocktails and views of London especially the Tower of London The bed by the way was the best we have ever slept in 
237044,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Found the design of the executive room slightly odd tv was designed to be low in sound no good if you have hearing difficulties And the position of the bed closest to the wall wss difficult to get round the bed and also too small a space if a guest was on the large side
237045,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The staff gave the impression that they were only interested in getting as many people in and out as quickly as possible rather than taking the time to ensure individual guests needs were met despite the Hilton literature dotted around the hotel promoting the opposite Other than that a pleasant stay , The room was clean tidy and organised Presentation cleanliness and ambiance of the lobby and groundfloor facilities was very nice We weren t due to check in until 15 00 but our room was ready by 13 30
237046,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Lifts were slow and air conditioning was a bit noisy, Room very clean we didn t have any food but ended up in the kitchen by mistake and it was very clean
237047,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, No TV or background music in the executive lounge leaving for a very somber unenjoyable atmosphere Door handle on the room was Broken and unsecure No meat options in the cooked breakfast selection at the Executive lounge only cooked option was Scrambled egg Not what I expect when paying extra for executive benefits , Second stay at this hotel fantastic location facility s and staff 
237048,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, I didn t like the fact the speakers on the iMac were so quiet so was difficult to watch TV and we asked for an omelette and it took to long to come , I loved the way the rooms were laid out and as soon as you enter the lobby you are welcomed It was very cozy and a warm environment 
237049,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Bedroom was a little small No view at all I did request high floor with a view But did not get either, Very good choice at breakfast Nice and bright reception
237050,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, There was a leak in the shower and actually I found the room bland and boring the air con was a saviour but the noise drives me insane and the Mac as a telly is a bit meh , the location was incredible and the staff amazing Breakfast was pretty good too PANCAKES 
237051,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Price felt a bit steep but it was Valentine s weekend Sky bar also expensive I felt, Checked in at 10am even though it said 3pm on booking held luggage when we checked out friendly and helped us out with tourist advice and travel Free cookies are big bonus and amazing Sky bar has the best views ever 
237052,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Concierge need informing on the parking regulations outside of their hotel I was told I would be ok to park my car outside of the hotel until 8am but unfortunately I came to my car before 8am and was issued with a parking ticket Breakfast in the city cafe was very expensive and two light switches in the bedroom were faulty , Excellent location and cleanliness
237053,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, That I had to leave lol there was nothing I didn t like, I have to be honest I loved everything about this hotel from the minute we arrived until we left All the staff were very attentive to any request we had The room was lovely the hotel was very clean 
237054,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Staff We were told during check in that the car park was full The website specifically states parking wouldn t be an issue Yet this was the case and we were asked to park up in the coach carpark a few roads away damper on the day Although late check out was requested and approved for 2pm a staff member decides to knock on the door at 12 30 to ask when we are checking out as there was no record of a late check out on the system Very rude and disappointing We didn t pay near enough 200 for the one night for nothing Poor service We stayed at the MK doubletree the night before where service location was perfect we even received cookies on arrival and price was good ,No Positive
237055,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, A few more milks for tea and coffee in the room , Great rooms comfy beds lovely shower and super breakfast Warm cookies on check in are fantastic 
237056,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Had to change room as there was no view and we had offices overlooking us got changed to another room that wasn t as bad but still had little or no view room was a lot smaller than the review pictures had led me to believe could not eat at hotel as it was way overpriced for breakfast 21 50pp was outrageous and because of this we didn t even consider dinner same as the sky bar just too pricey for the ordinary person plus selection of drink was very limited to poor which meant we only had one drink before leaving even tho we wanted to stay for longer, The hotels location was very close to tube and The Tower of London the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel was spotless and clean great view from the sky bar lovely smell upon entry at the lobby the facilities in the room were very good fridge iron hair dryer kettle the iMac was excellent
237057,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Left my bag in luggage area Lucky I checked it before I left as a bag that was placed inside it wasn t there Staff said it must have rolled out in the luggage area I was rather worried and I did think they could have been a litte more apologetic , Nice staff on checkin Great roof top bar A very quiet room Comfortable bed 
237058,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The trainee staff knows very little about the Hilton HHonors program I am a gold member and was not offered any upgrade until I had asked I had also prepaid the hotel booking charges but was charged again when I checked upon checked in and refund later I had to suffer from FX losses from this Very disappointed experience I am sure the trainees are doing their best perhaps a supervisor had to be there to assist Thumb down , Generally good 
237059,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The round table was taking too much space Not necessary Also Internet had to be reconnected after every 24 hours If it is free complimentary then keep it running , Nice neat room Lovely and cozy lobby
237060,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, As a Diamond member they used to provide a free bottle of wine and a small snack which was a nice touch Now they don t In the Exec lounge they don t provide lager as a choice of drink how strange is that it is also very annoying and so I never use the lounge as I cant get the drink I would like ,No Positive
237061,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room floor carpet could have gotten a way better clean up especially around the bed All other areas of the room and bathroom were very clean and nice , Wonderfull staff felt super welcome also allowed to check in around noon even though listed as 3pm Location is excellent 2min walking from tube line 2 stops away from Liverpool station connecting to all airports Rooftop terrace bar gives you amazing views to downtown Room was comfortably facilitated everything you need 10 karma points for amazing toiletries

237063,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Room could have been a little bigger but still I would strongly recommend this hotel, Super friendly staff Good breakfast Good location Good view from top floor bar
237064,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The room was a bit small and when I tried to extend my stay the price went up ridiculously high so I had to relocate Also I don t like the in room Mac computers which double as TVs The remote control is extremely limited and you have to use the keyboard to for example adjust the volume Everybody has their own computer nowadays so why not just have simple TVs Being offered a free cookie at check in is a bit naff too , The location was good and the hotel was very smart and clean 
237065,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Not much i didnt like only thing i could say is it would have been nice if there was more choice of sandwiches ect on the room service menu after 2am as we got bck late and what was on the menu eg chilli and curry was a little to heavy for that time of night apart from that had a lovely stay of 3 nights, The rooms were lovely and spacious the staff were helpfull and friendly and the cocktails on the pricey side but lovely
237066,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The comfort control was really noise and buzzed when turned off Incredibly annoying, Great location and roof top bar with amazing views Clean modern Great breakfast 
237067,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, check in took 20 minutes printer would not print for staff there was no paper in the card machine my pass card for the room door was not activated resulting in having to come back to the check in desk to get it activated to be able to use the lift ,No Positive

237070,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Some how convinced us to upgrade even though kept saying we didn t want to which after we realised there was no benefit of upgrading and cost us more money for no reason , Lovely reception really nice hotel Felt bit disappointing after seeing how nice the lobby and reception was to then seeing our room Nice and friendly staff Would visit again Right next to Tower Hill station
237071,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Wait for checkin queue Room looked on internal courtyard Breakfast was quite expensive No minibar contents Only 4 lifts so a long wait for the lift most times , Late check out Comfortable bed Roof terrace bar Good breakfast Helpful receptionist Great location

237082,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Only two negatives Breakfast was not included we paid separately and wasn t worth the money The noise I got woken up several times through the night from shouting, Friendly staff and clean hotel The lay out of the hotel is nice and trendy and the sky longue bar is great with brilliant view of the city

237084,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Main restaurant wasn t open on Friday night despite literature in hotel saying it would be so we ate at the hotel bar where food was nice but prices not so reasonable 51 without their added tips which you really have to look carefully to avoid gratuity being added 2 burgers and a drink each 51 , Breakfast choice was excellent and use of sky lounge superb plus I asked hotel to set up my room with balloon champagne and fruit plate as it was anniversary weekend and they got it spot on 
237085,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, We ordered room service very late at night and it still had not arrived after 45mins so we cancelled the order unfortunately we then had to have it removed from the bill on check out as it had been added to the bill along with phone calls we did not make The staff were lovely apologetic and removed the charges , The hotel was well furnished comfortable and modern Staff were polite and friendly Sky lounge is fantastic and the views were amazing

237094,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, N A, The location was great for our New Years stay to view the fireworks and also to get to the west end easily The whole hotel was very comfortable and we liked the roof top bar which we will visit again in the summer 
237095,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing, Easy to drive to from A1 Very pleasant staff Checking in and out stress free Good choice of food at breakfast Underground car park in central London is a big plus 
237096,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Very clean Bar on 12th floor nice to relax and very nice view over London Very close to Tower Bridge and the river boats Lots of restaurants and coffee shops Very close to tube We will defiantly use this hotel again when we go back to London 
237097,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Loved the place but the beds and pillows are so uncomfortable it is a shame Also a lot of noise from the air con system during the night which kept me up again very frustrating , Atmosphere is great luxury feel to it Location is also great and easy to get to from Liverpool Street 
237098,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, At the reception we were asked if we would like to upgrade to an executive room which pushed the peuce up to 300 for the night As it was NYE we decided to treat ourselves we were told with this that we would receive access to the executive lounge and a full breakfast Our new room was on the tenth floor had a view of roofline and nearly the river but not quite For an executive room it was small I dread to think what the size of the queen rooms are We had a moldy muffin left in he fridge of our room which was a lovely welcome The bathroom was nicely fitted out as expected but with a shower door you had to wrestle with to close and wouldn t actually fully close when you did manage to pull it shut We didn t even try to enter the executive lounge as it had been claimed by a group of fouled mouthed individuals who proceeded to swear at anyone who even walked passed them including an elderly couple Their badly behaved children although not as bad as their parents were allowed to run wild until past 1am Please note this hotel does not have a restaurant Upon coming down for our breakfast we found ourselves sat next to part of the same group who destroyed their table and treated the staff appallingly I am surprised a manager did not come to politely tell them to stop desturbing those around them All in all the stay was disappointed For one of the top London hotels I will not be spending that much on a room in the city again ,No Positive
237099,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, The price its London I didn t expect it to be cheap but what we got for the price we paid was very disappointing we got a queens room which was equal to a standard room at a budget hotel etap ibis , The hotel is in a nice location as we were visiting central London and was very clean and staff were friendly
237100,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Upgraded room was really not worth the extra money the standard rooms are better , I love the location and the friendliness of the staff I also like the Skyloung 
237101,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Due to us staying for New Years we expected that on the 12th floor at the sky lounge we would be able to see the fireworks but unfortunately we didn t see them due to a building being in the way Also there was no countdown off the dj and it seemed as if he didn t realise it was 12oclock , Cookie on arrival
237102,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Restaurant closed without any warning on 30th December even though TV services said is should be open Lobby bar charged 17 for two salmon bagels and two lukewarm cups of coffee Coffee was replaced free of charge but was no warmer so we gave up An additional round of drinks from the Skylon bar appeared on the bill which was removed when I queried it once they had checked that the bill was unsigned , Nice hotel with great views of Shard and Tower Bridge from the Skylon Bar 
237103,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent from start to finish Booked a King suite room 855 with lounge access brilliant views and lovely suite Staff were very attentive when needed and buffet breakfast was delicious and vast 
237104,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Some of the staff struggled to understand English the roof top bar was very expensive We upgraded to allow access to the executive lounge which required a number of complaints in relation to Lack of refreshments in the evening , Good location close to Tower of London and Tower Bridge tube station The roof top bar would be lovely in the summer but far to cold in December 
237105,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Our shampoos and conditioners were not replaced by housekeeping so we were left with insufficient toiletries the next morning , Natural Kitchen the restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent 
237106,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London,No Negative, Very friendly welcome Worth while upgrading to the executive club Beer wine and nibbles from 5 8 each evening and no queue for breakfast like the main restaurant

237156,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Tower of London, Nothing was bad but London prices do need some getting used to eg A G T in the Sky Line bar circa 10 Breakfast was indeed excellent but at 20 a person so it should be and perhaps there are more economic alternatives nearby , Service was first class location excellent only a few hundred yards from Tower Hill Underground Room was very good and cleaned well The Sky Line bar on the roof has spectacular views of London Bed was a little hard for us and within a short space of time they put on a mattress topper Nothing seemed too much trouble
