303746,Hotel Romana Residence, I thought the Air Conditioning could have been a lot better Was very weak and did not cool the room like I would like but it was not bad either There was a beautiful Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom but there was no shower So if you tried to take a shower in the tub with the no curtains you made a huge mess of the floor , The hotel is beautiful We had a huge room Separate area for doing work at a table while the girlfriend can sleep longer In the bedroom part there were shades that made it so dark in the room we thought the sun hadn t come up The bathroom was gorgeous and HUGE The staff was nice The breakfast was great The location to the Duomo Cathedral and the famous shopping center is very good A few minutes away 
303747,Hotel Romana Residence, Air conditioning was not so good, The room size was good but the air condition size was small good spread of breakfast very good location everything is in walking distance from the hotel
303748,Hotel Romana Residence, The sound of the passing trams may disturb you , Nice city hotel not far from Duomo but still away from the usual crowd Friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms 
303749,Hotel Romana Residence, The building is old and so that causes a few issues like very slow lifts and a less modern corridors but don t be put off as the interiors of the rooms are very nice Tea and coffee making facilities would have been an added bonus , Great central location just 10 mins walk from Duormo and 5 mins to Metro Comfortable bed Spacious room and bathroom Bath and shower Room very clean and nicely decorated Good room temperature with adjustable air con heating Huge window with double glazing and shutters to keep light out in the mornings 
303750,Hotel Romana Residence, The hotel is listed as 4 star This is not correct in any way I have stayed in 4 star hotels The decor was poor The furniture is old The lift can only have one person at a time The facilities were poor , The location was convenient to Duomo Only a few minutes walk
303751,Hotel Romana Residence, Two main issues the air conditioning is woefully inadequate and it seems there was no way to fix it neither did management care much And second the Wifi is very slow and erratic often coming to a halt altogether , Well situated withing 15 min walk of centre and near a metro station Good size room and bathroom 
303752,Hotel Romana Residence, The hotel is pretty old doer to shower did not close We had a room for 3 people and only one key card that had to be kept in key card slot for lights to stay on Breakfast was average The reception were ok and did not provide any additional information , Centrally located close to train station and walking distance to main square
303753,Hotel Romana Residence, noone smiling no any person in the staff never ever took a single smile horrible no one was interested about me or my family everthig is ok how are you what about the stay can I help to find anything etc etc no one was simple care about us never seen before similar they also forgot to refill minibar everyday ridiculous , so boring breakfast in a high price you could find much better in half price walking distance
303754,Hotel Romana Residence, There was a constant siege smell on the corridors the room wasn t clean and it was smelly and the air conditioner had a very loud noise even after them fixing it which kept me awake all night It didn t really cool the air or dehumidifier Switching off and opening the window wasn t an option due to the even louder street noise and the heat , Very good location and friendly staff Extremely good service at the breakfast room One of them remembered the way we liked the coffees which gave it an extra touch 
303755,Hotel Romana Residence, The gate to get out of the underground car park was faulty The button inside didnt work If you can handle the stress of driving in the centre of Milan this is an awesome hotel for your stay , This is our second time staying at this hotel Ideal with underground parking as we were doing a road trip Its a 10 min walk to the centre We had a beautiful junior suite with a spa bath Staff are very helpful 
303756,Hotel Romana Residence, Noise from the street was very loud even with the shutters closed Normal bath tub in the suite was a disappointment General condition of the rooms and bathroom in particular need some care painting peeling off missing silicone fillings around installations Very small TVs for a suite Not really a luxury feeling , Great Location with many attractions in walking distance excellent wifi reasonable breakfast easy underground parking Euro 25 day helpful staff Don t forget to buy a ZTL ticket available in most tobacco shops Euro 5 let the reception handle the registration online sms does not work with a foreign license plate 
303757,Hotel Romana Residence, Staff member on the check out was quite rude and price for parking didn t match the price when hotel was booked which he didn t seem to care about Room very pricey and just didn t feel as it was worth the money old tiny lift which was difficult to fit in even for two people with little luggage Would not book again , Nice breakfast lots of choice Most of the staff polite and professional Secure parking spacious newly redecorated room Good location 12mins to Duomo 
303758,Hotel Romana Residence, Nothing, Older type of hotel but it s been refurbished Breakfast is very good Location is very central 10 minute walk to Milan cathedral and a further 10 minutes to Castello Sforzesco Tons of restuarantes in the centre again watch the price of wine Shops are amazing and all the top Italian brands are there 
303759,Hotel Romana Residence, No room service menu in the room the inner garden is not available no hotel bar , Good location close to tram stop and Metro station good sized room clean Staff spoke good English luggage storage
303760,Hotel Romana Residence, To the reception smile doesn t cost you a penny The room was supposed to be soundproof Was not You could hear the noise from the street very well even with the window closed and a couple talking in the next room as they were in the same room with you These didn t bother us as we sleep very well and don t understand Italian D But someone who likes it quiet I can not recommend , Breakfast was alright Close to subway and within a walking distance from Duomo Clean and comfortable room Price was lower than most of the hotels in Milan 
303761,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, The room was very big the bed was comfortable Hundreds of TV channels in different languages Very comfortable bathroom with bath A tea pot with tea coffee and sugar 
303762,Hotel Romana Residence, Very noisy We was not able to sleep well because of noise from the street also we were able to hear neighbors Bath with shower very small and uncomfortable with black mold in corners and with curtain instead of glass very old and very dirty hair dryer air conditioner and ventilation So dirty walls I saw before only in hostels not in 4 star hotels No slippers in room Double bad has two mattresses instead of one big Breakfast is very bad with very poor assortment , Location 
303763,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, The hotel staff accommodated us to do an early check in The room was spacious and clean with a safe to keep valuables was a good addition It seemed the room was newly renovated and the decor was good There is also an elevator to get to the rooms The breakfast is ok for an additional fee The location was ok it was a bit of a walk to get to the Duomo 
303764,Hotel Romana Residence, The bathroom could have been cleaner around the bath as well the curtain shower The shower head would not stand u, Our room was the perfect size with a large double bed and plenty of storage
303765,Hotel Romana Residence, Not up to the standards of a real 4 star hotel too loud construction work right behind my wall at 8 am drilling hammering etc water supply was suspended because of construction work for several hours two tiny slow elevators one of which was out of order, comfortable large bed sizeable desk clean modern bathroom with Bidet decent breakfast
303766,Hotel Romana Residence, Seemed like it was quite outdated Didn t like the bathroom or the room and it seemed overpriced for what you got Breakfast was overpriced and not good, Location was good Staff friendly and helpful
303767,Hotel Romana Residence, Dated bathroom Tram stop outside hotel with regular trams Extremely small lifts only fitting 3 people Inner garden court yard overrun and not tendered, Good breakfast choice Helpful staff Tea and coffee making facilities 12 minute walk from Dumo
303768,Hotel Romana Residence, The breakfast staff were not particularly friendly and on every visit some of the items had run out and not restocked This included coffee and milk on one occasion which I would have hoped were essentials When advised the staff weren t exactly quick to act That was the only thing that detracted from our stay really , It was ideally located and the staff on reception and cleaners were very good 
303769,Hotel Romana Residence, A lot of chaos in the breakfast room We had to wait 1 hour in the lobby to have breakfast Very small breakfast area for 66 rooms There were a lot of dirty plates cups glasses on the tables There where 2 waitress but it did not helped to fix everything on time because there where not enough clean plates cups and other dishes It seems that reception staff is hiding from their guests they have their small room and they where there all the time We asked for the corkscrew but the receptionist could not find it but we find it in mini bar , Thank you for the upgrade from triple room to family room The room was big tidy and very comfortable 
303770,Hotel Romana Residence, 1 No blackout curtains how can you expect to sleep at night with all streetlight coming in 2 AC didn t work properly 3 Not sound proof noisy next door and traffic noise, Location decent size room 
303771,Hotel Romana Residence, The Tram runs opposite the Hotel so it was very noisy the rooms were run down without any Tea coffee maker no drinking water was provided so we had to buy from outside we had to close the widows to keep the street noises out and the airconditioning in the room was not working when we contacted the front desk we were rudely told that we came from India and we were used to tempretures of 50 Degrees so we did not need the air conditioning The staff dont even help take your bags from the car or load them , The proximity of the Hotel from the Dumo and Fashion district
303772,Hotel Romana Residence, Air conditioning would be a big improvement as the traffic noise made it difficult to keep the windows open Tea and coffee making facilities somewhere in the hotel outside of breakfast hours would also be a big help , Breakfast was extremely good and the staff were very attentive The hotel is in easy walking distance of the city center and all of its amenities 
303773,Hotel Romana Residence, The bathroom door was almost transparent made of glass and it didn t close hermetically , The family room was very big clean and comfortable The hotel was located in an area close to the Duomo 10 min walking distance and also very near to bus and tram stops The hotel area was safe and rather quiet 
303774,Hotel Romana Residence, The problems were the hotel isn t kept very well the room and hallways had an unpleasent scent the bathroom really needs refurbishment bathtub fills with water and the electrical sockets for the TV were hanging off exposing wires Hardly ideal when you have a crawling baby I didn t think the breakfast lived up to expectation either given the prior reviews The two main lifts you cannot use if you have a buggy as they are too small So you have to use the lift for the garage and even that is incredibly tight for 2 adults and a baby , Good location good to have onsite parking and the staff were nice 
303775,Hotel Romana Residence, Every morning 5 nights we experienced lack of coffee hot water juice bread cheese frutis Staff was not kind to bring theese products as quickly as possible There were no possibility to drink coffee or tea during all the day there were no in the rooms and in another place in hotel It s too expensive to the facilities which we noticed, Location is very good in the center of city Comfortable ways of approach to hotel by tram metro bus 
303776,Hotel Romana Residence, No restaurant in the hotel Very old tiny lift Staff were not interested or helpful No information or welcome at check in No information regarding check out Poor standard of hotel room No tea and coffee facilities in room Shower was falling apart Toilet had brown mould inside which even after the maid cleaned it was still there, It was very close to the city 10 min walk to the duomo and shops
303777,Hotel Romana Residence, Nothing special Just a place were to rest Not very clean small room everything cheap and weared from carpets and furniture till the tv set It s hardly a 4 stars , It s placed near city center and the metro station is just few steps away 
303778,Hotel Romana Residence, The room could be cleaner and the personnel aren t very nice , The room was nice and big The hotel is not far away from the centre and the breakfast is okay 
303779,Hotel Romana Residence, breakfast not good the bath room door in room no 437 was not fixed properly the water was going out side into the corridor, size of the room location staff
303780,Hotel Romana Residence, The room overlooks the street and noisy , Excellent location close to the Metro tram Beautiful spacious room bathroom equipped super The breakfast is plentiful and very good Large spacious garage for parking the car 
303781,Hotel Romana Residence, Some of the furniture may need a little bit of maintanance We had a squeaky wordrobe door which was hard to open , The room the food the location everything was excellent 
303782,Hotel Romana Residence, The wardrobe door was glass and broken We did not use it because we were afraid of doing damage The lifts seemed a bit small and old , The breakfast The bed was comfortable The staff were friendly It was quiet ddespite being on a busy road The wifi was excellent 
303783,Hotel Romana Residence, No additional facilities in the hotel No English channel television No bar or restaurant Basically just room and breakfast Not a 4 star as know in UK, Location was excellent easy walk to centre of town Room was pleasant and kept very clean
303784,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Great location our one night stay was made perfect with the hotel being in such close proximity to the main attractions Was also located close to many good places to eat The room was clean and had a very comfortable bed 
303785,Hotel Romana Residence, I was very disappointed with the service at this hotel Internet did not work in my room but when I complained they did not only fix it but insisted on everything being in working order They did not only fail to fix it but insisted that everything was already in working order For the first time I was faced with the complete indifference of the staff ,No Positive
303786,Hotel Romana Residence, The room has no coffee and tea facilities The staff at the restaurant are not hepful it would be good if they could speak english and not be rude , N A
303787,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Good position for Duomo but not as luxurious as it looks on pictures More like a 3 star No her and very few in area Hardly any restaurants close By No tea making facilities 
303788,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Location near to great italian stores the little ones where you have the best offers and near to Duomo 2 metro stops and the metro station is 2 mins from the hotel Very professional staff Beautiful hotel Great breakfast
303789,Hotel Romana Residence, the mess is all around in room broken window hair in the bathroom when arrived Breakfast terrible without choice and for extra payments, Location is quite good staff is friendly
303790,Hotel Romana Residence, 1 We book a room with twin bed I travelled with my friend but in fact there was a double bed in the room wich was not such a big problem if they had two blankets on it But they didn t I went downstairs and asked for a blanket but they brought a plaid of some artificial material Seriuosely How would we use it instead of a blanket Well we had to take the sheet that we removed from the bed to cover the plaid to make it possible to sleep under it at all And slept on the bed without a sheet 2 There was horribly noisy in the room There is a very buisy street outside always full of cars and trams Plus the tubes in the hotel made some loud and annoying noise from time to time all night long I think they just put us into the worst room they had because I booked with a big discount If I knew that the discount meant lack of quality I would never save money on the comfort In fact even with the discount the hotel didn t worth the money we spent on it , Location was good and the breakfast nice too 
303791,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, There was even a jacuzzi in the bathroom Everything was perfect 5 10 min to the Duomo by walk an excellent breakfast buffet and quite affordable compared to the prices of the city We will come back soon 
303792,Hotel Romana Residence, I just find the elevators very small only good for 3 4 persons , We got a family room and it was a great size for a family of 2 adults and 2 young kids location is a good 30 minute leisure walk to duomo 
303793,Hotel Romana Residence, When we arrived they wanted to give a room which was in bad condition When we complained they could immediately change Too hot in the rooms , The breakfast was good The electric shutter is nice 
303794,Hotel Romana Residence, Staff was very unfriendly and told us that our little boy could not share double room with us it is against the law but charging us extra 40 Euro for another room which had 1 double bed only with extra bathroom Should make a remark on website children not welcome so we know in advance not to book this hotel again ,No Positive
303795,Hotel Romana Residence, Rooms are a little on the small side but adequate Difficult to lay out two cases Lifts were a bit dodgy and only 2 person lift , Location is very convenient for walking to Duomo or catching trams excellent public transport services with Metro 50mt away Hop On Hop Off Bus located 50 mt away also Good cafes and authentic Italian restorantes close by I would stay again Recepton Staff helpful 
303796,Hotel Romana Residence, Although rated four star the hotel lacked the quality and associated things that go with a four star hotel basic breakfast bathrooms old rooms basic open wardrobes no in room tea or coffee facilities etc , Location
303797,Hotel Romana Residence, worn out materials with specific points in the room looking extremely old and dirty The Air condition was very dirty Coffee was awful astonishingly for an Italian hotel Saturday morning the shower ran out of hot water It seems that some rooms were renovated but others not We should have been informed since our booking was done many months prior to arrival I upload photos of disappointing points, Location was very good close to the metro and within walking distance from the Duomo Room quiet and bed large and comfortable Main lobby cozy and breakfast acceptable 
303798,Hotel Romana Residence, Large patches of mould in the bathroom ceiling ugly shower bathroom suite and room furniture certainly inadequate for a 4 stars hotel in Milan and for the price I was charged When I shared my opinion with a member of staff I was told that the patches in some of the rooms mine wasn t the only one in this status were due to spills of water caused by careless tourists enjoying their bath He admitted that the hotel as a whole needs to be refurbished Apparently they have already renovated some of the 80 rooms in the last couple of years They will be happy to accommodate a request for an already renovated room next time Very unprofessional ,No Positive
303799,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast room is small and doesn t cope well at busy times Be prepared to wait for a table the buffet to be re stocked and your coffee order never to come , The room was spacious and while the style is a bit dated it was very comfortable and met my needs The hotel is located very close to the centre being a 10 15 minute walk to the Duomo Metro located 2 minutes from the front door on yellow M3 line which takes you directly to the central train station 
303800,Hotel Romana Residence, quality of breakfast ingredients is more than poor very low quality cheap and not comparable with the standards you expect for such hotel and price , location parking cleanness
303801,Hotel Romana Residence, elevator small, Excellent location very professional staff breakfast on site Upgraded to a suite from a junior suite Great value for the money clean 
303802,Hotel Romana Residence, Think rooms need a makeover especially bathroom shower was in an awkward place centre of Bath I think if these were addressed would be more value for money it was OK for 2 nights, Buffet very good nice dining area 
303803,Hotel Romana Residence, We got a too on the top most floor which only has a very tiny window Still managed to get some sun light which was good but it would have been nice to have a room with a bigger window to enjoy the beautiful city of Milan , Location was good Close proximity to super market train station and other amenities However I didn t notice that many food choices around 
303804,Hotel Romana Residence, restaurant closes at 10 and no food is provided to the guest who checks in late needed an adopter for charging but was not available in the hotel, food not available after 10 pm fairly good otherwise
303805,Hotel Romana Residence, No bar and in the morning breakfast when busy could be run better tables needed clearing ran out of products nobody to direct you to a table , Location of hotel 
303806,Hotel Romana Residence, Standard room was a little tired but clean and functional , Convenient location with trams and metro stops nearby 10 minutes walk to main tourist area Upgraded to suite nice room clean large bathroom Good breakfast choice 
303807,Hotel Romana Residence, Elevator too small not enough breakfast variety and tv is too small But who goes to Milan to watch TV or worry about breakfast , Great location very helpfull staff and the junior suite is big enough 
303808,Hotel Romana Residence, The hotel looked different to the pics and the area was a bit of a dump The lift was just in working order The guy at reception was unhelpful and looked depressed as did this property , Not much
303809,Hotel Romana Residence, The hotel has potential to be beautiful The suits are nice However it is not well kept They need to renovate and repainted the walls Housekeeping does not clean at all there is mould around the bathtub The carpets were dirty with animal fur I had allergies for the entire stay When we checked into the room my allergies were immediately triggered I was sneezing uncontrollably then I noticed fur I called reception and mentioned the state of the carpet and that it needed vacuuming immediately The man who was sent do it was so angry and rude and just did a bad job making us feel like he was truly bothered by our request Oh they could not give me an iron when I I asked for one one evening It did not feel like a 4 hotel Only friendly staff at reception were the gentleman when we checked in on the evening of 2 September and the one from the morning we checked out on 6 September The gentleman who called our taxi and helped us load our taxi was friendly Pity i didn t take their names down The others throughout our stay were unfriendly and impatient , The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood very close to Duomo It is about a ten minutes walk to Duomo I loved the Manhattan restaurant which was recommended by the gentleman who was on night duty the day we checked in 
303810,Hotel Romana Residence, As usually with booking com we had the worst rooms in the first floor absolutelly not like in pictures I guess upper floors would have been better though ,No Positive
303811,Hotel Romana Residence, The attitude of receptionist upon check in was poor and looked like he pays us to stay in his hotel and not we pay him never will stay in this hotel anymore also blocked 3 times 214 20 Euro and didn t want to help to unblock the amounts Plus upon checkout could not use any preauthorized amounts and charged separately different ,No Positive
303812,Hotel Romana Residence, As we only wanted coffee in the morning and perhaps fruit or a bowl of cereal we did not sign up for the breakfast option as it was too expensive for our minimal needs The hotel should consider just offering coffee and one other option at a lower price , Location was very close to the metro making travel about the city easy 
303813,Hotel Romana Residence, the elevator is really small and can be suffocating and the view from our room wasn t good at all But these are all minor problems as everything else was amazing, everything but the view from the room Great location clean big rooms etc 
303814,Hotel Romana Residence, The rooms are old fashioned Staff weren t great Arrived with my girlfriend and they put us in a room with two single beds The facilities were extremely poor No coffee or tea in the room The bathroom was old and dark and although I m sure was clean it certainly didn t give off that impression , This is not a 4 star property Not even close 
303815,Hotel Romana Residence, The decor is tired and needs refreshing The bathroom was clean but a bit mouldy Think 2 stars and you have a better idea of the place The pictures on the internet look better than the reality , Location is not too far from main sites and is well situated for public transport The beds are comfortable 
303816,Hotel Romana Residence, Waking up at four o clock because the AC had timed out and it was warm and stuffy so I had to get up and turn it on again Avoid floor 7 it only has tiny roof windows , Very good location 
303817,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast was poor Staff in breakfast area were useless there were constant empty servers with no food and no willingness to refill Wifi was slow and unresponsive Air conditioning was hotel monitored so mostly the room was boiling , Beds were comfy 
303818,Hotel Romana Residence, Staff is not extremely friendly but they do the job The parking costs a lot of extra about 20 euro night but they don t tell you about it in advance There is a lot of street noise but it is the city center after all , A proper 4 star hotel in a good location 15 minute walk to the Dome Very clean and comfortable wifi in working and breakfast is good and varied 
303819,Hotel Romana Residence, Only a bath no shower which was different from what we had been told A C did not work properly and staff did nothing to help Staff wEre somewhat rude and very slow at service , A decent breakfast and the front desk had razors which came in handy when I forgot mine 
303820,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Perfect location Perfect space room for three persons me husband and son Highly recommend Don t know about food we were going to the nearest cafes 
303821,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast Very limited at 18 per person In my opinion expensive Try the pizza cafe instead, Fantastic pizza cafe 100m away Very good tram metro connections
303822,Hotel Romana Residence, No business center Minor detail though , Excellent location exceptionally friendly staff great breakfast and we received an up grade to the junior suite at no extra charge A great hotel 
303823,Hotel Romana Residence, A little bit too noisy you can hear what s going on in another room nearby, Greatest staff unbeatable value for money nice comfortable big rooms excellent location no such pri es in the centre of Milan at all for a great 4 star experience
303824,Hotel Romana Residence, Staff a bit unfriendly , Huge room Free slippers Good breakfast with lots of choice hot or cold food ham eggs sausage cheese cereals fruit bread pastries etc Walking distance to cathedral Brera Gallery navigli area where we had great food and drinks at a fraction of the cost Good value bar and restaurant also just around the corner Pity we couldn t get close to Mantegna s Dead Christ in the Brera because the floor had been rewaxed and that we couldn t see The Last Supper because you must book in advance and was booked till August 
303825,Hotel Romana Residence, The breakfast was a little basic bacon and scrambled eggs 2x juice 4 basic cereals ie all bran cornflakes rice Crispies A few cold meats the best bit were the fresh croissants Although we went out of season a few mornings people had to wait as there were no free tables left the staff didn t speak English at all so was difficult to communicate they offered cappuccinos etc but not sure if these were charged , Location was fantastic literally 10min walk to the cathedral and has a very impressive entrance Rooms were large and spacious offering a tv lots of wardrobe space and a free safe which was useful The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels given 
303826,Hotel Romana Residence, The lift was very small and dingy it didn t feel the safest going in there You are not provided with an iron and have to pay for staff to press your clothes , Went as a group of 3 the room was really big with 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms in one room Location about a 10 15 minute walk from the city centre They call taxis for you that appear within 1 minute 
303827,Hotel Romana Residence, Choice of breakfast items pretty average shame they don t provide tea coffee facilities in the room , Location Close to metro station and good links across the city from there 
303828,Hotel Romana Residence, Improve on morning breakfast the room aircon stop inch was not that good, Location of the hotel close to metro affinity ie walking distances to the iconic places
303829,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Very close to the metro station nice neighborhood lots of restaurants and shops nearby very close to UNIMI a very nice historical building Also Duomo is in easy reach Staff is helpful about personal requests 
303830,Hotel Romana Residence, no room service for food its doesn t seem to be a 4 star hotel it doesn t worth the amount I payed doumo is a bit far away, the parking is in the hotel garage the room was good and clean
303831,Hotel Romana Residence, A terrace or garden would be nice and a bar lounge for the evening, Receptionist was very helpful breakfast was good Very good bed and double double glass made for great soundproofing 
303832,Hotel Romana Residence, Didn t have much choice for breakfast, We got upgraded to a really nice and big room We were very happy and the staff who served us was very kind and friendly too Room was clean bright and cosy Close to city centre and tube station 
303833,Hotel Romana Residence, No bathtub only shower but not a major issue for short term stay, Great location within walking distance to la Scala cozy neighbourhood the hotel wifi was fast and facilities are just what I need staff was helpful when asked about transport in the city etc
303834,Hotel Romana Residence, I have decided to take this hotel because of breakfast i d read good opinions but in fact the breakfast was avarage Bathroom facility is also not so new but clean , The location is really good Bus stop for bus 94 is 1 minute from hotel metro station 4 minutes and you can walk 10 15 min to reach Duomi
303835,Hotel Romana Residence, Old and dated mould in the bathroom between tiles and on the ceiling Breakfast poor which was 10 extra The location didn t seem great to me close to metro but nothing around as far as cafes shops restaurants bars etc, Close to metro comfortable bed decent price 
303836,Hotel Romana Residence, All air vents were dirty Water system was making loud noise each time you use it Poor breakfast Street rooms are very noisy , The location Certain vintage look 
303837,Hotel Romana Residence, The breakfast hall could have been bigger as we had to wait for breakfast on numerous occasions The pineapple was not the best , The bed was comfy the room was very nice in general 
303838,Hotel Romana Residence, The whole hotel was extremely old and run down The beds were uncomfortable and the air conditioning units were very noisy The bathrooms were old with chipped baths and the showers were inadequate The hotel was overpriced and should not be rated 4 stars ,No Positive
303839,Hotel Romana Residence, This is definitely no 4 star hotel this hotel needs a renovation Bathroom was really old Shower didn t work properly And overall it was not very clean Roomservice available for breakfast only Staff is nice is though and very friendly ,No Positive
303840,Hotel Romana Residence, Room was not serviced bed was not done and room was not cleaned Hotel is noisy we could hear people talking on rooms around Service at breakfast was just bad still waiting to ask for a coffee , People at reception were gentle and nice providing good indications to enjoy the city 
303841,Hotel Romana Residence, It doesn t have a special quirky character to make you really fall in love with the place But there you are it is supremely adequate comfortable near and a good price It s elegant enough too in style and decor , Everything you want elevator comfortable bed lots and lots of TV choice though smallish flat screen and space in the room Great location pleasant ten minute walk to Piazza Duomo or one minute walk to metro and everywhere All for a reasonable not at all stiff price Oh yes I see Booking asks about the view from the room mine overlooked the major thoroughfare Via Porta Romana which is why Romana is in the title of the hotel and I found it a joy to open the window and look out on the bustle of a great city in the morning And it was not noisy at night 
303842,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast is expensive but you are paying for the quality and range of food , Nice quite location Within walking distance of the Metro Cathedral and shopping areas Excellent breakfast Quality clean rooms 
303843,Hotel Romana Residence, Not so soft pillow made my sleeping uncomfortable bad sound isolation noise between rooms and from the street despite doubled window , Very good location Duomo di Milano 10 min walk metro station Crocetta 2 min walk underground parking garage 25 EUR day well sized room
303844,Hotel Romana Residence, the mattress of the crib was very bad and our daughter had to sleep in our bed since was completly sweated in hers , the breakfast was really good as well as the location
303845,Hotel Romana Residence, The location is too noisy and the sound isolation is extremely poor Everything looks and feels old Bathroom was not clean even you can see fungi growth on the faucet , The location was fairly ok in regards to proximity to the center Hotel parking is available for a fair fee 
303846,Hotel Romana Residence, Old rooms without renovation You could hear everything what is going on in rooms next to yours Beds are not comfortable I didn t sleep at all , Not bad location Nearly 17 min by step to get to Duomo 
303847,Hotel Romana Residence, The room got a bit hot at night i never saw any controls for reducing the room temperature I had to open the window to let in some cool fresh air but then we were woken by some street noise I didn t ask about this at reception as it was no big deal We liked the hotel and would return if in Milan again , The hotel is quite central in a nice area of Milan Its kind of old fashioned but in a nice way Our room on the 6th floor was clean and tidy the bed was firm but comfortable 
303848,Hotel Romana Residence, Hotel doesn t have an opportunity for dinner in hotel Or at least without asking no information was found , Great location No need for public transpatation if visiting Milan center and its neighborhood Hotel is classic Specificly liked window darkening solution There also was rather wide slection for breakfast It was enjoyable stay 
303849,Hotel Romana Residence, They didn t have an iron in my room which forced me to use their Laundry services The amenities need an upgrade ASAP No international plugs in the room , The proximity to the Metro Station and center of the City and the breakfast 
303850,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Hotel is excellently connected with the city s public transport from metro stop Crocetta which lies only 100m away from the structure you can get anywhere as well as straight to Central Railway Station In addition it s only 10 15mins far from Milan Cathedral I was extremely satisfied with my room which I found clean at my arrival and during my stay as well as with the staff which did its best whenever I came up with a request One of my choices in case I ll be back to Milan again 
303851,Hotel Romana Residence, There was NOTHING we didn t like, Best breakfast we ever had Room very spacious and lovely decor Staff friendly Couldn t find any thing wrong Beautiful lobby and front of hotel Would recommend this hotel Location 10 minute walk to Duomo easy to find
303852,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast is OK but not excellent There are some noice from the street and the two lifts are narrow , Beds were good Rooms reception and breakfast area are nicely decorated Tram and Metro stations are close to the hotel 
303853,Hotel Romana Residence, Lift is slow and small, Very good buffet breakfast rooms were spacious and luxurious Bathrooms very clean providing very good shower gel and shampoo Walk to Duomo takes just about 15mins
303854,Hotel Romana Residence, I was expecting a but more from a 4 star hotel I travel a lot and I can tell that for me this is at best a 3 star hotel a few scratches and holes on the walls room very noisy bathroom sink ad shower old , The location of the hotel 
303855,Hotel Romana Residence, Furniture in room was quite Spartan Breakfast not included in price of room and quite expensive 18 euros but thoroughly good and delightful , Great location close to the Duomo and La Scala Clean large room Breakfast was good but not included in price of room 
303856,Hotel Romana Residence, Hotel definitely needs refurbrishment the furniture and bathroom were full of some scratches and stains the heating was on and there was no control of temperature and I woke up in the middle of the night because of heat called to reception the person who picked up was obviously very annoyed by my call and promised someone will come in the morning to fix it but noone ever came Had to wake up and open the windows every 3 4 hours, Very good location 5 min walk to Duomo clean good value for money
303857,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Apartment layout perfect for a young family we can have the children sleeping in a separate room Interior very tasteful breakfast good and location perfect for a few days to explore Milan 
303858,Hotel Romana Residence, The recepcionist was rude and he yelld at us becouse we rang 3 times for door to open to go in the garage we thought it was electronic opening The bathroom was really big disappointment Pictures on booking show new bathroom we had really old one Look at my pictures The windows were double but you could here everything from the street The heating was turned off at 22 23 I slept in my jeans and sweater Garage is not included in the price One day 25 The wi fi is very very slow Big dislike ,No Positive
303859,Hotel Romana Residence, decor bit outdated there are only 2 tiny and old lifts 3 4 persons each and 5 or 6 floors so you have to wait a while sometimes to get to your floor, 2 metro stops from city centre 20 minutes walk to Duomo good wifi comfortable beds reasonable breakfast nice clean room
303860,Hotel Romana Residence, Too many nude paintings because the duvet linen was not one piece the duvet was not very clean , The room size and the parking discount We were granted early check in which was nice Very good underground proximity 
303861,Hotel Romana Residence, Can t think of anything bad , Very comfortable old world quality clean and helpful staff Good breakfast room Excellent for 10 minute walk only to duomo cathedral 
303862,Hotel Romana Residence, Bathroom faucet didn t work right Shower was missing waterproof liner so water got all over the room , Nice large room with separate sofa bed Great location to get to downtown tourist spots 
303863,Hotel Romana Residence, Shower could have been better few eating places within the immediate vacinity Noisy due to busy area , Good location for all transport options Good breakfast
303864,Hotel Romana Residence, No facilities for ironing when I asked for one the front desk said it was health and safety which I understand and then he said I could burn the hotel and he would be out of work or die I couldn t believe what he said not good customer service also very disorganised hotel also breakfast they serve from 7 am till 10 30am we went down at 9 45 there was hardly any breakfast left when I asked for more toast the lady went in a huff everyone in the breakfast room agreed but after I complained toast arrived so they need to sort out that there is enough breakfast if it states till 10 30 then full breakfast should be there Remember you have to pay a tax of 5 Euro per day per person this wasn t stated Also plug sockets never worked, Not much will not go to this hotel ever
303865,Hotel Romana Residence, The breakfast room was busy on one of the mornings and the food the plates and the cutlery ran out , We were looking for a hotel that was at the lower end of the upmarket range of accommodation in expensive Milan This hotel fit the bill and was exactly what we were looking for Good value for money well located comfortable and clean Would stay again 
303866,Hotel Romana Residence, Dirty toiletries hooks were even broken to hang cloths while taking shower pictures attached impolite staff elevators were too small and dirty It was absolutely a waste of money and annoyance by staying in this place Poor Wifi signals in room , Nothing really
303867,Hotel Romana Residence, equipment TV a bit bigger please and above all a more stable and faster Internet wifi But I guess this will be done they are in the middle of renovation , kind staff location is fantastic next to subway and tramway 15 min walk to Duomo and 20 min to La Brerra
303868,Hotel Romana Residence, A bit dirtily in the bathroom No bathrobes and slippers and no toothpaste and toothbrush , Average hotel at 4 stars does not fit Nearby are many places where you can eat for every budget Good location and breakfast Pleasant and obliging staff 
303869,Hotel Romana Residence, Night desk clerk was extremely nasty Breakfast had minimal choices and understaffed Had to wait for food to refill buffet no matter what time I went As well as wait for plates Very little choices,No Positive
303870,Hotel Romana Residence, The rooms are ok but the restroom was not clean Mold on the tiles in the shower Tight shower so your body pretty much touch the tiles which makes it rather gross when the tiles were nasty They switched our room and it was a little better The switchboard never answered any of our calls therefore we couldn t get anyone to help us with our luggages We had to go downstairs to get someone to help us Breakfast was less that average We have travelled to many places and stayed in different hotels and can attest this was one of the below average ones We would have carried our own luggages except the elevators only went up to the 6 th floor while our rooms were on the 7 th Definitely not a 4 star hotel At most a 2 star Don t be fooled by the pictures posted online , Location was good Lots of restaurants within walking distance 
303871,Hotel Romana Residence, Poor value for money Bathroom old fashioned and worn Breakfast average No hotel bar let alone restaurant , The location is good fairly close to the historic centre of Milan and close to a Metro station
303872,Hotel Romana Residence, Bed was hard which seems to be the norm for Italy , Location was very close to main centre and also the stop for the Hop on Hop off bus A reasonable amount of restaurants and shops around also Hotel is connected to a restaurant where we had dinner which was quite good and fairly priced Close to metro stn Taxi to airport train also close Euro 10 fare 
303873,Hotel Romana Residence, Breakfast cappuccinos seemed limited to one per person and the ones I ordered were invariably cold , Breakfast was good and with a good variety The cleanliness and tidiness of my room were excellent 
303874,Hotel Romana Residence, The room looked worn there were scratches all along the walls of the room sink and tub The toilet was stained and so was the bathmat on the tub No chair by the desk but there was a plastic chair on the opposite side of the room The clothes hangers were high up and difficult for me to use I am around 5ft tall But these are all minor things compared to the shower I had Worst shower ever When I first turned the tap on the water came out of the opening of the tub overflow plate which doesn t make sense along with whatever black gunk was in there Lucky for me the drain wasn t working all that well so I had to stand in the tub and wait for the dirty water and the floating black bits to go away before I could try again On my next try I flipped the diverter before turning the tap on There was good water pressure from the showerhead but unfortunately the showerhead wouldn t stay up on the rail I thought I d try holding the showerhead but it was incredibly difficult to use the showerhead while avoiding touching the shower curtain especially since they thoughtfully installed the shower fixture in the middle of the tub After a few awkward tries I finally figured out that if I had the water at half pressure the showerhead wouldn t slide down as fast and I would only be standing in half an inch of water instead of an inch or more The rest of the shower was laborious as I had to keep pushing the showerhead back up and repositioning the shower curtain away from me When I finally got out of shower I saw that my fight with the shower had an unintended consequence somehow there was a huge puddle in the hallway outside the bathroom I was almost in tears at this point I had been travelling since 6am the previous day have just had two action packed days and was incredibly exhausted when I checked into Hotel Romana , Slippers electric blackout blinds 
303875,Hotel Romana Residence, The cost was steep I had estou leave a day earlier and did not get a refund and the shower towel did not contain water within the tube , The room was very good spacious with a good working space
303876,Hotel Romana Residence, They charged the credit card I used for booking 13 days before check in Though it was said on the web I was still super surprised that it was not like other hotels that charged you full price on checkin day but no free cancellation allowed before 13 days which was what I understood I did not have a chance to pay with another credit card or cash on site and it brought me a big trouble There was no shower but only tub in the bathroom The furnish of bathroom is a bit old I did not like the smell of towels , Location was good close to metro walking distance to duomo The staff kindly upgraded us to suite with a nice view The bed was very comfortable 
303877,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, The positioning of the hotel in central position and providing parking at this location allowed us to enjoy the most of our time at Milan for sightseeing and feel the life of this city full of history 
303878,Hotel Romana Residence, There was a large charge for a second visit to the breakfast This should be made clear at check in it is wrong to assume that is would be evident In the States almost all breakfasts are buffets open to as many visits as desired The eggs were powered the bacon was barely cooked there was no boiling water for tea And there was a two huge TV s in the dining area there was no where to sit without having to be subjected to a TV screen , The staff was considerate and professional The options at the breakfast buffet were varied and the pastries were excellent 
303879,Hotel Romana Residence, A C was not working and they could not fix it nor did they had another room for us We opened the windows but it was very noisy We had to go to another hotel , Location is excellent Staff was very nice but they could not help us with the A C 
303880,Hotel Romana Residence, I should have appreciated a kettle in the room for the morning coffee , The cosy atmosphere the vintage decoration the efficiency of the staff the location the nice breakfast buffet 
303881,Hotel Romana Residence, I had some trouble with the door but the porter came to explain how to operate it, very close to Metro station easy walk to Duomo very spacious apartment excellent wifi
303882,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, stayed here for one night with my mother and we really enjoyed the location and the style of the hotel it was really fancy nice the staff was friendly and funny and assisted us with everything we needed no problem the room was very comfortable and clean i would stay here again if i visit Milano 
303883,Hotel Romana Residence, There were a lot of problems with the bathroom perhaps explaining why we were upgraded No water came out of bath taps plugs in basin and bidet didn t work unfilled hole in tiles loose metal plate below bath taps , We were upgraded to a junior suite which was furnished with attractive antique furniture and good quality modern art 
303884,Hotel Romana Residence, We stayed for two nights and the first night the air conditioning did not work so we did not sleep as it was over 30 degrees The second night the ac was a little better after it had been apparently fixed but still really hot when we woke up in the morning the ac had flooded the whole room and the carpet and all of our stuff was soaked We still had to pay full price as well Not happy , The hotel was beautiful and a very good location
303885,Hotel Romana Residence, It did not worth the 170 Euro for one night for a double room The elevators are small and they look like elevators of a storage facility and not a 4 star hotel The hotel may need a renovation or much more better prices , There is a tram stop and metro station direct to the hotel Renovated and very nice bathroom spacious room 
303886,Hotel Romana Residence, We had booked a triple room that was newly renovated and fantastic The double room we had also booked was ok but not as new so I think there is big variation between rooms, Staff was extremely helpful 
303887,Hotel Romana Residence,No Negative, Very good value for money Excellent breakfast which was included in our booking Only 15 minutes walk from cathedral square and main shopping area 
303888,Hotel Romana Residence, First I got a ordinary room like I asked for But it was noisy and not well maintained So I asked for one of the 12 suites and got one for additional cost The suite was very nice and comfortabele , I stayed for 3 days to visit the EXPO The suite I upgraded to was very nice Therfore and because of the excellent beakfast I enjoied my stay very much The location of this hotel is perfect
