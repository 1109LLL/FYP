477505,Barcel Milan, The door to the toilet was not possibly to close which made it uncomfortable to use the toilet 4 stars hotel must have kettle and tea in the rooms but here they give a kettle on request after few calls to the reception , Modern design reasonable price a lot of parking lots around The bed was comfortable Breakfast was ok for Italy 
477506,Barcel Milan, Living in a 23rd century architectural exercise Slippery enormous shower cubicle inside the bedroom nowhere to hang towels nowhere Cosiness degree 0 You have to give instructions to the lift before boarding yes no floor buttons inside the lift car Finding your car in the garage next morning can be a lengthy exercise too , Good breakfast polite Spanish receptionist 
477507,Barcel Milan, The basin drainage didn t work properly Overall although very modern it s quite plasticky and somehow fake environment which is not expected from a 4 star rated hotel in Europe , Modern fashionable environment spacious and relaxing 
477508,Barcel Milan, The location is a little far from the city Whilst it s not too far to walk to a train or tram the area you walk through to get there is pretty sketchy we were scared to walk through at night, The staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough to help and their English was very good The style of the hotel is bright but nice and our room was huge and very comfortable we were upgraded for free and given the choice of what floor we would prefer Breakfast was incredible the best breakfast we had in Italy by far 
477509,Barcel Milan, No iron in the room There is literally one iron located in reception area used for the hotel The food is poor at the restaurant Breakfast was horrible and served me a cold food when having dinner , It was big and modern
477510,Barcel Milan, Nothing really however it is a bit of a nuisance if you have no car but the train and tram service was good Hotel shuttle bus was very handy as long as you remembered to book early for each way trip at the times that best suited you , Didnt have breakfasts
477511,Barcel Milan, WIFI NOT WORKING NO SWIMMING POOL IN THE SPA STAFF NOT REALLY SYMPATHETIC HONNEST AND ON TIME THE FOOD AT THE BREAKFAST IS ONAU BUT FOR A FOUR STAR HOTEL IT S KIND OF OVERRATED INDUSTRIAL NOT FRESH , Comfort and cleanliness of the room shuttle bus
477512,Barcel Milan, We changed the room twice first it was not clean then the toilet flush didn t work The staff was not really cooperative Took us more then an hour to get into our room For that location parking is extra Not satisfied ,No Positive
477513,Barcel Milan, Arrived after 11pm as planned and communicated Only one person at desk 10 minute line When I get to the counter I inquire about parking it s 12 euros a day but I see a huge empty parking lot in front of the property I ask about the parking lot the receptionist tells me that it s free but car windows are routinely smashed during the night However they take no responsibility even if you pay them to park in their secluded area I park my car in the empty lot for free then queue up for check in again While I m waiting a lady in a definitely non pleased state of mind joins and then cuts the line She explains that she was sleeping and a stranger entered her room The stranger was then waiting a few meters behind with his luggage He d been assigned the lady s room The receptionist apologizes somewhat sternly and proceeds to find another room for the gentleman while making no attempt to make up for the mistake The lady goes back to her room promising to write suitable reviews I am kind of waiting to read that I finally check in and get a room I find it and enter There s nobody sleeping but there s a suitcase a backpack and a pair of sunglasses also one of the towels had been used I go back to the reception and join the long line for the third time When my turn comes the lady apologizes again wonder if she noticed a pattern there and gives me a new room This time it appears to be empty Obviously no upgrade or anything for me either The rooms look nice and spacious However they are not sound proof by any stretch of the imagination Every time someone is walking on the corridor the sound of their steps their luggage and their conversation echoes through the room The minibar had a working light but no refrigeration Beverages were at room temperature Probably not going back , The windows of my rented car weren t smashed overnight The hotel and rooms look fancy The second room I was given was clean 
477514,Barcel Milan, Location Minibar worked badly no cool drinks and some bottles were already open , Air conditioning worked very well pleasant room design comfortable bed Tips for how to get there by public transport daily ticket is 4 5 euro and it is valid on tram bus metro and S trains From Milano Centrale 1 M3 direction Comasina 6 stops till Affori FN then bus 40 direction Bonola Mn 14 stops till L go Boccioni 2 Walk to Repubilca station 10 min then take the suburban trains S5 direction Varese or S6 till Certosa station from there you can walk 20 minutes to the hotel or take 12 19 tram 2 stops From Duomo Tram 12 24 stations 50 minutes If you don t like public transport the hotel offers shuttles to different zones of the city for an extra charge you must book in advance If you use the tram you must use a passage that connects the street of the hotel to the street of the tram station Some time there are homeless people there but they are peaceful Keep in mind that you must validate the card each time you get on the bus tram an you will also need the ticket at the exit 
477515,Barcel Milan, Second time at Barcelo and second disaster experience In order parking is not present and you need to park in a near abandoned parking arrived at reception I found a very cold and not helpful receptionist once in the camera lights were not working and also air conditioning was blocked assistance came after long time and in an arrogant way pretended the problems were not there elevators are simply a nightmare you can loose ages of time before your elevator arrives check out is done by 1 maximum 2 persons with very long and annoying queue ALL IN ALL I DO NOT RECOMMEND BARCELO HOTEL NO MATTER THEY MAY HAVE AN OFFER THIS PLACE IS SIMPLY A NIGHTMARE It is useless to pretend to be 4 stars and then work unefficiently and uneffectively , NOTHING 
477516,Barcel Milan, The pool was out of order Also need to change the room cause phone air conditioner and refrigerator were not working And the location is far and not easy to reach the city all the time,No Positive
477517,Barcel Milan, Too far away from Milan centre very rude male bartenders slow service no kitchen equipment in apartment no kettle no iron or ironing board All requests were dealt with incredibly slowly , Modern hotel with elegant interior design Very helpful female reception staff
477518,Barcel Milan, The staff were a little condescending at times although it depends because others were very nice and accommodating I think they re marketed as higher scale and I guess I didn t appear like a typical client The interior decorating wasn t to my taste It is very niche but I bet if you enjoy mod inspired contemporary art you won t mind My room looked like something out of the Jetsons The veiw however is truly awful The sky deck is overlooking train lines hideous corporate buildings and what looked like abandoned warehouse buildings I suspect the area is in development and in a few years it may have more visual appeal My bed was rock solid so if you re into a firm mattress this is the place for you , The room was spacious and clean The restaurant downstairs has decent food and the prices are reasonable Although it is not ideally located it is not difficult or expensive to get to it from public transport in the city The train is a 10 minute walk from the hotel They will book a shuttle for you but you must ask in advance The wellness center was under renovation but I m sure once finished that will add value to the stay They also gave me a handy smart phone for the duration of the stay which was a surprise I offered helpful advice free international calling maps etc As wifi was hard to access without an Italian number or international texts this was helpful for getting around You delete all the data before you leave but don t lose it or you ll pay the cost of the phone 
477519,Barcel Milan, Make internet access much easy to connect to , The atmosphere was very pleasant with helpful and smiling staff I will definitely come back again and recommend Barcelo hotel for friends and family 
477520,Barcel Milan, I didnt like the hotel thing with the interior design of the rooms which have no walls , The design of the hotel Breakfast Parking although I think they must provide a better instructions for the first time we found ourselves looking for the right enter to the parking with a lot of other cars circling the hotel Great view from my room at the 19th floor
477521,Barcel Milan, the parking is not organized in a proper way for some reason the parking in the hotel does not belong to hotel but they have another location which was in some other place the parking was extremely expensive and the pay machine was not working one tourist from Switzerland was quite mad about this at the desk breakfast was not included and was offered at enormous rate per person Got the feeling that customer is being ripped off on every step of staying , hotel building is modern
477522,Barcel Milan, the elevator to get to the room you need to wait 15 min the floor in the room while walking barefoot is dirty feet black in 10s for a superior room there was a kitchen without equipment the price relation to quality is terrible in the shower there were hair from other customers the breakfest terrible the two sweaty guys which put each slice of salami with hands without any gloves they just used to scratch their head and wipe the floor blee the hotel is much worse than 2 years ago, Nothing
477523,Barcel Milan, Waiting for the elevator Sometimes it would take 30 min to finally get an elevator No room service menu in the room and even though we asked for 1 large bed we were given a room with twin beds However I would still recommend the hotel Unfortunately the swimming pool in the hotel was closed which was quite disappointing , Staff was very kind friendly and respectful they were doing a great job in making us feel good for our stay The view from the 22nd floor was wonderful would be nice to have a bar restaurant there The design of the Hotel is amazing and I like the fact that there are mirrors everywhere Continental breakfast with lots of options very tasty food and fruits 
477524,Barcel Milan, 2 out of 3 elevators were broken for all the 4 four days I was there Pool in the SPA center still in maintenance and not available The bathroom is in the room without doors only the private area is closed behind a door but the lights in the private area are connected to the same switch of the room so if you have to go in the bathroom over the night you need to turns on the light and wake up your partner or use the light of the phone with some clear uncomfortable risks , staff service breakfast and restaurant are great 
477525,Barcel Milan, Smell of refrigerator was very bad Position of the hotel not so convenient for city centre especially if travelling with public transportation , Spacious room Exactly as in the pictures In room features coffee machine music system TVs Very kind staff
477526,Barcel Milan, Room temperature was too hot we called the reception but still they couldn t control the room temperature We booked the hotel to use pool but when we went to the hotel they told us pool was closed very dissapointed and they only run one shuttle bus for 7 people so for people traveling in large groups it s a waste as the shuttle bus would always be not available, Room was very trendy and modern
477527,Barcel Milan, The bathtub was in the bedroom without a door partition Bad smells in the floor not in the apartment though, The size of the apartment was awesome Staff were very nice Free parking next to the property 
477528,Barcel Milan, The location is just bordering on inconvenient It helps that they have a shuttle service but this has limited hours And while there is a bus station that is walking distance away in principle it involves walking through a dark and scary underpass to get to it Not everyone will be happy with that At the hotel itself my biggest minus would be the absence of bath tubs The shower stall was interestingly designed but I still wish there was a bath tub Finally the elevators You would think that the design would make for more efficient shuttling of hotel guests you select your floor before entering But the absence of indicators as to which floor the lift is already at means that you have no idea when your lift will arrive Normally this would not be a problem But when there is a huge conference and lots of people are checking in or out the wait can become downright infernal I was waiting for seriously almost fifteen minutes before a lift got to me at the 19th floor because of a big convention and it didn t help not knowing what floor the lift was already at , The place itself is amazing with lively designs and innovations Very clean great service and great food 
477529,Barcel Milan, We are waiting more that 20 min to staff see us and speak with us also they charge me more 10 for town tax i should now that before i book the room was NOT CLEAN , Only the coffe in the morning
477530,Barcel Milan, Location Taxi is extremely expensive to the city and takes around 20 mins Taxi from Linate cost around 60 80 euros Shuttle from hotel takes you to the nearest metro which i would suggest people to use as taxi fares are extortionate Breakfast was ok not great Could do with more variety No iron and ironing board and no tea coffee facilities in the room which is a huge drawback especially for a business traveller , Ultra modern hotel and value for money Service is good especially the concierge Chamara went above and beyond to meet our expectations 
477531,Barcel Milan, It could be slow at the reception , Chef T Bone dinner in the restaurant was excellent star kitchen Interesting type of elevators Near to the big spa centre and cinema with nice restaurants 
477532,Barcel Milan, Our room was not cleaned properly In the room wehere our parnter stayed was dirty towel left in the room and one in front of the room Strange , Nice hotel interesting decor modern fresh Very nice and kind staff 
477533,Barcel Milan, The entrance from the garage you should replace at least the carpet on the floor , Nice design in green good location for Fiera Rho Milano free shuttle service 
477534,Barcel Milan, the only thing I didnt like was black things in bath shower, Apartment was fatastic I want to book Barcelo s hotells wherever I will go Breakfast was excelent Staff also 
477535,Barcel Milan, The location wasn t good was very isolated train or metro station are 15 20 minutes drive Far from hotel there were no good restaurant near the are or shopping center The food wasn t so good especially the pasta wasn t good , The hotel staff was very nice the room was clean very nice design and modern The room was comfortable on the view was great 
477536,Barcel Milan, The service at welcome was not so nice You dont get the feeling to be welcome The parking situation is complicated, It a nice design hotel in milano Its clean and modern The rooms are fancy 
477537,Barcel Milan, The bathrooms are weird The hotel is quite far from Milan I recommend you rent a car There is a large free parking area in front of the hotel You dont have to pay 12 a day for parking, Large rooms very clean and modern Good breakfast fresh food 
477538,Barcel Milan, Check in took a while But the receptionist apologized and was friendly Maybe the hotel is a little under staffed during peak times as even room service in the evening needed a second call But we did have a great piadina however Conclude by saying no hotel experience can be 100 perfect and things always get better with experience , The Hotel has a different charm to it a very unique design Lots of privacy with great view of the city Value for money if you get a discount 
477539,Barcel Milan, Long check in queue Entrance to the parking of the hotel is not clearly signed and the one just next to the entrance belongs to an other more expensive company , Price quality is amazing We got a free upgrade because we had to quite a bit to check in Amazing view from the top floors on a clear day 
477540,Barcel Milan, there was a probleme in the telephone i our floor i would have liked to be welcome by a valet with a trolly asking to carry my laggages specially when making a long tired trip , i like the modern chic stile of the hotel the food at the restaurant the rich breakfast
477541,Barcel Milan, You don t get much for your money and the location of the hotel is far away from the city Hotel is located right next to a motorway Lidl office buildings and train tracks so not an impressive view , Very modern stunning design friendly staff very clean 
477542,Barcel Milan, Breakfast was disappointing as the items were not being replaced quickly enough for the peak volume around 8 00am There are too many mirrors in the bedrooms giving no privacy to anyone showering poor design The fan in the toilet was not working , Beds super comfy 
477543,Barcel Milan, New furniture or cleaned in restaurents to be considered , Great room special accomodation Shower could be a bit stronger Very good price quality mix Very good breakfast for Italian standards 
477544,Barcel Milan, The room was too hot and when I asked 2 times to lower the air condition they told me we will try but without change It was like a sauna and the window can be open only little bit so no fresh air The mini bar was not cold as well , Good design nice place new hotel Service ok
477545,Barcel Milan, 1 I have booked the hotel because it is close to Fi re Milano that I was supposed to visit but it is soooooo far from the center that u feel like you are not in Milano any more And the district around is so weird that I preferred to don t go out of the hotel by myself More than that in the description it was stated that hotel is prividing free transfer to fi re Milano in reality they just bring u to the nearest metro 2 The spa One on the reasons I took Barcelo was spa The spa was not free It costs 5 per person But it was so cold inside that it was not possible to swim in the pool and then relax on the sunbed it was freezing So u can t enjoy the spa Really 3 I arrived to the hotel around 3 at around 4 I asked the reception if I can eat smth And NO The restaurant is closed till 7 and there nothing to eat in the bar 4 stars 4 I asked for the iron because I needed to iron my clothes They opened me some back room and I had to iron my staff there Among boxes and whatever In general this hotel is too expensive for what u get , Actually there is nothing outstanding in this hotel Staff was nice Design is interesting and the elevator is perfect for selfie but that s it
477546,Barcel Milan, the lighting in the rooms is terrible a bright blue light shines in the room and cant be turned off unless all the room lights are turned off No light lamp near the bed to read the bathroom is part of the room this doesn t work , The bed was comfy
477547,Barcel Milan, Location is making impossible to efficiently and comfortably visit Milan 12km from Duomo Milano Surrounding may be dangerous since there are homeless people sleeping nearby under the tunnel , Very good service Employees are polite and patient Comfortable beds 
477548,Barcel Milan, Martino receptionist who checked us in wasn t nice at all quite rude actually Room was dirty cleaning standards extremely poor and you wouldn t expect that after reading all of the reviews Shower floor and walls discussing Heated swimming pool with the dirtiest walls I ve even seen you could scratch the dirt with your finger After you walk in nothing seems to be wrong but after looking closer you ll know that the spa area isn t clean regularly Staff in general very arrogant and can t speak English what makes it worst as they would serve you different things than you have ordered of menu more expensive one Hotel ordered a taxi for us in departure and we have paid 16 extra for the same distance as day earlier plus they ve promised driver would leave us in the right place but he didn t so we had to walk another 10mins after he left and almost missed our bus for the airport Do not order room service unless they have investigated and changed all the food trays see pics , Front office manager seems to be looking after Guests and he also tried to make us happier by taking 40 off our total bill also gave us a take away breakfast even we didn t ask for it Only one receptionist out of 6 I think was nice helpful with directions and could talk fluent English male 
477549,Barcel Milan, Situated in the middle of nowhere really , The hotel was lovely The staff were friendly and helpful Rooms nice and fantastic shower The listing says free shuttle to Certosa Station and Rho Fiera Milano but we weren t offered that We were told how to walk there when I enquired at reception Bit disappointed with that bit it didn t affect our pleasant stay 
477550,Barcel Milan, Auto Ac of the room During the night it turns automatically on and it was to hot Not so good insulation Woke up some times with noise from the corridor during the night Bad Internet in the room , Friendly staff In front of the hotel there is free parking Relatively close to the center by car
477551,Barcel Milan, Shower in the middle of the room although very nice but has no closing door Sort of Aquarioum Very hot in the room even in the winter not enough air Cannot control temperature in the room , Very nice hotel new and comfortable a little far from the city but provides Shattle to the nearest Metro station Staff is very nice and helpfull 
477552,Barcel Milan, The location isn t so great BUT with the free shuttle service it is very ok at least for me cuz I left in the morning every day traveling and come back at 9 10 in the evening , Very nice hotel modern look inside and outside The room was very nice The plumbing high end not cheap Wi fi was great at least at 10 floor The sky terrace from 22 floor is amazing I recommend this hotel for the modern style and value price offer 
477553,Barcel Milan, Breakfast not included Hotel with good design but not practical Asked for board and iron and they said no in the room I was going there often but I will find alternatives from now on ,No Positive
477554,Barcel Milan, City Taxes onto overall charge I wasn t aware , Great Hotel Staff so friendly and helpful Food and Drink lovely Shuttle Bus so easy to use and availability wasn t an issue 
477555,Barcel Milan, The parking is supposed to be 12euros per day but that is the case only for the parking on the back and not in the basement parking If you enter to the basement parking from the main entrance the value is 21euros per day , The room was great and you have great view of one part of the city 
477556,Barcel Milan, Leaking fridge Our children were not allowed to use the pool Refugees sleeping closeby in a bike pedestrian tunnel, Design of the hotel Price and value for money Service from Allessandro to arrange tickets for the game at San Siro
477557,Barcel Milan, Staff were overly efficient to the point of being rude about paperwork and insensitive to keeping us waiting with small children Most of the staff were lovely especially the waiting staff but at reception the male staff were quite rude I also had to wait 30 mins for shuttle to collect me as they got the collection point wrong Swimming pool and gym were very small , Food was good plenty of healthy and veggie vegan options 
477558,Barcel Milan, wifi is slow and kind of torture register all devices every day door opening electricity activating cards were not really working Needed support 2 times in 3 days to get into the flat or get electricity work elevator system is really stupid and slow last day the main elevators were simply not working spa is small TV is not really useful around 300 italian chanels few foreign english speaking only no usb connection , modern design really comfortable king size bed Pizza and Pasta with the room service stakes in the restaurant are really tasty Transfer service is realy great to Rho Fiero Staff is really friendly with pets 
477559,Barcel Milan, Air con did not work Charged 10 euros to use a Visa card Restaurant served uncooked chicken Management were rude and tried to charge for the above Does not provide water and told no shops nearby so had to buy 500ml bottle for two euros There is a Lidl next door It is unsafe to walk to the metro Walk past homeless centre and underpass , Rooms and building are nice to look at 
477560,Barcel Milan, The neighbourhood is terrible basically the hotel is in the middle of old industrial site there are still lots of abandoned warehouses or plants near Also the railroad and the highway Not a pleasant view The hotel could compensate this with a great atmosphere and facilities but this just does not happen Because of poor management I guess Having a terrace with a view on the 22nd floor and not even providing even a seating not even fixing a broken floorboard leave alone creating a 24 hour bar which really must be there is just inexcusable Getting down to a second terrace on a 4th or so floor was even a better experience the doors only open to outside and you are left on a completely empty terrace more like a building site and have to figure out how to get back in the hotel Overall the hotel looks and feels deserted you have to go to that enormous reception hall just to find some people But the only open facility you can find is a very small bar No choice of beers even not one that you know only the hotel brand almost no food high prices not adequate to quality and service Also why did I end up exploring the hotel in the evening Basically because I was travelling with a friend and they have this designer shower and bathroom right in the middle of the room Surely the shower glass is opaque but anyway you have to step out of it directly to the room just to take a towel No hooks and not even a door to the shower And you have to travel two steps to adjust the temperature How do I know what the temperature is if I m two steps away That s just silly Also I m reflected in all the mirrors in the room while doing that And in the morning I have to brush my teeth literally within reach of my sleeping friend s face Thanks god they ve placed toilet in the separate space Can t be locked though And windows are dirty , Everything is new and clean Friendly staff 
477561,Barcel Milan, 1 Elevators are simply not working and 2 times had to walk through the stairs 2 Wireless is poor and slow speed 3 Parking is not well signalled and once inside there is no indication for pay machine and reception 4 Staff was always pretending to be helpful but due to workload and unefficiency they simply did nothing 5 Design is fancy BUT KEY THINGS ARE MISSING you cannot manouvre air conditioning from the room all lights are centralised and so on OFFER LESS THINGS BUT OFFER THEM WELL I TRAVEL SINCE 20 YEARS FOR BUSINESS OR LEISURE AND THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD , Only the style of the Hotel
477562,Barcel Milan, The hotel needs to employ more staff and provide training The front desk receptionist was overwhelmed by the number of people checking in and the wait was unacceptably long Meanwhile back of house staff were wandering around counting ceiling tiles Restaurant service was absolutely incompetent Hotel bar could be improved and stay open later for such an isolated hotel Not bad as a business hotel but would not recommend it otherwise , Rooms were large clean and comfortable 
477563,Barcel Milan, Far from town centre no easy access to public transport Parking charged separately , Good hotel if you re driving Nice modern design with a spa clean and confortable good breakfast
477564,Barcel Milan, Didn t get to use the spa facilities as there was some sort of breakdown and a bar on the rooftop terrace would be a good idea , Hotel was bright modern and although not central there is a free shuttle bus to from the local train station Very clean food is good drinks are reasonably priced too Loved the modern design of the bedroom the shower being in the middle was a bit different We had a problem with the toilet and it was repaired straight away Fresh orange juice cool water in reception area which is very welcome after a long day out Good customer service all round The hotel is close to a cinema complex which also has a few restaurants which is good if you don t want to go too far in the evening 
477565,Barcel Milan, The staff all seemed like they didn t know what they was doing everything was difficult from getting breakfast to ordering a bottle of water The location is no where near the centre and they do offer shuttle buses to the train station however they are always late and you have to book well in advance , The hotel is very stylish and clean however it s let down by the concrete hard beds with the air con that barley works
477566,Barcel Milan, We arrived at the hotel with a good impression but when we talked to the front desk staffs named Barbara and Martina we are very disappointed on their behaivior Thet are very unprofessional when talking to the clients We are also disappointed to the room they gave because of the smell inside the room Smells like a public toilet , none 
477567,Barcel Milan, I wish that the people that we re working there could pay more attention to our need of help sometimes When we asked for the trams and shuddles it was a bit difficult for them to understand what we really need help with , My visit was amazing I love the rooms and the facitilities aswell It was comfy and it was hard saying goodbye to Barcelo Milano 
477568,Barcel Milan, Very far from the city lucky we were traveling with bike still we paid 12 per night for parking in the hotel s parking , All new and very clean Good breakfast 
477569,Barcel Milan, No easy way of getting to airport apart from taxi which cost me over 200 euros in total Air conditioning in rooms not great Breakfast lacks variety and not enough staff at breakfast On the Saturday we arrived at 945 and there was no bread or eggs left However on other days no issues Location is out of town but I knew that when I booked Shuttle driver a little grumpy , Generally friendly accommodating staff especially at the main desk Nice rooms Shuttle service to local station from where u can easily get into town Paid 800 euros in total for two rooms with breakfast for 6 nights Good value 
477570,Barcel Milan, Definitely out in the middle of nowhere and rather sketchy looking area too But there is a shuttle to the subway and if you have a car you will be fine , Cool hotel we booked a suite and it was incredibly spacious although the kitchen didn t have any plates or pots and pans 
477571,Barcel Milan, The hotel is new and the hallways to parking garage is smelling very bed There is no bottle water after midnight The mosquitoes are everywhere in lobby lunch dinner room , We requested extra bed they fullfilled our request quickly Beds were also comfortable The room design is also very impressive 
477572,Barcel Milan, The staff did everything fine but they are like robots come on guys cheer up crack a smile , The way the hotel is set out is great It s not the normal boring hotel inside 
477573,Barcel Milan, We are North American and would have liked to be able to get ice cubes that s about our only complaint , Cool design hotel which the kids and parents loved 
477574,Barcel Milan, Air conditioning did not work in the room for the entire 4 day stay , Breakfast was great great selection of everything fruit coffees teas cereals coldcuts cooked breakfast omelettes pastries The design decor was also uniquely interesting Welcoming and comfortable reception area and very helpful staff 
477575,Barcel Milan, If you come alone or with your girlfriend the shower could be ok but the open space and the shower in the middle of the room isn t a good choice for those who come with their friends Also the hotel is 15 minutes walk from the train station for the center area of Millan , The breakfast was ok you are free to choose Fridge in the room Tip for those who come by car it s a free large parking close to the hotel across the street 
477576,Barcel Milan, The location was kind of far out but not too bad Definitely not in walking distance of anything , The staff was amazing Very nice and very helpful with which sites to see and helping us get from one place to another 
477577,Barcel Milan, The shower with no door offering no privacy at all The breakfast which was ok but gets packed away at 10 20am Location of hotel is 40 mins from Malpensa to Garibaldi station 12 and then 25 mins 25 by taxi to the hotel or 95 by taxi to the hotel Milan Douma is 25 from the hotel , Loved the cleanliness of the hotel and the staff especially Kriem who assisted us upon arrival with a friendly smile and gave us some tips on what to see in Milan Damien who checked us in very polite and helpful
477578,Barcel Milan, Very bad location and the parking entrance is not in the same hotel entrance In room dinning closes at 12a m The room AC is not cooling The toilette shower is not private and its open on the room when taking a shower it wets the whole room floor and makes the room foggy when taking a shower with a hot water , The room design was so cool 
477579,Barcel Milan, Nothing about the hotel other than its out of town location hence its lower price compared to central Milan I left my car there when we were staying the next night in central Milan taxi was 24 Euro to the nearest station it wasn t the nearest by a long chalk and then had a nightmare when coming back to collect the car No taxis at Centralo railway station and it s a big station and had to trudge with three cases and a backpack for over an hour in 35 degrees of sweltering heat , Funky interior decor great viewing terrace good value food and wine a great pizza for about 7 00 friendly and accommodating staff
477580,Barcel Milan,No Negative, The hotel is extremely stylish and the lay out of the rooms well planned and functional The staff was very efficient and helpful We loved every moment 
477581,Barcel Milan, Waiters breakfast and dinner were not very friendly and far from hospitable Extra beds were not arranged upon arrival parking expensive , The design of the room is really something special and conform the photos on website Reception staff friendly and helpful 
477582,Barcel Milan, We had a car so it was no big issue for us but the hotel is in an industrial area which is not very well connected to the city by public transportation , The hotel and rooms are very spacious and modern 
477583,Barcel Milan, RECEPTION STAFF NOT TO ACCOMODATIVE MAYBE TOO BUSY AND TOO FEW BUT THE CONCIERGE MADE UP FOR IT , THE AMBIENCE WAS GOOD CLEANLINESS AND HOUSEKEEPING EXCELLANT RESTAURANT FOOD AND SERVICE WAS EXCELLANT AND BUFFET BREAKFAST WAS SUMPTUOS THOUGH EGGS COULD BE SERVED AS PER CHOICE 
477584,Barcel Milan, Communication was poor prior and during stay Card was charged before we arrived although I was informed we would pay when we stay I spent loads on cabs as I was told the places I wanted to get to were too far from metros etc It turns out everything I needed to get to was served by public transport So over a hundred euros spent on travel when all I needed to spend was 12 euros over three days There is a tram that runs directly into the city a small walk from the hotel which isn t volunteered information it costs 1 50 euros , Great size room 
477585,Barcel Milan, The staff not friendly and really bad location No facility with the hotel everything you have to pay for it No complement in room like coffee or even water , The hotel looks nice insaid only
477586,Barcel Milan, The elevators can only be booked in advance and there s only three of them for a 22 floors hotel Therefore one can wait up to 15 minutes before getting an elevator The spa is only accessible in the afternoon and there is no way to use the swimming pool after 8 pm very uncomfortable Tha parking has to be paid separately 30 per night and the only cash machine was not working The food at the restaurant is fine although the restaurant itself is pretty noisy , The bed was comfortable and the room big enough 
477587,Barcel Milan, Bathroom has no hooks for towels when you are in the shower No shelf in the shower for shampoo or soap Elevators totally inefficient You might need to wait 10 15 minutes before one of the 3 elevators stops to pick you up, The hotel is quit modern and functional and particularly because of its position close to Milano Fiera it is an excellent choice for that purpose 
477588,Barcel Milan, I didnt like the location of the hotel because it is far from the centre, i liked a lot the minivan service to take you to the certosa station it is very helpfull as the hotel is a out of city center
477589,Barcel Milan, N A, Free upgrade in Executive Double room complementary daily access to the Spa area Modern design Big and cozy room Open space between bathroom and bedroom is a great concept suitable for a couple Free parking option available Easy to reach from highway 
477590,Barcel Milan, Too far from the city center which affected our traveling times The open shower with no door was not good , Very modern hotel and spacious rooms Clean and neat 
477591,Barcel Milan, Staff impossible incorrect info on facilities no shuttle to EXPO on a small car for 6 people every 30 mins Pool closed till noon No bathrobe in room no shower cap in room left luggage at check in and 30 mins to find it on return Very rude staff at desk particularly the large lady with glasses eating a pizza in her office at the back of reception at 11 pm as I tried to get my bag , Colours in bedroom
477592,Barcel Milan, The smell of air freshener in the room was horrendous so strong you could almost taste it It seems like they spray it all over the curtains Also the toilet door is a sliding door without a handle or a lock and it wouldn t stay closed just slid open every time I tried to close it , Very close to the Expo
477593,Barcel Milan, Ridiculous shuttle service Small van that doesn t run often enough so it s impossible to use this service Really under staffed , Nice modern hotel 
477594,Barcel Milan, We had mold growing in our shower the air conditioner didn t work They switched our room finally after they said they were completely booked f which was a lie because they showed me 5 vacant rooms before we moved out of our moldy one Never were greeted when we arrived to the hotel , The design 
477595,Barcel Milan, Biggest disappointment was the restaurant atmosphere with terrible echoing acoustics and kids running all over from the adjacent kids club with no gate The modern decor became a playground for them and we were surrounded by chaos and forgotten by servers our entire meal We left early Food was good but atmosphere felt as we were In a mall food court by the kids play area Also there is an amazing moden looking jacuzzi area that is deserted since only spa clients can use But it was pointless because they don t keep the water warm and the sauna didn t work The treatment in the spa was so so and when the amenities aren t in working order the spa treatment was less of a value Not too convenient to downtown Milan or train from airport without taxis or longer train rides involved , This room was fun memorable and different The desk was busy but the service was nice The shuttle driver to the expo was vety nice but make your reservation ahead for that service 
477596,Barcel Milan, Slow service at the reception We would wait for ages for any kind of assistance Lifts broke down very often during our stay so it would take 10min just to get out of the hotel , Very pretty hotel
477597,Barcel Milan, Not enough staff on bar or restaurant in evening waiting 30 mins for a cocktail whilst stood at the bar and one member of staff dirty glasses not cleaned away from outside by following morning leathal floor boards on viewing terrace very dangerous , Contemporary design of main areas and rooms viewing terrace on 22nd floor amazing
477598,Barcel Milan, Poor wifi connection very unstable connections dropping off on constantly and requires re log in all the time It is highly frustrated when we r trying to book our train tickets and other hotels online I can t stop swearing of the stupid connections Poor business centre facility unhelpful staff the printer was broken in the business center and we can not print the train tickets and hotel bookings ourselves have to send all bookings to the concierge to get them printed people on the front desk are not helpful and we have to wait for nearly an hour to get things sorted which would only takes 5 minutes if the printer is good Poor shuttle services to world expo The hotel provides free shuttle bus to the milan world expo but we could never catch the bus back to the hotel partially due to the 1st day the staff informed us about a wrong pick up address and the 2nd day the poor organisation of world expo Italian people tends to make everything unnecessarily complicated especially their transportation system Poor value for money for the amount of money we paid we r expecting much better service yet we found that we r only dreaming Wil not recommend this hotel to anyone unfortunately , We were attracted by the architecture design of the building and its proximity location to milan world expo yet are disappointed when we left the hotel 
477599,Barcel Milan, No public transport nearby to the center of Milano the hotel is located in an industrial zone Old furbishment in the room Dirty towels Rooms not ready at check in time 14 00, Location next to Expo Milano ok 
477600,Barcel Milan, Location is only really useful if you are attending the Expo Milano even then Taxis still cost between 10 20 Euro even though it is less than 1 KM away Staff appear somewhat experienced and trying to have breakfast at the bar was a truly Monti Python experience Although breakfast was good evening meals at the hotel restaurant even pasta is not recommended, Great design rooms are a good size Breakfast also has a good variety
