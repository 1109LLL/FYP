204782,Commodore Hotel, The room was small The carpets a bit shabby No bar You had to pay extra for breakfast biggest complaint is after using booking com for 12 years this is the first time we have ever had to give a 50 pound deposit When we settled the next morning it should have been deducted from the bill and it wasn t Will have to complain to booking com Disgraceful , The location is very good for Hyde park Oxford street and public transport The breakfast was good nice selecion The bed was comfortable 
204783,Commodore Hotel, Unfortunately we were on the ground floor right next to a slamming door this was slamming constant from around 6am onwards and you could hear people from above but I always travel with earplugs would request a better room location next time, Rooms were small but has everything you need plus air con was an added much needed comfort
204784,Commodore Hotel, The rooms and corridors need seriously updating there were stains on the carpets and they were also threadbare patched up plaster on walls taps loose in the bathroom towel warmer was chipped off and rusting and air conditioner did not work very poor for a very hot night when we d spent 170 for the room for one night Not good enough , The location was close to Hyde park so ideal for the event that we attended

204787,Commodore Hotel, The hotel is now very worn and old not in a good way I used to stay here a few years ago and quite liked it but problems with bookings meant i switched to other properties when in London the place feels disorganised my booking had been mixed up and I couldn t get the room i had booked I was given another room which already had other peoples luggage in it Staff did not seem to understand why such things are annoying When I eventually spoke to the manager he was very good and promised to rectify things for future trips but there was no practical solution offered I did get the suite I had booked on a my second night but my 2nd evening was busy with work and I only got to use it for 6 hours before checking out for the airport All in all very disappointing ,No Positive
204788,Commodore Hotel, The walls were paper thin and we could hear the Neighbours talking Also to close the room doors people really needed to slam the door which was very annoying after 9pm having the room shake during this process wasn t fun , The location was perfect for Hyde Park Just a two minute walk 
204789,Commodore Hotel, Decour was very dated and in need of a good paint as paint was peeling in the hallway and bedroom Bed wasn t very comfortable , Close to Hyde park walking distance of everything we wanted to do 
204790,Commodore Hotel, There is no bar or restaurant and limited room service but there is plenty of places 1 1 2 blocks away , This hotel is comprised of a variety of townhomes with an assortment of hotel rooms and apartments The rooms are period with old style dark wood brocade fabric Victorian furniture but have modern bathrooms TVs wif etc The apartments are huge and appointed to a modern finish The hotel is on a quiet cul de sac and is set back from the main road Bayswater It is very quiet and right next to Hyde Park Lancaster Gate tube station is currently closed but Bayswater is a short walk and Paddington is just 10 minutes I really like this place 
204791,Commodore Hotel, Let me start by saying I booked months ago and am now 33 weeks pregnant Asked specifically for a twin room on either floor When I arrived at the hotel on Friday 30th June the reception was frozey the receptionist wouldn t make eye contact no how are you no welcome just can I have your credit card with no explanationation on what for I asked and eventfully she said to take full payment no option to pay with another card just hurry up and hand over the card I paid the amount in full put my card away and then was asked for it again for a 100 security deposit which would be released in 5 working days The lady receptionist literally couldn t care less that I was struggling with bags and having to rumble around for this card I was told we had been upgraded into an apartment with no option to stay in the hotel I booked the hotel wanting a twin room as I am up and down all night and this is not fair on my husband We were lend to this apartment 41 5mins walk down the road apparently No help with bags nothing just running after the porter We get to this apartment with 2 guys sitting on the step smoking and drunk opened the door to be told you have 4 flights of stairs at this point I had enough I said you are joking why can I not be put into the hotel I was told because they had over booked and I had no option Porter started to climb the stairs and I said will you help please He tutted and took my bags I struggled with the stairs this is way too much for me personally The apartment was dated smelt of musk and dirty The sofa cushions with covered in a white liquid I dare ask The fridge stunk of old meat The sofa bed had no duvet for my poor husband The shower room had a white mildew in the corner My main bedroom was fine the bed was small but ok The bathroom was dirty again full of hair and marks I called the reception to be told that no management worked the weekend and to email the issues I did this Friday no answer as , No much really had aircon and the double bed wasn t awful 
204792,Commodore Hotel, It was very noisy at night the constant creaking of the property kept us up The bed was incredibly uncomfortable Probably one of the worst night sleeps ive had and i can normally sleep through anyghing ,No Positive
204793,Commodore Hotel, The check in staff were terrible we waited an hour after the check in time and one of our rooms still wasn t ready when we complained about the time it had taken we were told it was our fault for changing from a room we hadn t even booked in the first place No one seemed to have a clue what they were doing Then after waiting all that time we were finally told we could get into one of the rooms or could leave our bags behind the desk for later Terrible service unfortunately as the hotel was nice , The bed was comfortable and room very clean
204794,Commodore Hotel, Upgraded to appartment had to check out after first night which messed up our plans as was told couldn t stay in same room for full 2 days Also no bedding provided for sofa bed for second person so cold and uncomfortable sleep On return to the hotel at midnight put back in same room appartment had no been cleaned no coffee replenished Staff very unhelpful Not the service I expected for 315 for 2 nights, Room was not available so upgraded to appartment that was lovely for the first day
204795,Commodore Hotel, Terrible room in the basement Minimal natural light Felt like we slept in a cleaners cupboard The beds were on wheels so every time you lay down you moved half a metre across the room The bathroom was tiny to sit on the toilet meant you had one leg in the shower Not impressed ,No Positive
204796,Commodore Hotel, Entrance to the room was awkward could hardly get in with big suitcase Closet for clothing also contained the mini fridge which when closed became warm My suits felt like they had been in a hot air dryer Three consecutive nights but each with a different price night 2 10 Pound night 3 40 Pound remarkable , I was upgraded to a double room That room had a nice balcony so I could even sit outside Bathroom was spacious for this type of hotel in London 
204797,Commodore Hotel, The room was incredibly small not like the photos no lift no bar shower room extremely small could hardly shut the door when using the toilet the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in for the money extremely disappointing I won t be coming back , It s location 
204798,Commodore Hotel, The carpets in our room were in need of a good clean the carpets and floorboards throughout the second floor should be replaced due to the uneven and creaking sounds when walking to the lift the walls needed redecorating the hotel was advertised as a 4 it is definitely not I would not give it a 2 we were also asked to pay a 50 deposit for the mini bar which did not have any alcohol in at all , The front of the building The shower in our room
204799,Commodore Hotel, The room provided was damp and smelled musty The carpet was beyond worn and looked filthy I did not witness renovations to these accommodations as stated by the property manager online from a May post , The location was great
204800,Commodore Hotel, The staff are very unfriendly The rooms are dirty and extremely warn The rooms look nothing like the pictures on the internet which is very deceiving , There is a tube station close to the hotel 
204801,Commodore Hotel, It could have been cleaner , Only a couple minutes walk to several busses and trains Walking distance to restaurants grocery stores and a pharmacy 
204802,Commodore Hotel, The facilities are very outdated For a four star hotel I expected it to be in better shape The floors are in serious need of replacement The wifi wasn t very strong but worked okay At first we were in a basement room that has a dead cockroach and were moved upstairs to a much nicer room Though again the floors were not great and came off in your socks Also the maids did not refill all items each day or take away dirty dishes ,No Positive
204803,Commodore Hotel, When the aircon didn t work and I was given a room in the basement It looks fancier but it s not a room I would choose to sleep in , The room on the 7th floor even though I had to lug my luggage up one floor Wish the aircon works though 
204804,Commodore Hotel, Having to pay a deposit was abit much if a deposit was needed it should be paid back on departure of the hotel , The suite was beautiful I loved the old Victorian style 
204805,Commodore Hotel, this hotel is not 4 star the carpet in bedroom was thread bare and the room very small paintwork chipped and in need clean hall way outside room was dirty and although it had patio door onto roof top this was dirty and we had duck nesting in plant pot on the patio,No Positive

204807,Commodore Hotel, The location is a bit hard to find without navigation The fitness center was old and dingy mold smell and I would never use it , Last minute booking Room was adequate Good location across from Hyde park Quiet neighborhood Friendly staff 
204808,Commodore Hotel, A few afternoons were very warm in the room and when there was a breeze it was comfortable However on a couple of days it was quite warm but the A C did not work It appeared that the units were on a timer since they did not function during certain parts of the afternoon the thermostat was locked out but the fan still worked This occurred in each of the rooms in which we stayed We did bring this to the attention of the front desk the first day it occurred but they were not able to adjust the thermostat either It did work later during the following afternoon , The staff were very helpful and breakfast was very good Location was close enough to transportation restaurants and Hyde Park and a shirt walk to Kensington Palace We stayed here at the start of our UK vacation then returned at the end Our room for the second part of our stay in London was newer with more room than the one during the first part of our stay The rooms were very clean and the lighting was satisfactory 
204809,Commodore Hotel, We were given the most dreadful room at the top of the hotel outside the laundry cupboard devoid of any decorative features or comfort It felt like the servants quarters in a town house Having stayed here several times before I know there are nicer rooms so we complained and were allocated another room but it was pretty basic The glamour of the entrance hall certainly doesn t run through the hotel The carpet outside our room was totally threadbare The electricity kept cutting out There is a line between shabby chic and downright scruffy and I m afraid that whilst this hotel used to be the former it has become the latter , The entrance hall and the location The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff particularly when there was a problem 
204810,Commodore Hotel, I didnt like anything about this hotel complete disappoinent the room the hotel and all the facility was not anything like the information online I tried to book other places despite the fact that i have already paid for the hotel as i was let down badly but unfortunatley it was too late to find any other hotels I dont know how this hotel got 4 star They only deservd 1 star , I hated every single second in there 
204811,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Quiet neighborhood and very safe too Less than2 minute walk to the Kensington gardens and the tube I love the Kensington garden Hyde park We walked thru the park to go to Kensington About 10 15 minute walk to Paddington station which has the express train to Heathrow Queensway is nearby also it has a variety of restaurants ie Persian Chinese Indian etc We went to Little Persia restaurant and the atmosphere and food were great London is great place for history buffs Victoria and Albert museum was free We didn t get the chance to go to other neighboring museums due to time 
204812,Commodore Hotel, Extremely tiny chambers Extremely narrow corridor to access the rooms The furniture and design is from pre Victorian era , Excellent location close to Hyde Park Near to bus metro and railway stations The Soho is under one hour walking distance Effective countermeasures during terrorist attack locking main doors 
204813,Commodore Hotel, Got a room in the basement It smelled bad I believe due to the humidity and lack of light Matress was horrible Found a big bug on the floor We were moved to a better room after a complaint Room was way better ,No Positive
204814,Commodore Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work in either room they put me in Got handed off to the next shift and nothing was fixed while we were out and about all day They gave me a small desk fan to compensate never got below about 75 degrees in the room Tiny bathroom about an 8 min walk to Queensway Sub stop Leicester Gate sub stop is closed through July 2017 Not a 4 star experience , Friendly staff
204815,Commodore Hotel, I had requested an early check in because we were flying in from San Francisco arriving at 8a they seemed annoyed at my question which was dissapointing even so it was overall a great stay I would book it again , The location was perfect a nice quiet neighborhood 1 block from Hyde Park the Italian Garden The hotel was very clean the staff was kind 
204816,Commodore Hotel, A couple of the gentleman at the front desk would benefit from customer service training , The terrace was the highlight We enjoyed breakfast on the terrace It was private and the weather was perfect Marsella was a delight And very helpful

204818,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, We had done a last moment checkin as our flight got cancelled The rooms are spacious perfect to stay with children Evertthing is close by so a perfect location and at very decent price The staff is good and helpful 
204819,Commodore Hotel, The number of stairs no known when booked 99 Staff were very helpful in offering an alternative however the apartment made up for the climb We would go again and stay in the same apartment , Location 
204820,Commodore Hotel, The AC didn t work for the first day discourteous staff and receptionists Didn t match with our rest of the booking com experience at all during this Europe tour It sucked , Awful experience 
204821,Commodore Hotel, The room was in need of refurbishment and re decorating there were many chips in the kitchen sink etc and lots of noise coming from the building next door ,No Positive
204822,Commodore Hotel, A deposit for the mini bar excuse me this is 2017 In addition this was not refunded to my account upon check out despite reassurances that it would be I do not like staff who lie This is totally unacceptable I still incur charges for this The room was pathetically small My wife and I had to exit the bedroom to allow the other to move around No doubt a necessary but stupidly located fire door within the room itself Requested to give my ID document so a copy could be made This practice must stop It is not a requirement and I have a letter from the Home Office to the effect Wooden floors and elephants in the room above did not allow a good rest Air conditioning did not work properly and the room was stifling , Location was superb in all respects
204823,Commodore Hotel, People on top of us kept walking and it was too noisy all the time sling should have noise prove and solid it was squeaking all the time when people were walking Another think when we came to the hotel after the night out there was Asian Indian looking guy standing outside for smoking right at the entrance of the door with his very ugly night short and half naked it wasn t very pleasant when you have you family with you especially being as Muslim I was very embarrassed to my wife ,No Positive
204824,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Although the hotel is situated in quite the center of London it is very quet area Not far from both undergrounds and bus stop Service minded and helpful staff The room and its facilities function well but they are kind of old Generally we had a lovely stay and surely will stay here again 
204825,Commodore Hotel, Asked for staff to organise a taxi to take us to Paddington Station A non taxi car pulled up and the driver took us to the station and charged us ten pound It would have cost 6 pound in a taxi , Old and Quirky Hotel in a great location 2 min walk to Hyde Park
204826,Commodore Hotel, The bed was like a rock Shower and bathroom was leaking Carpet in rooms and hallways needs to be updated , Staff was excellent Very helpful and friendly 
204827,Commodore Hotel, The first room we were given was very outdated there was a crack in the window and a frame covering a hole in the wall The shower was in a bathtub that was a death trap to get into they had installed a wall along the side to prevent water from getting out and you had to climb in through the slanted back part of the tub Surprised nobody has been injured yet The sink also lacked running hot water However when we shared our concerns with the hotel staff they immediately offered to move us to a more updated room , Hotel is in an excellent and charming area of London very close to Tube and bus stations One thing to note is the closest Tube station Lancaster Gate is closed until July Not a problem though as the buses run straight to the other stations otherwise it is a very short walk Hotel staff were very accommodating with our requests Directly across the street from a historic church and a two minute walk to Hyde Park 15 minutes to Albert Memorial or Kensington Palace 
204828,Commodore Hotel, Everything Extremely run down rooms windows that don t lock but are easy to open with one finger I didn t like the fact that they charged me 10 hour for my room that was already ready A strange man entered my room with a key whole I was sleeping and the hotel had no explanation but that I should think nothing of it I was nervous to sleep both nights I was there To top it off the front desk man had horrendous body odour I will never go back , The lobby 
204829,Commodore Hotel, Not like four star Just like one or zore No poor No poor No poor But I saw they have the poor on booking They are liar No worth the price , Nothing
204830,Commodore Hotel, Too small and the facility old No worth the price I ll not choose the this hotel again It not like a four star Just worth one or zero No poor The big reason I choose this hotel is that I saw the poor in booking But they don t have don t have don t have , Nothing
204831,Commodore Hotel, Room was tiny toilet was downstairs and bathroom upstairs No lift to our room, Location is perfect for those who want a central base from which to explore London The outside is beautiful but the rooms are pretty old and dated It s not expensive though 
204832,Commodore Hotel, Perhaps cost of breakfast which we did not partake in as it seemed a little pricey , Staff excellent very helpful and accommodating Location for where we wanted to go perfect facilities and cleanliness first class would definitely return 
204833,Commodore Hotel, There was a restaurant on site but options very limited and most were Indian dishes which is not great if you re not a fan of Indian food There are restaurants nearby however Rooms are quite small but the hotel was pleasant fine for our 2 night stay , Good location Right across the road from Hyde Park and walking distance to transport Walking distance to a few restaurants and pubs Good wifi and coffee making facilities in the room Clean and tidy 
204834,Commodore Hotel, I was given a room at the basement which was too noisy I was told that another room would be available for me the following day but this never happened The wi fi signal was extremely poor Overall during my stay I did not feel like staying in a 4 star hotel and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone Utter disappointment and a waste of money , Excellent location 
204835,Commodore Hotel, Pity there is no bar , It s a very well appointed hotel with style I was upgraded to a suite which was sensational Best room I ve stayed in London for a long time 
204836,Commodore Hotel, They are doing up the downstairs and could do with continuing the up grade but was quiet good anyway, Location is Excellent and the area very nice and safe Would go back again
204837,Commodore Hotel, The welcome from the receptionist could have been a little warmer there seemed too little staff and although we were the only guests checking in at that time she appeared really stressed There was no explanation about the breakfast options no bar available to have a drink and no information available with regards to the local area , On our arrival we were rather impressed by the entrance but once inside our first thought was that the hotel could really do with some TLC Checking in was a little difficult due to a little language barrier but we were very pleased as we had requested a room with some outside space and we got exactly that yes it was only a little terrace and you had to go through a large window to get there but we had asked for outside space and we got it Our room was rather grand in fact it was huge and on two levels but it was very dated rather dusty and the mattress was so lumpy 
204838,Commodore Hotel, There was a refurbishment going on at this hotel that wasn t advertised we couldn t even get access due to ladders the hotel needs a lot of work Our room was tiny no where to put our suitcase without blocking the door poor d cor light was broken tap in bathroom was broken and bathroom generally poor Single duvet in double duvet cover and bed not even made well polyester pillows rubbish and no extras supplied were supposed to stay 2 nights but checked out after one and didn t get a refund even though we alerted them soon after checking in 100 a night absolute rubbish value for money better off checking into a premier inn ,No Positive
204839,Commodore Hotel, Staff were a bit offstandish and even though I chose to pay at the hotel on the Saturday the hotel had pre authorised the money since Monday When I got to the hotel they pre authorised another 50 in case of damages and mini bar use This money was also held for several more days after we checked out Although the staff s defence was that it was made clear before we booked it was not I have never encountered this at a hotel before and disliked it very much Also it was not up to the standard you would expect from a 4 star hotel , Good location
204840,Commodore Hotel, VERY POOR ROOMS NEED MAJOTR RE FIT CARPET WHAT CARPET THREAD BARE BATHROOM VERY VERY POOR NEEDS MONEY SPENDING BIG TIME ON ROOMS THEY WERE CLEAN,No Positive
204841,Commodore Hotel, Very basic room with duct tape holding the carpet down Asked for breakfast to be sent to in the morning at the front desk the previous evening which the receptionist noted down We waited the next day only to be told we should have put a card on our door We called down for ice to have a drink before we went out and having waited over 20 minutes we called down to cancel as we were leaving Hair dryer in the room didn t work so a new one was sent up by the plug on it was broken Called down again and the receptionist said their was nothing he could do as that was the only spare I asked if he could get one from another room and he couldn t Eventually an electrician was sent up to fix the plug The receptionist seemed as if I was asking a lot of him and as if I were making him go out of his way for something which you would expect to be provided in a hotel room Not all the staff were bad and most were helpful and friendly but overall with my experience I would not go back You can get a better room and better service at other hotels for the same price , Five minutes walk to Oxford Street Good location for shopping 
204842,Commodore Hotel, Internet was very unreliable in the apartment area Most of the staff were very accommodating However there was one receptionist who was very unhelpful impolite He seemed unhappy to deal with customers inquiries The nearest train station Lancaster was unfortunately closed for renovation The Queensway station is about a 10 min walk from the hotel which can be a chore if you re traveling with heavy luggage , The neighborhood was quiet upscale The rooms are somewhat spacious elegantly decorated It s conveniently located near Queensway train station Hyde park is just a stone s throw away 
204843,Commodore Hotel, We didn t have breakfast so could not comment Nothing to dislike , A quiet and peaceful hotel tucked away from the madness of London Easy to access by bus The bed was big and very comfortable Yes it could do with an update but all of the facilities were there and very serviceable What would this country do without the EU people who come to work here and provide us with such excellent customer service The receptionists were a credit to the hotel 
204844,Commodore Hotel, Hotel while very clean is a little bit dated could do with a good overhaul Carpets were a bit old tatty Bathroom was very small we were upgraded to an executive room I hate to think how small the standard rooms are as ours was quite tight , Hotel is in a great location the bus service was great too
204845,Commodore Hotel, On arrival we were told that there was a problem with rooms they did not have the 2 rooms that we had booked I see from Tripadvisor that this has happened to others We were given the option of 3 of us sharing a room not suitable or an upgrade to an apartment in Kensington As it was London marathon weekend we had little option than accept the apartment offered The apartment was very basic smelly noisy We were travelling with a visitor from Switzerland felt very embarrassed annoyed to have to stay in these apartments Would never book the Commodore again We were also charged a 100 room deposit , Nothing
204846,Commodore Hotel, 1 The room The carpet is about to come off The cabinet door cannot be opened fully because the bed was blocking it so the drawers could not even be opened 2 The creaky ceilings IT WAS SO LOUD On the very first night of my 15 nights every time the guests in the room above mine walked my ceiling would creak so loudly I reported this to reception when I got back from class the next day they said Let me check The guests in that room just checked out To which I replied I m staying for 15 nights you can t assure me that you won t have guests check into that room can you To which he smugly replied We can t transfer you now You can try tomorrow morning if we have an available room NO APOLOGY And since I was taking short courses my entire stay I didn t have time to unpack and repack to move rooms It was horrible every single night 3 The unaccommodating staff Aside from what I said in number 2 I left a denim shopping bag in the room along with some other things I m willing to let go of and on the day I checked out I called them to say I m coming back for it when I get picked up by airport transport They said they ll check but when I went back the concierge just said dismissively that there s nothing I insisted that they have someone check and so he took a binder and said housekeeping reports all items left behind here and there s nothing in your room I can understand if they just don t keep things left behind but THEY COULD SAY IT POLITELY LIKE THEY ACTUALLY CARE BECAUSE I PAID 95 GBP PER NIGHT FOR 15 NIGHTS 4 The pathetic service They have old carpet on the narrow corridors leading to the rooms It s so difficult to pull luggage on it and when I was led to my room I wasn t even offered help with my 2 pieces of luggage which I was clearly having difficulty with despite them being Rimowa with 4 wheels 5 The lack of linens , The location is safe and near one of Hyde Park s entrances There are a few bus stops within a minute s walk The subway station is close but it was closed during my entire stay and will be until July 2017 
204847,Commodore Hotel, Old building with poor maintenance Elevator super small Sofa bed is nod bed just sofa ok for a child no for a teenager or adult Check in and check out a nightmare We didn t get the room we paid for No worries to try to solve the problem at all Traveling with children the guy at the reception pretend to fit everyone in a king size bed During the check out we were asked if we had used the mini bar and even when we said no we were charged with mini bar Again no worries to verify the mistake when finally decided to check and confirm the mistake no chance we can get the money back for being a weekend , Location is great for public transport train bus or underground Plenty offer or great restaurants around Good breakfast at the hotel
204848,Commodore Hotel, The furniture and carpets are really old The carpet has lost all it s colours since it s been fitted tens of years ago The check out is too early 11 00 and when we asked the receptionist if we could leave luggage in the hotel so we don t carry it all day with us before catching a train this was declined saying that there is no space for our luggage , The location 
204849,Commodore Hotel, No hot water for 3 nights and money was taken from my account without any notice or a final bill breakdown I can t for the life of me work out why we have been charged what we have I expected a decent demonstration of goodwill in terms of a refund for our dreadful experience but none has been forthcoming so far booking com are looking into it but it s taking ages to get a resolution Staff were far from friendly and courteous and there seemed to be a language barrier Breakfast was mediocre at best coffee awful and orange juice was freshly squeezed from a carton of Asda Value orange juice I could go on but I really do not want to waste my time on this any more dreadful experience very poorly handled not a 4 experience , Our suite looked very lovely BUT
204850,Commodore Hotel, The bed was awful Room freezing cold due to heating not working The toilet blocked several times Tv was tiny and I could hear every word from the room next door To top it off the iron which must be about 15 years old ruined the shirt my boyfriend had just purchased for the evening due to the dirt inside , The location
204851,Commodore Hotel, Air conditioning was noisy and balcony door didn t lock without a key which we weren t allowed to have, The cleaning service was good towels and toiletries were all provided
204852,Commodore Hotel, Room offered in a poorly unready state with used towels everywhere We have been relocated 3 times during stay without apology Bed sheets feel dirty with yellow stains Staff barely speaks and understands English , Gym room Nice showers
204853,Commodore Hotel, The property was extremely dated The bedroom was horrendous Curtains broken carpet dirty and bathroom wasn t cleaned The furniture was broken and dated We tried to check in 1 30 but room not available We went back at 7 to be told they didn t have a double room and would upgrade us but because I refused to pay the extra 50 deposit making it 100 00 they seemed to find me this horrid room I d asked for a room with a view as my 11 year son had never visited London before OMG it was of back buildings So so disappointed I cannot tell you PLEASE read all reviews though I had and thought I m sure itl be ok but how wrong was I I truely recommend not going there , Front of building that s it
204854,Commodore Hotel, The cleaner must have come into the room 4 or 5 times on leaving day from half 8 til 10am to check if we were ready to go yet check out was meant to be at 11 Felt very rushed so she let the hotel down a bit , The bathroom was very spacious excellent when you have little kids The bed was very comfy too the best I ve been on
204855,Commodore Hotel, Room service for food is not 24 7 nothing really to dislike, Excellent location my room was upgraded to a nice one friendly and helpful staff good breakfast
204856,Commodore Hotel, Beds were a bit firm and the room was small Decor was jaded , The location was ideal as London was on the doorstop A bit quirky Victorian themed room okay if you like that sort of thing 
204857,Commodore Hotel, Nothing much negative The reception process seems to treat everyone like a potential criminal coying photo ID not simply checking it against the registration form large deposit taken on a credit card in case you use hotel services Not really very welcoming and not a one off as it was the same the last time I stayed Other places do the same thing but they are much more tactful One bedside lamp didn t work at all the other had loose wiring and flickered and flashed off if moved The hot water took a long time arrive at the taps , Stayed here before booked a great value suite with four poster bed and balconies two balconies Very comfy very large bed Relatively quiet location but close to buses and Underground Well placed for the Albetr Hall less than 15 minutes walk away across the park 
204858,Commodore Hotel, The bed was a little too firm for our liking but not totally uncomfortable , The hotel location is just a couple of minutes walk from Hyde Park and several bars and restaurants The hotel room we stayed in was bigger than I d anticipated Townhouse and the decor was beautiful It was also very quiet inside and outside of the hotel which was great and unexpected due to the centrality of London The staff were really friendly polite and helpful The 11am checkout time was also very useful great for a lie in Such a lovely hotel to stay in 
204859,Commodore Hotel, The staff at the reception was nasty and not helpful at all The room we ve been given that meant to be double was smaller than a single room at trvelodge when we requested bigger room the staff member became verbally aggressive The room was dirty hair in the sink stains on the carpet dirty towels carpet not hoovered stains on the pillowcase feedback form with negative opinion left from previous guest Not happy at all DO NOT recommend this hotel to anybody even to enemy , Location was not bad Young girl who might have been Polish seemed to be nice friendly and helpful although the food was not good 
204860,Commodore Hotel, The lift very small for big people The bathroom there should be a drainage on the floor where the sink is , The lobby very space with comfortable fire place and paintings with other decorations 
204861,Commodore Hotel, Noisy room due to most probably plumbing issues We knew every time the neighbour in the next room visited his her bathroom Our bathroom extremely small Uncomfortable for two people ,No Positive
204862,Commodore Hotel, I don t know if room service for food was not available at the time I arrived as the menu actually looked really good with some lovely dishes I was given a menu from a local take out place it was pizza and pasta and the usual high carbs what I term as terrible food I m into healthy eating and gluten free if possible so I was struggling to get something reasonably healthy , the room was quiet without that horrible air con that is so loud you are on a jumbo jet this is the first hotel in a long time that I actually managed to sleep all night 
204863,Commodore Hotel, I really didn t like the repetitive knocking at the door every morning The walls are thin so you can hear wats going on in the next room The floor also squeaks and cracks so along with thin floorplan it sounds like there s always a commotion goin on makes it hard to get a peaceful not and morning , I really liked the king size comfortable bed and the spacious shower
204864,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location to Hyde Park and into the city The rooms were very clean large and had everything you needed The staff were very friendly and helpful 
204865,Commodore Hotel, First room had threadbare carpet and stained sheets Replacement room was much better but the hotel badly needs an overall update with new carpets for all rooms Reception staff were unfriendly and not surprised at complaints , beautiful building and entrance foyer
204866,Commodore Hotel, The decoration and carpets were worn and tired looking Hotel would look much better with this issue addressed, The staff were friendly and helpful The bathroom in bedroom was newly refurbished 
204867,Commodore Hotel, There was a problem with the booking We had paid for a breakfast on booking com but the people at the hotel refused to honour it despite being shown the email They tried to make us pay for it and held us up by insisting on discussion it Really this was between the hotel and the booking company if they don t want to use a booking company they shouldn t do it Or they should fulfill obligations without argument It certainly was not our problem , The room was clean and comfortable
204868,Commodore Hotel, Thw shower although quiet powerful could not be could be hung on the wall fixture because the fixture was broken Alsi the shower curtain was very flimsy and stuck ti you while you wete showering, A pleasant and comfortable stay at a quiet hotel 
204869,Commodore Hotel, On arrival we were allocated a top floor apartment whilst the apartment was nice there had been a bed made up in the lounge area that we didn t require We asked if we could put the bed away and we re told that it was broken The bed took up all of the lounge defeating the object of staying in an apartment keeping the lounge and bedrooms separate Secondly and most importantly the locks on the windows of the bedrooms were broken we were 6 floors up and there was a sheer drop to the ground The windows opened up fully and with ease and as we have small children we asked if the locks could be fixed or if we could move to another apartment We were told the locks couldn t be fixed that day and they had no more apartments left so we were moved to what they described as a family suite The suite was in fact a small room on the 7th floor with 2 beds in it it was old dated beyond hot and extremely noisy The bathroom was disgusting this is apparently a 4 hotel We explained that we were not happy and that we had paid for an apartment and that s what we wanted The manager assured us he would do his best to sort out an alternative apartment the following day but we would have to stay in the family suite the first night We were told we would have to pack all our belongings up for a third time and that we would be moved the next day We went off in to London to spend the half term with our children seeing the sights we were contacted by staff at the hotel no less than 10 times throughout our day asking us various questions and completely ruining our day out The manager also insisted we return to the hotel at 3pm to have a meeting All while we were simply trying to enjoy our time away with our children On return to the hotel later that evening my husband was summoned to another meeting lasting over 40 minutes by the manager ,No Positive
204870,Commodore Hotel, The mattresses need updating URGENTLY Invest in some free view channels The carpet was worn and filthy staff are probably under pressure NOT to vacuum Other guests were inconsiderate no noise policy in place banging doors and shouting across corridors at any and all hours of the day night Walls are paper thin Pillows are even thinner The gym equipment is laughable just do away with it in the advert and the TV sets need to go The whole experience was just awful The apologetic staff did little to ease how i regarded my stay For the price tag it is day light robbery , The linen and towels were super clean 
204871,Commodore Hotel, The only thing I didn t love about our stay was that we had a do not disturb sign on our door while out and about in the city and the cleaning staff came in anyways Not a huge issue as it s always nice to come home to a clean room however we personally prefer to live in and have cleaning done at the end , This hotel was a welcome relief from a nightmare one night stay at a local Airbnb We ended up canceling our Airbnb in the middle of the night and booked here on a complete whim and thank goodness we did The location is perfect close to everything you would want to see in London close to all forms of public transportation and yet far enough away from noise and city bustle We were upgraded upon arrival and our room was wonderful very comfy bed and a terrace The staff were very sweet and though we didn t try any of the food there I m sure it s just as great 
204872,Commodore Hotel, The Central Heating Radiator badly needs Bleeding it has a lot of air inside causing the Control Valve to Buzz very loudly even when set at 0 at regular intervals ruining your nights sleep Room 704 Hotel please note and Rectify , Hotel was very nice clean and well appointed in a great location I would stay there again 
204873,Commodore Hotel, Full English Breakfast was a tad expensive at 12 95 each and fairly average to be honest If it had been better I may have paid for the second day but in the end found a better caf around the corner which was better value and better taste The hotel is a little bit shabby in places which a little more TLC or maybe a bit of touch up painting would improve for a small cost However this was fine given the cost of our stay so I have not marked the hotel down for this as overall I would definitely stay there again , Great location we were a few minutes walk from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace which was the very reason for our stay and overall found it a very good hotel for anything more than we got I would have expected to pay more too so no complaints from me as I found it great value Extra kudos to the lady who checked us in who I thought was absolutely lovely and welcoming Very pleasant and would not hesitate to stay there again Fantastic location if you re going to Kensington Palace like we were at good value too for the area 
204874,Commodore Hotel, Room at basement level Had I known I would end up with that room I would not have paid 99 pounds for it the carpet in the room did not look great, friendly staff comfortable bed top notch location right behind Kensington Garden
204875,Commodore Hotel, Check in was awful treated like we were not trusted Rooms were incredibly noisy could here upstairs and next door water and walking about Maid just walked in without knocking a hour before check out time Then 10 mins later was knocking again Our kettle kept switching on and boiling dry but staff didn t seem to care of fire hazard, The bed was comfy
204876,Commodore Hotel, We were in the basement floor view of a brick wall no sunlight Two occasions where someone knocked on our door no one there when we answered Staff didn t care Room key didn t work Wifi didn t work Staff not too welcoming, Room was large and clean Location was brilliant Beautiful building
204877,Commodore Hotel, Dirty room noise of boiler all night freezing room bathroom falling apart pictures held up with bluetac above our heads cigarette burns in blinds ignorant staff, Nothing not a 4 star hotel Other than location the rest was incredibly poorer
204878,Commodore Hotel, Yoghurt at breakfast was not cooled No elevator to the 6th floor , WIFI was without limits and internet was ok not great not bad Continental breakfast was just fine Friendly reception good service I needed an iron board and it was delivered to my room within minutes 
204879,Commodore Hotel, There was the constant sound of running water and one of the bedside lights didnt work , The room was airy and the bed very comfortable and the staff were very helpful It was a great location away from the main road but with good access to the tube 
204880,Commodore Hotel, I booked the hotel to include a full english breakfast to be told a couple of days before that it was actually a mistake and they could only offer a continental breakfast On arrival at the hotel when I made an order for room service they told us that they had no food so we had to order from there partner takeaway service which was a kebab shop We ordered through the hotel 1x quarter pounder cheeseburger and paid 6 00 they delivered just a portion of chips that we did not order and no burger Spoke to the hotel and the kebab shop and was refused my money back the hotel did nothing to follow this up so I was without the correct food I ordered and down by 6 00 From the room service menu there was a cream tea which was a tea and a fruit scone the man said they should have this 10 minutes later he come up to the room with just a cup of earl grey tea an apple and an orange to compensate for the scone and charged me 5 00 there was already tea in the room So I refused to pay this as firstly I asked for english breakfast tea and not early grey secondly there was already tea in the room I just wanted to order the cream tea as it came with a scone but they was unable to provide this In the end I disputed this 5 00 charge for the wrong tea and they removed this from the bill , The room was lovely 
204881,Commodore Hotel, Dusty I ve been sneezing throughout the duration of my stay I don t think the old curtains carpets top of bed cloth decors are getting washed on a regular basis I still have to put a 50 deposit in case there s a damage to property in which is a big turn off because they can always find a tiny reason to blame and therefore they can easily say I broke something which I didn t It s a win win situation when it comes to this appalling style of deposit just to extort money from customers in a legitimate way , Location 
204882,Commodore Hotel, The room was very hot especially on the first night and I was unable to lower the temperature or put a fan on , The location is excellent and good price for that area The hotel has a good ambience 
204883,Commodore Hotel, 1 Front desk stuffs are not friendly flexible especially the Indian or similar race employee claimed that we could not have our luggage stored when we check out the check out is early at 11am and our schedule to airport is at 3pm It was when we were prepare to throw a fight with him that he became flexible I wish the hotel would improve on their customer service 2 The room G1 that we stayed the carpet is balding stained Cleanliness is not at its best I think it s time for the hotel to upgrade the room s fixtures fittings , 1 Location is superb 2 Neighbourhood is posh 3 Heater is kept warm 24 hour 4 Water heater works 
204884,Commodore Hotel, The hairdrier did not work very well and our room was on the ground floor and overlooked an inner courtyard with noisy machines , The Hotel was warm and confortable with polite and correct staff Bathrooms were clean and the bed was big and confortable The rooms were old but clean 
204885,Commodore Hotel, The hotel itself is incredibly outdated and could do with a serious update The carpets appeared filthy I felt I had to wear shoes in my room The throw on my bed was tired and had some sort of coffee ring stain The fitness centre was extremely limited and the WiFi was exceptionally poor slow and kept dropping out The bed was exceptionally uncomfortable I like a firm mattress but this was like lying on a board and the pillows were flat lumpy Not impressed and would not consider staying here again , The location is the best thing about this hotel The walk in shower was great and rooms are larger than average for a London hotel 
204886,Commodore Hotel, Bathroom was clean but not spotless Some mouldy bits and shower curtain made shower really narrow , Location very good Just a couple minutes away from centre Rooms were tidy and comfortable I will return to this hotel 
204887,Commodore Hotel, The staff would put a letter under the door daily telling you that although you request no room cleaning after 3 days they require to be cleaned Ok so on that day we left and came back after 8 to 10 hours of being gone and our room door was ajar A slight Crack and not pulled shut Luckily for us nothing going was taken but definitely made the staff aware that this was unacceptable , Location
204888,Commodore Hotel, We were disappointed with the executive suite very small window opened out on to the service yard not at all executive The room service was VERY poor It took three attempts to get the basics of a very simple order any where near correct We ordered a Afternoon Tea which was supposed to consist of a selection of sandwiches and cakes along with cream scones and strawberry preserve we got two scones and cream no preserve no knifes no milk when eventually preserve was brought it was marmalade at which stage we just gave up There was a lot of noise throughout the night people running up and down the corridor and slamming doors , The lady on reception was friendly
204889,Commodore Hotel, Old furniture as well as I couldn t see from the window as the mechanism to put up the curtain was broken Very difficult to orientate till you get to your room Wifi just for one application It means that only one person could use it , The room was quite big The bed really nice to sleep Staff working at the hotel helpful 
204890,Commodore Hotel, Very limited menu room service only the restaurant wasn t open in the evening No alcoholic drinks although a well stocked room bar with a choice of soft drinks , Very polite staff The room was warm and comfortable Appealing reception and lounge area Quiet pleasant area just 10 mins walk from Queensway underground 
204891,Commodore Hotel, The quality of the rooms is quite bad overall Everything in the hotel is tiny Bathrooms are small and cheaply built The continental breakfast was not really eatable overcooked eggs and cheese which is wet from fat Due to planned engineering works at the nearby underground station the hotel is not that easy to reach And the worst the hotel is that bad built that I woke up every time sbd used a bathroom next to above or under my room , The receptionists are friendly and willing to help The lobby area is very charming with the open fire place 
204892,Commodore Hotel, The room was too small for a couple The lift was dodgy the carpet worn and the people in the next room had very loud sex on most nights followed by hurried footsteps past our room afterwards , Location was good comfy lounge adjacent to the entry staff friendly and mostly helpful 
204893,Commodore Hotel, The corridors were red hot uncomfortable the lift was tiny there was lots of noise lasting for over 3 5 hours in our first night and the hotel did little to resolve, The location of the hotel was good and within easy access of the Tube station
204894,Commodore Hotel, We arrived back at the hotel on day 2 of our trip to find a live cockroach on the floor We were given a different room but we never expected to see a cockroach in our room Although the hotel looked relatively clean and tidy it obviously wasn t We were not offered any compensation for this and hardly an apology It felt like this happens more often than not Would definitely never recommend or return ,No Positive
204895,Commodore Hotel, room didn t have a hairdryer no shower gel hair still in shower plug hole towels in the washing machine we was unsure if they had been washed or not microwave didn t work we was on the 6th floor and the lift wasn t working , beds were comfy
204896,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Very impressed as our stay was a treat for my girlfrends birthday I asked in special requests if the hotel can put a birthday banner in the room They said yes and apon arrival told us we had a free room upgrade and left a signed birthday card in there too Overall The hotel was lovely and the staff were fantastic very friendly 
204897,Commodore Hotel, We were transferred to another room with huge but uncomfortable beds Request to transfer to a room with a better view was not granted , The bed in my first room was comfy but it looked out into a courtyard and the window to the outside couldn t be locked Breakfast was good 
204898,Commodore Hotel, The carpets needs to be changed But didn t bother the experience just my own observation The bed wasn t the best , The decor is gorgeous The staff were really helpful and nice The location is perfect 
204899,Commodore Hotel, What I didn t like this time was that the room we got was only accessible via 3 flights of stairs It was ok this time because I travelled light but had I been with my family it would have been a tragedy A warning note would have been nice , I ve been to this hotel a few times now and happy with location and facilities at this hotel 
204900,Commodore Hotel, The photo s shown on booking com were nothing like the room we had Tiny room worn carpet cracked mirror in bathroom dirty sink area and miserable staff Not happy ,No Positive
204901,Commodore Hotel, We booked and Executive Double bedroom and received a shoe box The room was tiny you had to walk like a crab between the bed and wardrobe to get to the other side of the room The carpet was coming up in places and it was horrifically stained there was a massive brown stain in one corner looked like it might have been false tan or something I have stayed in Travelodges far nicer and cleaner than this place The hotel itself was grotty appreciate it is an old hotel but if you re boasting 4 stars and charging that amount per room you would expect it to be a bit up to date or at least clean I booked this for myself my parter and another room for my parents for a night out in London to say we were all highly disappointed is an understatement I complained at the desk about the state of the room and was just stared at blankly I was then told that if I come back at 8am the following morning they MIGHT be able to offer me complimentary breakfast Poor customer service as if i m going to set my alarm to get up and go seeking a free breakfast something should have been offered on the spot as is common practice in customer service Really really disappointing altogether , NOTHING
204902,Commodore Hotel, Blocked twice total charge on my card and then wanted 50 pounds deposit still Have not got it back even though room was left perfect very bad experience and nobody to be held responsible This hotel not worth the hassle and I organise trips regularly will tell people to avoid it still waiting on my 50 pounds,No Positive
204903,Commodore Hotel, Terrible staff Last day there was an extremely rude receptionist They lost our luggage that was left in storage after that they have realized that it was locked somewhere and they could not find the key It took them more than an hour and only after my call to the POLICE they finally opened the door and returned me the bags BUT I missed the last train and was almost late to the airport Very very stressful , Location was ok but keep in mind that the closest underground station Lancaster is temporary closed 
204904,Commodore Hotel, The mattress was quite worn A new one is badly necessary For the next one it might be clever to use a mattress cover to expand the lifespan of the mattresses As our room was in the basement we cleary heard the underground trains passing the hotel If you are very sensitive to noises you shall mention this before , The location is excellent right at the Hyde Park and within walking distance to Paddington station Lancaster Gate Bus stop is also nearby Staff was very nice and polite and helpful We even got an better room than we have booked We loved the look of the Lobby area Very nice to come in after a long and cold day in the city and sitting in front of the fire 
204905,Commodore Hotel, Cramped room despite it being executive double The carpet was stained and threadbare The furniture was chipped missing handles and doors The bedside lighting had wiring taped up which is a health hazard Plugs were virtually impossible to access through cabinets The bathroom had broken tiles and tiles that were loose The heated towel rail was broken The lift was broken which enabled us to walk up the stairs to view the poor decoration of the building that was evident in our room Website photos do not correlate to reality , Reception was a nice beginning Nice big bed free wifi 
204906,Commodore Hotel, There was no water in the bathroom for about 6 hours on one of the days we were there Had to walk to the reception area to use the toilet at 5am , Spacious apartment Well equipped 
204907,Commodore Hotel, I originally booked the apartment but when we arrived the apartment wasn t available and so we had to be separated into 2 separate rooms We couldnt spend the time together as a family as planned in the apartment We was given free breakfasts for in the inconvenience and it was nice too I doubt I would stay here again , The location was good for us visting Winter Wonderland and the breakfast was nice 
204908,Commodore Hotel, The indian at the helpdesk he is useless and the room s carpet so worn old hotel not good value u can go to course hotel sane street recommended , Location close to the underground 
204909,Commodore Hotel, Didnt like being next door to the lift very noisy all night The room was very hot The lift wouldnt work properly on our 2nd day we were on the 6th floor with a baby and a child ,No Positive
204910,Commodore Hotel, The room was very small and the prices in London are insane compared to the size and the quality of the hotels rooms The staircase is very small especially when travelling with a big suitcase Breakfast is way too expensive , The hotel is very nice and comfortable The bed was big and lovely 
204911,Commodore Hotel, Hard fried eggs Not being advised I needed photo ID no evening meals No notice to say no afternoon tea as it was NYE 50retension fee in case you break anything in the room wasn t advertised or at least I didn t see it , The hotel was lovely warm and welcoming the decor was beautiful The room was immaculately clean spotless intact Always personnel to ask questions Five minute walk yo the bus stop ten to the tube breakfast was OK ample food on a fry up and hot The shower in the room was great the bed squeeked but it was an old one and so very comfy 
204912,Commodore Hotel, The amount of stairs Dirty looking stained carpet in the bedroom Inside the bin lid in the kitchen was filthy Not nice smell on first entering the flat No iron No bowl or tea towel for washing pots plug was useless in kitchen , We stayed in the 1 bedroom apartment Comfy bed lovely shower pleased there was an en suite Location was great 
204913,Commodore Hotel, Very small elevators Couldn t afford to eat breakfast there About 25 00 for a simple breakfast is too much The patio door to the outside sitting area would not lock The safe in the room would not operate and could not be fixed , Liked the comfort of the room and the central location just north of Hyde Park Also liked the location within 300 meters of an underground tube station The London underground provides unsurpassed ease of transportation 
204914,Commodore Hotel, It was clean but smelled bad and was quite noisy as we were below the ground floor It was also very hot and we couldn t figure out the controls As it was quite expensive it was disappointing that the rug was very stained and not laid properly with nails showing at the edges , Big two bedroom room with very nice clean bathrooms and kitchen Good location 
204915,Commodore Hotel, Firstly the hotel receptionist demanded for my ID and photocopy eventhough I provided the booking com confirmation The apartment was old and not all the lights was working When we check out we we re told that hotel stowage cannot stowed our luggages temporary for a few hours Not helpful , We we re allowed to leave our luggages at the hotel 2hours earlier Subsequently the Porter sent to our apartment 
204916,Commodore Hotel, Staff informing you when checking in of the hotel facilities no information offered Beds were very hard and noise pollution from other rooms Isolated and felt you were not part of the hotel No contact just up to your room then out without acknowledgement Travel into the centre of London is costly when staying for week, Informal
204917,Commodore Hotel, Although we had a four post bed and it was very comfy it was a little rickety and we did feel like it might fall over Bit worn in places and stains on carpet, Friendly staff especially at breakfast and the best continental breakfast I ve ever had
204918,Commodore Hotel, The pictures shown at the webpage does not match the general condition of the hotel The place is worn down Breakfast was not to standards of a 4 star hotel , Location was great 
204919,Commodore Hotel, Quality and facilities need to be improved if you wanted to get customer back I had to leave after one night for another hotel in Paddington area , Nothing much
204920,Commodore Hotel, Executive double very small Small TV set back in unit with the mains lead stretched to the socket so you couldn t pull it out to see it Other plug sockets in room not working Sash window could be opened but would slide shut Second rate fixtures and fittings , Location to Hyde Park and the tube 
204921,Commodore Hotel, I m amazed that this place is considered 4 star hotel I would hate to see a 2 or 3 star Either the AA reviewer is completely blind or the hotel has painted an extra couple of stars on themselves Grumpy staff badly threadbare carpets tired decor Non functional aircon and a broken lift I didn t want to risk eating in the restaurant judging by the rest of the hotel and the fact that the enticer menu in the lift had serious spelling errors I arrived in my cupboard sorry room which hadn t been hoovered to find that the tiny room was baking on discovery that the aircon was broken i called reception to be told that all air con in the hotel has been disabled for winter I ended up having to stick a fan in an open window to try to cool down the room fortunately there was not much room to cool Lets just say that after a shower It was not possible to stand at the end of the bed to to use the towel as there wasn t enough room All in all a very unpleasant and overpriced place to stay Needless to say I shall not be returning here , The only positives were the free wifi and the location
204922,Commodore Hotel, No climate control in rooms unable to turn radiators off no lift to 5th and 6th floor staff were unhelpful and unapologetic when we raised concerns Asked for a debit card on arrival after they already having our credit card details said it was for a security deposit but it wouldn t be deducted from my account unless any damages when we check out they deducted it from my account straight away then simple told us to come back in the morning and they d refund it straight away after check out we did and they Made us buy something from the mini bar again after checking out in order to release our security deposit straight away this still hasn t been refunded back to me 48 hours later Now refusing to take my calls,No Positive

204924,Commodore Hotel, Room a little bit small and cold because of old windows which were not fitting the closure very well , Breakfast was good and there were different things to choose The position is very good and situated centrally 
204925,Commodore Hotel, The staff was not particularly friendly My room had a interior garden door which wasn t closing It s also so loud I could hear the woman in the room next door talking on the phone it was so loud it sounded like she was in the same room as me Also there was some constant noise in my room might have been the central heating system or something like that but thankfully I had earplugs , the room was large and the bed was comfortable The room was overall ok 
204926,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The staff was sometimes very busy but I left my phone at the desk and they picked it up stored it and approached me later to know if I was the one who lost it Super On the phone not so friendly though 
204927,Commodore Hotel, Arrived to learn that they had let our double room go and instead had to settle for a twin Rooms too hot stay was mid December and cramped No air conditioning working Room and bathroom was grubby and out dated , Location is excellent 
204928,Commodore Hotel, Bed pillows are not comfortable carpet is worn out the room I stayed at was noisy because its close to the lift They checked me in a room at first in a part of the hotel that did not have a lift when I refused to take a 3 story stairs they moved me to another floor with a lift, The location I like lancastee gate quiet safe yet central 
204929,Commodore Hotel, No vegan breakfast option The private hire cab that was called for us was over expensive and not suitable for us with a wheelchair we would have preferred a black cab as we requested , Staff very helpful and friendly 
204930,Commodore Hotel, The apartment was lovely the sofa bed wasn t very comfortable and the bathroom was roasting Apart from that it was lovely Could have done with a mini bar snacks etc, The apartment was brilliant great location huge and very comfortable

204932,Commodore Hotel, The beds weren t very comfy pillows not very good just felt like it needed modernising Also the room had an awful musty smell upon entering if I would of arrived earlier I would of requested a room change it s as it was late I didn t Also a really irritating noise all night what our friends could hear possibly the air con unit sounding like a water dripping noise , Hotel had a lot of character not too far from the tube on the central line Lancaster Gate tube 
204933,Commodore Hotel, I booke hotel with free cancellation and to pay at hotel if staying went ahead to stay at hotel was asked for payment on checking in paid in full in cash a few days later I see on my bank statement that they charged my card also for full amount I rang and was told it was a Hold on my card not charged that it would be released back to my card I am furious I paid in cash on Thursday 24th November its Wednesday 29th and still no show of money back in my account they say they don t charge your card but your money isn t available to you as they have hold on it not acceptable at all I use booking Com as you have free cancellation on some rooms and pay on checkout I would not recommend you stay at this hotel , Nothing

204936,Commodore Hotel, No heating both radiator and conditioning unit not working Although staff did try best to sort provided with little fan heater in the end , Room was nice except
204937,Commodore Hotel, The interior was rundown The carpet in our room was bare in parts and the shower only had half a door for the shower water spilled everywhere And they painted something in our room while we were gone without any prior notice just came back to our room and there was a wet paint sign on the wall , Great location 
204938,Commodore Hotel, Room was clean but very tired Worn carpet etc , The head receptionist was lovely and couldn t have been more helpful Her staff on the other hand could at least have raised a smile during check in 
204939,Commodore Hotel, Breakfast Pastries not fresh and fruit all tinned Squeeky floorboards in the room above mine , Pleasant staff comfortable bed powerful hot water good sized room 
204940,Commodore Hotel, The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever experienced in a hotel it was like sleeping on a wooden board Executive room Very small basic so what is a standard room like , The location suited our needs
204941,Commodore Hotel, Everything apart from location Grumpy staff Lost luggage Tv on sliding test in cupboard but can t watch it cos the power leads to short Harrumph x 5, Nothing
204942,Commodore Hotel, Very dated and expensive considering the rooms were so basic Mainly paying for the location and nice exterior of the hotel Interior is very dated Carpets could do with a deep clean replacement, Great location clean
204943,Commodore Hotel, The room and bathroom were tiny The furniture was very dated carpets filthy and paint chipped everywhere Also found loads under the wardrobe clearly not been checked for a while The walls are really thin and you can here the people above you walking around and people in the corridors in the morning thumping about There is only 2 plug sockets on one side of the bed and there was exposed wiring from the Ethernet cable in the room We paid 60 a night at the weekend but I would expect more from a 4 hotel, All the consumables towels bedsheets etc were very clean Full tea and coffee making facilities which were well stocked and a very reasonably priced mini bar in the room
204944,Commodore Hotel, The room was extremely tired very old fashioned stains on the carpet and in desperate need of a make over and modernising , The staff and location where perfect Room service menu was poor Offered 3 types of cheesecake but they had none Continental breakfast was poor the fruit was from a tin we had to ring down and ask for rolls but then got no butter just jam The tea and coffee was cold 
204945,Commodore Hotel, Outdated old and small things like hand wash weren t supplied Lifts were noisy throughout the night and staff didn t speak fluent English, Excellent location and hotel looked great from the outside 
204946,Commodore Hotel, Staff were rude and unhelpful we were placed in a basement room that smelt damp and had peeling plaster our view was of some grates that cover the storage heaters The bathroom was very cramped with the shower tray having a crack running through it also the cradle for the shower head was not fitted correctly so it fell off each time you attempted to use it As a responsible guest I had reported these issues so the following morning we were visited by maintenance and cleaning staff from 9am This hotel saw fit to ruin my stay with this behaviour as I had traveled to London for a relaxing time and this was spoilt by their insistence to fixing these issues they could have simply waited until I d checked out to do this If you want to stay in a hotel that completely inconsiderate of it s guest stay at the commodore hotel , Not a single thing 
204947,Commodore Hotel, I expected more from a top scoring property with excellent reviews perhaps they could use some of the money paid to them to re lay the thread bare stained carpets Also being able to hear the people in the next room talking is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel, The staff I dealt with where polite helpful The location was handy 
204948,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, It was at a perfect location and very close to the underground tube station It s location was brilliant The neighbourhood was very classy and safe For being in the middle of the city it had such a quiet location which was perfect 
204949,Commodore Hotel, An older hotel that does offer character but a bit tired in places especially room carpets , Good location friendly and helpful staff Safety deposit box Good value all round 
204950,Commodore Hotel, The rooms were very small tired and dated Everything was dirty Shabby and in need of a good clean I have no idea at all how it is classed ad 4 star it should be 2 star , The location right on the edge of Kensington Gardens Hyde Park was fantastic
204951,Commodore Hotel, The rooms do vary and some of the carpets could do with a makeover but that s made up for by the wonderful reception lounge , I always choose to stay here when I m in London as it s a great location and prices very reasonable Very comfortable and feels English in a good way 
204952,Commodore Hotel, The hotel is dated the condition of the common areas is poor The carpet are worn stained and dirty The carpet in the rooms are in a similar condition On the day night of my stay there was no hot water and no effort was made to inform guest of this problem The air conditioning unit in my room was not working and requires a service I have stayed in the hotel on a number of occasions over the past 24 months I have noticed a gradual detrrioration of the rooms and common areas over this time It is not value for money any more , Not very much
204953,Commodore Hotel, As a family of 5 we booked paid for a 2 bedroom apartment On arrival were told they had made a mistake with our booking We were given a 1 bedroom apartment with an extra z bed No refund of price was offered All items in kitchen were for 4 people so facilities didn t meet our needs Sofa bed z bed were so uncomfortable They gave us complimentary breakfast it wasn t a full English it was a very basic continental buffet food was poor I absolutely would not recommend this hotel apartments to anyone especially a family We should of a my the very least been refunded the difference in price , The location

204957,Commodore Hotel, The rooms were smaller than expected barely fitting for two people The bathrooms even smaller When we arrived the room looked like it hasn t been cleaned for days the carpet was stained Room service barely did any vacuuming they only made the bed and that is all Definitely NOT value for money Please spend your money elsewhere with the rates we got which was quite expensive we did not even get breakfast , The location is quite convenient Just a short walk away from Lancaster Gate station that will take you anywhere in central London Also there are buses and nearby restaurants Staff were also quite accommodating and friendly 
204958,Commodore Hotel, The price went from 130 to 170 because I changed the date by one week when I arrived the price was 175 plus breakfast I was with my wife so didnt want to start a fuss as it was our anniversary The bedroom was cramped the bed was like sleeping on a door The dinning room was far to small for the amount of people staying It was chaotic To be honest I am a seasoned traveller Ive only ever stayed in a hotel this poor on one other occasion It felt like a second rate guest house , Nothing

204963,Commodore Hotel, As soon as we entered the apartment I sat on a chair and noticed that it was unstoppable Two legs were broken We moved it carefully and did not complain about it After returning home I received the following email from the manager Dear Ms Due to the damaged chair that was left upon your departure we have charged 80 as damage fees from your card Please find the relevant pictures enclosed Best Regards Commodore Hotel I am really sorry about it They accused us of damaging their property I can t really believe this behaviour I Sent an email and told them that we have not broken that chair but they paid no attention I liked their hotel and the staff I wish they haven t changed my mind Sorry,No Positive
204964,Commodore Hotel, Cleanliness we spotted a mouse in our room which was supposed to be an upgraded executive room it was terrible stay and we would never stay there again The carpets beyond the reception were threadbare and the furniture in the room was worn beyond words , Location
204965,Commodore Hotel, Thin walls extremely poor sound proofing could hear quests above and the room next to ours , Bathroom was Dirty unclean towels broken bed uncomfortable mattress kettle not working mini fridge with empty bottles which they tried to bill us for no ironing board or iron when we asked the staff where unhelpful staff and said we will get u one in the morning Which was no good to us as We needed to iron our clothes to go out Had to change plans and never got iron in the morning 
204966,Commodore Hotel, Facilities were quite dated and worn We were taken back a bit by a warning letter we received for keeping a few bottles of water in the mini fridge Ridiculous additional fees or a fine if we kept them there , Great location enjoyed being able to walk everywhere The room was comfortable and clean 
204967,Commodore Hotel, No strong alcohol choice in the minibar , Excellent location considering that hotel is on Central Line and red line now is a night tube Easy to walk from Paddington Ideal place to sleep after exhausting walks in London
204968,Commodore Hotel, The furniture was cracked the walls were unclean and the bed base was broken along with having to go up 97 steps to get to my apartment, The bathroom was very nice and the kitchen living room was nice
204969,Commodore Hotel, The carpet was disgusting The walls had mold on them and were stained The windows were dirty The general cleanliness of the hotel was one of the poorest I ve ever stayed in Definitely not a 3 start should be advertised as 2 Urgently needs to undergo a renovation, The location was good was in a great area
204970,Commodore Hotel, The floorboards are so creaky that every time the person in the room above moved you would know about it Keeps you awake at nights I m sure not in every room but would avoid in the future , Room was quite spacious
204971,Commodore Hotel, My room could have been better There was a huge crack on the wall where the air con was fitted and the carpet was not very clean, I liked the fact my father used to own the restaurant downstairs from the hotel
204972,Commodore Hotel, The hotel was a bit rundown and didn t really look like in the pictures Old furniture creaky floor old carpets The bathroom definitely needed renovating , Very good location next to Hyde Park Friendly staff
204973,Commodore Hotel, I would be happier if this property had a lift 55 stairs was sometimes beyond my ability , Everything was really good about this apartment It was the first time I stayed in such a nice place in this area with this price 
204974,Commodore Hotel, The remote control unit on the TV did not work and despite efforts to replace this was never done Using the TV was therefore difficult during our stay , Location was right for our needs 
204975,Commodore Hotel, The lift The mouse that came to visit Worn carpets Doors that don t close properly I will be contacting you as I have been charged twice for my room , The staff were excellent I was given a double room when I had booked a single
204976,Commodore Hotel, The whole room and hotel experience was very disappointing Very noisy room the room was very tired carpet ripped stained and worn out chipped sink and broken plug The hotel and room just were not 4 star quality as advertised , The staff were great and very friendly
204977,Commodore Hotel, We had a good sized room and bathroom but the hotel does seem a little out dated and dirty The Hotel is in need of a little restoration or deep cleaning We had mould growing inside the shower and my girlfriend was complaining about the hairdryer as it was from the 80s If you are thinking of staying bring your own hairdryer Probably shouldn t be rated as a four star hotel , Great location Right next to Hyde Park 5 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube station not far of a walk to Marble Arch and Oxford Street Area seemed safe and quite Staff seemed very friendly 
204978,Commodore Hotel, Dirty and tired bedroom The bed was almost as big as the room Was a poor option for the money I paid I tried to get a refund for my second night but couldn t as I booked through booking com, OK location
204979,Commodore Hotel, There are no near facilities early check out the cleaniness of the tiolet was not great, Its location although a bit of distance from the main attractions
204980,Commodore Hotel, Given wrong room despite booking and arriving on time double instead of suite and offered no apology or reduction in price other than two complimentary continental breakfasts which had a poor selection Room was incredibly noisey and nowhere near what you d expect for a 4 star hotel Tiny lift and worn carpets tatty furniture overpriced plug sockets minimal and inconvenient to get to Also our luggage was stored unacceptably for hours in main reception area by a communal doorway Very disappointing , Location was great staff at breakfast very friendly and comfy bed
204981,Commodore Hotel, The rooms were very small and very noisy We all found it difficult to sleep In addition the showers were actually quite dangerous falling shower head and scolding hot water without warning , Clean and good location 
204982,Commodore Hotel, Hotel needs to be cleaned from top yo toe TV would only change channel if i switched off and on all the time they offer room service but DONT use it Its microwaved food Mine arrived frozen still They should be advertising as a 3 Star , Location was convenient and room was big bathroom was really good 
204983,Commodore Hotel, Very tiny room not even room to close the curtains Extremely thin walls we could hear everything that was going on in the other rooms I did not think the room reflected the price ,No Positive
204984,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, We were located on the 6th floor but once they learned my wife was claustraphbic so would have to take the stairs and not the lift they put us on the ground floor The only room available was an Executive Double but they upgraded us at no extra cost 
204985,Commodore Hotel, Like staying in a creaky old b b old wornout carpets dated maghogany furniture ancient mattress shower flooded the bathroom no plug for the sink creaky floorboards upstairs better hotels for the money despite the value, Great location good value
204986,Commodore Hotel, Small television Internet could be faster We also had problems to link the laptops wirelessly to the internet from 3rd floor but no problems with the mobile phones The sound from nearby room upstairs was a bit penetrable The training facilities could have be more accessible we detected a room for training locked with a padlock not very inviting or motivating We assumed that the training room because of the padlock was not very updated but we never went into it The staff could have been more relaxed and friendly when we arrived too much focus on the payment arrangement that we were credible visitors , Superb location close to Hyde park and a 2 3 minutes walk to the Lanchester gate underground station A nice pub and a convenient kiosk nearby Good breakfast but we had to pay extra for English breakfast Nice and clean rom with a desk for computer work Positive that the internet access lasted for full week no problem with internet access for extra devices 2 laptops 2 mobile phones Friendly and service minded staff breakfast 
204987,Commodore Hotel, Booked a room for 3 that wasn t available so had to have a double and a single decor v tired in communal areas rooms nice , Staff position breakfast all great
204988,Commodore Hotel, We ordered continental breakfast buffet lovely selection and standard however we got our own tea and then were only offered a cup by a lovely lady at table as we were about to leave restaurant Breakfast was advertised as served until 10 30 we arrived at 10 I assumed we could enter until 10 30 but in fact it was cleared at this time maybe allow entry till then and leave buffet till 10 45 Minor detail , Immediate smiley welcome from polite and knowledgeable staff laughs before we even received key Easy to find perfect location amazingly comfortable beds quiet room Very good 
204989,Commodore Hotel, Carpets are very worn plumbing for shower difficult to use Hard to get a temperature which isn t boiling hot or cold managed in the end after lots of fine adjustments to the taps Air con made occasional loud buzzing noise Very minor thing but plug sockets by the bed would be great for charging phone at night , Best bit Fast free wifi Great Brilliant location lovely view over Leinster Mews from the window Staff were efficient Bed was comfortable Room was clean And there was a bath which was a bonus got to love a bath 
204990,Commodore Hotel, The hotel and rooms were looking tired The mark on the cleanliness is due to the carpets needing replacing and fixtures in bathroom also, Staff were very good
204991,Commodore Hotel, Everything just not what I expected for a so called 4 star hotel It is in need of a complete overhaul from the threadborn carpets to the decor to the furniture to the cleanliness of the bathroom Never again Just a very poor hotel ,No Positive
204992,Commodore Hotel, 1 I thought I had 2 hours for the checkout because of my genius membership with booking com but the hotel informed me that it s not true and they had many customers from booking com claiming 2 hours 2 This hotel is very far from 4 stars I m used to american hotels This hotel is similar to what you get in a 2 2 5 stars hotel in America , 1 Staff were easy to deal with and helpful which I found a bit surprising because of the other customer reviews I saw here Probably the hotel had issues in the past and fixed them 2 I m generally satisfied with what I got compared to what I paid I was a solo traveler in a double room and I got a decent genius discount 
204993,Commodore Hotel, We had 5 rooms and all of them needed repairs The AC leaked water in some of the rooms the bathroom tap sprayed water in two rooms and one room had a bad smell In one room was much noise from the pipes and they had to change rooms This is old hotel and I am not going to stay there again , The staff tried to do their best and the rooms were clean 
204994,Commodore Hotel, N A, Fantastic location as it s only a couple of miles away from the theatres Very comfortable beds and we were surprised to find it had air conditioning as well Would definitely stay here again 
204995,Commodore Hotel, They took money from my card for extras on check in but then informed me there was no bar or restaurant I daren t ask what extras they were offering This place is shabby dingy and not worth the money Avoid Also bizarrely they asked if I wanted to pay in Romanian currency , Nothing
204996,Commodore Hotel, Lift small old We used the narrow stairs which was not a problem and kept us fit , The staff were extremely helpful friendly and could not do enough for you very accommodating The full English breakfast was also good 
204997,Commodore Hotel, The room was very noisy Boiler woke us everytime somone in the hotel used water The bedroom upstairs floor creaked as such we had a poor nights sleep , Wifi and location
204998,Commodore Hotel, Booked an apartment Given a room Was promised twice that a discount would be applied still waiting Carpets very threadbare room too hot and stuffy a c makes a lot of noise but to no effect , Location handy for Hyde Park

205000,Commodore Hotel, Not 4 star Very dated decor Desperately needs redecorating Our apartment we booked was not available so we were given a room Not real coffee at breakfast and not offered a pot of tea not n, Location was good
205001,Commodore Hotel, Tap in bathroom leaked and on our last day the shower temperature was very variable , The staff were all excellent Diana excelling in the restaurant and a young chap whose name I didn t catch but who worked in the Reception area very helpful and cheerful 
205002,Commodore Hotel, Room was very small Shower was difficult to even move in it was that tiny Some of the plugs in the room were broken Kettle had to be on the floor to connect to a plug , Lobby was very nice Location was good 
205003,Commodore Hotel, The tapp was leaking and the shower s temperature would keep changing dramatically , The location and staff were excellent and the hotel was luxurious The room was big for london standards I found that it was great value for money 
205004,Commodore Hotel, Little things that i would hope were high on the maintenance man s list i e slight damage to toilet flush , The free upgrade was appreciated and the staff were helpful and ensured we got to where we needed to be 
205005,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Such friendly staff upgraded to a suite which was amazing Beautiful antiques and pictures in the room Massive 4 poster bed Will definitely be back
205006,Commodore Hotel, Shower curtain should be replaced with glass On booking com had a genius bonus for late check out which I don t exactly know what means As booking com does tell you about a lot of bonuses which actually are only virtual Any way requested for late check out only by 1 hour but was asked to pay 20pounds more , Location is ideal Clean place and stylish room 
205007,Commodore Hotel, Some of the hard to reach places hadn t been dusted for a while but everywhere else was cleaned properly The decor is a little tired Redecoration needed soo , Fantstic quirky room with four poster bed 
205008,Commodore Hotel, The tiny lifts and the narrow corridors but I think most hotels in Europe are like that anyway so I guess there was nothing we didn t really like , The staff especially Vin were extremely helpful We also loved the room given to us 
205009,Commodore Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 2am due to dripping water poor maintenance All guests needed to evacuate In the morning there was no apology or any offer of compensation for a broken nights sleep A bond of 50 is held for a month after checkout far too long , The location
205010,Commodore Hotel, The fire alarm going off in the early hours of the morning dude to a water leak That supposedly has happened before probably should get that sorted , All the facilities in the room and communal areas were clean and easy to use 
205011,Commodore Hotel, We were unlucky with the rooms we ve got The first one was tiny and the air conditioner didn t work So we were moved to a newly refurbished and bigger one Unfortunately water started dripping through the bathroom ceiling the next morning so we had to move again This time to the basement where a light sleeper hears a distant sound from the underground Regrettably we were woken on our last night by the fire alarm at 1 30am which kept going on and on and on for some time until somebody shut it off completely Luckily there was no real fire that night The Commodore Manager was very nice and tried to sort out the water dripping from the ceiling situation He gave us a room at the same floor so we can shower and showed us 3 new rooms to choose from Additionally we were given two vouchers for breakfast which I wouldn t recommend to pay The service staff at breakfast was very poor and not friendly However we lost a couple of valuable hours with moving rooms London is an expensive city and you don t expect luxury for a decent priced hotel however all bathrooms need some work done we ve seen 4 and if you have the chance get a newly refurbished room with a working a c , The staff especially the hotel manager was very friendly polite and helpful We liked the location which was a short walk from Lancaster Gate Underground station and across from Hyde park 
205012,Commodore Hotel, Staff left a note because I had used fridge for item I bought outside hotel that threatened a 50 GBP charge to clean fridge and informed me a separate fridge could be hired for 39 GBP per night The fridge was not clean in the first place Was promised my deposit would be refunded within 7 days we are home now after 3 weeks and still no sign of refund ,No Positive
205013,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Our room d cor was beautiful and the location was fantastic It s only a short walk to the subway Paddington station Hyde Park and a couple of good traditional pubs and local shops Would definitely recommend this hotel and we would stay there again 
205014,Commodore Hotel, The first room I was given the carpet had so many stains that I didn t want to take off my shoes I mentioned the carpet situation to the front desk agent and she mentioned it was just replaced Maybe it was 20 years ago Had to switch rooms because there was a leak in my room by the bathroom The second room I was switched too was not much better My bathroom was missing a door knob In the morning I had to get dressed and go to the front desk to get someone to open my door so I could use the washroom Had to wait for someone to come in with a tool box so they could open the door Found a hair clip in my bed so clearly the room was not cleaned properly When I asked to speak to a manager there was no manager on staff until 10am Horrible stay and hotel , Nothing
205015,Commodore Hotel, the room could have been a bit bigger , Bed was comfortable and it was well located to the tube network and on the doorstep of Hyde Park very quiet area and a stone throw away from the busy high street of Baywaters
205016,Commodore Hotel, I did not like that on the first day during the time when we were out the house keeper seems to look in to our stuff Nothing was stolen but still it was really unpleasant surprise After we complain to the register in the next days everything was great , I did like the location and the boys and girls in the reception They are really kind 
205017,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Extremely friendly and helpful staff went out of their way to accommodate a couple of requests during our stay Great hotel great location for city exploring only 5 mins from tube station on the central line 
205018,Commodore Hotel, Everything else was beyond awful The fridge inside didn t work the shower flooded the water temperature fluctuated from scalding to freezing and would even switch off entirely The sink tap spits water at you as the plumbing is hopeless The curtains in the room are hung on with seriously sharp hooks bent to all proportions and fall off occasionally the TV regularly turned on by itself during the night due to a timer that couldn t be changed and the air conditioner blows out dust as the bottom section is not closed off Plus the top floor cannot be accessed by the lift and the lift itself can only fit 1 person with luggage at a time The staff did not appear surprised when we raised concerns about the fridge not working I suspect they ve heard it all before A real shame this hotel could be so much more , Polite staff comfy bed 
205019,Commodore Hotel, choice was 6th floor with no lift or cellar first room had 1 toilet not working I needed to insist to get the water supply cut in order to be able to sleep 2nd room was in the cellar with dirty carpet and dirty bathroom VERY poor bed couldn t do more than 3 nights, quiete neighborhood close to Hide park breakfast was good quality
205020,Commodore Hotel, The shower was either incredibly hot or incredibly cold The room had a ledge that was lose and therefore useless as everything fell , The location was great and the staff is friendly and helpful 
205021,Commodore Hotel, The hotel was scruffy and run down Dead plants on the doorstep and pop music playing in the lobby in an Edwardian style hotel was really tacky I was in a room facing the inner courtyard with a view of air con pipes and some plastic plants in pots The courtyard was netted against pigeons the net was full of litter The room was dusty the bathroom door handle broken the shower curtain mouldy and the hairdryer cut out every 30 seconds due to overheating Staff and guests sitting smoking on the front steps created a really poor impression on arrival The lounge was closed off with plastic hazard tape It was somewhere to lay my head for the night the best I can say is that the sheets were clean , The location was great 
205022,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and we were very privileged to receive an upgrade on our room which was unexpected but fantastic Also due to a late departure time the hotel was very accommodating in allowing us to leave our luggage at the hotel until 6pm the following day The hotel is perfectly situated by Hyde Park and was easily accessible to most areas of central London I will definitely be making a return journey 
205023,Commodore Hotel, The first night I was put in a room located at the 7th floor no elevator on this floor got to stop on the 6th and climb some stairs which was next to the elevators generator or something that was extremely noisy and totally unacceptable I called the reception who offered me straight away an option to change room but as it was 12 30 at night I preferred to move to another room in the morning The next day I moved to a 3 bed room 3rd floor which was very spacious and great However I consider bad choice to put me next to the noise in the first place as they were aware of the problem At least they were very helpful and wanted to make up immediately In addition the hotel is relatively old and requires some maintenance On the other hand the great location 3 4 minutes from Lancaster Gate station and the helpful staff especially the Greek Receptionist will make me to visit again this hotel , The staff at the Reception especially the Greek lady were very friendly and willing to provide excellent services They provided the best solution to the problem described in the negative section 
205024,Commodore Hotel, Hotel in need of refurbishment Bathroom was adequate but water temperature fluctuated Fire alarm went off at 2am but false alarm because water had caused a short circuit ,No Positive
205025,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The location is brilliant very central and the hotel looks beautiful My room was only small but comfortable with a surprisingly big enquite bathroom Felt safe was only there one night but would have happily stayed longer
205026,Commodore Hotel, Not being able to open the window We were on the 6th Floor so it was understandable but the room was very stuffy , The hotel was very friendly and welcoming and extremely helpful 
205027,Commodore Hotel, I had to move rooms because the water didn t drain out of my shower so my bathroom flooded Then my shower in the second room went from scolding hot to freezing cold and was never a suitable temperature to shower under The hotel called me back after i told them about this problem and said they would look at the issue But they followed up with an email saying that after investigation they found nothing was wrong with my second room shower The email implied I had made it up They offered an abysmal discount and made me feel like I was the one that had done something wrong Whilst checking in several other customers were complaining about various things and were met with blank helpless expressions at reception Not nearly enough man power either ,No Positive
205028,Commodore Hotel, The conditions of the rooms I asked to be moved because the first room smelt stale Smokey and damp the staff were helpful and offered me a twin room not ideal but did smell of fresh paint the rest of the room was tired the carpet was threadbare there was paint all over the carpet and generally the room was the type you would get in a 2 star hotel , leaving the next morning There was nothing about this hotel I liked The location is good for the park but there are plenty of better hotels in the area 
205029,Commodore Hotel, Shower that scalded mid use Lights not hanging by a wire Carpet not threadbare Enough room to stretch my arms out The public areas of the hotel were fine the rest shabby I won t be recommending Poor vfm , 50m from my conference
205030,Commodore Hotel, One of the 2 plug sockets were hanging off the bedroom wall the electrics tripped out The decorators woke us up at 8am on a weekend after travelling until late the previous day The broken shower flooded the whole bathroom when used The broken sink tap squirted water all over the bathroom The bedside table had one leg broken so needed propping up carefully and the draw hung out , The bed was comfortable clean bedding and towels Toiletries were included 
205031,Commodore Hotel, Carpets on the stairs are showing there age and the detailing could be better paint work in the bedroom bathroom, Full English was excellent and reception staff very helpful
205032,Commodore Hotel, The suite we had was very tired looking Not all the bulbs worked Repairs were required and some had not been finished very well , The Victorian elements were lovely Stopped the hotel being the same as everywhere else The staff were friendly and polite 
205033,Commodore Hotel, Definitely not 4 star more like 3 star Rooms were small but typical of European hotels The beds were very hard , Helpful staff great location on a quiet street across from Hyde Park and within a few min walking to Underground station Very reasonably priced 
205034,Commodore Hotel, Carpets are terrible worn and stained General maintenance needed Only one tiny lift that took ages , Friendly staff and reasonable location Nice reception and lounge area 
205035,Commodore Hotel, Breakfast was a bit expensive but we were travelling on a budget otherwise absolutely nothing , After a 24hour flight we showed up at the hotel looking all dishellevd and tired The staff could not have been more welcoming They let us freshen up downstairs and held our bags till checkin so we could wander around They gave us maps and heaps of info which really helped us get around hassle free Every time we got home or left in the morning the staff made an effort to smile and see if we needed help and really made us feel comfortable Even though it was absolutely freezing outside inside was so cosy and warm There is really nothing to fault Perfect location literally 3 minutes to walk to the nearest tube and right across from the park with a bike station almost at the front door plus lots of major attractions in walking distance The room was big and had a beautiful bathroom with good heating and wifi Definitely good value for money and would stay here again next time We loved it 
205036,Commodore Hotel, The shower door was broken and the bathroom was very small The carpet in the basement was disgusting unhygenic and dirty Terrible view of a tarpaulin and pipes , The ambience and location were excellent The staff were friendly and helpful 
205037,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location close but not too close to town The staff were very helpful and friendly and we were upgraded to a suite which was an unexpected and welcome surprise The room was opulent in its day but needs a little TLC as wear is starting to show With that said it is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the bedroom is upstairs Very grand The breakfast was good quality and well cooked All in all a great and very enjoyable stay 
205038,Commodore Hotel, Carpet was worn right in the middle of the room there was paint on the floor The room was tiny and the walls were so thin I could hear the man next door brushing his teeth , Lady in the morning was lovely on reception I left on 25 04 16
205039,Commodore Hotel, Couldn t plug kettle in duvet didn t fit bed room smelt of paint lights didn t work blind was broken , The bed was comfy Staff were helpful and polite 
205040,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The location was great Bus stations are around the corner and the central line is just at the next stop The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was excellent 
205041,Commodore Hotel, Shower was difficult to adjust potentially dangerous Rooms very close to each other Other guests came home at 2 30am and I was kept awake The breakfast was very well cooked but little choice so had to have full breakfast which was too big , Breakfast good but expensive Room clean staff courteous and helfful
205042,Commodore Hotel, After being shown to our room We discovered the bed was broken We complained and told there is only one more room in the place In the basement This wasn t great but we didn t have a choice so accepted it Then discovered that half the sockets on the room didn t work This if we r honest was more annoying than a problem Then after a few drinks and a meal in London we get back to the hotel Into bed only to find out that the underground runs under our room That will be us awake till 1 2am Then at 7am the front desk phones us to say that s our wake up call Which is fine Except we didn t ask for a bloody wake up call No apology No nothing Not one manager spoke to us about our disappointing stay after we complained numerous times Would stay again , Location was excellent 
205043,Commodore Hotel, the ubiquitous foam rubber pillows dim lighting for bathroom mirror shabby furnishings but forgivable for 95 in central London , Nice to have a double bed in a single room Neighbourhood attractive and very quiet 10 min walk from Paddington Staff very pleasant
205044,Commodore Hotel, Outside balcony with chairs and small table hasn t been cleaned in years Looks appalling Breakfast room is a bit small English breakfast is a bit stodgy Bacon and sausages were very salty and oily fried eggs just ok Better value for in small cafes around corner Corridors on non suite side were very narrow and pokey looking, large room Viceroy Suite pleasant staff
205045,Commodore Hotel, Check in was a bit lengthy having to supply ID then charged a 50 deposit for one night stay Emailed twice in the previous week to check in at 12pm as opposed to 2pm didnt get a reply , Great location beautiful hotel and room friendly staff
205046,Commodore Hotel, I stayed in basment which wasn t indicated during the reservation Worst thing was that every 10 minutes terrible noise came from boiler room which was adjacent to my room and we couldn t sleep Tip for other guests makes sure you indicate in your booking that you do not wish to stay in the basement,No Positive
205047,Commodore Hotel, The condition of the room in the hotel and apartment we had were not great floors had stains and the hotel room smelt a little musty wouldn t say it was 4 for hotel rooms Sofa bed in the apartment was extremely creaky and could not be folded so was a bit out of place in the lounge dining area and in the room for 3 there was barely a sofa bed just a thin small sofa with sheets on top if there are larger guests it would not be appropriate , Staff were very friendly lovely bathrooms both in apartment and normal room but apartment shower looked amazing but water came out unevenly for the big head shower but there was also a smaller hand held one inside which was good Even though the apartment floor had stains it still had the wow factor and a good main bed Bit pricey but what you would expect for the location Great for transport too taxi rank round the corner and bus stops 1 minute away not at all far from the station either 
205048,Commodore Hotel, The staff is kind and smiling Unfortunately behind this kindness there s no real willing to provide proper service On the second day of our staying in the hotel hot water finished in our room We had to move to another room The only available room was really downgraded although the at the reception we were told that it was a very good one It s enough to say that it was a smoked room It was also cold and the air conditioner was broken There was no personal lights near the beds and so on Only when I really insisted they finally found one better room , The location of this property is excellent It s close to the tube station and to the bus stops There are convenient stores in the area It s very close to Kensington Gardens 
205049,Commodore Hotel, The sound of furniture moving around in the room above but it didn t last long, Beds were comfy location was excellent and overall stay was very enjoyable
205050,Commodore Hotel, The bathroom was very dated Shower was good once we got it to work Fixtures and fittings looked very tired and worn Basic shower curtain replaced the obviously broken previous screen , The room was of a good size although a little strange with the bathroom on a higher level Staff seemed friendly and helpful 
205051,Commodore Hotel, The breakfast was very expensive 15 GBP for a mediocre meal , We liked being so close to the park and easy to access tube and bus lines Lots of good restaurants and pubs nearby Friendly helpful staff 
205052,Commodore Hotel, Carpet in the room was very threadbare and could do with either replacing or covering with a rug , Staff incredibly friendly room good price for a central London location 
205053,Commodore Hotel, Layout was a little odd No ironing facilities in the room Our shower was poor, Two minutes from Hyde Park We booked a suit with four poster which was well worth the little extra Breakfast cooked to order was a nice bonus It had an old quaint feel but wasn t lacking in amenities
205054,Commodore Hotel, the building is old so you can hear people walking and sometimes talking Could be disturbing at night, location is next to lancaster gate station staff are very helpful
205055,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful Hotel was located near to the train station and not far from anywhere we wanted to travel Rooms were clean but small and a great place to locate yourself when staying in London
205056,Commodore Hotel, See above, Booked for 2 nights at 164 on the first night the room had a cold wind blowing in the room room a c only made a sound but did not seem work went to receptionist at midnight to be reallocated another room this room was above 5 flights of stairs room carpet was un clean and tea kettle did not work no internet working even though wireless password given signal too weak even to check emails staff was friendly but hotel needs to be pulled Dow completely and re built I would definitely not come back here again 
205057,Commodore Hotel, It s advertised as a 4 hotel however I have stayed in hostels with better quality than this hotel I would not recommend to anyone As I had to complain twice to get my room changed as it was not what I payed for The shower as you can see in the pic I have posted the door is the opening forward so if you wanted to close to have a shower you would have to be a skinny minny to do it so otherwise you wouldn t be able to close the door , Nothing
205058,Commodore Hotel, Security deposit taken from me on arrival after payment with no previous mention and not returned until after I arrived home from my trip Lack of communication with staff after I requested a late check out I was disturbed 3 times within an hour ,No Positive
205059,Commodore Hotel, The room was basic and small Slightly outdated There was not a bar or anywhere to socialise The cleaner kept knocking on our door asking if we wanted a clean despite having checked twice the same day we had the door tag on too The lift was very small , The staff were friendly
205060,Commodore Hotel, Very run down Carpets threadbare and whole hotel is in need of decoration Noisy generator air system at night, Good location English breakfast ordered and cooked in kitchen which was nice but meant it took a lot longer than usual for breakfast 
205061,Commodore Hotel, The door between the bedroom and the lobby where the door to the bathroom is situated could not be shut as it crashed into the bed and therefore had to remain propped open with a chair which resulted in the reduced access to the desk , The bed was very comfortable
205062,Commodore Hotel, Staff friendly but miserable looking boss like lady hovering about makes it uncomfortable Beautiful furniture but odd modern and cheapstuff added inbetween makes it look cheap , Good location Nice hotel Clean and comfortable Close to tube 
205063,Commodore Hotel, There was a draft coming through to the room and right over the bed where I slept It was rather uncomfortable The shower curtain in the the bath would stick to you as you had a shower they should change for glass Also rooms were very small and dormitory like uninviting and bare also, Friendly staff great location
205064,Commodore Hotel, The bed was hard Had to ask for a plug for the bath It wasn t clear that breakfast was extra price for full breakfast was shown which made it appear that Continental breakfast was included , Breakfast was poor 
205065,Commodore Hotel, The hotel needs a serious refurbishing The carpets are disgraceful and all the furniture is old the bathroom needs a good re grout and they should really come up with a safer way to lock the windows I was on the ground floor and I had to climb onto a chair to close my window They also need a better wifi connection ,No Positive
205066,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The location is incredible the staff are accommodating and the rooms are very comfortable Its quite a small hotel and is quite an old building but all the rooms have been updated to a very high spec they are very modern and clean Perfect base for a stay in London city

205069,Commodore Hotel, Booked executive room but more like double room 206 not as advised on site TVs was poor could not get bbc Channels And had problem as text kept coming on screen electrical sockets where largely in excessable behind tv unit or under desk you had to get on your hands and knees to plug anything in including the kettle it also had to be placed on floor as the lead was not long enough asked at reception for another or an extension lead it never happened no bar in hotel either and only soft drinks in room fridge,No Positive
205070,Commodore Hotel, Rooms are a bit shabby and in need of refurbishment There are no lifts for certain parts of the building The hotel is a charming old buiding but carpets and furnishings are quite old and worn , Location excellent Staff very helpful and polite 
205071,Commodore Hotel, The sheets weren t that clean and the furniture in the room was somehow damaged The floor was heavily stained , The location is great It s opposite of Hyde Park in a very nice and clean neighbourhood The staff was really kind 
205072,Commodore Hotel, 1 I was given a room where I had to climb about 5 flights of stairs There was no lift 2 The bathroom was tiny and in the shower it was not possible to bend down or move your arms at all because of the size of the shower 3 There were two windows on the ceiling where light came down but there were no blinds to control the light It was difficult to rest and get decent sleep 4 I had paid for the room on line but at the time of check in I was told that it was not paid and I had to pay around 150 which was double the amount that I had already paid I asked the guy at the reception to check again I was then told that it was a mistake and the bill was someone else s However I was not offered any apology for this error , The hotel was very close to the tube station
205073,Commodore Hotel, Could do with a fresh coat of paint and a general tidy up, Friendly and accommodating staff great location between Queesnway Lancaster Gate tube stations close to a couple shops restaurants and cafes right next to Hyde Park 
205074,Commodore Hotel, Not enough room for a family of 6 Quality was quite bad , I had told them time of booking that we have young children they gave us the highest floor room The water kept going cold and the windows where ratting all night For 5 start hotel the room needs a builder to fix cracks and smashed draw Also the heating was not great 
205075,Commodore Hotel, The air conditioning unit made a noise all night resulting in not much sleep , The balcony was a nice surprise and the bed was comfy Having the use of the fridge was useful 
205076,Commodore Hotel, This is not a four star hotel 2 to 3 at best Rooms were tired and worn and many things did not work broken shower door TV not functioning and very poor internet connection , Well located and for a reasonable price 
205077,Commodore Hotel, Awful hotel certainly not 4 as we were led to believe Our friends had a room with step down to the room as soon as you entered the room it was dark and no notice of steps he walked in with his case and promptly fell down the flight of steps breaking his ankle in two places Ruined our weekend in London needless to say a long period of recovery for our friend Hotel staff uninterested when asked for first aider they gave us Savlon Asked to speak to manager no manager or deputy on site Rooms were disgusting thread bare stained carpets Electrics for shaving point hanging off in bathroom light switch by bed missing front cover Curtain rail just about hanging on If I was booking com I would remove them from my list of hotels and we normally use Booking com for most of our trips but would not be happy to see this hotel recommended to anyone Apart from anything else it is dangerous ,No Positive
205078,Commodore Hotel, DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL the hotel charged me three times for one night stay I emailed many times ask for refund and the hotel just ignored my email and no reply at all,No Positive
205079,Commodore Hotel, The ceiling was linking and they wanted to transfer us to a room on the basement A lot smaller than the one we had Only the next day after a huge argument suddenly they found one decent available room Very rude manager The worse hotel I ve been the last ten years Too old without facilities not even a decent coffee area Would not recommend for any reason , Only the location
205080,Commodore Hotel, The fact there was a noisy fan outside kept me awake half the night in room 402 Also when having a bath we were told that the water was going through the ceiling and down the walls in room underneath It must have been the overflow pipe not correctly plumbed as none had spilt over the edge , The staff were very helpful Also very near an underground and close to beautiful Hyde Park Clean towels each day and beds made nicely
205081,Commodore Hotel, The standard of the room was below average considering the price we paid There was lots of little things about the room that brought down the overall quality For example there were holes in the walls partially covered by paintings The tv reception was often poor and would drop out There was a big crack in the floor in the corner by the shower where water would gather after dripping down the side of the shower wall As a result you could tell there was water damage to the floor underneath as it was quite warped You could tell there would be issues in future with water leaking down the walls into the floors below causing mould and structural issues Also there was no lift in the building at all which was a pain and something I didn t realise before booking here We were lucky to be on the second floor but could imagine it would have been difficult for those who ended up with a room on one of the floors above ours , The staff were generally friendly and accommodating When it came time to leave they helped us by organising a taxi to take us to the airport which was much appreciated The room was kept clean and items like shampoo soaps and lotion were good quality and topped up regularly The bed was fairy comfortable and the room was a good size for the two of us 
205082,Commodore Hotel, The shower couldn t make its mind up it was either too hot or too cold , It was 5 minutes walk to the tube The staff were very helpful We even got a free upgrade 
205083,Commodore Hotel, We were given the wrong room to begin with but this was quickly rectified Cleaning staff weren t notified that we requested late check out , Good location only a few minutes from the tube Nice room space and a balcony terrace for out particular room 
205084,Commodore Hotel, Room was very basic which is partially understandable as its in london but cleanliness waa questionable at one point upon entering the room we saw a beetle cockroach run actoss the floor The biggest problem however was the squeaky floorboards and bed we were woken up multiple points during the night because of this and were both restless the following day as a result Will not be staying here again , Desk staff seemed pleasent location was good
205085,Commodore Hotel, Room was small and there was noise from something to do with heating plumbing Some confusion over breakfast charge rate and also what had been taken from the card deposit and what had been refunded Eventually sorted but irritating , Reasonably convenient for Paddington station 
205086,Commodore Hotel, 50 pound deposit paid on arrival incase of any breakages No BBC on TV some creaky noises overnight , Great find on booking com got it for 65 for the night Great location near to Hyde Park and close to tube stations Lovely high quality hotel and room

205090,Commodore Hotel, Although it s clean and neat the hotel is looking a bit shabby now for a 4 Carpets in my room were stained and paint peeling off walls in public areas of hotel Quiet area with a few pubs but not for people looking for exciting nightlife Will have to travel on the tubes to other areas , Quiet residential area yet still close to the tube stations Close to beautiful park Small and intimate hotel Suitable for a place to sleep as we were out all day 
205091,Commodore Hotel, The hotel decor is becoming rather tired and the facilities have deteriorated over the years I have been visiting I suspect this is due to a change of ownership First time I have never had a continental breakfast included , My complaint was dealt with very effectively Staff helpful and polite Location is excellent which is why we stay there and will continue to do so 
205092,Commodore Hotel, the Internet is very very slow you can t upload or download any images the room is very very small not like the pictures there is no lift, The location only
205093,Commodore Hotel, The room was quite tatty Dirty stained carpets lighting was thick with dust and bathroom had a lot of wood rot Paintings on wall were not straight some missing so stains on wall from where they were missing in need of a make over Just feel that because we got a cheap deal we were put in a room that was below 4 star standard The carpets on the level to the room were torn in places trip hazard And again old and tatty , The location was ideal for Royal Albert hall and history museum It was also in a very quiet area from the main road Within walking distance to Paddington and tube links Hyde park a 2 minute walk It was a short stay so comfortable but would not be happy for a long holiday in the specific room we had 
205094,Commodore Hotel, Beautiful room but I feel in need of some TLC Lots of little things that made the room look slightly shabby which made you feel that general housekeeping wasn t high on the agender , Quiet location within easy travel distance of everything 
205095,Commodore Hotel, Bad security Dead bolt lock broken Member of staff entered room at 2am without knocking even with do not disturb sign on door Unacceptable, Helpful staff
205096,Commodore Hotel, Breakfast was not included in the room price , Excellent location Beautiful building We had an issue with our room however we were moved immediately to another one with an upgrade The staff was very friendly always This will be the place to stay whenever I travel to London 
205097,Commodore Hotel, On arrival i reported telephone not working no kettle and bed side lamp not working Kettle replace straight away 30 mins later a telephone guy came but after about 30 mins said he could not fix it He would return tomorrow When we left the lamp still had not been fixed and the telephone was inoperative Hence we could not use room service which ruined the stay of being in a very elite hotel and we had to go upstairs and order what we should have had a phone for , Location just 10 min walk to tube Princess Diana s home and park 5 mins walk across the road Staff very friendly and Helpful King size bed and large room very clean Breakfast and staff excellent Wifi available for free excellent food 
205098,Commodore Hotel, We 4 friends had booked a 2 bedroom apartment which was down in the basement no info on the website of that with a bunker feeling and a clear smell of mould We were offered a 1 bedroom apartment with a sofabed in replacement and the feeling from the concierge was that if we did not accept it we would not have anywhere to stay or had to go back in to the basement The apartment was poorly equipped so we did not even think about using the kitchen It was really cold in the apartment 18 so when inside we sat in the bed with our blankets on The breakfast we paid a lot extra for was not worth the penny For the same sum you get a full English breakfast at any cafe in the neighbourhood , The man taking care of the luggage made his everything to make this stay a positive experience Without his spirit of helping us this would have been an even greater disaster 
205099,Commodore Hotel, Being an older building the walls and roof are very thin so noise including upstairs footsteps are very present , Friendly staff very helpful and speak a number of languages Absolutely beautiful building in a great area minutes walk from the park 
205100,Commodore Hotel, There was a small problem on checking in when I discovered that the room I was allocated was still in use The staff though dealt with it very quickly and I ended up with a really good room , For the points highlighted above
205101,Commodore Hotel, We booked and paid for an Executive Double Room When we returned home we realised that we had been put in a standard room This is not an honourable practice It is not a 4 star hotel The decor and the carpets need to be upgraded Also we would have liked if there had been a bar in the hotel , In view of some negative reviews we were dreading our visit to this hotel However we were delighted with the location which was perfect for our visit The room was clean and warm in what was very cold weather The staff was very helpful and polite 
205102,Commodore Hotel, The rooms were dirty Especially the carpets and sink The electrical box was exposed above the door way The tv cabinet doors were broken The sofa bed had big gaps between the end of the frame and maytress at both ends This is very dangerous for children becoming trapped The breakfast was none existent and extremely expensive We were given upgrades so i don t know what the otber rooms were like The 4 poster bed was comfy Tey didn t replenish the taea or coffee or put clean cups in the room after the first night The hotel was just lacking in all areas For the price and being in london I expected much more I recommend it if you can get a cheap deal We paid 330 253 for our rooms for 2 nights I wouldn t say it was value for money You are better off staying in a travel lodge or premier inn The location is good for winter wonderland We were disapointed , Good location for winter wonderland
205103,Commodore Hotel, In need of upgrading especially some common areas and the lift is so small First room given was so small we had no room where to put our luggage Second room given larger with outdated furniture but OK Noise from generator coming from internal courtyard Highly priced for value given both for breakfast and comfort Cannot rate it for a 4 star hotel , Excellent location and the staff was helpful with our queries
205104,Commodore Hotel, The room was dirty and smells so bad The shower room didn t have any curtain The hair driver was broken But the price wasn t cheap If the photos of the booking com had told us the true situation we wouldn t have reserved I never advice you to reserve this hotel Absolutely not , The staffs are very kind This is one and only good point 
205105,Commodore Hotel, We are a couple with 2 kids and we rented an apartment It did not work the TV the Refrigerator the toilet the windows did not close At the reception the only solution that gave us was we stay in hotel separate rooms Not accepted we separated and 22h said there was responsible person who wanted that we could not go to sleep the other hand the problem is we had already paid advance They were very rude and arrogant More inform you that the apartments are away from the hotel and that there is no mention of this and that the apartments have no lift ,No Positive
205106,Commodore Hotel, The hotel room was small and not very well appointed The Hotel was gloomy and in need of a face lift There were Health and Safety issues in that the stair carpet on the 6 th floor was fraying and loose trip hazards I have photographs The staff plainly have not had any training in customer relations or of working in a service industry Once my daughter and I had booked in NO member of staff spoke to us at all not even to say Good Morning or have you had a pleasant day it was as if we had become invisible Having not taken any heed of us as we left and returned to the Hotel I cannot imagine what a problem there would have been had there been a fire who is in the building who is not in the building the staff would not have had a clue I used to be a Management Surveyor and therefore know a lot about safety issues and the power that the Health and Safety Executive possesses Neither of the two men at Reception on the day we left made a move to help me with my case down the steps I am 71 years old female I suspect they were still reeling after I gave them my views on the Hotel It was unfortunate for this Hotel that the hotel we had staying the night before was a Premier Inn which was light bright slick and ALL the staff were smiling helpful and looked as if they gave a damn what our stay was like And happily their floors did not creak every time we made a move it was more central and also was marginally cheaper The only cheery person I encountered at the Commodore was Vincy the person who carried our cases to the room for us , Nothing 
205107,Commodore Hotel, Noise on lower level floor woke me up several times lift too small shower needs updating, Great location lovely room fantastic staff couldn t of helped any more comfy beds spacious room
205108,Commodore Hotel, Room 510 the double room was extremely small and it was difficult for two people to move around the room There was no space to put luggage Rooms weren t ready at 2pm as they were still being cleaned Daily room and bathroom cleaning was poor , Breakfast was good 
205109,Commodore Hotel, as a single traveller you always end up on the top floor in the smallest room bathroom and room were tiny , Excellent location good value for money it is central London and for that reasonably priced 
205110,Commodore Hotel, Access to accommodation awful awful apartment awful access in main hotel no responsibility accepted for any problems We overpaid for the accommodation we got they would not return left toilet bag full of expensive items without being able to use my credit card up to 50 Booking com also not helpful at all would not recommend either to any one even though we have used booking com quite a lot ,No Positive
205111,Commodore Hotel, Could hear corridor noise but it wasn t constant so didn t bother us In reality I ve heard noise from corridors in every hotel I ve stayed in , Very nice room and massive bed Close to tube station 
205112,Commodore Hotel, The reception area of the hotel is nice but the corridors and rooms are shabby with torn carpets and chipped furniture Overall the decor looks tired and not very clean The bed sagged and requires a change of mattress Multiple plugpoints did not work and the bedside lamp was broken , The location of the hotel is good as it is close to tube stations Paddington railway station and Hyde Park 
205113,Commodore Hotel, The facilities The shower glass door was damaged and could potentially cause an injury The curtains were torn It looked a bit shabby , The location is great Opposite Hyde Park next to a tube station but far enough to be quiet 
205114,Commodore Hotel, No bar Very dated Rooms were advertised completely different to what they were I had booked a four poster suite expecting something a little extra special but basically got a normal sized room with a four poster bed And didn t receive my complementary bowl of fruit , Location was very good good transport links and a very quiet area staff were very helpful and friendly 
205115,Commodore Hotel, Room decor In room facilities Door to room had a massive gap underneath so you can hear everything outside your room Within half an hour we had 4 house keeping people just enter the room without knocking Breakfast times not made clear so we lost 33pounds for 3 breakfasts Staff were rude about it as well , Location

205117,Commodore Hotel, NO idea why this has a star rating It was awful Threaded carpets tiny poky rooms horrible stale breakfast charged extra at 9 50 I tried to be in as little as possible and out as fast as I could , Nothing really It was all such a disappointment 
205118,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, Customer service was very good and they kindly upgraded us as the first room they gave us was not what was in the pictures However it is quite tired and the decor is quite old fashioned It probably needs a makeover To be fair to the staff though they were very helpful and friendly and on the whole we had a lovely stay The location was fab for Winter Wonderland and the price was good 
205119,Commodore Hotel, Glass Table in lounge the glass was not connected to the table This was extremely dangerous and could break someones foot , The fact we had our own apartment
205120,Commodore Hotel, The bathroom was a little small and the floorboards very loud and squeaky but overall our visit was good , Really liked the comfort and cleanliness overall 
205121,Commodore Hotel, besides the lobby the rooms and corridor need a real refurbishment including new carpet The carpets are absolutely disgusting and the bathroom is in a really bad shape , The location was great

205126,Commodore Hotel, The rooms were very old fashioned and smelt funny but it s just a place to sleep so was fine , The location was amazing you can walk two minutes to the tube station and a few minutes to lots of restaurants 
205127,Commodore Hotel, Plenty of notices saying the hotel was not responsible for etc First impression not positive Then you are asked for a deposit to cover damage to the room etc Given that we are in our 75 year common sense should be used I understand that the hotel cannot be responsible for a number of things but this info can be provided in the room Not when you walk in the front door ,No Positive

205130,Commodore Hotel, The first room that we went in we had to reject due to mould and dirty bathroom The second room was very hot as the heating was on constantly and you could not regulate the radiators as there were no valves Overall the rooms looked shabby and unclean , The staff were pleasant enough and the hotel was in a good location
205131,Commodore Hotel, This trip was different for an array of reasons starting with the removal of the bar on the ground floor This was also followed by the removal of alcohol from the minibars which really isn t a big deal but the lack of choice and openess is evident The staff has all but changed and really needs to be brought up to speed about certain things , I love the location of the commodore and have always been a fan of the services provided 
205132,Commodore Hotel, It took a while to check in this process needs updating The hotels needs a refurbishment The room service menu is not great and few close restaurants I would advise dinner before checking in after a long day , The staff were polite
205133,Commodore Hotel, A bit outdated you have to book at clever price , It s very close to the Hide Park and to the red line of tube you can get fast anywere Non noise around in the night 
205134,Commodore Hotel, The shower in our room didn t work properly and the room had a lot of wear and tear throughout it the bed also wasn t the most comfortable Although the location and staff were excellent the room itself could do with a good revamp , Location is excellent walking distance to Oxford St and main shopping districts Great value for money and the staff were one of the best I ve had on my many trips to London

205141,Commodore Hotel, When I got to the hotel I was told that I can have my room from 2pm At 2pm it was nowhere close to ready to occupy They kept me waiting for a long time 1 5 hours and didn t let me know when I can have my room I had to check it for myself The room was very smelly First I thought I would simply leave the hotel but then I opened all windows and got rid of most of the smell The room became cold and though I turned the heating to maximum it didn t help much Old ugly smelly furniture Staff forgot to give me 2nd password for wi fi 2 device with me needing internet access Had to go back down to reception and ask for one In the morning the cleaning lady entered the room though there was the sign do not disturb Would never go back , It was quiet

205149,Commodore Hotel, Unfortunately a very bland experience a hotel that seems to rely solely on location to get customers Not making any kind of lasting impression and therefore no incentive for me to go back On arrival I was given an upgrade for some reason and therefore given a double room w twin beds What use I as a single traveler have of a room w two beds is a mystery to me , Location Nothing more 
205150,Commodore Hotel, I was upgraded I did not ask for the upgrade to appartment accommodation a short walk from the hotel The porter who accompanied me was new and we ended up climbing numours stairs in error When I final got to my room I did not like the alone feeling also the hotel had no restaurant for dinner and they did not do room service to the appartments so I walked back to the hotel where they were able to give me a nice room in the hotel it would have saved an unpleasant experience if they had done this first , The bed was comfortable The room service curry was excellent

205169,Commodore Hotel, Although comfortable and clean the room and corridor carpets need replacement Was on the sixth floor and the lift motor made quite a noise Internet service from room was useless and in the lobby was extremely slow , The location although the tube station is one of least comfortable it is good Back after the hassle of centre London and the walk from station is of tranquillity One minute from beautiful Hyde Park Good selection of TV stations good sized bathroom and helpful staff 
205170,Commodore Hotel, The staff are not willing to help sincerely I have to Google everything Because they are not willing to help Veeeery small room, 15 min walk to Oxford Street London Marble Arch Very big terrace
205171,Commodore Hotel, There was no one to help us wth our luggage when we arrived we were very tired naturally after a 24 hour flight but had to carry out cases up four flights of stairs Dirty bathroom with mould curtains falling off rods crooked lampshades No one knew what was going on at reception first we were told breakfast was included then it wasn t We rang for s bottle opener as the drinks in mini bar needed a bottle opener must only be one in whole hotel as the man waited while we opened bottle and took it away Also we rang and requested an extra glass but never received it It was bit like Fawlty Towers , The location was fabulous 
205172,Commodore Hotel, Hotel needs interior make over carpets and walls are worn and dirty bath tub curtain was dirty, Address in Bayswater proximity to Hyde Park quiet and safe neighbourhood nice buildings judged from outer appearance in the street
205173,Commodore Hotel, The initial suite we booked didn t have the 4 poster bed we had requested The manager upgraded us for free to an apartment however this was probably in a worse condition There s was broken furniture the flush was missing from the toilet in the main bathroom and both floors in both showers had been sprayed with some kind of glue adhesive which you stuck to when used and also released a very strong smell so we had to sleep with the window open in Nov , The location was ideal for our visit and the area was peaceful Breakfast was nice 
205174,Commodore Hotel, A chaotic checking in process where my room had been overbooked so the manager tried to bully me and a colleague into sharing a different room but I refused so eventually I was given the smallest room I have ever stayed in although perfectly clean , The perfect location for central london next to Hyde Park and two minutes from the underground station 
205175,Commodore Hotel, Stairs my mum had alot of trouble get down up breakfast time to our room , Room was lovely loved the four posterbedbed staff very very friendly 
205176,Commodore Hotel, The ridiculous run around I was given by yourselves and the hotel when trying to pre pay for the room du to the fact that I would nt actually be staying at the hotel The fact that it took 3 viewings for my party to find a room i pre paid for 2 Breakfasts only for my party to be told that they could nt have breakfast at 6 50 7am in the morning With regards to a refund they were told to speak to the manager who of course was not working at the time , Nothing absolutely nothing 
205177,Commodore Hotel, Wished there more restaurants near by , The staff were fantastic I think the property needs a bit of a refresh The carpets in the hall need replacing The bar fridge had no prices so weren t sure the price of anything Being close to Hyde Park was fantastic 
205178,Commodore Hotel, No bar no room service We had the noisiest of rooms coming from the tube and aircon basement room The bed linen was too small for the bed , Great location for central London Close to some good family restaurants Nice pleasant staff Nice size bed 
205179,Commodore Hotel, We couldn t get the room we booked which was a 4 post bed suite with a balcony so the receptionist said there were maintenance issues so for the 1st night we were put in a normal hotel room and weren t refunded any money the second night we were put into the type of room we wanted but minus the balcony which we specifically booked So we went down to breakfast in the morning but were 5 mins late our fault the waitress said she can give us some croissants and coffee and we can go back to our room which made us feel like we ve been bad and should be punished So we complained and this time she said the customer extended their stay which is different from what she said before after all that we still had to pay full price for the room we didn t get , Beds were satisfactory comply
205180,Commodore Hotel, Tiny room it was a twin but that was ok for a weekend where we were out most of the time , Location was fabulous near Lancaster Gate tube and Hyde Park

205186,Commodore Hotel, A little bit dingy and grotty Neither of the lamps in my room worked for example and the fuseboard lacked a cover which gave the room quite a dilapidated look Fitness facilities looked to be in dire need of updating Also I was not allowed a late checkout , Great location and price relative to other London hotels Very large and comfortable bed 
205187,Commodore Hotel, Nothing the place is great and the staff are really friendly and helpfull i would have no hesitation in staying there again, We booked 2 rooms as we were travelling as a family when i had to visit London to collect a work visa 5 adaults and one toddler When we arrive they had changed our booking to a 2 bed aparment which was great for us for breakfast etc with the young one Good location with shops restraunts and bars on the doorstep

205194,Commodore Hotel, The building is Victorian so is in need of repair but this is being addressed by the new manager Don t let this put you off , The room was clean and very comfortable I had a great nights sleep I got a really quiet room too which was lovely Location is great just on the edge of Hyde Park and the staff were really friendly and helpful giving me some recommendations on local places to eat The room had some gorgeous antique furniture in it which was in keeping with the building and made a nice change to the usual modern rooms Very nice 
205195,Commodore Hotel, The room booklet and the notices downstairs all advertise afternoon tea in the lobby and yet we never saw it happen and the staff were completely unaware of it when asked You can hear footsteps from upstairs rooms quite loudly in the room , The location is great and the staff are friendly and helpful 
205196,Commodore Hotel, The decor in the room needed updating The bedside lamps did not work and one was missing The shower facility needed careful handling otherwise it flooded the floor , very close to all amenities and a good bus service to many parts of London Opposite Hyde Park allowing us to walk to many areas 
205197,Commodore Hotel, Room carpets were worn and tired looking Reception had trouble finding my booking confirmation even though it was booked the week before and at one point thought I was going to have to sleep in the stables , Location

205204,Commodore Hotel, Staff advised that renovations were imminent Hotel interior badly in need of this Plumbing issues with water leaking into my shower when the room above used their shower No heat for first 2 days and while staff were polite I am not convinced that they understand customer service , 1 Location 2 David the young man who was able to get the heat sorted 
205205,Commodore Hotel, The loading of laundry into a truck was done at one in the morning which was very disturbing with all the shouting and noises by the van staff Probably not under control by the hotel but still annoying, Good location Friendly staff Overall cleanliness was good 
205206,Commodore Hotel, No elevator at apartment unit My friend stay at twin bed unit but the air condition is not working For what I heard they are not the only case the facility is kind of old and lack of maintenance , Good location quite neighborhood Apartment unit for family is not a bad choice 
205207,Commodore Hotel, Disguising cleanliness The carpets are so dirty I would never think of lying or sitting on the floor The bed spread on my bed was so full of dust that my eyes became itchy when lifting it to pull it up or off it took 2 requests to have it changed to a clean one The internet works spasmodically I was moved 3 times in my first day as the first room was so small you could not walk around the bed and it had no TV as advertised The second room had no internet reception The third room had two broken bedside lights which were never repaired but I had given up changing rooms Lying in bed at night you can hear all the movement from the rooms next to you and above and even hear them talking My bed only got made properly twice in my 10 days The other days a half baked attempt was made to pull the blanket up without even straightening the sheets The only electrical plug is under the tiny desk so I had to boil the kettle under the desk and charge my phone plug in my computer in the same place My laundry was lost until found included in another room s laundry Normally when travelling your hotel room can be a sanctuary from a busy day I dreaded coming back to the hotel every evening and on the weekends made sure that I stayed out all day Booking com refused to let me cancel as I had prepaid which given the state of the hotel is a very poor reflection on bookings com as well , location is good access to subway rail and close to many tourist attractions
205208,Commodore Hotel, Size of room none working equipment noisy lift near bedroom through out the night very poor decor and every thing needed upgrading , Location and staff attitude
205209,Commodore Hotel, Even though our room was grand it was showing signs of neglect and disrepair things were tired and not cared for toilet not working properly and the shower broken the bed was old and ok to sleep in also wifi was spotty at best in room upkeep has not been done This hotel has huge potential with a little money invested but I can t recommend it as is feel bad for the staff owner s need to read these , We had seen all the negative reviews and were apprehensive walking in we were met by Vicency at the door who was over the top friendly and helpful we got there early and were shown our room in 30 minutes At first glance our room was wonderfully grand with a canopied bed and period furniture even had a balcony we wondered where the negative was coming from location was fantastic our room ceilings were 15 feet high 
205210,Commodore Hotel, there are squeaking sounds from the floor when you step on it in the room and you can her it from the other rooms and it s very disturbing the room I paid for was an executive one but I found out it was very small and it was not as shown on the booking web site the hall was small an narrow the hotel had only one lift and it was small and narrow as well the furniture was old and not in a classic way it is a motel not a hotel I can t believe someone gave it a 4 star hotel I don t recommend this hotel to my enemies , the only positive thing about this hotel is that is near the hyde park 
205211,Commodore Hotel, A bit old and tired We were upgraded to executive suite We would hate to see what the double was like Tiles in bathroom need a scrub Carpets tatty at the ends Worn in corridors We stayed one night and that was fine Anymore and we would have changed hotel and asked for refund No information of prices of minibar , Staff friendly and can t do enough for you Breakfast was lovely

205215,Commodore Hotel, The hotel is old and so dirty The rude lady at the reception said that the room is cleaned every 2 days They just empty the trash bin everyday Is that really a 4 star hotel The cleaning staff do not work at all It was a horrible stay , Shawn the manager was very nice and tried to fix the problems

205218,Commodore Hotel, Terrible customer service Never a 4 star hotel We booked a one bed apartment which they didn t reserve for us and then tried to give us two very poor condition double bedrooms and tried to blame Booking com for this mix up and then lied about the reasons for this Cleanliness needs improved Constant stream of complaints from all customers when we were there We will never return here nor recommend this hotel to anyone Noisey pipework and air con system rattled all night I could go on , The location was ideal

205221,Commodore Hotel,No Negative, The staff were pleasant and effective the room good and clean and quiet the breakfast was good and the price excellent value for money compared to other central London hotels 
205222,Commodore Hotel, A little bit worn and not 5 experience but for the price that wasn t expected Check in could have been smoother as staff and systems a bit slow but all in all very good , Great cheap last minute place to stay clean and comfortable and of a high standard for central London and for the price 
205223,Commodore Hotel, Pictures on Booking com left much to be desired The room was very small and very poorly cleaned Definitely not worth the value If you like a nice bed and clean facilities look elsewhere The staff was also quite rude and unwelcomeing , Great location near Kings Cross station

205229,Commodore Hotel, Rooms appear clearly very dirty very old The pavement was floating and the moquette was dirty and broken in several points The furniture was full of dents and the bathroom had clear signs of calcare on the walls probably due to water leakage from the room above , the presence of a gym

205240,Commodore Hotel, Hotel decor is tired and grubby Door to veranda was difficult to lock and once I had done it I couldn t open it A bit worrying when you are travelling alone The room has a damp problem so it smelled musty and unpleasant I could hear the person moving around in the room above as tbe floorboards creaked and they were up at 6 00 am so was I , Location and I was upgraded to a double room from a single Warm greeting on arrival by the doorman and help with luggage
