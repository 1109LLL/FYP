70629,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Decor a little unusual Strange floor coverings and wall paper The room had a slightly musty smell , Close to restaurants Good Parisian breakfast Comfortable bed Clean hotel 
70630,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The room was clean Had no idea what room to expect but to come in with lots of flies flying around in your room that s just unhygienic They gave us a room facing the street and because we were staying on the weekend it was so noisy someone was having a party and we didn t get any sleep till 3am every night and then people checking out at 5am leaving their room woke us up too because you can just hear everything My girlfriend left her jacket on the Eurostar and I asked in the reception if they could talk in french and ask if anyone had hand it in by any chance and they didn t bother to just said leave early and ask for yourself , The location is brilliant short walking distance to the Eiffel tower Taxi service was very fast too They also let us leave our luggage with them after check out which was helpful 
70631,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, WiFi was barely functional not possible to work on it Made it less than ideal for a business trip , Room was beautiful and bed super comfortable Great location close to the Eiffel tower 
70632,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The room air Cond didn t work and slept with the window open , The quietness of the room hotel location and convienance of the location in relation to the major attractions
70633,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Room very small and cramped with too much furniture Oddly the toilet was separate Very few facilities and not worth 4 stars , At 19 euros did not eat breakfast Too expensive Beds comfy linen very good 
70634,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, N A, The standard of the room hotel was fantastic very clean very comfortable The staff location was excellent A Brilliant boutique hotel
70635,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, extremely small room very uncomfortable bathroom and toilet without privacy bathroom not separated from room and toilet not providing privacy, great location very kind staff clean and cozy decor 
70636,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Only one thing We arrived on Saturday evening but rooftop bar was closed on Sunday and Monday and then we left so we never got to use it That s it though everything else was great , Everything Hotel was lovely in good location staff were lovely got upgraded when we arrived Was great would recommend it 
70637,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The breakfast staff were unsociable the food was just brought to you without asking what you would like the bathrooms had no door so no privacy and with mirrors everywhere I felt unsafe as there were glass panels in the bathroom and the shower soaked the floor, The staff on reception were very good the bed was comfortable and the hotel very clean
70638,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The television had very few channels especially for the English , The staff were extremely helpful with all of our needs and requests Loved how close to the Eiffel Tower we were Great location and everything we needed was in walking distance I e shops hairdressers restaurants metro We will definitely stay here again 
70639,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The breakfast was expensive and not much to choose from, The shower in our room was amazing the bed and the terrace on the rooftop they were also amazing
70640,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The wifi seemed to have serious issues It would work for about 30 minutes before dieing The speed was slow but fine I just wish the internet would have stopped droping, Great location cute room great food walking distance to so many things 
70641,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Wifi is terrible Cuts out all the time slow speed just terrible Breakfast They don t serve hot egg dishes Like omelettes or fried eggs That was surprising , Amazing housekeeping and stuff very responsive Good location Very close to Champs Elysees Taxi stop right nearby so never wait too long for the car Great value for money 
70642,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Nothing I think they re doing an awesome job , The design of the hotel is gorgeous It s full of little nice details very bright and friendly I wish I could have spent more time in the splendid lobby The staff is competent and nice The location is great walking distance to the Eiffel Tower rue Cler with a lot of little authentic restaurants and fast access to bus metro and cabs 
70643,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The elevator was not working at all and I have to carry my bags from the third floor to till the reception when I did the check out All TV channel was French It was value for money 250 per night,No Positive
70644,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The lift was out of order until Monday this is Saturday The access to the room is via an exterior staircase we were on the 4th floor although this is not the fault of the staff they seemed a little too non apologetic about this The towels and bathrobes could do with some fabric softener Breakfast service is correct excellent fresh orange juice but the breakfast itself is disappointing for a Hotel This could be really simplified with a decent buffet During the night we could hear people talking in the courtyard despite the double glazing and sound proofing but no big deal it is the centre of Paris, Location excellent and the room deco was funky Within a few minutes you are standing below the Eiffel Tower The terrace is very different and cozy thank you to the barman for his cherry service The room was spotless 
70645,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, like most Paris hotels the room is small but the mirror design did change its perspective , The shower was just amazing and the bed was really comfortable My friend and I were able to relax properly Location was perfect 15 minutes walk to the Eiffel tower and less than 5 to the metro station 
70646,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Unfortunately the lift was out of order every time have to climb all the stairs , Friendly staffs only take 5 mins walk to the Metro station cafe restaurants nearby
70647,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The room was quite small but acceptable considering the location but the toilet was abysmal Separate from the small bathroom with no wash basin Imagine a broom cupboard 3 feet deep with a toilet and there you have it Very uncomfortable Front desk staff so so 2 female staff on duty early in the morning when we passed through the empty reception area didn t even bother to greet us with a good morning but just continued to speak to each other as if we were invisible , The location was excellent close to all amenities in a bubbly district of Paris
70648,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Staff were very efficient and professional but didn t find gentlemen on reception very friendly When I arrived there was no offer of maps of the area efficient but not friendly or cheerful The lady who was there in the evening was much friendlier , Location was great Room was comfortable 
70649,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Roof terrace service was a little hit and miss as the bar was on the ground floor , Rooms were a good size for Paris good location and roof top bar was a great addition 
70650,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Nothing to say no faults, The whole Hotel experience was amazing All the staff couldn t do enough for you One if not the best hotels we have ever stayed in
70651,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The toilet was very tiny Room ventilation was poor AC was awesome just not much fresh air , The night reception lady was super friendly and welcoming She made our stay very special 
70652,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Nothing , We were delighted with our stay at 7 Eiffel We were upgraded at no charge on our arrival and the staff were very helpful and friendly The location is fantastic a few minutes from the Metro and Eiffel Tower The hotel is styled in a modern way but with lots of personality Very much recommended 
70653,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, The breakfast , The shower The decor Proximity to Eiffel Tower and so many eateries The pink lit front entrance which allows you to identify you ve reached home amongst all the other hotels after a late night The Creperie across the road 
70654,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Thin walls street noise wifi connection could be faster front desk clerk gave us suitcases from other guests when we were leaving, Comfy bed good location nicely decorated hotel we had access to our room at 12 pm rain shower
70655,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel,No Negative, We chose this hotel based on the comments that it was quiet and had comfortable beds The location is sensational and walking distance to the Eiffel Tower Seinne river and Champs lys es Also surrounded by great little cafes A really fabo 2 day stay
70656,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, I couldn t get the radio to work on the AV system , Clean and comfortable room Not spacious but not cramped well designed Helpful and friendly staff Good location quiet yet central 
70657,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, It look like a interior decorator student took every opportunity to use their course in textures to dictate the hotel From the faux brick carpet to the textured walls it was unsettling , Location
70658,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Very noisy Road Very cold room Electrics went in the room two out of the three nights Heating wasn t working in room Average breakfast , Bed was comfortable Nicely decorated hotel 
70659,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, Booking room included Breakfast state on Booking show Buffet quite surprised we have to sit down and only one staff serving 2 eggs 3 bread pastries yogurt coffee orange juice fruit salad That s all so don t expecting full English breakfast , Good location and close to Metro 
70660,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel,No Negative, We stayed here as my daughter is living in Paris this year and it is near her apartment in the 7th I know Paris well and from here it is easy to walk to lots of famous monuments and galleries The rooms are comfortable especially the beds and there are rooms with walk in showers The most important thing though was that the staff were so friendly and chatty which dare I say is not always the case in Paris hotels They could not have been more helpful Tip I set up an uber account on my phone as I had my elderly mother with me and this proved invaluable 
70661,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely lovely hotel staff are so attentive and couldn t do enough for us the roof top terrace was so peaceful and the barman kept popping up to make sure we were satisfied perfect location to all tourists spots only about 5 10 mins from the Eiffel Tower Definitely recommend 
70662,Le 7 Eiffel Hotel, We realised the day before departure that our flights were actually much later than expected We looked for a possible late checkout and were told that it wasn t possible as the hotel was fully booked for the following night However we were then told that we could book an extra room at full cost how this was possible if the hotel was fully booked i don t know , The location was fantastic Easy access to everything and the area was pretty quiet also for such a busy part of Paris
