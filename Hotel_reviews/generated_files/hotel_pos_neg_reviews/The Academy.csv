103896,The Academy,No Negative, When we arrived we were shown a small room in the attic 4 flights of stairs When I explained I was not too happy they changed us to a ground floor room twice the size at no extra cost 
103897,The Academy, I probably got the smallest room in the entire Hotel Advertised were 14 m2 the real room felt like 7 m2 Like a maidens room in a classic house On one side there was a sloping wall from the Roof It felt quite tiny Temperature in there was very hot because it was on the last floor On my departure day a staff member approached in my room in the morning just to check drinks in the mini bar Strange I didn t feel very welcome in this Hotel , The Hotel is situated in a block of traditional english houses near the University Campus in Bloomsbury Very Close to the West End The interior is nicely designed in a classic style 
103898,The Academy,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and polite The single room was comfortable and thoughtfully laid out A small thing that I particularly liked was that bottled water in the room which I drank was replaced by a fresh bottle when the room was cleaned Something that many larger hotels fail to do I think it reflects the attention to detail The bed was comfy and the room on the back of the building very quite overnight even though I had the window open The decor is not the most contemporary but its a Georgian building and it suits the style It was a great location and a good price for a central London hotel in July I will definitely book again
103899,The Academy, Air conditioner unit leaked all over the floor at one point and was incredibly loud the rest of the time Hairdryer provided but one blew a fuse and the next one would only work for 10 seconds at a time Breakfast was a rip off 13 95 for full English but my mother only wanted the bacon and tomato so was given half a tomato and 1 rasher of bacon And the continental selection was poor on 2 of the 4 days they ran out of fruit by the time we got there at 8ish , The staff were lovely nothing was too much trouble Especially the young man who helped with our bags brought room service fixed our air conditioner unit The beds were really comfy as well had a lovely night s sleep 
103900,The Academy, Little bit grubby Really noisy pipework in attic room Air con didn t work well and you can t open windows so a little stuffy Our blind was broken light bulbs out Stains on the throw on the bed Window sill was really mouldy etc The place needs some love and attention , Cheap Good central location but still a quiet neighbourhood no street noise from bars clubs Comfortable bed Nice toiletries in bathroom 
103901,The Academy, The TV didn t work There was no iPod dock as advertised in the room There was a water leak from the light fixture in the room , The bed was very comfortable
103902,The Academy, Bathroom sink rather old and narrow with no catch in the sink shower was more modern and sufficient Several flights up to room without a lift although a porter was available to help with baggage WiFi access was good and complementary as part of the booking but required a new log in every 24hrs for each device Breakfast not included in room rate which is a bit pricier than other hotels along Gower Street Another potential drawback was the terms conditions of booking which did not permit a refund for cancellation or change post booking Luckily we did not have any changes and arrived in time from a longhaul but it could have been a concern , Excellent location for public transport access to city and stations and British Museum and other cultural sites Private garden areas in the hotel which were very pleasant and quiet Nice to sit there with a complimentary newspaper or later in the summer evening with a drink from the hotel bar Staff were always very helpful and welcoming Room was also comfortable and a fair size Optionally there was room service for meals which was an option for those on business travel etc 
103903,The Academy, Blocked funds on my credit card but did not say how much in advance and were reluctant to provide evidence Small attic room no lift Tired furnishings and dated bathroom , Good location for me 
103904,The Academy, We liked the location but sometimes it would take a while to get where we were going We wondered if it would be less time on the bus or underground if were closer to central London The mini refrigerator in the room was getting worn out The bathroom was small but adequate There is no elevator which was fine for us It s definitely an older building and it is a little worn in places We sat out in the court yard one early evening but left when another guest came out and started smoking The lobby is tiny , I traveled with my 21 year old daughter We liked the location because it was quieter than central London We had a twin room It was small but I think typical for England There were bus stops and underground stations close by One bus stop was across the street The British Museum is an easy walking distance The room was clean comfortable and air conditioned When we visited in July it was hot The staff responded to requests quickly and politely There were good restaurants right around the corner The neighborhood felt safe even when coming back later at night after seeing a play The only time we ate there was after we got back late from a day trip to Bath and Stonehenge and ordered room service It was just what we needed It was generally quiet We had a room on the inside We could here people walking back and forth above us 
103905,The Academy, This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at It is classified as 4 stars when even 2 would be generous The entire hotel is outdated dirty and rickety The walls doors and windows look like they have not been painted or even cleaned in months The carpets are worn and stained and the floors creak The A C is noisy even after it is turned off The staff are inefficient not very knowledgeable and unfriendly The front desk is a single clerk surrounded by many hotel guests waiting for attention No service attitude sour faced arguing nickeling and diming you on every little thing Here is an example of their warped logic I had reserved a suite which was a larger than normal room I had requested in advance to have a quiet room not facing the main Gower St that the hotel is on to which I had received an email reply saying that all the suites where facing the main road but were completely noise proof with double glazed windows Upon check in I realized that indeed the suites were facing the road but the double glazed windows did a poor job in keeping the traffic noise out This was proven after the first night in which I got no sleep because of the traffic roaring by all night When I complained the next morning and asked to move to a room not facing the street I was told that I could downgrade to a significantly smaller room but the hotel did not usually reduce the price accordingly When I argued the point I was done a favor of reducing the price by USD 25 from USD 310 to USD 285 whereas according to the prices on booking com the difference should have been close to USD 100 When I protested I was told that by hotel policy I should really have been charged the walk in rate for the downgraded room which was close to USD 400 After spending more than 45 mins on this futile discussion I gave up , The croissants at breakfast were quite good See my review below 
103906,The Academy, The hotel is quite shabby and needs renovation to match its 4 stars There are rooms beneath the street level so if you re unfortunate to have one of these there is no view neither you can open the window The hotel should inform their guests what room type they will get , Excellent location close to a couple of underground stations but if you like walking you can also explore some of the main sightseeings by foot 
103907,The Academy,No Negative, The room was bigger than expected and comfortable Room included water fruit slippers robes and other features Just a 5 10 minute walk into Leicester square 
103908,The Academy, On the last day we asked the hotel staff to arrange a taxi In the end it was a private van that required us to take our luggage and walk one street to get to it When we got to the car the driver demanded an additional 10 saying that he did not know we are going terminal five When we got there I wanted to pay by credit card and he said it will required an additional 10 In the end the cost is 76 more expensive than Uber ,No Positive
103909,The Academy,No Negative, The hotel is in a really good location close to the underground shops bars and restaurants The room was really clean with comfy beds and a continental breakfast included in the price which was all that we needed The staff were very helpful and friendly during our stay 
103910,The Academy, the room No 3 is located in groudfloor near to ventilation systems noisy Never again , Very good location near to Tube bus transport Oxford street and nice restaurants and pubs nearby 
103911,The Academy, Historical buildings have their flaws and lack of sound proofing early traffic from the street cracking staircase, Charming location with a historical feeling For people who are looking for an authentic stay and not a modern approach Very conveniently located close to Fitzrovia and Euston Great breakfast continental full English 
103912,The Academy, The shower was quite uncomfortable not only an issue of bathroom size but about the taps and shower heads , Location was great in a peaceful street while being very close to main streets and several attractions e g Biritsh Museum Room facilities are satisfactory The garden is so beautiful 
103913,The Academy, We would have appreciated a second chair in the bedroom , Beds very comfortable Spacious room air conditioning well appointed bathroom Private gardens Helpful staff who allocated us a room on the ground floor to help one of us who is disabled Excellent location Very good food in Store Street just a few minutes away 
103914,The Academy, wifi was absolutely horrible bathroom was too tiny Electrical outlet had extensions for charging phones and the like They did not always work and hard to use had to go to desk and ask for toilet paper because cleaning staff did not leave any nor shampoo or conditioner until I asked them in the hall for them hotel looks tired and needs update and better upkeep their hotel address and telephone needs to be clearly written on their room book so guest can tell it to people coming to visit had to look it up online instead of by the desk no pen or pad provided to write anything down Some of the British staff behaved like they are unhappy to be working at The Academy stern grumpy fake required politeness without a smile clearly portraying attitude of wanting to be doing or working elsewhere They should then Does not give a nice impression to a visitor housekeeping came in one day to clean room without knocking on the door told them to return in few minutes as we were getting ready to go out room was very small for the rate needs more hangers in closet, Location was great and best aspect of hotel non British foreign staff were wonderful up nicest warmest helpful without an attitude and very pleasant Went out of their way to be truly helpful including Jose from Seville at the front desk the sweet Ookish background staff member the reception staffer Italian young woman from front desk African background gentleman on evening shift as well as servers in the restaurant and others These staff members save the hotel AC worked well had a good safe small fridge good secure room door
103915,The Academy, It s a b b that charges 4 star prices Much better 4 star hotels round the corner that are cheaper The staff don t know that fresh orange does not come out of a bottle from the local supermarket , Location
103916,The Academy, The hotel interior rooms is a little dated interior narrow corridors small stairs etc I did not really mind it to be honest it adds to the character , Decent hotel with friendly staff and housed in an old building with lovely characteristics The hotel has a small garden on the backside which was nice Comfortable bed and good wifi Good value for a hotel in London on that location 
103917,The Academy, bit noisy and the air conditioning made funny noises but it was effective at keeping the room cool , A well located hotel in a nice area Tiny single room right in the roof but very comfortable and lovely bathroom 
103918,The Academy, Poorly insulated rooms and noisy water system I was first given room 36 on the top floor As the boiler is located in the attic over the room at times it felt like having somebody with a sledgehammer over my head I was moved to room 20 on the 2nd floor a larger nicer room but also poorly insulated I could hear the people on the room over mine walking around and whenever they took a shower it felt like a train was passing through the room O, The location and staff are really nice 
103919,The Academy, This was a expensive for a nice but slightly dated hotel , The hotel was really close to Oxford street Quite near work My room was upgraded It had a good coffee machine and a great shower 
103920,The Academy, decor old and dingy also dont like to be charged for items that we thought were a gift eg crisps and sweets that s not nice I would not have bought them myself and so would not have eaten them, very comfy bed beautiful linen staff were really friendly and helpful
103921,The Academy, The wifi password vouchers given by the staff were sometimes useless very slow wifi connection and vouchers need to be requested every 24 hr period for a new password to use the wifi and we were charged for an additional breakfast as we had apparently presiones for two adults and since we didn t include 1 youth in the booking that extra person breakfast was added to our cost even though we boooked the family room which is for up to 4 people we assumed that because the family room could fit up to four persons the continental breakfast was covered for four but it didn t continental breakfast only covered for two adults who were in the original booking , The rooms were big and clean staff was friendly and tried to help and answer questions
103922,The Academy, Room a little cramped and there was a weird smell in the bathroom on the last day Wifi was a problem but they mentioned that after the refurbishment due this summer it will improve , Having a room on the top floor was good no noise from above rarely noise from people on the stairs and bad you do have to carry your suitcase on steep stairs but they offer to help you Good AC complimentary bottled water comfortable bed It is reasonably close to Tottenham Rd Station which takes you anywhere and to Russel Sq Station which is Piccadilly line straight from Heathrow 
103923,The Academy, Being asked for 100 without prior notice as insurance for not damaging the room Also only one channel on TV was working , Bags were stored at no extra cost
103924,The Academy,No Negative, They had an issue with our bedroom a double room with twin beds and offered to change for two single rooms instead No extra cost All nicely done 
103925,The Academy,No Negative, The night staff was very welcoming They needed to photocopy my passport and they sent someone to take it and bring it back to me Day staff was also good very quick 
103926,The Academy, unusable wi fi I could not even connect I complained and I was told I could use the business option at 15 day broken window charred bacon minuscule room , bed
103927,The Academy, I stayed following an op therefore did not leave the room I would have liked to be able to make tea in my room , The air con was great and the bed was comfortable Room service food was yummy 
103928,The Academy, Was annoyed that it hadn t been made clear when booking that the hotel takes another 50 00 per day as security in case you use anything in the mini bar or decided to have breakfast I felt it should be stated prior to arrival , Very close to tubes 20 minute leisurely walk and you re at Trafalgar square room was very quiet overlooking garden and fairly spacious 
103929,The Academy, Although our bathroom was also well appointed and had a bath which we love we could only fill the bath with the shower attachment Only a minor niggle , Our suite was spacious and well appointed Really comfortable bed with good quality cotton linen duvet and pillows We overlooked Gower Street which was quiet and we slept very well Breakfast room was also restful with easy listening background music a gentle way to start the day 
103930,The Academy, Wifi not good enough to use at least on the third floor And the front facing rooms quite traffic noisy I would ask for a garden side room next time,No Positive
103931,The Academy, There s a porter to help with bags up stairs because no lift , Got upgraded from a single room to a suit delighted with all the trappings sprawling couch coffee machine etc Perfect sleep mattress Location was super convenient for central London very satisfied with this booking 
103932,The Academy, Loose wallpaper and cracks in both the sink and shower that had turned brown of filth was not very nice The guy who kept an eye on the minibar came in twice in the same morning to check the content Said he knocked but I didn t hear that That felt uncomfortable Stay away from the minibar 2 65 for a Kitkat They lady in reception who I spoke to when I arrived spoke very fast explaining some kind of complicated system of how they block certain amounts on your card in case you use the minibar and what else I have 3 different amounts blocked on my account but dont know which is for what yet since nothing seems to be settled London hotels appear to have lower standard in general but this was much to expensive for what you got , Very comfortable beds Room was nicely laid out The staff were nice in particular the lady worked with the breakfast 
103933,The Academy, Unhelpful with booking process Several phone calls to try and sort it out but had to solve problem myself in the end Not very clean Inclusive breakfast but only continental supplied Had option to pay extra for cooked breakfast ,No Positive
103934,The Academy, The decor generally was rather tired and furniture a little shabby No lift and we were on the top floor Room was in the lift and very warm , Location Breakfast was good and staff were pleasant 
103935,The Academy, They could have had skimmed milk, My single room was larger than I usually find in hotels it was clean and comfortable and the shower wasn t the tiny box that I usually get The location was very good for me very close to the British Museum and Oxford Street The hotel has a largish garden with a fishpond and in the warmer weather it would be lovely to relax there The staff were all friendly and helpful I would certainly stay there again 
103936,The Academy, Room was tiny and room was on the third floor which meant lots of stairs Water pipes were noisy at night, Location was great The shower was strong and hot Bed was comfortable
103937,The Academy, Information on booking com site about extra 100 deposit and to make sure you have ID for stay Had these sort of thing s not pointed out before which can really mess things up booking in , It was great for everything you need around you and very handy for tube station and the room was a great size and very comfortable 
103938,The Academy, One of the receptionists wasn t very helpful with the checking out process part of my stay They stated couple of times that I had to pay the full cost amount for my stay despite the fact I ve already paid in full on the first day with a different receptionist and I ve tried to explain this couple of times fortunately I had the receipt for this This was quite distressing as I thought they would already know from whatever they have on the computer system and or on paper file Clearly this part needs some improvement as the checking out process shouldn t have to be that stressful , The room I ve stayed at was quite comfortable and has met my expectations Most staffs were friendly and helpful The hotel is within walking distance to the underground tube the British Museum and Oxford St
103939,The Academy, Very disappointed with the room with all that equipment devices with lights attached to the wall on top of the bed that we had to sleep with Not a very comfortable night The bedroom was on the top floor attic and some parts of the walls were lower not easy to walk around And of course had to walk up many steps Impossible to compare with the others we stayed before ,No Positive
103940,The Academy, We were here two years ago and were told then that improvements were being made to the hotel Based on our room these either weren t done or need to be done again The hotel is tired It needs a lot of work to bring it up to 4 star standard In our bathroom the extractor wasn t working the temperature regulator on the shower was broken so water came out at a single temperature hot The minibar fridge wasn t cold we ended up throwing some food we d put in there The WiFi was good in our room However there is a woefully inadequate capacity limit which means you need to get another password from reception to carry on We have stayed here four times over the last four or five years and sadly won t be here for a fifth , Great location helpful staff
103941,The Academy, The hotel is old and our shower was an adopted place like a cabin in the wall The room was very small and there is no elevator To go to the 4th with 3 luggage is not easy even with the assistance of the staff , The hotel is very central and well connected Close to Goodge Street station a which is line well connected and 2 stations away from Leicester Square You can also move walking to Oxford Street Charing Cross etc 
103942,The Academy, Very slow check in check out Free wifi was very patchy and was limited to 0 5mbs Room was tatty window frame was rotten through and wouldn t shut so there was a constant draft The piping in my room had been repaired with duck tape the grout was very mouldy and there were stains on the carpet , Excellent location Quiet room 
103943,The Academy, The whole hotel was incredibly hot which made it smell a bit fusty Not enough working sockets to charge my electronic devices which I passed on to the reception staff upon departure , Great location lots of restaurants nearby the hotel has a couple of courtyard gardens that must be lovely in the Summer large room with a big desk 
103944,The Academy, A precharge for the 1st night stay was taken from my account on the first day That is ok Not impressed that they then charged the FULL 2 nights to my account when leaving thus I have paid for the 1st night TWICE the second night I have to now wait for 10 working days for this over charge of 174 to go back into my account NOT ACCEPTABLE , Nice building boutique type hotel 
103945,The Academy, Traffic noise They need to get double glazing As with all hotels of this type single room quite small and right at the top of the building If you are not fit and healthy it could be a problem as there is no lift The television radio kept cutting out after a certain time obviously an energy saving measure but very annoying , Lovely soft towels and a dressing gown Nice bathroom 
103946,The Academy, I stayed here 2 years ago it was part of the Eton Collection of hotels and was excellent It has gone way down hill now Old tired room 34 smelt really musty and damp unrelenting internal machinery noise and a window that didn t seal when closed and the noise from Gower Street was ridiculous Certainly not good value for money , Location is the only good thing 
103947,The Academy, The bedroom set up was not helpful No mirror by a plug to dry hair Continental Breakfast was not much choice I had to contact Hotel to request them to release my funds They took initial swipe of my card and then charged me again , Location
103948,The Academy, The continental breakfast was not bad but mediocre The good thing about it all is that you can choose another option like an a English breakfast or to add smth from the menu , The hotel is situated in a perfect location quite surrounding and close to everything British Museum tube bus stop The staff was super friendly and rooms were clean well equipped and comfy 
103949,The Academy, Sadly the toilet seat was broken on our arrival Staff offered another room but substitute room was small and not like for like Waiter at breakfast struggled with language but an older English lady took over and sorted things Away from reception paintwork on doors and walls was poor Luggage markings all over the place Easy fix with touch up paint will help but until then hotel doesn t look 4 star , Size of room Upgraded breakfast 
103950,The Academy, At check in I was surprised that they wanted to secure almost twice the amount of the room on my credit card as a deposit I thought that was excessive , I was in a single room that was cosy but was very well furnished and equipped and very comfortable and had everything that I needed Will stay again No deposit on booking or charge for cancellation a bonus
103951,The Academy, Big amount of money above the rooms price that hotel charge or hold on the bank card just in case room facilities could be more modern two types of breakfasts one that you pay through booking is continental means only toasts full English breakfast for additional charge For such level of the hotel there should be only one good full English breakfast without any additional charges on arrival, Location walking distance to main center sightseeing friendly staff reading relaxing drinking tea room in the old English style available for all clients at the first floor
103952,The Academy, Only thing would be a small fridge in the room , Great location close to Euston and Covent Garden Friendly staff very comfortable room Would definitely stay again 
103953,The Academy, The sink in the bathroom had a broken plug which meant we couldn t use the sink Otherwise room was great , great location nice room comfortable and cosy 
103954,The Academy, Older building with creaky floors and stairs slightly sad carpets etc, Good sized room and good location in central London Really convenient for The British Museum Oxford Street Covent Garden etc 
103955,The Academy, Breakfast was poor member of staff was complaining that she was on her own Did book double room but was told 1 day before they had overbooked Room service was also poor many items not available member of staff taking them to room was rude , Proper leaf tea for breakfast 
103956,The Academy, There nothing I didn t like but would suggest coffee making facilities in room would be nice , This was a very friendly hotel with happy attentive staff Our room was very comfortable and quiet not something easy to get in London The location was great for us and we were able to walk to Covent gardens etc Well presented hotel and good breakfast 
103957,The Academy, We had a room on the ground floor with windows to the street very noisy no privacy , Location near to Euston station many bus stations in walk distance to Soho Covent garden
103958,The Academy, The air conditioning was quite noisy and some of the room could do with an upgrade The curtains were partly off the rails so we didn t have all of the advantage of the black out curtains I suppose the price is what it is for being in the middle of London but it didn t meet my expectations standards for that price , Great location close to shops and theatres and quiet location The bed was comfortable and the staff friendly 
103959,The Academy, A little awkward for the buses as it is on a one way street so ok for getting into the centre but further to walk coming back , Good central location The staff were friendly and efficient We felt very much at home and had everything we could have wished for in the room 
103960,The Academy, Everything, The hotel was expensive compared what they offer I got a room in the 3rd floor and there was no lift The hotel is old and there was a leakage of water from my bathroom to the underneath room Also I didn t sleep well as there was noise form the central heating which disturb my sleeping I also requested a bottle of presecco to be in the room at the time of the arrival but there was not there You have got to ring a bell when you come back late night and the receptionist open the door himself and you can t leave the hotel as well until you call someone to open the main door The whole experience was not nice and I won t go back again 
103961,The Academy, For subsequent 3 days no wifi service even the telephone was unable to connect The wifi connection was unsatisfactory It d be better if the house keeping service could be complete each day like emptying the trash bin sanitary and complimentary provision all checked , A quiet room with an open view with some trees outside Two staff members in the restaurant was friendly and caring on 6 Nov 2016 on my 1st day of arrival when I was extremely tired I was grateful to their nice serving 
103962,The Academy, They charged me 4GBP more than what was confirmed on booking com Shower broke down was able to quickly fix it myself and heating couldn t be turned off Wifi is not secure , Clean and comfy bed If you re lucky like me you can get a big room There were some things which I didn t like but in the end it s still good value for money on that location 
103963,The Academy, Room was a bit small when considering we paid over 160 a night and we were up in the attic so had several flights of stairs to climb as there was no lift , Good location and very clean room Fresh towels each day Robe and slippers provided
103964,The Academy, breakfast package included paid as a extra was only continental tea coffee cereals etc If I had known that I would not have paid the extra Cooked breakfast available but you have to pay extra on site , friendly staff
103965,The Academy, The room was in the basement which I didn t mind but 2 ceiling lights didn t work and the bedside lights didn t work heating didn t appear to work on the Saturday and sunday the bathroom stunk of raw sewage and made the stay unpleasant I wasn t even asked by staff how my stay was when I left, location
103966,The Academy, Not the 4 I expected No hairdryer in the room no rails for towels in the bathroom It felt a bit tired in terms of decor and furniture Radio playing in the reception which I did not feel was appropriate The internet connection passwords did not work , Good location close to Euston station good selection of little cafes round the corner Staff were pleasant 
103967,The Academy, The wifi was patchy and unreliable , Lovely character hotel Very comfortable well located for walking in to the West End Staff friendly and helpful It has the personal touch that many hotels lack 
103968,The Academy, The hotel advertises Wi Fi in my case it was No Fi Slow and only on momentarily This is a n absolute no no for a business traveler Also three times while in the hotel which wasn t much due to having to go to Starbucks to get a good internet connection all of the lights in the room went out It took and hour to get them back on I left, The beds were soft and the shower great The breakfast staff very amenable Food was average as I had continental Breakfast room very clean and sorted out
103969,The Academy, Couple of minor suggestions option of tea as well as coffee in room choice of a harder pillow for my husband although my pillow was perfect , We can t fault this hotel Location room staff breakfast all excellent Will definitely return when back in London 
103970,The Academy, No bar Convenient location for our purpose Covent Garden opera but less convenient for many central London locations , Large room Comfortable bed Free w fi Well appointed bedroom accessories 
103971,The Academy,No Negative, Lovely courtyard garden to sit in Friendly and helpful staff Quirky staircases from the original houses and there is always someone to carry your case up these stairs There is no lift but actually I should have stayed longer to improve my physical condition 
103972,The Academy, Room phone didn t work had to use mobile to call reception Didn t have food choice and when alternative arrived it was almost cold Wi fi useless Paid 15 for high speed connection which was hardly any better despite 20 minute call to customer centre at a cost still to be discovered No shower gel nowhere in shower to hang shampoo flannel etc Very difficult to close window to reduce traffic noise Still charged for breakfast even though service did not start early enough for me a detail not apparent on booking com website Cost of meal knocked off bill but little compensation for such a poor experience , Good location comfortable bed quick check in and out 
103973,The Academy, Room service took over half an hour to tell us they didn t have what we wanted Then another half an hour to get a dried up sandwich no butter on the bread No phone in room had to keep walking to reception Room blind fell down nearly injured my husband took nearly a hour to sort the end night guy was not a maintenence man He gave my husband a duvet to cover the window No apologies can we move you The continental breakfast was terrible dry cheese and ham hard rolls cereal not a good selection Fruit juices nearly run out and tasteless Tea and coffee the most cheapest brands on the market The housekeeping on the room was terrible The fridge was filthy the bottles not wiped round The glass all stained The bath panel thick layer of dust the carpet holey Dust on ledges The list can go on For the price we paid it did not meet a 4 star standard , Only used as it was convenient to where we needed to be 
103974,The Academy,No Negative, Very close to the British museum The Euston square metro and Euston overground a short walking distance Great staff and comfortable rooms with good amenities 
103975,The Academy, Room was s little dated decor wise and had a smell of damp mould , Lovely staff very helpful Position of hotel is great Continental breakfast was very good 
103976,The Academy, Very clean but a little tatty in need of some TLC extractor not working in bathroom carpets in public area needs replacing, Location was great for site seeing and shopping room very nice with a great bed and bedding
103977,The Academy, Third floor no lift , The position the hotel is very cozy Very nicely decorated A lot of personality It is walking distance from main central London venues It is worth the money Recomended
103978,The Academy, No hot water in our room got it changed There dusty bed no shower curtain and flies and ants in our bathroom , Nice classic furniture in the common areas
103979,The Academy, Room small and claustrophobic There definitely should be a warning highlighting the step into the very small ensuite as it is a hazard For a small hotel the receptionist was not very welcoming on arrival Wine which had never been requested nor consumed was added to our bill at the end for some reason However this was immediately removed on pointing out the error Continental breakfast was adequate ,No Positive
103980,The Academy, Should have gotten breakfast included in that stay Safety box got stuck and I had to go down several times for drinking water which was supposed to have been brought to my room , Lovely property Great location for what I was interested in Staff was friendly and helpful A nice experience Thank you 
103981,The Academy, Bar service could have been better and some general wear and tear could have been maintained too and requested soft eggs but came hard , The hotel had a nice atmosphere
103982,The Academy, It wasn t a problem for me but I would say there are a lot of stairs to the rooms at the top and there is no lift , Very comfortable room with good facilities Great location 
103983,The Academy, Nothing, Loved the location room was lovely great bathroom and the room contained everything you could want as s traveller Breakfast provided a good choice and was very tasty
103984,The Academy, Slow check in and check out very noisy rooms at the front of the building and no help with providing vanity kits even though in their room guide Would recommend the Ambassador instead , Great location and lovely and clean
103985,The Academy, One of the issues was the Internet you need a separate paper with a long code for each device every 24h in reality much more often Internet is very slow and disconnects all the time For those who need to work it s super inconvenient ,No Positive
103986,The Academy, We stayed here before in the Garden Suite and that experience is why we returned It turns out the rest of the rooms or at least the room we were given was NOTHING like the Garden Suite So tiny we could turn around A tiny window we couldn t see out of and the noisy air conditioner was so loud we felt like we were in a fish tank We were so disappointed Lucky we were able to change rooms for the second night but YOU could be the unlucky one who gets the fish tank Also the hotel is a bit out of the way so hope you enjoy walking We were also not impressed with the desk The first time we were here about 4 years ago the staff was very attentive This time hardly though the luggage porter was hard working and very nice In the end we were extremely disappointed and wished we hadn t stayed here Way over priced ,No Positive
103987,The Academy, Very expensive breakfast charge we got breakfast elsewhere, The staff were really helpful and gave us a different room ground floor instead of 3rd floor when they discovered that my husband has mobility difficulties 
103988,The Academy, nothing, I have stayed two weeks at this hotel There is nothing i would complain I liked everything staff are kind and very helpful I would definitely choose the same hotel if i travel to London again Location is good with full of restaurants cafes and bars Close to tube station 
103989,The Academy, The aircon machine made a loud gurgling noise so had to be switched off through the night this in turn made the room hot and hard to sleep in , The bed was comfy 
103990,The Academy, The ensuite bathroom was tiny with an annoying raised doorframe There was no side to put the kettle so I had to boil it on the floor and make the tea on the shelf in the wardrobe , The location was great and so were the staff
103991,The Academy, Decor a bit 1990s Long codes to log onto wi fi , Interesting hotel inside several Georgian town houses knocked together Convenient for Tottenham Court Road Euston etc
103992,The Academy, When checking in at 3pm being told to come back at 6pm because the room wasn t ready we refused So they upgraded us to a different room and gave us a bottle of prosecco to compensate very good Room had a dirty window which opened wide with no safety stop we were on the second floor But what was worse was being woken up at 5am by people attempting unsuccessfully to get into our room this happened on two occasions , Architectural features of a Georgian townhouse were interesting The air con was good as was the shower 
103993,The Academy, Like all London hotels room was snug but perfectly adequate My daughter did join me and there was space for both of us , Location excellent quiet room at back of hotel nice garden and common sitting room 
103994,The Academy, Our allocated room was scruffy and the fridge was worse But they rapidly found us a better and cleaner one without quibbling and after that everything was fine Might go back, Very comfy beds friendly helpful staffstaff from all over the world and rooms at the back at least very quiet
103995,The Academy,No Negative, Staff very helpful room was extremely clean housekeeping do a great job location was excellent undergrounds stations just a few yards locate in an area with restaurants stores museum and nightlife 
103996,The Academy,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite which delighted my daughter as we were in London to see a show for her 18th birthday Bed very comfortable Lovely English breakfast before a day s shopping in Oxford Street which is close by 
103997,The Academy, Key card got demagnetised twice and needed re setting Water was only delivered the first few days would have been nice to get a fresh bottle every day, Bed was very comfy good location nice staff
103998,The Academy, Room bathroom were extremely small no fridge in the room I expect booking directly with the hotel might offer a better experience , Comfy bed nice towels helpful staff 
103999,The Academy, I have no complaints , Great location attentive staff great value Carlos had noted it was our Anniversary upgraded our room to a suite at no extra cost he was really friendly made us feel welcomed guests thank you again The suite was really lovely although on the front the noise from the road wasn t a problem at all A lovely comfy bed We stayed in room 21 Will definitely stay there again 
104000,The Academy, The room is quite old need some refurbishment Air conditioner making some water noises which was a little bit annoying , The Academy is in very good and convenient location only 5 minutes walk from Goodge Street Tube Station 10 12 mins to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station also within easy reach to Soho and China Town 15 20 minutes by walk The bed is very comfy 
104001,The Academy, I came back in the very early hours and the hotel door was locked The bell didn t work so I had to ring the hotel on my mobile phone so that someone could come to let me in It wasn t a problem at all and only a minor complaint but if my mobile phone battery had been dead I m not sure how I would have made contact with reception for someone to come and let me in , Very good price for central london I had a room around the back away from Gower Street and it was so quiet My room also had a double door so I couldn t hear any hotel noise which I usually find a problem in small central london hotels Excellent value for money 
104002,The Academy, I and family members have stayed here several times in the past On this occasion it failed miserably to live up to previous experiences So much so that I wouldn t consider staying here again , The location is convenient 
104003,The Academy, Only one electric socket which was low down on the wall we were advised to plug the kettle into this which would mean having a boiling kettle on the floor which we felt was unsafe subsequently we were supplied with an extension lead , Location was perfect for our visit very near shopping areas and attractions
104004,The Academy, Nothing at all If it ain t broke don t fix it , The whole experience was so different to other hotels Much more welcoming and relaxed Will definitely be returning
104005,The Academy, Nothing, Staff were welcoming and efficient on arrival and departure Obviously an old period property with charm and character but maintained very well and rooms were well appointed They were clean and had all if not more amenities than many larger hotels we have stayed at in London in the same area Which is an ideal location to get around London Tremendous value for money if you just want a comfortable place to lay your head whilst visiting London We will definately stay here again 
104006,The Academy, The only bad thing I can write about this hotel is also part of its charm It s a boutique hotel created out of 5 terraced houses Meaning no lifts but narrow winding stairways Very charming Until you have something to carry such as luggage , The location of The Academy Hotel is fifteen minutes walk from Oxford Street and there are underground stations and bus stops nearby This was very convenient The room was quiet and private 
104007,The Academy, I didn t have any bad experiences , The location 5 minutes from Goodge St tube and a 10 minute walk from Oxford St is excellent Lots of good pubs and restaurants cafes close by 
104008,The Academy, We didn t like the fact that on booking com it said that breakfast was included but when we got to the hotel we were told that it was 15 each for breakfast , I liked the high ceilings and the old school feel of the hotel

104013,The Academy, Shower room was quite small which some people might not like but it was perfectly ok for us A shelf in the shower for soap etc would have been helpful but that s quite trivial , Really helpful friendly staff at reception and at breakfast twin room on top floor overlooking the road but not all noisy nicely decorated very comfy beds Great location for British Museum and Central London shopping 
104014,The Academy, Utterly overpriced considering the service contents of the hotel and the competition of many other hotels on Gowder Street and its vicinity , The location is good
