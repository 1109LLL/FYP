151703,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, compact lift and small size rooms services were not up to the mark i will not consider it 4 standard reception didnt understand english properly, interior decoration and location
151704,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Very tight rooms Bathroom shower nice but not well scealed in both rooms room service not good missing bathroom accessories we have to ask for shampoo , Nice d coration Friendly staff Good address
151705,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Only the wifi connection , Wi fi was rubbish and TVs some of the channels wouldn t connect May have been due to very poor weather conditions The staff were very friendly and helpful Bed was very comfortable and the shower was great Free upgrade 
151706,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Like 99 of rooms in Paris the rooms here are as well a bit too small for our taste , Great location staff polite The best thing is the mobile phone you get from the hotel and you can use it outside the hotel use google maps you can t get lost 
151707,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Coffee making supplies needed to be a little more generous and topped up during stay 3 nights , Friendly and welcoming small but very well appointed room and en suite super comfy bed Good to have coffee making facilities in the room 
151708,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The hotel was so much smaller than we had expected We opened the door to our bedroom and it literally hit the bed There is not much manoeuvring room inside the bedroom The corridors are really dark and narrow and the lift is tiny only fits 2 people maybe 3 at a squeeze , The bed was extra comfy The hotel was in a great location near lots of restaurants and cafes and staff were very friendly and helpful 
151709,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The room was tiny Really should be single occupancy only as you could hardly move Also our safe didn t work correctly although this was sorted right after reporting to the reception The room comes with lovely fluffy robes but ours had no ties provided so we struggled to use them Despite reporting this to reception it wasn t sorted at all over he weekend , The staff were wonderful and friendly we had tickets to Disneyland and the reception logged me in and printed them without hassle The rooms were really clean and the bed comfy
151710,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Even by European city standards the rooms are small Not unpleasantly so but you probably won t be encouraged to lounge therein , Very chic clean and well maintained hotel in Montparnasse with delightful staff A few excellent quirky extras like the ability to borrow a cellphone tablet and only pay for the calls Room has a terrific balcony which provided wonderful escape from the bustle of the city 
151711,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The rumble of the metro thin walls meaning you could hear the slightest of noise from neighbouring rooms We also booked two adjoining rooms yet the hotel does not offer this and we ended up with one suite and a double room the 2nd room was subsequently smaller in comparison , Fantastic bed and location staff were super friendly The smartphone for free calls internet and use on the go was a fanstatic idea and sets this hotel apar from all of its competitors We stayed in a Suite on the 5th floor which offered great space and a nice city view 
151712,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, We had our 6month old son with us we were put on the top sixth floor The elevator only went to the 5th floor so we had to carry the pushchair up down a flight of stairs every time we wanted to go out Metro 4 was out of service not hotels fault but did hinder travel options Buses are very good though even with a pushchair in tow , The beds were very comfortable and the shower was very hot with good pressure They provided a phone with the internet on it free calls and a constant use of google maps make exploring the city fantastic as we never felt lost or confused as to where we were heading next Great location next to metro line 4 goes direct to and from guard du nord train station Buffet breakfast was fantastic food was delicious and I love freshly squeezed OJ so that was a bonus 
151713,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The hotel is really small and so are the rooms but we didn t mind I think we got what we paid for We didn t have breakfast at the hotel because we thougt it was expensive, The bed was really comfy and the hotell was all over cozy and welcoming The metro station was just a couple of minutes away so it was easy to get by We walked a lot and the eiffel tower was a 30 minute walk from the hotel so we were happy with the location We will definitely come back 
151714,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, I always like to put something in here to maintain credibility but I cannot think of a single thing that I was unhappy with , I ve visited Paris twice and after a fantastic stay at a different Elegencia hotel the first time Legend around the corner from this one I made a point to seek one from the same company again and was delighted to find one in my price range I was definitely not disappointed Extremely friendly and helpful staff who went out of their way to assist in any way that they could Our room was upgraded for free so I can t say what normal room size would be but the cost was very reasonable for a great location in central Paris a short walk from a several different transport options Providing us with a handy a local smartphone including data was absolutely brilliant It quickly became indispensable as it allowed us to livemap where we were check admission times etc I cannot say enough good things about this company in general and this place in particular 
151715,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Room a bit noisy especially when other occupants on the same floor use the shower Also shower is very small should consider installing a shower curtain Floor carpeting need thorough cleaning to remove stains , Good location close to the underground station restaurants cinemas etc Nice view of Montparnasse tower from room Bedroom was small but functional Staff was very friendly and spoke good english
151716,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The walls are really thin and you hear the alarm of the neighbor toilets and the shower , H tel cozy next to Montparnasse Great location Nice designed rooms The furnitures are good Nuxe bath products beautiful room Friendly receptionists 
151717,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, My bag was stolen from my room And possibly was the woman who cleaned it that day because she was the only person who could get inside It is unacceptable for a city hotel to dont have security and can someone steal things so easily I ll Never stay again here ,No Positive
151718,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, I would have liked to have dedicated parking but for average tourists this is probably a non issue , Great cozy place with plenty of cafes and interesting things around to check out Excellent value and great access to the metro and centrum Highly recommended 
151719,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The noise from the main road the vibrations from the metro , The decor is absolutely stunning the staff very polite location is good lots of food places nearby 
151720,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Tea coffee making facility in room please, Great hotel quiet had good sleep great shower lovely helpful staff In good interesting location Enjoyed the framed illustrations around hotel and room Pleasant waiting relaxing area 
151721,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Very thick walls witch means soundy environment because of street noises , Hotel location is just perfect about 5 minutes walk from Duroc metro station You can actually see Tour eiffel from the street near the hotel What s more You can choose from many different restaurants caf s that are just near the hotel Even sushi spot is on the corner Room is fabulous very elegant and parisiene You can really feel the vibe of the city and even imagine that You are real femme fatale Do not forget to try elevator and You can reach the stars 
151722,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, No lights in the stairwells seemed a bit dangerous , At breakfast they served the most delicious velvety homemade yogurt ever I actually had to have two pots of it Also love the illustrations on the walls and the honey show gel was amazing 
151723,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The rooms were a bit small and there was no option to have to single beds in the bedroom , Very neet little hotel Does look a bit like a pleasure house from outside but it s a really nice boutique style hotel They really optimize every bit of space they have 
151724,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Bed was far too soft Very noisy room on the ground floor so no possibility to open the windows Room too warm during the night , Excellent location very close to m tro Very friendly staff Excellent breakfast buffet very good choice justifying fairly high price 
151725,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Check out is at 12 noon and at 11 53 am I got a knock on the door asking when I will leave Admiditally I was about 5 min late out of the room in the end but I think it was a little bit extreme , The bed was very comfortable and the tv was large There are lots of restaurants around and you can reach the airport easily from the location 
151726,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, It was quite tight in terms of space both in the bedroom on the top floor and the lift and the breakfast area, All of the hotel staff very friendly and very helpful Breakfast lovely The local bar La Marquise two doors down on the right after leaving the hotel was splendid for a drink and food Excellent transport links and bars restaurants Montparnasse Tower offers fabulous views 
151727,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Struggling to work out the light when I got to my room as this was not explained at check in You put the card in a slot by the door, Lovely friendly staff Great location with lots of bars and restaurants right in Blvd Montparnasse The rooms were modern clean and functional I would stay again in a heartbeat 
151728,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The Air conditioning was not effective enough and it can get a little noisy at times , Our room was upgraded to a larger one Very nice neighbourhood to stay with lots of restaurants and shops nearby Clean simple rooms with comfy bed 
151729,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Room was very VERY small Tiny bathroom Tains ran underneath hotel at frequent intervals Despite asking to pay for guaranteed early check in we were told it wasn t possible but everything would be done to have room ready which it wasn t We arrived 8 00h after 32hrs travelling had to wait exactly to check in time at 15 00h No complimentary tea coffee available Terrible wifi connection Vacuum cleaner hose seemed to live in hallway as it was lying there during our stay Overpriced for what it is Would not stay again or recommend it There are plenty better value boutique hotels in Paris , Very helpful friendly staff Good location 30 40mins walk to city Centre close to public transport 
151730,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The bathroom was a bit pokey in design it was hard to get in and out of the shower but that s just a minor thing as it was so beautiful and clean and the bath was big and perfect for a soak , Clean and comfortable and the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly 
151731,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The fact that a can of coke from the mini nar costs 9 20 euros , Very pleasant staff we loved the room and the little private balcony for our wine and coffee moments 
151732,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The bathroom was tiny to the point where the toilet was not comfortable to sit on This was in the basic room and we were upgraded due to a leak This bathroom was considerably bigger The room was fabulous too , Incredibly comfortable bed Very friendly staff 
151733,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, , Location was great The metro is very close and it s a good station with a lot of different metrolines The staff was really kind and helpfull Breakfast was so GOOD We loved it Rooms are not like every hotel in Paris really big but good and big enough Everything in the hotel looks like it s brand new It gave us an luxery feeling The bed is really good In every room there is a free phone called Handy You can use it for free Onlimited internet and international calls within Europe We used our Handy a lot for Google Maps We think this is a great extra service from the hotel We have had a lovely time in Parizienne If we re coming back to Paris we re definitely going back to Parizienne 
151734,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Staff when i checked out speaks English very little and not so polite Also my taxi booking time was turned out different taxi came 30 minutes earlier than my booking and the staff kept bothering me as it was my fault , Good location 
151735,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff was very kind and do the effort to speak spanish to communicate with my parents they only speak spanish It was not near the main touristic places but was very close to the Gare Montparnasse 
151736,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, If you listen well you can hear the subway passing by In my room a glass door of the shower was missing Also some leakage through the carpet , Very nice comfortable beds Friendly staff
151737,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia,No Negative, The bed is the most comfortable bed we have slept in throughout our entire trip The rooms are decorated delightfully and the place is very clean It s located in a really nice area close to the metro and walking distance to the Eiffel Tower which was a plus at night Would highly recommended staying here while in Paris 
151738,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, breakfast was too expensive 15 euro so i didn t try it the desk in the room was too small to work on and no cattle in the room for coffee and tea that s a big disadvantage in such an expensive city and i could really use some hot tea as i caught a cold , Akmost every thing hotel was just amazing location near Metro 4 leading directly to the Cite and other Metro lines nearby too together with bus lines day and night Staff was very friendly and hlpful room was just amazing comfortable bed 
151739,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, As mentioned the room and bathroom were tiny , Excellent hotel Although our room was very small it s was furnished to an excellent standard The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel offers a smartphone in each room that you can use round the city and make international calls and the Internet This is a brilliant service and something I have never seen before Over allast I would say the hotel is excellent and I would stay again 
151740,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Unfortunately the hotel is situated above the metro line so occasionally you can hear train passing underground I have requested for my room to be changed and they put me in level 5 which was amazing So just avoid room 105 in level 1 Breakfast is not worth 15 there are plenty of restaurants around for less and better street view , The best hotel I m Not sure why it has 3 star rating while it has the quality of a 5 star Bed super comfy TV huge view perfect decor breath taking There was nothing in this hotel that I didn t like 
151741,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia,No Negative, The Hotel was amazing Lovely and comfortable but the most formidable was the staff They were just amazing and they helped me a lot Not only in the hotel with the services but also outside escorting me to the best flower boutiques to buy the finest flowers and even playing the roll of a translator My thanks is great and the staff deserves a 10 
151742,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia,No Negative, Great location short walk to major subway station making it easy to get most places and within 15 20 minute walk from most major landmarks Staff were helpful and friendly 
151743,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Everything was great ok maybe the isolation from outside noise probably not as bad on non Euro soccer nights , Staff was very helpful and polite Room was well equipped even though tiny normal for Paris standards Location location location metro and RER close to the hotel and plenty of restaurants around 
151744,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, It said on the welcome pack that mains adapters were available but when we asked they didn t seem to be able to help and just handed us a box with a couple of unsuitable adapters , The room was very clean and the bathroom was lovely and new 
151745,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, There is a slight echo of the metro tube under the hotel but really this isn t a problem There is noise everywhere is Paris , A lovely little hotel in a great area of Paris Considering in Paris the room is quite spacious and the bathroom is cleverly fit into a small space The facilities were lovely nicely decorated and the staff were wonderful and spoke great English Good access to lots of bars restaurants and metro stations 
151746,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Small noisy bedroom ridicously small shower room small and very dark corridors and lift shabby breakfast room, Very nice staff good comfortable bed Good location 
151747,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Asked for late checkout and was told it wasn t possible because of arriving guests but that it was possible for 20 Euro Would have been great even having an extra half hour like is generally possible from mid range hotels upward Also a lady came in the room without knocking after two ladies came by for cleaning they knocked on the door Thankfully I was dressed etc , Cool design nice smelling soap comfy bed
151748,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Noise from street and rumbling from trains below Once you were asleep this was not a problem English channels on the TV would be nice to have Room is very small but is good for a short stay , New modern interior Everything was clean The staff were very friendly and helpful The location is close to metro and restaurants and within walking distance of some sights They have a smartphone like device in the room which you can use and even take around town 
151749,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Metro sound under the floor once asleep didn t hear it , Great location easy access to metros Restaurants were very nice and staff were really friendly Enjoyed cafe 50 breakfasts really good and great value Hot chocolate was amazing 
151750,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Stairways was dark when walking up and down so a little dangerous No kettle for a morning cup of tea , Location was fantastic Hotel was extremely welcoming and friendly Short walk to Eiffel Tower and other landmarks Definitely recommend
151751,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Noisy and capricieuse room the most expansive one could have been a bit more special Not sure it s worth taking the most expansive room , Breakfast staff
151752,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Tiny rooms almost impossible to move around no real doors at bathrooms thin walls make rooms really loud and hard to sleep , Great location nice decoration
151753,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, very small room very small bathroom not enough space for clothes no wardrobe 2 tiny shelves 3 hangers and 1 draw certainly pricy for what you get , location near montparnasse plenty of restaurants bars shopping eiffel tower clean nice staff close to metro stylish
151754,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Only gripe was that when we arrived we had a mini bar no alcohol that had a bottle of water some snacks and tomato juice which we assumed were part of the price as there was no mention of the snacks on the hotel paperwork or any price list anywhere We however got charged at the end of the stay which was unexpected , It was a pretty amazing unique hotel with a very personal feel in a wonderful location Staff were very accomodating and knowledgeable It was one of the cleanest hotels I have ever known It s like we were the first people staying in a newly opened hotel 
151755,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The bathroom was extremely small When I sat down on the toilet my shoulder touched the paper roll on the wall and I could hardly move The room was extremely noisy Actually the cleaning team was extremely noisy in the other room and I could hear everything which woke me up in the morning , Comfortable bed 
151756,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Nothing at all, By Paris standards it s a great place small but super comfortable I liked that I had this feeling of a renovated space there which is rare in Paris Receptionist working there are extremely helpful and kind Any interaction with them was a pleasure There is a room service too which we used on several occasions We will stay there again and recommend our friends and family to do so 
151757,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Extreme small room and bathroom Could literally not move around in the bathroom Large mildew spot near the window Bad sound isolation you can almost hear the people in nearby rooms breathe, Convenient location
151758,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Walls are very thin and you feel the rolling during metro I don t recommend for familys with children or who wants to have a good sleep , location of the hotel is very close to Montparnasse Gar and Metro station At most 100m away I strongly recommend to young couples or people who just want to use hotel for sleeping Rooms and bathroom is very small but very very clean 
151759,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Tiny rooms with paper thin walls meaning you can hear everything going on in neighbouring rooms Beds and pillows very uncomfortable , Plenty of restaurants around and close to Metro station Reasonably nice breakfast but very small breakfast room
151760,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Facilities to make a cuppa in the morning would have been a nice to have but wouldn t stop me recommending this place , Beautifully presented great location very friendly and helpful staff

151764,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The hotel was dark with darkly painted walls and hall lights that didn t come on until they detected movement , Location friendly helpful staff great breakfast
151765,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, The subway you can not under any circumstances stay on the 1st floor The noise is terrible even with earplugs its like the subway runs in the next room Noicy beetween the rooms as well and the room was soo small 60 80cm from foot end bed to wall And the toilet door is not a door its just a sliding door in glass Not very private and aslo very small I will not book this hotel again or recomend it to any one If you choose this hotel you must stay on top floor othervise choose another one , Clean nice bed and pillows The staff was friendly and helpful 
151766,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia,No Negative, Very nice Hotel it is located in the centre of paris only 20 mins walk for the eiffel tower many shops and restaurants near the hotel Very nice atmosphere and staff very helpful I recommend this hotel it was a really pleasant stay 
151767,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Unfortunately I was for business and there was no room for doing my work The rooms are quite small so no room for a desk, What a great petite little hotel my choise for a romantic tript to Paris Very much attention is addressed to the ambiance and breakfast is all you can wish for 
151768,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Nothing , Everything From greeting you with a smile to holding your luggage to bringing your luggage to you room to offering macaroons as a wedding gift to cleanliness to luxurious soaps to comfort etc this boutique hotel is perfect Thank you Staff for your extraordinary service We will definitely see you again Xoxo
151769,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, Room is very small and bathroom is so small it really feels like an airplane bathroom Also we asked the hotel to call a cab for us since we needed to get to the orly airport early Friday morning it cost us 55 and it was an uber not an official taxi and the real price is around 20 This is taking advantage of tourists and not okay for a hotel to do that , clean room
151770,H tel La Parizienne by Elegancia, everything is good until last night we found our room left open after room cleaning for whole day while we have Euro 10 000 assets in the room Luckily nothing lost We reported this issue to hotel staff but they seem to push responsibility to the cleaner which I not satisfied with their explanation wonder if I lost something who going to compensate me , Location quite central convenient to go all the attractions using metro 3 different lines nearby can see Eiffel Tower from the hotel Clean room Room size not too bad Many restaurants nearby Convenient shop nearby
