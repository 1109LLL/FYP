20546,The Nadler Victoria, The rooms are just a tad small the only downgrade I could find But really it s an older building probably 19th century that s been upgraded and modernized nicely , Staff was 1st rate The young woman Carmen with the most enchanting eyes I might add was especially friendly and helpful 
20547,The Nadler Victoria, Even though we booked over 6 months in advance we asked for rooms side by side as we had young children and were put at opposite ends of the hallway which was a bit annoying, Beds were amazingly comfy In an excellent location with great little coffee cafe straight down stairs The staff could not do enough for us Enjoyed our stay 
20548,The Nadler Victoria, In the basement you can feel the underground but it s not too bad , The bed was very comfortable and the hotel can be accessed via a tube exit that means you don t need to go through Victoria station Tiny kitchenette would be very handy if staying more than overnight 
20549,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Room was very comfortable and well appointed Very easy walk to the tube and Victoria station with lots of eating options nearby Staff were all excellent to deal with This will be my first choice when I m next in London 
20550,The Nadler Victoria, No breakfast Given the price for the room this is a little hard to swallow , Just 2 blocks from Victoria Underground Station and 3 blocks from Victoria rail station There are bus tours of London starting and ending near the station making this a pretty convenient location Extra large rooms for a London hotel The staff is very friendly and helpful We highly recommend the hotel for this feature Their tourism and dining recommendations were very helpful The rooms are the largest and nicest I have seen in many years of visiting London The room was very quiet and had good air conditioning 
20551,The Nadler Victoria, The receptionist never told us anything about the hotel so I did not know of any faculties e g if there was a bar or dining facilities , The coffee making facilities in the room comfy beds and quietness of the area 
20552,The Nadler Victoria, Housekeeper did not empty the wastebaskets every time she cleaned , The hospitality staff was excellent Roberto Russo is the manager and he leads by example Before we left the US we contacted Carmen who arranged for a car to pick us up at Gatwick She responded very promptly to my enquiries Roberto personally helped us plan a day outing to Greenwich Cristina Altaur and Silvia and Carmen were exceptionally attentive to me and my husband greeting us answering our questions arranging for transportation and making us feel welcome I would go back because we were treated as guests should be The hotel is a five minute walk to Victoria Underground and a seven minute walk to Victoria Coach Station It is directly acrosss from Buckingham Palace and St James s Park Lots of good cafes take away and restaurants for every budget 
20553,The Nadler Victoria, There is nothing that I would change , Staff was amazing The hotel is hidden on a quiet street one block from the Buckingham Palace wall 2 minute walk two blocks to the Palace stables 3 minute walk and three blocks from the main Palace entrance easy 4 minute walk Hop on Hop off bus stop one block away 1 minute walk Victoria Transportation Station 5 minute walk Huge shopping and many many restaurants within minutes Cab service is available at the front desk and usually takes 2 3 minutes for it to arrive Best hotel and best hotel service I ve had in years
20554,The Nadler Victoria, OK everything was great but 2 annoying items The garbage can in the rooms was one the you have to step on the side lever to open You might have to chase the can around the room when it is empty A good old trash can would have been great Number 2 is this hotel is technically advanced with electronics Maybe too advanced you might have to play with items to get them to work or like I did call the front desk , The front desk was beyond outstanding in every way The rooms were small but they had everything you need or could want If the room didn t have the staff would get it Terrific hotel 
20555,The Nadler Victoria, I stayed in a back room with an uninspiring view of an interior courtyard but the room was quiet due to the location , Amazing Location near Buckingham Palace and across from the Royal mews It was 2 blocks from Victoria Station so central to the entire city 
20556,The Nadler Victoria, I was given a room in the basement and it was really noisy due to trucks driving on the road next to the hotel It felt like they were driving on you because the room was below ground , Nice decoration great location 
20557,The Nadler Victoria, Only request would be for better coffee available in the rooms, Small rooms this is London but excellent customer service Nauris was the gentlemen who checked us in and was superb I stayed in two rooms and found the basic room better laid out than the King room or similar name the fact the basic room was downstairs but still had natural light didn t bother me Great place with great staff and will stay again when back in London 
20558,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing to complain about really , The central location We attended an event at Buckingham Palace so only had to walk around the corner And we were given an upgrade 
20559,The Nadler Victoria, The hallway lights were on motion detectors and still dark when lit It was also dark decor which can make it difficult to navigate The room had a safe but was on the lowest shelf in the wardrobe and not easy to access especially if older or mobility is a problem , The location was perfect for our visit The room was spacious The decor and bathroom was modern Our room was above a side street and very quiet 
20560,The Nadler Victoria, Can t think of a thing that wasn t above my expectations , Superb customer service The Nadler had the most helpful and personable staff I ve ever dealt with 
20561,The Nadler Victoria, Pillows could be more comfortable, Extremely friendly and welcoming staff well trained Nothing is a problem Good showers plugs next to mirrors so that you can dry your hair and ghd hairdryer 
20562,The Nadler Victoria, There is no real breakfast option they can organise you some food but its not the same as a breakfast served at the hotel restaurant But you have a kitchenette so you can prepare some breakfast for yourself , This was my second time in Nadler Victoria I will be coming back This is a great location walking distance from Victoria station Extremely comfortable for my business commuting Rooms are really great comfy bed kitchenette 
20563,The Nadler Victoria, Somewhere to eat in the hotel would have been great but we knew it didn t exist when we booked so couldn t really complain , The hotel has no facilities itself other than a room service I E no restaurant which we knew about anyway but they did give us great guidance on where to eat locally and with discounts provided Excellent and extremely helpful staff without too much exuberance great please to stay and particularly good if you re going to see the Palace 
20564,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing it is a boutique hotel that is room only If you book knowing this you won t be disappointed, The finish of the hotel overall is to a good standard The room I stayed in was very quiet for central London
20565,The Nadler Victoria, Would of Likeed to be able to have breakfast or meals within hotel but there were restaurants near, The staff were fantastic and couldn t do anymore to help Brilliant 
20566,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing negative at all to say A suggestion an electric toaster would be an added bonus to the already great supplies in the kitchenette , The Nadler Victoria in a great location very convenient to Victoria Station and popular tourist destinations Room super clean kitchenette with microwave fridge and kettle a big bonus Also found nearby shops have everyday essentials No hesitation in booking Nadler Victoria for my next stay in London 
20567,The Nadler Victoria, This may sound silly but I m not a big fan of fake fur throws on the beds Also a bathroom would be a welcome enhancement , This is about the 4th time I ve been here since last year so all things good The staff is cheerful and helpful no matter what time of day Any problem with the room is addressed as soon as possible The decor is tasteful and relaxing Good mattresses I always get a good night s sleep In terms of location two minutes to my office unbeatable 
20568,The Nadler Victoria, Room 007 is right next door to one of the staff s main thoroughfares this meant that from relatively early in the morning you could hear the beep of the cards they used for access this woke us up several times I would definitely stay here again but would ask not to be located in one of the basement rooms , The staff were lovely 
20569,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing we had a great stay, We had a king room booked to attend a royal garden party The hotel is very convenient for the Palace and a good location in all close to Victoria and Belgravia The room although not large had everything required for a comfortable stay The GHD hairdryer was a nice touch and a big improvement on most rubbish hotel hairdryers We did not use the mini kitchen other than for a couple of cups of tea but the water filter tap was appreciated I m always happy to see a solid loo door these days when new hotel style seems to be more important than practicality The hotel and room were very quiet great soundproofing The hotel staff were very professional very friendly and helpful We had an issue with the safe and TV when we arrived but help arrived immediately to resolve the problems So nice to stay somewhere where the employees are happy 
20570,The Nadler Victoria, Rooms were on the small size, Staff were very helpful in terms of answering questions and making suggestions for restaurants for example The sound insulation is obviously very good as despite a major construction project across the street the hotel was very quiet
20571,The Nadler Victoria, Had room in basement Room was still good But looking at a wall is not nice , Location is great close to Victoria Nova with nice restaurants The room was small but clean and nicely furnished 
20572,The Nadler Victoria, Construction across the street although the hotel is very sound proof and noise was not an issue , The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly As a first time visitor to London and your hotel this was very much appreciated 
20573,The Nadler Victoria, The room was a little on the small side , Friendly helpful staff Clean room The location is excellent just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace St Jame s Park The Mall and Victoria station
20574,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing I can think of , The location was very good next to the Victoria tube station and next to a number of excellent restaurants The staff was very willing to help you and was able to book a personal taxi service to London City Airport when the DLR was not running in the weekend 
20575,The Nadler Victoria, It would have been good to have the option of breakfast in addition to diy in room tho plenty of eateries nearby , Great mini kitchen in room Staff were great Location superb 
20576,The Nadler Victoria, The standard room rate excluding breakfast is a bit too expensive , All staffs are very friendly and willing to help in all cases The hotel location is excellent 
20577,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, This is in the center location of Victoria and you can walk to Buckingham Palace Big Ben London Eye It takes around 10 minutes walks to Big Ben and London Eye For Buckingham Palace it only 5 minutes walk The service is spectacular and very friendly 
20578,The Nadler Victoria, We were on the bottom floor so the views weren t great and I would have liked there to be a bar restaurant but you didn t have to walk very far to get to the nearest one, The location was perfect and local amenities were excellent and also very close Room was very modern with a luxurious feel to it and while it was compact it had absolutely everything you could need It was very very clean and the staff were friendly and fabulous 
20579,The Nadler Victoria, Housekeeping may be improved Standard double room no 110 has a small window looking to bathroom door , Staff on the reception was very hospitable kind and helpful Especially our special thanks to Christina Bathroom design was modern and the hair dryer worked very well Room was large Very close to the Apollo theatre Wicked musical and Victoria station 
20580,The Nadler Victoria, Website and booking did not provide clear instructions as to how to get to hotel from train station pretty crucial when there is so much construction going on Also I noticed that customer service was patchy I saw some customers get very friendly and helpful assistance while I did not get that treatment They simply processed my check in and check out in very official manner and then sent me on my way , Bed was quite comfy and very much appreciated having mini fridge and microwave in the room in addition to Nespresso machine 
20581,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, I love the Nadler Victoria great staff that are always helpful and kind The rooms are great as is the location just 5 mins walk from Victoria station and Buckingham Palace Ideal 
20582,The Nadler Victoria, This was by far the most expensive room we said it in our 10 day trip across the United Kingdom It was around 450 for just two nights in the weekend Also it had a very small room so any more than a couple it was just my wife and I would make for very cramped quarters , It had a very contemporary modern looking room and it started with very courteous front desk service in which they led us to our room It had a very nice contemporary bathroom as well Finally the room itself had individual wifi service Its location was also very convenient as it was only 5 minute walk to both Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station and therefore direct train service to Gatwick airport 
20583,The Nadler Victoria, There happened to be a fruit basket in the room and reception rang to let me know it was not intended for me not so nice but that I could keep it very nice , A friendly and knowledgeable reception is particularly welcome after a long trip On learning that I had not requested a room at street level without a second thought reception immediately offered me another room upstairs When I asked for directions to a particular restaurant close by reception pointed me in the right direction without needing to search on line for the location Nothing beats friendly and well informed staff 
20584,The Nadler Victoria, Actually nothing All my expectations were met with this hotel 3 d it , This hotel was FANTASTIC I loved the personalize greeting on the TV when we came in The beds were incredibly comfortable I could have slept all day if I wasn t so excited about seeing the city The decor was chic and modern The shower was awesome The staff was very friendly It was also very nice to have a little mini kitchen and hairdryer I will absolutely recommend this to anyone I know travelling to London 
20585,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing a very pleasant experience , Convenience location pricing Rooms were nicely proportioned Bonus was a little kitchenette Someone has thought about the guest for a change 
20586,The Nadler Victoria, Corridors slightly dark but I am being picky here , The kitchenette in the room was superb The addition of the Nespresso machine and complimentary coffee pods added a touch of luxury The room was immaculately clean and fitted out to an extremely high standard Beds were comfortable The bathroom had an excellent large showerhead The location was superb for my needs

20591,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, We had a really lovely stay in The Nadler Victoria The staff was friendly and genuinely helpful At first we were a bit doubtful since our room was on the lower ground but after the first night we realized it was actually a good thing we could not hear traffic or nearby construction works at all and slept like babies during our vacation We will definitely choose The Nadler again if we re coming to London 
20592,The Nadler Victoria, The construction site next door turned out to work as an earlier than planned alarm clock It should only be temporary though , The room was spacious enough for a London hotel The mini kitchen with Nespresso and Brita tap came in quite handy Staff were cheery and helpful You could not but go around with a smile on your face

20598,The Nadler Victoria, The electrics in the bedroom seemed to be in need of attention in places ie the kettle did t work and I was unable to charge my phone , Really warm greeting by very enthusiastic receptionist Very keen to ensure I was aware of everything that the hotel and London has to offer 
20599,The Nadler Victoria, Not enough hooks or places for clothes , Personal attention from three staff members They went beyond our requests for help Very genuine and sincere a home away from home 
20600,The Nadler Victoria, Wifi kept disconnecting pillows were terribly hard for us and difficult room was too too bright at night and couldn t tell when in the morning it was The lobby was barren and with no signs of of a welcome, Impeccably clean and very professional yet friendly staff couldn t do enough

20624,The Nadler Victoria, hotel staff while very eager to please still needs more training Nevertheless they are performing very well , The Hotel is really nice I have stayed at the mandarin and Langham before but this place can beat the 5 star hotels
20625,The Nadler Victoria, The standard double is pretty small and althouth it had everything we neede i would love to see a bit bigger room, The location of the hotel is very convenient Its 2 3 min easy walk to victoria station and its like 1 min walk to a big shopping center where you can find all kinds of restaurants and shops

20631,The Nadler Victoria, Could have used a tutorial regarding the lights and switches Very complicated for an old brain A room bar or a small bar and breakfast area would have made it better I hated the bar adjacent to the Hotel , Hotel was very comfortable and clean Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Several even walked us out to the cab Great location and loved the internet tv combo 
20632,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Although our room was small it was well appointed and thoughtfully planned so that the space was used well We were very impressed with their clever use of energy saving devices it points the way for other countries to adopt its policies The staff always went out of its way to be helpful to us strangers in London and by the end of our six days with them we honestly looked upon them as family 
20633,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing , Location and the staff Nothing was too much trouble right down to a brolly in the evening They even gave us a couple of coffees when we went back to collect our luggage

20635,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing, Very good service Especially we need a print for ticket when I sent a email before leaving room and downstairs They have printed it already and seal in the envelope 
20636,The Nadler Victoria, No bar or restaurant so meals including breakfast had to be ordered from outside Unfortunately breakfast didn t start until 7 30 so left without , Excellent location and v warm welcome from the staff Had small double room which was beautifully decorated and comfortable Particularly loved the kitchen in a cupboard complete with crockery and microwave 
20637,The Nadler Victoria, The room was very small way too small for a couple Despite requesting for a larger room in response to the General Manager s welcome email no effort was made to find us a larger room Complimentary bottle water was provided only on arrival but there is a 1 charge for additional water which is not the norm in Europe The hotel was little more than a serviced apartment Location was convenient and close to historic tourist sites and access to public transport There is major construction work going on opposite the hotel and around the precinct Not a huge inconvenience but not a pretty sight , Bed was comfy Staff were friendly 
20638,The Nadler Victoria, There is no restaurant which is not a problem since there are several good coffee shops and restaurants within a minute s walk from the hotel , Although the rooms are compact ie small they are very well designed Modern spotlessly clean comfortable bed great built in kitchenette Even though this hotel is in the heart of the city the room was quiet 
20639,The Nadler Victoria, The switch on the kettle didn t work I had to stand with my finger on it until it boiled Fresh milk would have been a nice touch to go with Nespresso machine A tuck box I arrived late and hadn t eaten dinner the only thing on offer was a bag of crisps , The hairdryer was the best one I have ever had in a hotel room 
20640,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Convenient location Hotel was in great condition and staff were friendly and helpful There is no restaurant in the hotel but there s no need for one with all of the restaurants nearby There IS a mini kitchen in the room which was a bonus microwave plates etc 
20641,The Nadler Victoria, No gym on site although they did have an arrangement with a gym that was close by , Loved the soft jazz playing in our room when we arrived the kitchenette and the luxe furry throw on our huge comfy bed Staff were super helpful and friendly 
20642,The Nadler Victoria, Price is a little high but central London is spendy , Location is very central easy to walk most places and very close to Victoria Station Staff was friendly but not obtrusive Bathroom was more sizable than I expected in a good way Bed is comfortable Each room has its own temperature control which worked well Nice to have coffee tea making facilities and microwave Great stay and would stay again 
20643,The Nadler Victoria, The room was small as compared to other hotels in that price point Also my room was in the basement of this hotel Pitch black when you get off the elevator Automatic lights do turn on after you exit the elevator but they are really dim No windows in the room With that said I do not know what above ground rooms look like So to be fair If my room were on another floor it might have been perfect , The room was beautfiful and updated 
20644,The Nadler Victoria, Construction in the area not the hotel itself View consists of a large hole in the ground and the noise is significant during the day , This is wonderful hotel Staff and room are great While the room is small it may be the best laid out of any I have been in 
20645,The Nadler Victoria, Wifi was slow at peak times Would have liked a couple of flatter pillows The ones we had all were pretty thick and left me and my wife with stick necks in the morning , The friendly and helpful staff especially the woman who checked us in and set up our room very nicely for our honeymoon The location was also great 
20646,The Nadler Victoria, Would have been nice to have a clock in the room , Very comfortable beds Rooms very clean and well appointed Good sound proofing so very little noise Had a excellent nights sleep and would definitely recommend this hotel 
20647,The Nadler Victoria, Nesspresso capsules in room on a personal level would of liked to have a Kazaar capsule or two but i like strong coffee , We were greeted by two lovely reception staff information given was very useful taken to room by one our lovely reception staff shown all aspects of the room and its facilities including Nesspresso maker bed was best I ve slept in in a hotel great location everything was nearby ie beer wine food shopping etc reception staff organised transport for us all in all excellent hotel warming and welcoming staff trouble free overnight stay thank you 
20648,The Nadler Victoria, The trickiest part was maneuvering around the street construction but that isn t a long term proposition so really no downside , The location of the hotel was excellent The staff was very accommodating and helpful We enjoyed our stay and got a kick out of being neighbors to Buckingham Palace 
20649,The Nadler Victoria, The room safe was on the bottom shelf of the closet the a c didn t work as well as it could and the pillows were too hard, Great location wonderful staff still sparkling new We would stay there again A bargain for the area Lots of places to eat nearby easy access to the underground 
20650,The Nadler Victoria, Staff were a bit meh gave me hassle with Amex on arrival which was their error but didn t apologize for the 20 I spent trying to figure it out , Comfy silent and dark all the things I need from a hotel Room was small but then that s why it s called a small double but was nice and modern 
20651,The Nadler Victoria, The pillows were too hard for our taste but may suite others An on site restaurant would be an asset but there are plenty of places to dine nearby and a continental breakfast can be arranged , Staff exceptionally helpful and friendly Great location Clean modern hotel and rooms with good kitchenette should you wish to self cater 
20652,The Nadler Victoria, A mirror needs to be on the wall behind the desk for those women who prefer sitting to apply makeup , The rooms are small but filled with everything you need in space economy ways I loved my room The beds are magical I m an insomniac but I fell asleep each night as soon as I put my head on my pillow 
20653,The Nadler Victoria, No breakfast available on site but you can order some in and there are a few great places to get breakfast in the local area , Staff were excellent 2 min walk to the Palace Rooms have a kettle microwave and coffee machine Comfy bed

20656,The Nadler Victoria, No on site restaurant or bar facilities but I had my breakfast delivered to my door in the morning , Fantastic personal customer service the location was perfect for most of Londons famous landmarks with the palace a stone throw away Value for money was great and I now wouldn t stay anywhere else in London 
20657,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, This is a boutique hotel that has done away with typical amenities such as workout room food service or pool and focused on providing one of the best room experiences I have found in a hotel New technologies fine linens and smartly laid out rooms plus caring excellent staff are what the hallmarks here 
20658,The Nadler Victoria, Breakfast wasnt the best but nothing to complain about , Very very nice bit pricy but well worth it A wonderful stay staffs were super helpful and nice Hifi up to date and caught me by surprise 
20659,The Nadler Victoria, Design of bathrooms meant that showering could make the entire bathroom wet That s my only complaint and it wasn t even a big deal, Location is amazing literally the closest thing you ll get to sleeping with the Queen Staff were exceptional beds super comfy excellent value for money
20660,The Nadler Victoria, Light kept switching off in the kitchenette, The staff genuinely wanted to help with no unexpected charges Plus we noted the makes of the towels and bed throw to buy them for ourselves 
20661,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Welcome and information on the area was so good We were given answers to all our queries regarding the best places in and around the hotel The access to palace etc was excellent no need for transport but getting to other areas was also good as transport links were great Thank you
20662,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing As with many parts of London there is nearby building work but the room was well soundproofed , An oasis of calm in a very busy area of London Couldn t get a better location for visiting the Palace Very comfortable room great bed bathroom with a shower and TV that you don t need a degree in engineering to work out how to use like all the Nadler hotels 
20663,The Nadler Victoria, Wifi a bit slow , Lovely room My wife was recovering from a knee operation staff were super helpful to her while I was out cycling London 100 Carried all the bags to car really looked after her 
20664,The Nadler Victoria, Everything was great , Staff was incredible Booked our theatre tickets and concerts Shopped for best price Suggested great restaurants Could not have done more Loved our stay Highly recommend 
20665,The Nadler Victoria, Minor gripe a sign says you can ask for a rubber mat for the shower it reply needs to be in place the shower is very slippery , Very well designed Functional everything thought through The staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful without fawning Nice efficient engaging fun 
20666,The Nadler Victoria, The room was very warm it would have been ideal if the AC was timed to come on periodically throughout the day , Staff were really helpful Bed was super comfy 
20667,The Nadler Victoria, Not the fault of the hotel as we should have done our research The hotel is just inside the congestion tax area around 200meters and as we dropped our bags off before returning our hire car we incurred a 107 charge Tip catch a taxi from the hire car drop off , Excellent hotel in a wonderful location easy access to restuarants transport and central London The staff were amazing so eager to help with recommendations and any concerns Everytime I waited in the reception area I was offered complimentary coffee or water We will definitely choose stay again
20668,The Nadler Victoria, Daylight was showing through the curtains room a little bit small for 3 persons, To be on the 5th floor room equipment very silent very nice staff recent hotel kitchnette
20669,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, We had a great stay at The Nadler Victoria and would definitely book again The room was lovely and the kitchenette was a fab bonus Especially as we had a young baby with us The hotel was able to provide us with a travel cot There were lots of little touches that showed great attention to detail GHD hairdryers connection cables micro USB etc Staff were nice and location was perfect 
20670,The Nadler Victoria, There was not a little confusion when I tried to email to have the hotel secure us a car from the airport I felt that many different people responded at different times without checking the history Reception was polite but a little cool as well , Nice and new liked the decor and location by Buckingham Palace and a nice variety of restaurants and souvenir shops Also had a nice little kitchenette 
20671,The Nadler Victoria, Not sure whether anything is being done about the building next to the Nadler but it does detract and there was a lot of building work going on along the main street, The staff were very helpful with information about good restaurants and for breakfast and even provided us with a printed map of a place a little away from the normal tourist places
20672,The Nadler Victoria, Disappointed there was no cooked breakfast Don t eat carbs so had nothing Problems getting the TV to work though staff helpful , The kitchenette would have been great if we had been staying longer but for overnight all you really need is a kettle Nice bathroom 
20673,The Nadler Victoria, We were given a room in the basement level despite having booked months ahead , The friendly front office staff particularly Jennifer Bourda who was most helpful pleasant and prompt 
20674,The Nadler Victoria, There is no dining room nor restaurant facilities Room a bit dark quite a small window, It was really was really handy to have a kitchenette in the room 
20675,The Nadler Victoria, Would have been good to have a small breakfast room but plenty of options nearby, I liked the location next to Buckingham Palace Easy walking distance to West End shopping Parliament Square London Eye and South Bank attractions
20676,The Nadler Victoria, Didn t have a toaster a few more pieces of cutlery and cups etc needed , Fantastic location so helpful staff mini kitchen useful Free local calls up to 30mins 
20677,The Nadler Victoria, I went at the beginning and the end of my trip The first room I had was very very small Obviously it s not a huge issue but I would have liked to know There wasn t enough room for our luggage and our bodies to move around I upgraded for my second stay , The location was great the staff was friendly and helpful 
20678,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Great shower nice compact room some would say small but was clean well finished and had everything you need TV and room specifics free WiFi was a huge plus plus plenty of data and electrical outlets 
20679,The Nadler Victoria, Not worth paying anymore than 120 as there are no on site restaurants nor bar nor room service for your midnight snack cravings , Everything is good for the price I paid around 120 per night 
20680,The Nadler Victoria, The aircon did not work the first night and we had 27 degrees Celsius in the room There were problems getting the wifi going on a couple of occasions had to reboot the router , Quiet room Very good value for money 
20681,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing really , Staff were excellent and friendly welcome Nothing was too much trouble for them Handy kitchenette in room meeting your basic needs Good location An excellent hotel with clean cut modern design 
20682,The Nadler Victoria, Check out at 11am would be nice the standard 12pm time , The staff is ber friendly and nice and localization is excellent for ones who are staying for short time because is super central 
20683,The Nadler Victoria, The view outside was of an interesting building site going on but if you re looking for something more scenic perhaps ask recommendations from the staff ahead of time , We had a lovely stay here for four days The location as great and easily got around the city from here Lots of restaurants and cafes by Victoria Station as well The room was a little tight but not unusual for London Everything was well designed and was pleasantly surprised to find a microwave in the little pantry as well On top of it all staff was always super friendly and dealt well to respond to any requests we made 
20684,The Nadler Victoria, That we had to leave, the staff was so helpful and amazing and accommodating The bed was heavenly The room was so clean and cute and had all the latest amenities 
20685,The Nadler Victoria, Some surfaces in room were a little dusty which was disappointing Very unimpressed to have paid more by booking on Booking com room would have been 30 cheaper had I booked direct , Location was excellent Room nicely decorated and had good facilities Staff were lovely Nice breakfast delivered to my room 
20686,The Nadler Victoria, Would have loved to been able to open a little window for some fresh air rather than the air conditioning I would suggest maybe putting lock bars on the window so it can open to a certain extent Could do with a full length mirror where there is more lighting rather than on the back door of the wardrobe Aslo the lights of the kitchenette and the wardrobe decided themselves when they wanted to come on not when we actually want them to come on lol, The bed was extremely conformable with a great range of pillow choice and the fur throw was AMAZING contemplated on bringing it home Shower was like heaven The kitchenette was very convenient
20687,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing, Such comfortable bed super clean and great having kitchenette and filtered water So quiet despite building going on in a big way neatby Staff excellent and location excellent Will dtay thete again when in London
20688,The Nadler Victoria, As anywhere in a high profile location rooms are a bit tight and if you don t like sleeping with A C you will be very hot as you can t open the windows , The location is great staff very pleasant and hlepful rooms clean and cosy 
20689,The Nadler Victoria, Would have preferred carpets in the bedroom and rather more space to move around in , The hotel is very convenient for Buckingham Palace Westminster Abbey etc and Victoria Although we were given a basement room it was well appointed and very comfortable 
20690,The Nadler Victoria, Not one thing really although maybe illustrative information on which items could be put in recycling bin in kitchenette , Great location Quiet and peaceful Staff very helpful and welcoming 
20691,The Nadler Victoria, Basement room so wouldn t have liked to stay for a few nights However for one night on business it was perfect for the money , The man on reception really went out of his way Fantastic service Functional room and excellent value given the location Free wifi a bonus

20694,The Nadler Victoria, The fittings in the room while new seemed quite cheaply put together and I wasn t thrilled with the comfort of the bed View wasn t great we looked out over a construction site but that can t always be avoided , The location is pretty grand if that s the part of the City you re interested in Rooms are clean new and rather stylishly appointed

20697,The Nadler Victoria, Room not ready when I arrived 2 30pm Receptionist very unhelpful No restaurant so no room service or breakfast unless you want a croissant in a bag delivered to your room Very basic lobby for a 4 star hotel more like a Premier Inn Dark gloomy corridors Room had dreadful view Large double room was tiny Meagre tea coffee supplies , Good quality TV Kitchenette handy 
20698,The Nadler Victoria, Room safe didn t work I do wonder why hotels don t check such things , Staff at Nadler are so helpful and really make you feel like nothing is too much trouble Other hotels should learn from them 
20699,The Nadler Victoria, It s London so it s expensive No food or drink area but there are a choice of hideously expensive bars and pubs nearby like the theatre bar that serves wine in plastic cups for 7 a shot , Excellent room huge comfortable bed intelligent sharp reception good sound and screen stuff Attention to detail Easy largely traffic free stroll to Victoria Station if you hit the right route 
20700,The Nadler Victoria, The British staff person on all our interactions was detached and not welcoming , Conveniently located Modern and pleasant room amenities In particular the staff person from Sicily was very professional cheerful and helpful

20704,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, All the staff were friendly and efficient without exception The room small double was small but well equipped comfortable and stylish I loved the fur throw and the slightly surreal illuminated book spines the recharging points and extra cables were a nice touch The bathroom was pristine and the shower was enormous The teeny kitchenette was just what we needed and I wish my sink at home looked as shiny though a dishcloth might have helped me leave it tidier We asked for a quiet room and it really was quiet no disturbances at all honestly the most peaceful night s sleep I have ever had at a hotel This was an exploratory visit we were sizing the place up for a possible return to a Nadler with our child and dog and it certainly convinced us to do this 
20705,The Nadler Victoria, Noise from the hall was a bit distracting probably because we were close to the elevator though I accept this would not bother too many people I suspect so don t let it out you off , Mini kitchen was really practicable made life much easier Bed was ultra comfortable Cleanliness 10 10 Staff were a pleasure to deal with

20711,The Nadler Victoria, The iron and ironing board were under the bed That s where they are kept and so very difficult to access The bath is very high and very difficult for an older person to get into and with the shower over the bath there is no alternative, Nice big room which was very quiet
20712,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Staff was willing to go above and beyond great knowledge of local pubs places to eat and see Had a minor room issue and it was handled in 10 mins flat Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend 5 mins walk to Victoria Station tube trains and 5 mins to Buckingham Palace

20750,The Nadler Victoria, Breakfast would have been great but thats an absolutely non issue I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone , My elderly parents were visiting and the staff were extra patient and courteous Despite incessant calls they were genuinely cordial Almost unbelievable for a hotel in this category for tourists the location couldn t possibly be more central
20751,The Nadler Victoria, Lack of breakfast facility , The room was small but nice I especially liked the pentry although a small dining table instead of a desk would have been more appropriate 
20752,The Nadler Victoria, Nothing, The hotel is new and really great value for money while I was on business and alone I would also recommend the hotel for couples and leisure trip While rooms are quite small they are fine and in London most of the day is spent out touring The facilities are good with basic kitchen in each room and staff were helpful and friendly while the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar this is not an issue as there are plenty within 150 meters and cafes within 50 meters for breakfast also the hotel will order in for you or you can do yourself All in all a great choice and value 
20753,The Nadler Victoria, Would have loved more coffee for the room and perhaps better quality shower gel and shampoo A bar would have been nice or a mini bar in room but there are places nearby , Brita filtered water on tap Nespresso coffee machine and basic refreshment amenities Interactive TV with personalised wifi access and a plethora of entertainment channels Big comfy bed and pristine bathroom with very large monsoon shower and heated mirror so it doesn t steam up

20756,The Nadler Victoria, The only minor drawback if any was the lack of onsite food service However the mini kitchen helped meet our needs giving us a place to prepare coffee and porridge , The king size bed was very comfortable and the room extremely clean and quiet The hotel was an easy walk from shopping dining sites and underground
20757,The Nadler Victoria, We knew before we arrived there was no breakfast but if at any time in the future they decided to offer this then the ratings would I believe be much higher , The hotel was super clean the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was lovely and also very quiet we both slept well 
20758,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, The Nadler Victoria is perfectly situated five minutes from Bucingham Palace with lots of great sight seeing locations within easy walking distance A beautiful hotel the room had a well equipped super functional kitchenette a spacious bathroom and a very comfortable bed Staff were very friendly and helpful indeed

20763,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Great modern place Fantastic attention to detail room was very clean and quite large Friendly and professional staff aiming to please Overall a real find in a great area of central London 
20764,The Nadler Victoria, One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is new and there are a number of ongoing construction projects in the vicinity as well so if you want to sleep in or spend time in the room there you may want to make sure you have a room which is not facing a construction site , Compact but well appointed rooms including kitchenette with coffee machine fridge etc welcoming staff Brand new hotel so everything is spotless Location is good close to almost everything tube station is within walking distance 
20765,The Nadler Victoria, Much of the area near Victoria Station is being reconstructed and unfortunately this hotel is right next to a building site , The hotel is brand new I had the sensation that we were the first people to ever use the room wonderfully clean and beautifully furnished The kitchen area with a microwave a coffee machine etc was great The staff were extremely kind genuinely offering to help especially Veronika who showed us to our room and explained everything The hotel is convenient for Victoria Station just a short walk and it s also very close to Buckingham Palace

20767,The Nadler Victoria, Photos are misleading We had booked a Large Double room which I refused to accept when I saw it It was barely big enough for a kid We were moved to a larger room where if you put two suitcases on the floor you can t walk pass through to the bathroom anymore You cannot open the windows in this hotel due to safety reasons we were told so at the reception So you ve got two options either suffocate or put on the a c I would consider the second one if the a c wasn t blowing directly at my head while sleeping The kitchenette and Nespresso coffee machine is a good touch if we had more space to actually enjoy it , The hotel is brand new very clean and located less then 5 min walk from Victoria tube station which is one of the most central hubs in London The staff is friendly and ready to help with anything 
20768,The Nadler Victoria, Would have been great to have breakfast but I guess that is easliy available localy, Great location very helpfull staff Very pleasant rooms very clean

20771,The Nadler Victoria, Could of have some robes and slippers in the room to relax and lounge around but this is my preference and does not detract from our overall experience, Im reluctant to give this hotel 5 stars as I don t want anyone else to know how great it is The staff at the nadler Victoria are always welcoming and attentive The standard of service decor and rooms are excellent I can t thank all the staff enough for accommodating our requests during our stay They make this hotel 
20772,The Nadler Victoria,No Negative, Excellent free wifi Very good for working in the room Small kitchenette with fridge and coffee tea maker is great not restaurant in hotel needed Water filter no need to buy bottled water environment friendly
