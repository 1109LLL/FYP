140872,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were upgrade to a junior suite Not sure how small the bathroom is in a standard double room but I would have traded in the sofa for a larger bathroom , Staff were lovely location was good and food in the restaurant was excellent The breakfast service was extremely well organised 
140873,Blakemore Hyde Park, a little far out but then again it was very quiet and in a good area, great value for money very helpful friendly staff very clean comfortable rooms will definetly stay again and recommend to friends and family
140874,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast is rather 2stars hotel The lady manager at the breakfast room was very loudy OK we are not deaf making clear the difference between continental and english breakfast Actually both are poor quality , Location
140875,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast is little choice n small place Not easy to find seat during peak time Bed is too soft , Location is silent n quiet but only 10 min walk from underground Lot of shops on Main Street so easy to buy regular things
140876,Blakemore Hyde Park, the lift broke down in which my son got stuck in there for 15 minutes on the Monday evening around 9pm , enjoyed my stay would recommend to my family and friends 
140877,Blakemore Hyde Park, No Sky TV we had planned to watch the Lions match which started at 8 30 a m but were told this was not available and we went to a pub down the road , On arrival we upgraded to a Suite which was a nice touch Staff very helpful and pleasant 
140878,Blakemore Hyde Park, Our first room had a shower unit and the second a bath which I much preferred Will have to remember to specify this on future bookings , I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and when we had a problem with the sprinkler in our room we were moved without delay 
140879,Blakemore Hyde Park, Elevator too slow Addition of 2nd elevator would be ideal, The croissants were a great reason to wake up to Washroom very sleek Inviting ambience
140880,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, me and the wife went to see Green Day We checked into the hotel about 11 o clock 10 30 And they graded a room So I can only recommend the place absolutely top drawer 
140881,Blakemore Hyde Park, One drawback of this hotel although not for us is that there is only one elevator serving all the guests We were on the first floor so weren t really bothered by this I suppose being a refurbished building it might have been a problem to put in another elevator , We were very satisfied with the Blakemore Hotel Our room an executive room was spacious and very comfortable The air conditioning was very welcome as it was rather hot in London when we were there The staff were very friendly and kind Breakfast was quite good although I didn t understand why they charged 5 50GB extra for the full breakfast The room was already pretty pricy so even if they slapped this price onto the room price we might not have felt it and had a much better feeling The location for us was really good as we wanted to be near a tube line Bayswater Station on the District Line which goes straight to Wimbledon Connections to other parts of the city were also convenient Queensway tube station 5 10 min from Hotel only 3 stops to Oxford street
140882,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast wasn t the best i have had and a really silly system of when you have booked on line it is only continental breakfast you are entitled to but can pay extra for full buffet breakfast The staff are very keen to point out what you are not allowed to have if you are only continental I felt that they were watching us to make sure we didn t help ourselves to a sausage Twin room wasn t particularly big but it was ok for the 2 nights we were there , great location of Hyde Park 2 tube stations in walking distance
140883,Blakemore Hyde Park, The was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in The walls are paper thin You could here everything in the rooms next door opposite and above Could even here others going to the bathroom and on one night another couple across the hall Getting to and from hotel with traffic was a nightmare On 2 occasions the taxi driver refused to take us to the hotel due to congestion , Looked good in the pictures 
140884,Blakemore Hyde Park, Very rude female staff member who checked us in condescending staff ill working air conditioner in room made sleeping very uncomfortable bright light coming in through sides of water stained window shade at 5 15 in morning Room needs room darkening shade staff opened our windows while we were out and came back to room with heavy rain blowing into the room all over my sisters luggage and my make up , Location Good Free continental breakfast wonderful toiletries pretty lobby
140885,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff went out of way to meet our needs We were caught in a broken elevator and they communicated closely with us through the process Taxis were called on time Directions to sites provided AC a definite plus Bath tub as requested 
140886,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were quite helpful We had to check out early and the front desk staff organized a taxi the night before as well as an early breakfast We were upgraded to a suite an unexpected treat Would stay here again 
140887,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room standard is fine Our room was oriented towards the street and was a bit noisy Nothing big but worth mentioning for those who are looking for quietness Both breakfast are disposed on the same table Nothing during the booking process mentioned that two different breakfast were possible to choose It feels really awkward to mix both breakfast and have hotel staff forbid customers to touch the dishes you are not entitled to like talking to children Breakfast was a general disappointment A nordic Scandic a 60 pounds night hotel has by far a better breakfast , Room of standard quality For Scandinavians the hotel is to compare with a Scandic when it comes to room standards 
140888,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was nothing to note in relation to a dislike , The facilities were clean and comfortable The staff were very pleasant and helpful Public transport was close by and also a laundromat The food at the hotel was of good quality and reasonably priced 
140889,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing really, The room was well sized and spotless If you re looking for high end this is not your place but if your looking for good value with friendly staff clean and large rooms this is your place it s a bit off the path for central London but within easy distance to South ken Sloan square Hyde park 
140890,Blakemore Hyde Park, Firstable the guy who receive us was way so rude and literally treat me as a hooker and I have no idea why But him was rude until try he last minute the we have been on the reception So bad impression The breakfast was nothing special and the woman who receive us on the breakfast area is quite rude in a way to say that you may pay for extra money for the whole breakfast and she asked me to get the money immediately just because my bill was already paid what makes me feel so uncomfortable early morning , T
140891,Blakemore Hyde Park, I would have thought for the price a complimentary bottle of water in the bedroom and a full English breakfast wasn t too much to expect and the breakfast area itself was rather cramped , Location was fantastic for Hyde Park summertime concert
140892,Blakemore Hyde Park, AC was not working in the room at mid night it seems that they close the ACs called reciption no one could help as it was late night I have also asked them to change the room they said we are fully booked and we cant do anything I called booking com and informed them the issue they directly called the hotel and sorted the issue out to find me a better room they also offered me other hotels nearby , Location and cleanliness
140893,Blakemore Hyde Park, Despite beautiful bathroom no toilet roll holder and had to ask housekeeping for a toilet roll Room 118 think it has been totally missed when refurbished as no signs of ever being one Hence why housekeeping could miss it , Clean modern facilities Good breakfast selection and very warm welcome by Nicolleta 
140894,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Great front desk team Helped to arrange for baggage storage Later adjusted rooms to have them nearly adjacent and offered to reconfigure them from twins to double if needed Even found a missing item we had left behind 
140895,Blakemore Hyde Park, The price But it is London it was quite a walk from British Summer Time in Hyde Park The event of which we came to London for The air conditioning did not work in the room, Overall smart comfy modern and clean room I would recommend Very attentive welcoming friendly staff 
140896,Blakemore Hyde Park, Dropped bags off at lunchtime and checked in late after an event in Hyde park When we went to our room the lighting did not work no reply from reception so had to go back down and wait Trip switch reset and all ok , Enjoyed relaxed lunch in hotel restaurant 
140897,Blakemore Hyde Park, Water Power of the shower was a bit weak Busy at breakfast so had to wait a bit , Location room was good as upgraded Clean bar good Value for money 
140898,Blakemore Hyde Park, The breakfast wasn t as good as others during our holiday , The most comfortable beds of our trip Lovely fluffy towels We received a free upgrade Perfect quiet room for the last night of our holiday 
140899,Blakemore Hyde Park, The continental breakfast should include at least boiled egg There was no hair conditioner in bathroom accessories Our room was located on ground floor and didn t get much daylight in the room Staff at reception could be a little bit more welcoming though They were not unfriendly but also not extremely friendly either You d expect when you leave that staff would say thank you for visiting and welcome again I would stay here again , Location was really good Just 5 minute walk to Hyde Park and bus stops to city center We also walked to Paddington station when we left Very easy There are plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby too Easy walk to the National History Museum as well Very good shower nice bathroom Newspapers available 
140900,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, The Terrace a delightful outdoor area rare in London hotels Good breakfast Room upgrade was great Polite and attentive staff Lovely hotel We will return 
140901,Blakemore Hyde Park, I can t find any fault with this hotel It was all good in our experience , We had a spacious comfortable room The staff were friendly and the continental breakfast was very good with the addition of a full English breakfast for a very reasonable supplement It looked good too although the continental breakfast was ok for us The hotel was fairly central and only a couple of minutes from Hyde Park so great for an early morning stroll in the sunshine I would definitely stay here again 
140902,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only so much selection on what you could have for breakfast included i e Fruit toast fruit juice etc had to pay separate for cooked breakfast think after what we paid should been included in price whether it be cooked breakfast or what ever they had on offer , Very clean and beds Was very comfortable Staff very friendly polite and welcoming would definitely use again
140903,Blakemore Hyde Park, There wasn t anything we didn t like , Location was safe and staff was excellent Restaurant with outdoor seating was very enjoyable Loved our room 
140904,Blakemore Hyde Park, The assigned room 110 was supposed to be an upgrade But beware To get to it you must carry your luggage down a half flight of stairs then when you open the door to the room there is another half flight of stairs to cart the luggage up Stay away from this room , Location and staff friendliness 
140905,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Very enjoyable stay good continental breakfast included Used concierge to leave luggage so we could explore without carrying our luggage Room available before 3pm check in 
140906,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Lovely Hotel very central and easy to reach all the tourist attractions Near to 2 underground stations and right on the doorstep of Hyde Park Beds were vey comfortable and breakfast was good Friendly and helpful staff 
140907,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bar area was in the foyer , It was in a convenient location The staff were efficient courteous and helpful The room was pleasant and very comfortable 
140908,Blakemore Hyde Park, Apart from the limited space the room was very hot with no way to reduce the temperature The noise from the pipes in the ceiling was very annoying continuous and the staff couldn t do anything about it I hope they can find a solution for this issue If you need wifi you have to go to the reception area no wifi signal in the rooms Breakfast was very disappointing , The small restaurant has nice and very polite staff and offers a range of delicious dishes The steak worth a try Reception staff were very helpful special attributes to Roberta 
140909,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast could have been a lot better After booking bed and breakfast found out it was continental only That was ok with us but the choice really wasn t as good as it could have been Have had a lot better Tea and coffee in room but no biscuits being picky now Twin club room wasn t very big but it was sufficient , Location to Hyde Park was excellent 20 minute walk to Marble Arch tube another 2 tube stations nearer too Staff really helpful and polite Fridge in room was lovely and cold 
140910,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We were pleasantly surprised to be given a room upgrade on arrival Although the bathroom was a little small the rest of the room was more than adequate for my wife and me We were blessed with some good weather during our stay and it was very pleasant to sit in the terrace area and have a drink 
140911,Blakemore Hyde Park, Suite was made up for 2 people and 3 were on the reservation Had to manage as not in hotel till 11 30 pm and felt it was too late to ask for bed to be made up and extra towels cup and drinks,No Positive
140912,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room service time limitation to 20 pm too short , Good location for London and surrounds particularly Hyde Park Great breakfast a little limited on room service Very nice outdoor terrace adjoining bar 
140913,Blakemore Hyde Park, The shower was in the wrong place water all over the floor slope in the bath was dangerous No biscuits with the tea only two breakfast teas Hot Breakfast was 5 50 extra after paying nearly 190 a night it should have been free I emailed ahead to say we were coming to London for my daughters 21st birthday there were no nice touches at all from the staff Bit disappointed too be honest won t stay there again next time I ll stay in the Hilton, The beds were comfy the location to Paddington was good 
140914,Blakemore Hyde Park, Continental and english breakfast separetly Why not just offer one breakfast for everybody It felt complicated 4 star hotel and we paid well for the room breakfast was no 4 star quality even if we took english breakfast for extra charge Ive had much better breakfast in cheaper hotels , Our room was cleaned very well every day And atmosphere was nice 
140915,Blakemore Hyde Park, Service for our Pre Theatre Dinner was slow but they did offer to put deserts in our room fridge for our return We did hear other diners complain about slow service , Comfortable bed and quiet for a ciity hotel 
140916,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast was very poor with a very limited choice Beds were quite uncomfortable , Food in restaurant was lovely and the air conditioning is a real bonus 
140917,Blakemore Hyde Park, You can hear the doors in the hallway and people walking upstairs but it didn t keep us from sleeping The pillows are too hard , Absolutely fabulous hotel for the money We took a junior suite and got upgraded to a beautiful suite Really good breakfast in the morning Good deco and interiors and very clean Big comfortable bed Friendly and helpful staff Location is amazing 5 min from Hyde Park We will come again 
140918,Blakemore Hyde Park, My room was on first floor front and seemed easy access from the street break ins Also it was noisy but the staff was gracious and offered to move me but for three nights it was okay to stay where I was , great staff good breakfast good bath
140919,Blakemore Hyde Park, My fish at dinner was very overcooked but that was a minor issue, Room and facilities were great outside terrace is beautiful and staff were very good the guy who checked us in Gareth I believe was very professional and very friendly
140920,Blakemore Hyde Park, We walked from Paddington a little far with a heavy case The lift too a long time it was quicker to walk up the stairs , We had a free upgrade to a suite which was very nice 
140921,Blakemore Hyde Park, The towel rack in bathroom was too high I needed to use a hangar to get towels down Regarding breakfast it took awhile to get coffee delivered to my table , I was upgraded to an executive room Regarding the bathroom the shower head was very powerful Also appreciated the bath mat for tub 
140922,Blakemore Hyde Park, Seems a bit petty but the Breakfast area is a bit small and some guests were really loud when talking I can never understand why people have to talk loud to someone on the same table across the room that I can hear every word they say Also people talking on mobile phones with the speaker on so that they can eat their food and have a discussion at the same time very rude but not the hotels fault , We have stayed here before so knew what to expect the staff were friendly and check in was relatively easy My wife and I enjoy walking and it is a nice walk into Oxford street from the Hotel and also had a great walk around Kensington Gardens and Hyde park The breakfast choices were very good and the restaurant had a good selection and what we had was cooked really well It was also a nice atmosphere sitting outside in the evenings having a drink Definitely will be going to the Blakemore again 
140923,Blakemore Hyde Park, Fell down on the marble steps no one from management even bothered to find out if I was ok Asked I could check out later because I came home from hospital at 6AM and wanted to rest Was told I could stay till 12 but after that there was a 50 pounds charge per hour Cant believe they had no consideration to think I fell because it was raining and no one cleaned the steps of the water from the rain , The restaurant staff very friendly and accommodating
140924,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast included was ok it was tacky to charge 5 extra pounds for the hot items which honestly they weren t that great My suggestion is give people the foooood Don t stress over 5 pounds There are a lot of hotel choices The a c was quite noisy but I didn t make a fuss about it , Very nice property in an area that s far from the main attractions yet close enough to its own life Hyde park is right down the street Central line runs by the hotel so it s super easy to get to any place There s a nice neighborhood coffee shop and laundry a few blocks away Great Indian and Greek food 
140925,Blakemore Hyde Park, Wifi is not always good and room air conditioning of one night out of our 5 night stay was not working One of our stored luggage s lock was damaged and opened hotel staff not helpful after reporting the damage, Room size
140926,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The location the friendly welcome and very responsive staff A joy to stay at your hotel and close to the tubes buses and also the shops and ease to get to the gardens and also London attractions 
140927,Blakemore Hyde Park, Internet was spotty complained 3 or 4 times before they got it fixed On the day of our arrival we were tired and hungry from traveling from the US we tried to eat dinner at the restaurant and even tho there were multiple tables available hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait after being ignored by the wait staff for an inordinate amount of time we left and had a nice meal at the Greek restaurant several doors down, Close to Kensington gardens staff friendsnotly and helpful for the most part Breakfast was good
140928,Blakemore Hyde Park, The green light in the room couldn t be turned off Charged incorrectly for a meal nothing done about it Breakfast buffet staff manager very overzealous about how much one person could eat , Location
140929,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast selection suggestion include the hot supplement in the room rate , Very good staff able to accommodate most requests easily This hotel is in a great location walking distance to three tube lines and Paddington Stations Hyde Park Kensington Palace Portobello Road and Notting Hill all close by Fabulous cafes and restaurants all round Plenty of options for an excellent breakfast if you dont want to always eat in the hotel 
140930,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, Beautiful hotel friendly staff I had a junior suite which was fabulous plenty of room with a sep lounge area and lovely big bath It is a great location easy walk to Queensway shops with plenty of food options for any taste buds easy walking to Kensington gardens as well as Buckingham palace if your able took us about 20 mins cutting through Hyde park

140932,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing to dislike, Absolutely loved everything about this hotel Wonderful location to subway and Kensington Palace and grounds We ordered room service after a tiring day and was delighted with our Chicken Caesar Salads especially enjoyed eating on our porch outside Would highly recommend 
140933,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was a seemingly unjustified distinction between the complimentary Continental breakfast and the several additional hot items bacon sausage scrambled eggs that constituted the Full English option for an additional charge Many hotels in Sweden offered a full buffet breakfast including such hot items as waffles eggs bacon and sausage and sometimes potatoes etc without such a distinction so this seemed petty I might have enjoyed the occasional serving of bacon but the Continental breakfast was more than adequate with a variety of breads pastries cold cuts cheese fruit yogurt and cereal including hot porridge on request , Excellent hotel with full service and fine facilities for an extended stay Friendly and helpful staff the receptionist recommendation for a very good Greek continental restaurant nearby when we arrived after the hotel kitchen had closed porter service to handle our baggage we were traveling with an unusual number of large bags concierge can summon taxi quickly from a reliable provider attentive service in bar restaurant The restaurant was very good There was a very pleasant terrace for bar and restaurant patrons and the lobby bar seating was comfortable and appealing The Continental breakfast in the basement dining area was very satisfactory with wait staff who recognized guests checked in for multi day stays remembered food preferences 
140934,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, This is our favourite location in London close to walks in the park and many antique shops and nice restaurants Our first time at the Blakemore and we will come here again 
140935,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had booked a DOUBLE room and we got two single beds however the housekeeping cam and changed it and made it up as a double We booked four months ago so this should not have happened However we were satisfied when it was done, All staff very nice
140936,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing really to complain about as it was a great stay Maybe they could upgrade some of the plugs with USB sockets or have some sort of USB charging port that would be beneficial , We were kindly upgraded to a lovely and quiet suite The bed was super comfy Loved the monsoon shower too The buffet breakfast was tasty and filling we purchased Full English over the complimentary continental breakfast and the staff were friendly and attentive We will stay again 
140937,Blakemore Hyde Park, Absolutely brilliant , Wonderful hotel to stay Best location Lots of shops to go and have breakfast lunch and dinner Good shopping Hyde park down the rode Just wonderful 
140938,Blakemore Hyde Park, Didnt realize how far out it was when we booked it location No closed captioning on the TV bummer for hearing impaired Staff was a little stuffy , Room was lovely just enough but not too much Loved the shower Thanks for the king bed and little refrigerator Loved the staircase 
140939,Blakemore Hyde Park, Poor wifi was a huge issue for us as it was often difficult to connect and it dropped out constantly which was frustrating , Very helpful front desk staff and at concierge I enjoyed the continental breakfast good variety and of good quality and once again your manager at the entry point was excellent 
140940,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast could have been improved Plus extension of room till 1500 hrs without additional money, I got a free upgrade to executive room Room lobby was nice with new carpets and paintings all over unlike novotel waterloo where i stayed last time and carpets were quite old 
140941,Blakemore Hyde Park, The welcoming at the desk was not good and friendly Dont remember her name We could not charge our phones and didnt got help Our rooms aircondition was cold or hot and straight to bed There was too loud music in the breakfast but we were too busy to tell that at the time , The doorman in the lobby was very nice and helpful Room was clean and nice Hotels location is great 
140942,Blakemore Hyde Park, Lift was a little slow But wasn t a big problem Just easy walk down the stairs when it took too long to come to thd floor , Great location and very comfortable beds Great bar as well with nice relaxing environment 
140943,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The workout room was fantastic and the location was great It was very close to an underground station so getting into London neighborhoods was very easy However the street the hotel is on is quieter and nice The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating 
140944,Blakemore Hyde Park, No view but didn t matter We weren t there to look out of a window , Excellent location with public transport within walking distance The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was great Room was very comfortable and clean The proximity to Hyde Park was really nice 
140945,Blakemore Hyde Park, The continental breakfast was pretty basic, The food served in the restaurant was very tasty Within 15 minutes from Paddington Heathrow Express Comfy bed upgraded to junior suite 
140946,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room was nice but for a double size it should have had two chairs Also for the price there should have been complimentary biscuits to go with the drinks , Breakfast very good room nice and clean 
140947,Blakemore Hyde Park, I booked and paid for four rooms for a total of 25 nights My husband and I were given a room next to the elevator with a broken air conditioner On the 9th I requested another room and was assigned another room next to a different elevator I immediately requested that we be moved I was told there was no other room available at that time I sent an email to the reservation department explaining our problem but did not receive a response The next day after very little sleep my husband went to the desk and requested another room He was angry and of course got immediate action resulting in us being put into 603 From that time on we were extremely happy I felt that the front desk was not listening to me and was not interested in my problem This problem could easily been solved and we would have been happy , The breakfast staff were fabulous and the breakfast was enjoyable Housekeeping was very thorough and accommodating 
140948,Blakemore Hyde Park, If you won t pay extra they won t let you check in until 3 00 This is within their rights but it is the first hotel I ve encountered which takes this approach Plumbing and footsteps above were a bit noisy , Comfortable with a good location 
140949,Blakemore Hyde Park, thin walls and doors you can hear noise from the corridor and your neighbour The silicone in the shower need to be refreshed black spots it poor breakfast , Localization size of the room fitness room very helpful staff nice building and lobby design of the room possibility to open the window hair dryer 
140950,Blakemore Hyde Park, Continental breakfast was included in our room rate but full english breakfast which was not cooked to order cost a further 5 95 , Nice hotel to stay away from the bustle of London whilst being close to everything There was a large comfortable bed in a spacious room The room we were allocated was on the ground floor at the front The hotel is located on a quiet street but even when traffic was passing the hotel we didn t hear it at all and were not disturbed The only disturbance was in the morning from the room upstairs which obviously had several children in it who were jumping up and down rather a lot which was noisy but that s hardly the fault of the hotel It takes 10 minutes to walk to the hotel from Paddington station and less than that to walk to Bayswater tube station Hyde park is 5 minutes walk away so the hotel is well situated 
140951,Blakemore Hyde Park, The cleaning lady had taken my waterbottle from my backpack during the roomcleaning when me and my son weren t in the room It s wrong that the cleaning lady had been digging in my personal belongings and taken the bottle from my own backpack ,No Positive
140952,Blakemore Hyde Park, dirty room invaded by dust poor daily cleaning 1 elevator serving a lot of people waiting time is crazy The steps of the stairs are less than one foot wide standard which makes it not only uncomfortable but risky ceiling is not sound proof steps of people walking upside are heard very loudly One feels a bomb is explosing doors closing system very noisy and disturbing all night long toothpaste is extra charged no water bottles provided in the room generally the hotel lacks basic structural features , Nothing special
140953,Blakemore Hyde Park, The included breakfast also should include the hot food without an up charge During busy breakfast times it seemed a little short staffed One morning we were not asked or able to flag someone down for coffee , Convenient location Good restaurant Friendly staff Good amenities 
140954,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel upgraded us to the Honeymoon suite and it was MASSIVE Huge bed 3 TVs lovely furniture and Fresh fruit Lovely Hotel and very friendly charming staff Very much recommend 
140955,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Great breakfast room was spotless and always clean Bed was soft and comfortable Nice view outside of the window Staff were very friendly particularly the woman in the dining room of a morning

140958,Blakemore Hyde Park, Overlooked the circle and district line so could hear the trains passing by shower in bathroom was really weak barely strong enough flow to wash with , Reception ladies very welcoming and pleasant Large bed 
140959,Blakemore Hyde Park, There is nothing that I did not like about the hotel , The hotel is in a beautiful area beside Hyde Park and very easily accessible from the Tube or taxis Inside the hotel itself is decorated beautifully and in my experience the staff were extremely helpful chatty and pleasant Also when we arrived they upgraded us to a junior suite which we both thought was a lovely gesture We did not eat in the hotel but I ordered room service on one of the nights I was quite tipsy and got peckish I ordered a margarita pizza which was really nice and the lady I was speaking to about where I was going to after my stay there was really friendly and wished me well for my further travels I was going to Bali the next morning and had to come to London to fly there I would definitely recommend this hotel both for the area the aesthetics of the place the staff and the value for money I will be back to stay 
140960,Blakemore Hyde Park, Over priced drinks some personnel not very friendly , The room was comfortable The morning service for breakfast was good Restaurant food was good Concierge was very helpful 
140961,Blakemore Hyde Park, It was a long walk from Paddington Station but hotel location was my choice , The staff was efficient helpful and friendly The rooms comfortable and well supplied 
140962,Blakemore Hyde Park, No food available at night, Breakfast was good but should start earlier We really liked our Concierge Joao he was very friendly and very helpful on giving us directions 
140963,Blakemore Hyde Park, The treatment that we got when we checked in was cold and unfriendly We arrived a bit earlier than the check in time We asked if it would be possible to just get any room because we were after a long travel and after 10 days of hiking We just wanted to freshen up and change clothes We explained that we are in London just for a day to celebrate our daughter s birthday and we will be out all day and in the evening we had tickets to a musical They were not willing to let us in and we had to change our clothes and freshen up in the toilets The whole attitude was totally not welcoming and not service oriented , The location was great The facilities are very good for this price We were upgraded at the end of the day due to misunderstanding in the morning when we checked in and the Junior suite that we got was fabulous It was a nice touch 
140964,Blakemore Hyde Park, No complaints, Upgraded for free to a suite on arrival lovely room spacious comfy beds modern bathroom The continental breakfast served a range of croissants cereals ham cheese and fruit You can upgrade to full English breakfast for 5 if you want to Right next to Hyde Park and good public transport links we used the tube a lot Taxi to Covent Garden 20 Fantastic stay definitely would return on our next visit to London
140965,Blakemore Hyde Park, Extra charge for English breakfast when I paid for breakfast to be included I assumed also included English breakfast not just croissants and pastries,No Positive
140966,Blakemore Hyde Park, Unfortunately we experienced consistently poor water pressure in bathroom taps a trickle and in the lower shower second morning the shower water was cold lukewarm Breakfast Croissants and rolls need to be improved quality Seeded brown bread for toasting seemed in short supply although there was plenty of white and thick cut brown , Property clean and freshly decorated renovated facilities in rooms good nice bathroom in good decorative condition comfortable beds TV tea tray bath products Breakfast room was well organised and managed Continental breakfast was regularly refreshed on buffet counter with reasonable selection on offer 
140967,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing it was excellent, Fantastic breakfast and the bed was out of this world We attended the garden party at the palace They really looked after us at the hotel excellent service and we will be back again
140968,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff tried to charge me for my daughter notwithstanding the fact that I had put all her details on the booking form and had been given a price based on her details The electicity in our room broke during the night and it took almost half an hour in darkness for anyone to come The breakfast was not good and the staff in the restaurant were inept and unfriendly ,No Positive
140969,Blakemore Hyde Park, It s such a rightly popular hotel that they need more than one lift , All the staff were extremely helpful and everything we asked for eg a room fan and cooler bed covers was provided swiftly and our requests were followed up by enquiries the following day if all was well 
140970,Blakemore Hyde Park, The elevators took a bit long but the property has 6 floors so easily to take the stairs , Hotel was located in an upscale part of town Very nice area and easy access to public transportation The room was very large and filled with all the necessary accommodations The continental breakfast was good and all the staff very friendly and helpful 
140971,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Slightly underwhelming to be fair Check in was dealing with a rather argumentative receptionist And the breakfast police were everywhere Let me explain we booked room with continental breakfast My mistake As soon as walked into the restaurant the greeting from staff was essentially you can t have a cooked breakfast unless you pay for it Never had that before and we certainly won t go back ecause of it 
140972,Blakemore Hyde Park, It is very welcoming The Concierge is ready to answer all questions and help out whenever requested The terrace bar is an ideal place to enjoy the sun while relaxing with a drink I really enjoyed the meals I had at the hotel , The Blakemore Hyde Park is a lovely hotel The suite was spotless the staff very friendly and helpful the full English breakfast worth every penny This is my choice hotel from now on whenever I am in London 
140973,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room was very hot and overlooked some sort of heating generator , Friendly staff in the dining room continental breakfast more than adequate Staff helpful booking transport for us Within walking distance to Kensington Gardens 
140974,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent stay altogether I will return Very clean and well kept hotel clean and tidy room fantastic bathroom Bonus that WiFi allowed Netflix use 
140975,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had a ground floor room and you can here the under ground trains rumbling, We were upgraded to a suite that was a nice surprise At breakfast there was a good selection of food stuff Free news papers 
140976,Blakemore Hyde Park, They have a hold on my card which they won t release, Hotel was fine until they decided to hold payments for no reason as their amount was taken out 
140977,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bed was a little uncomfortable for me but my wife liked it just fine , The hotel is located in a relatively quiet neighborhood near Hyde Park An Underground station is nearby so you can reach any major London attraction fairly quickly The staff was very professional and friendly Our room was clean attractive and comfortable The complimentary continental breakfast was a very good way to start each day Overall we had a good experience and would recommend this hotel 
140978,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast, The reception staff are friendly specially Gabriella and the food was excellent in the hotel restaurant breakfast was not that much of varieties very limited choices
140979,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We were upgraded to a very large room with all facilities The room was nicely warm and a great bed and bathroom very good breakfast Highly recommended
140980,Blakemore Hyde Park, The workings of the lifts need to be improved Also certain frontline staff need to be mindful to be courteous towards all guests irrespective of the color of their skin , Room clean cheerful staff serving breakfast
140981,Blakemore Hyde Park, the intercontinental breakfast is too poor just some cheese and ham fruits croissants not warm dishes , The room was super big clean and I got an upgrade P
140982,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We had an amazing stay at this hotel We checked in late and had booked an executive room only to be told we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite This completely helped to make our already amazing trip to London even more memorable Thank you so much to the lovely staff The room was amazing and we will definitely stay here again if we visit London again Only downside was the breakfast we pre booked was only continental and a further cost was needed for a hot breakfast which we knew nothing of until we arrived for breakfast Other than that we could not fault the hotel 
140983,Blakemore Hyde Park, Small rooms very narrow bed difficult to adjust to it if you re used to a bed of 1 8 2 m wide It was impossible to adjust the temperature in the room every night too hot No soundproof , Great location nice staff sufficient breakfast 
140984,Blakemore Hyde Park, The hairdryers in both our rooms had problems Just replaced one of them at our request No replacement for the 2nd one Internet is very week specially in the rooms , Good breakfast nice small restaurant good food very confortable beds
140985,Blakemore Hyde Park, The fact that full english was not included in the 176 price was a let down , Room eas very warm but the bed was fantastic and tv in the bathroom 
140986,Blakemore Hyde Park, Terrible staff at the breakfast Lacked training and elegence , Good value for the money you pay But if you want to experience something special then look elsewhere
140987,Blakemore Hyde Park, 1 Breakfast was not including every thing and this is not seen else were in addition we only eat halal food which makes oyr choices are really few 2 We ask for vat refund for airport and we where given only invoice which has no value in the airport without the letter from the hotel i think we are cheated by saying it will work in the airport , Clean nice staff and good location
140988,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Good choice of continental breakfast plenty of seating rare queues Though in the basement the room is air conditioned light and with an airy feel Public rooms and corridors are well proportioned and quiet The restaurant caters for most tastes and pockets The Bar is well stocked the wine list is adventurous and the wine well kept Bedrooms and bathrooms are spotless and generally well appointed The beds are comfortable yet supportive Given the general warmth of the building few guests should need more than the quilt provided Guests have self control of air conditioning and central heating Though window openings are restricted for safety reasons the available air flow is adequate 
140989,Blakemore Hyde Park, Most staff of the property are not as cordial and friendly as before perhaps as the hotel is getting very high occupancy Some facilities like in room safe and ac switch are not maintained properly However our room was changed when the ac was not working properly , The overall ambiance
140990,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We took advantage of a last minute discounted booking for a club double room Once informing the hotel that we had a six week old infant with us we received a free upgrade to a large suite We were very comfortable and felt quite spoilt Thank you 
140991,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was on the ground floor and the smoke from the cigarettes of the hotel residents sitting in front of the hotel was coming into the room through the windows The free continental breakfast includes only cold ham cheese cereals and croissants You have to pay 5 pounds if you want to have hot food They also charge you for slippers , The bed was quite good 
140992,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff was little bit incompetent The last day of our stay they provided us wrong information about time which is needed to transport to stansted airport by taxi and we almost missed the plane Also the last morning we ordered the earlier breakfast and everything what we got was yogurt bread and few packages of jam We did not expect the full breakfast but something like this is a shame for the four star hotel Also when you after cleaning service find your sleep dress thrown on the floor you are not happy , Nice location in nice part of london Clean rooms and comfortable beds good breakfast 
140993,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bathroom was very small so could have had more wall hooks for hanging clothes wash bags etc instead of having to place them on the floor The shower was only hand held with no head height socket so showering was rather awkward A rather strange hand held bottom washer shower hose right next to the toilet , Room 114 was big enough and very clean Bed very comfortable Outlook from window was acceptable though at times there was a strong smell of cooking 
140994,Blakemore Hyde Park, Me and my friend have been to many hotels but this is BY FAR the worst experience we had During the last 24 hours of our stay one of the hotel staff members entered our room and took a bag full of gifts and souvenirs we left near to our luggage We are very organized couple and this bag couldn t have been regarded as something else Unfortunately the hotel refused to take responsibility for this negligence or even tried to help us out They never bothered to answer our emails and when we called they gave excuses such as the manager is currently not here or we will respond by email We feel betrayed by this behavior lack of security and the fact that someone can walk into your room and take from your belonging in the sponsorship of the management Furthermore the lack of response of the hotel is shameful and disgraceful We will not come back to this hotel and advised all our friends not to do so as well ,No Positive
140995,Blakemore Hyde Park, IN THE BATHROOM WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR AFTER TAKE A SHOWER YOU TOUCH WITH YOUR FOOT A PART WERE THE DOOR STOP , JOAO FROM THE STAF FOR US HE IS THE BEST PERSON IN THIS REA 
140996,Blakemore Hyde Park, One elevator for a hotel this size is riduclous Always a wait and slow plus you never knew which way it was going Bath shower spray combo is a technical mess coming from North America takes a long time to figure out Noisey in street rooms especially with construction outside , Bed and pillows were very good 
140997,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The location is perfect next to the park and near bus station to downtown The area is very calm no business activities in the street Max 10 minute walk to metro train station shops and restaurants The staff is nice and helpful Our room was modern and in a very good shape 
140998,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent staff very helpful courteous Good breakfast with leading lady Nicoletta politely conducting staff visitors Overall very clean and quiet hotel We will definitely come again 
140999,Blakemore Hyde Park, Continental breakfast had exactly same items every day could do with some variation to keep it from becoming boring We were charged for having baby crib in room 7 a night that wasn t clear during online booking As for furniture and decor it s simple and chic but none of it is memorable , Booked double club room and requested baby crib for the duration of my stay Our room was upgraded on arrival for no extra charge although not much of an explanation was given we remain happy with the upgrade Room was spacious very comfortable extra large double bed exceeded expectation in size and comfort 
141000,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was nothing we didn t like about our stay , It was very clean and comfortable with a good breakfast It s located in a nice area with good transport links I would highly recommend staying here 
141001,Blakemore Hyde Park, Our room was near a fire door which banged loudly early morning waking us up easy to fix I would think One small lift which proved a small problem at breakfast when lots of people moving from floor to floor, Location room size cleanliness helpful staff all good
141002,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, great location good value and a short walk from the tube and high street with pubs and restaurants close to Paddington if you need the Heathrow Xpress Staff really friendly great breakfast 
141003,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, I loved this hotel It is very central to tube stations near Hyde Park the staff was friendly and helpful the bar cosy I was there on business but I think this is suitable for families couples anyone who wants to stay in central London 
141004,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only thing that was missing was a toilet brush i the bathroom I don t know why they dont put one it is quite uncomfortable without it , The location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to the tube and Hyde par and Portobello market in Notting Hill Comfortable clean nice breakfast and helpful staff 
141005,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast wasn t great because of my room rate I was only offered continental this wasn t clear when I booked , Good location very friendly staff nice clean room 
141006,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The restaurant was also excellent in both service and quality of meals Breakfast was also great and although we had only continental breakfast we were invited to have english breakfast on our last day Very nice people
141007,Blakemore Hyde Park, We got in late one night after 10 and assumed that we would be able to get room service and we could not One day there was a knock at my door and I was told that we had to leave the room so that mattresses could be delivered While I am happy that the hotel is interested in putting in new mattresses I was bothered by the fact that this was a morning when we had planned to stay in the room a little longer and could not There were some times when I called the front desk and couldn t get an answer , I am glad that breakfast was available in the hotel so I didn t have to worry about going out to find breakfast The hotel seemed to be very clean 
141008,Blakemore Hyde Park, I would have liked to know prior to my journey what type of breakfast would be offered intercontinental or continental A kind of odour in the bath room ,No Positive
141009,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had an incidence with boiling water in the shower when we complained we were told that it was a general problem in the house But checking up in the evening it came apparent to us that we had been told a lie and getting no apologies or compensation did not help on the fact that we thought this was beneath a Hotel of this class , The room was large and the continental breakfast was good We enjoyed the afternoon tea at the Hotel which was also very good Are within walking distance of two different metros and have nice pubs and restaurants near by 
141010,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, Given a room close to reception and upgraded to a junior suite so very pleased Staff were very polite attentive and friendly On business so location good for my function but close to Hyde Park and underground a 10 minute walk so good for leisure travellers too 
141011,Blakemore Hyde Park, theres always room for improvement and its the little touches that would give this place the personal touch Free tea coffee with snacks during the day available in the lobby better lighting in the rooms a better quality shower in saying this I ve certainly had worse , room was a good size and clean Bed comfortable shower not the best but worked fine Towels big Breakfast had a reasonable amount of options staff helpful and friendly Locations excellent handy to everything but in a peaceful street have stayed here twice and will do so again I felt safe secure 
141012,Blakemore Hyde Park, Long time to check in After have payed 12 day stay I waited 50 min before take my room no fair and reasonable explanation for this wait was given People arrived after were immediately accommodated and received their room in due time Moreover once I got the magnetic key it didn t work twice After 1 h finally I entered my room exhausted and bit upset ,No Positive
141013,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing major the only thing I noticed was some items in our room e g the shower head and the wardrobe door were a bit worn out , Lovely staff they upgraded us from a twin room to a junior suite for free The room itself was spacious comfortable and impeccably clean The hotel is located in a very posh part of London a stone s throw from Hyde Park and within walking distance of two tube stations Bayswater and Queensway The continental breakfast included in the room rate was varied and tasty 
141014,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The bar staff at night were very accomodating Nice friendly atmosphere Short walk from Queensway tube station and right beside Hyde Park for a lovely walk
141015,Blakemore Hyde Park, Don t know his name but there was one employee at the concierge desk who was very rude and had a really bad attitude Rest of the staff were nice , Nice clean rooms with very good housekeeping
141016,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bedroom doors need to be adjusted so as not to bang shut when the entering or leaving the bedroom , Comfortable beds clean rooms Good continental b fast 
141017,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The room was spotless the bed unbelievably comfy and all staff were very polite and welcoming It was also very quiet there were no disturbances and so a good nights sleep was no problem 
141018,Blakemore Hyde Park, Price of drinks was a bit much , Value for money on hotel and upgrade to cooked breakfast was excellent Also being upgraded from a club room to junior suite was amazing 
141019,Blakemore Hyde Park, The checkout time was 11 so that was very early You could only get to 12 unless you wanted to paid 50pounds to stay there until 3 The hot breakfast should be included with the rest of the meal , I liked the rooms and the bed 
141020,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only a small thing but the public areas were very VERY warm as heating seemed to be on all the time , Comfy beds very friendly staff and a lovely quiet room 508 
141021,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only one lift that can get a bit busy in the morning , Flexible staff to accommodate guest needs I was allowed to take a shower before check in Very nice rooms Fast free Wifi Wonderful breakfast 
141022,Blakemore Hyde Park, There could have been some biscuits to have with me tea coffee , The room was a good size and very clean The shower was great and the bed was comfortable 
141023,Blakemore Hyde Park, First pot of tea was not warm enough so had to ask for a replacement Mugs would be preferable in the rooms instead of cups and saucers and complimentary biscuits hot chocolate , Breakfast area well set out and good choice 
141024,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing really , All the staff we met from the housekeeping to the bar etc were excellent courteous friendly and professional with a willingness to be of assistance The ambience and cleanliness of the hotel were terrific Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay
141025,Blakemore Hyde Park, Please consider making check in earlier 15h00 is too late especially if one s flight arrives early in the morning , Service at reception breakfast and concierge was brilliant All staff were courteous and friendly Please keep me the excellent service 
141026,Blakemore Hyde Park, Unfortunately during our stay the main lift was Out of Order and we experienced very noisy residents in a room across the corridor as well as the lift alarm sounding called Reception and got a poor response we are working on the alarm nothing done about the noisy residents , Hotel is in a quiet location close to good walks Public Transport 
141027,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were on level 1 and there was a party going on Noise was very loud Certainly not staff fault and in fairness it was a fri night people do have to enjoy life , Staff were extremely helpful and willing to go above and beyond All were constantly smiling Breakfast both continental and full were fantastic Would definitely stay again London transport although pricey next to none in the world Fantastic 
141028,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and courteous The room was clean spacious and provided everything we needed The cleaning staff did an excellent job Breakfast was included and it was very good For travel sometimes we took a taxi and sometimes we took the tube subway which was easy to navigate and this location is a quick walk to Queensway Station 
141029,Blakemore Hyde Park, On ground floor near reception so door to corridor banged regularly was not asked how my stay was when checking out, Easy to find comfortable
141030,Blakemore Hyde Park, Warm plates for continental cold breakfast Cold plates Dining room layout is very tight and not convivial Less tables Lift small and slow , Friendly staff and location 
141031,Blakemore Hyde Park, I did request early check in and no one got back to me only downside , When we arrived the room wasn t ready which is fair enough as check in was 3 and we arrived at 2 when we checked in we were told we were upgraded to a junior suite So we were very happy posh beautiful lovely hotel 
141032,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel was smart clean and obviously well run It was a pleasure to stay there The staff were particularly pleasant and genuinely wanting to be helpful We would have no hesitation in staying there again nor recommending it as an ideal base to explore London city 
141033,Blakemore Hyde Park, The Continental breakfast that included in the stay only cover bread cereal cheese and salad Simple breakfast food such as scrambles egg sausages and those hot stuff would need to pay extra A bit disappointed on this arrangement , The room size is big The location is good too Just a few minutes walk to reach Hyde park bus station and underground stations
141034,Blakemore Hyde Park, I did find however a few strands of hair inside the bed which was a small let down, On arrival I was made aware that my room was upgraded to a Suite free of charge which wasincredible as the size and elements of the room was amazing 
141035,Blakemore Hyde Park, the only slight negative was the restaurant was a bit warm , we were upgraded to a suite on arrival the continental breakfast included in the price was excellent selection and ample available my daughter on the first morning paid the extra 5 50 for the self service full english breakfast and found it to be very tasty the staff were all very friendly and helpful the hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the nearest tube station we would stay here again
141036,Blakemore Hyde Park, 1 The air conditioner does not work 2 the location is a little far from Metro station 3 The breakfast is poor and they ask extra money if you want to eat the cooked food such as fried egg sausages bean and so forth 4 They keep brothering you by telephone and knocking the door when u re close the time of check out I felt i was going to be thrown out 5 Wiffi is very poor slow and sometimes no connection, The room is beautiful
141037,Blakemore Hyde Park, Being mislead about price promotion prices Telling the staff it was for our daughters 18th birthday not even a happy birthday note in either of our rooms, Noticed on check out that we were the only people NOT to have gotten a promotion price for our stay in fact they had accidentally added a very small surcharge which when questioned was deducted from our bill Sad as we will have both our daughters in London in a couple of months will be visiting London at least every 6 weeks We booked paid for our stay months ago after being told assured that that was their best price when it was plain to see other guests checking out bills on the reception desk for all to see that the price we paid was far from their best price 
141038,Blakemore Hyde Park, The wifi was terrible bad connectivity in my room and the lift was broken and we had long waits to use the small service lift or walks up stairs , staff were wonderful and and super helpful Room was cosy and clean 
141039,Blakemore Hyde Park, Quit a distance from central London however the walk to oxford street through Hyde park makes up for it Beautiful walk on a sunny day, The breakfast was delicious Bathroom was very modern Rooms are spacious The beds are amazing
141040,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Overall we had a lovely couple of days The Hotel was immaculate and the staff where very helpful It was situated in a lovely quiet relaxing area I would definitely stay here again if I was more confident using the tube We either walked or got a taxi to where we wanted to go which was a little expensive at times 
141041,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, Excellent location the staff were so nice especially nicoletta at breakfast what a lovely person We were upgraded to junior suite breakfasts were amazing 
141042,Blakemore Hyde Park, Got a twin room and a club room could not see any difference although I paid more for the club My daughter and friend on the 1st floor room complained of a lot of noise early in the morning , Croissants were really good and fresh Staff were very helpful and friendly 
141043,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was to hot My partner and I had to sleep with aircon on cold to balance it out we visited during winter , Location was great close to queens way and Bayswater station Also close to bus stop that takes you straight to Piccadilly 5 min walk to local supermarket and also restaurants 
141044,Blakemore Hyde Park, Some attention needed to ensure the rooms are in fully functional the thermostat and kettle were not working in my first room and the bathroom fixtures need some repair on leaking joints and blocked shower head The ground floor twin room was spacious but being located next to automatic door which opened regularly caused periodical banging sounds onto the room door , This is my third stay over the last 3 years as the location is very convenient and the comfort quality of rooms have been consistent The group of staff during this recent stay were the most friendly and helpful batch and they were able to offer me a change of room to suit my needs arrange the transfer of my luggage The breakfast offers a good variety of Continental and hot dishes restaurant staff were very efficient and attentive 
141045,Blakemore Hyde Park, I wasn t able to get early check in which was a bit disappointing after a transatlantic red eye , All in all a great hotel Clean modern helpful staff good bar great restaurant 
141046,Blakemore Hyde Park, nothing could be better the hotel was perfect for our needs and could not wish for more, The staff were friendly and very helpful hotel perfect location and very comfortable good breakfast excellent room service
141047,Blakemore Hyde Park, The icing on the cake would be a pool but I guess that s impossible , As we have already been to this hotel 3 times I would assume that tells you all you need to know 
141048,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bed was a huge gaping hole and way too soft I didn t sleep Mattress was in dire need of changing , The hotel was good value for money and close to mayfair 
141049,Blakemore Hyde Park, No room service after 10 30 p m Poor breakfast The receptionist could have been more polite Some staff very kind others not , Great lokation Comfortable bed 
141050,Blakemore Hyde Park, Our entire stay for 10 days and the lift was out of order for 7 days , The staff was friendly and helpful The room is clean and tidy but a little bit dirty regarding the bed sheet 
141051,Blakemore Hyde Park, Not a normal place for common taxis So the only way to really get a taxi is to have the hotel call one That taxi is much more expensive than the common taxi ,No Positive
141052,Blakemore Hyde Park, Croissants at breakfast not warmed and crisped A blast of cold air in the reception lounge every time staff walked past the automatic doors to the outdoor terrace, Decent breakfasts Quiet rooms Easilly accessed by public transport for sightseeing around London Great Greek restaurant 100 metres down the road 
141053,Blakemore Hyde Park, Being nitpicky but no pens and paper were in the room Also concierge person didn t have maps of the tube that had print large enough to read That said they were very helpful and really tried to accommodate us Also the hotel computer that guests could use needs an update I couldn t use it to check in to my return flight to the states and it said that it had a bunch of viruses , Room was large unlike most other European Hotels clean and very nice Bathroom was great Room had two TVs Breakfast was very good Continental breakfast was more than sufficient 
141054,Blakemore Hyde Park, Extra charge had to be paid for eggs and other things at the breakfast which wasn t a good value for the money, Croissants were delicious as well as the size of the room was very convenient
141055,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bathroom too small not enough light in the room, Prime location 5 minutes walk from Hyde Park 3 very close tube stations and buses from and to everywhere in London Excellent breakfast helpful and kind staff always with a smile 
141056,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was rather noisy I could here people walking in the corridor as well as the room above The vent between between the base of the door and the floor carpet was letting light in when we went to sleep I guess it could be because of uneven floor surfaces It was a little bit annoying when trying to sleep, Location was very important to us and we feel this was best placed for our needs The staff are quite friendly The hotel is very clean On arrival we got our room upgraded which I thought was fantastic The room was spacious and loved the decor Overall I would stay at this hotel again
141057,Blakemore Hyde Park, Had 2 stains on my bedding one on the sheet and one on top of the duvet which wasn t very refreshing And where our room was when staff was going in and out of rooms the door kept on slamming so very loud as well , The decor and location of the hotel 
141058,Blakemore Hyde Park, some guests were wearing coats and fashion scarves at breakfast There was no need for this as the room was very warm Maybe guests should be asked to remove these before entering the restaurant , the room rate included a continental breakfast which we enjoyed We didn t use the restaurant for other meals so cannot comment on anything other than the breakfast All the staff were extremely professional and helpful nothing seemed too much trouble and restaurant staff are very efficient and attentive We would definately return and would certainly recommend this hotel I must mention the cleaners our room was cleaned to a very high standard as too were the public areas Well worthy of its 4 star rating 
141059,Blakemore Hyde Park, The view on the second floor room 218 wasn t that great Maybe more up to 4 6 floor is better , We loved our room and lobby s interior Very nice area and good connections 
141060,Blakemore Hyde Park, Tv was limited and modified so you could only watch free view TV or other movies they offer We were unable to plug in our laptop , Great location and good size rooms for London The staff are very helpfull and accommodating They offer a good breakfast and excellent WiFi 
141061,Blakemore Hyde Park, There is only one elevator in this 6 story hotel Very long wait so we had to take the stairs I accept it is difficult to built a second one in such an old building Wifi was poor Showering in the bath tub is not ideal Bathroom was rather cramped for space The fire doors make a lot of noise So you wake up early when other guests leave , The room junior suite was spacious Very comfortable bed Continental breakfast was OK Underground is a 10 minute walk Hotel is in a quiet street 
141062,Blakemore Hyde Park, Pre Theatre dining was poor We booked for 5 00 and didn t leave till 6 30 this nearly made us miss our show Service was terrible and the food was not great , The facilities of the hotel are very good Breakfast is great The drinks are a little over priced 
141063,Blakemore Hyde Park, I cannot accept that in central London none of the elevators could not be fixed in 3days time have you see a queue for the elevator Also we had to pay all the amount before entering to the room and just after they had inform us for the elevator issue As they had all contact details they could inform us in advance for having a chance to book another hotel No matter that we had requested room quiet and at the upper floor we had 2nd floor and the visitors from upstairs make the last 2nights unbearable sound proof no way I addition they had offer us after we had made a complain at booking as compensation free room upgrade and 10 off for our next visit but at the check out no voucher was given They could easily make partial refund the booking offer us the chance to relocate to another hotel but we had to change all our plans and appointments which were pre booked Until today there was not an official apology from a manager of the hotel Its a shame for such a hotel, location breakfast big rooms make sure prior of booking that the elevators are working
141064,Blakemore Hyde Park, The elevator was not working during my stay not a deal breaker but I was on the 3rd floor so it was bothersome If you have any issues with taking the stairs then you may want to check it out in advance as there is only 1 elevator , Very friendly staff and the hotel was clean and well presented It s in a good location that was quiet but also close enough to the underground and many shops 
141065,Blakemore Hyde Park, The view from the room was literally to the wall maybe two three meters away Sometimes was too warm in the room , The room was comfortable clean and well equipped The bed was comfortable and very pleasant for sleep The facility is in quiet street five minutes from metro station and few minutes from Hyde park Continental breakfast very good especially croissants 
141066,Blakemore Hyde Park, Very small bathroom area I had to go into the bedroom to get dry after a shower , Staff were very good and were available to help with any problems that might arise 
141067,Blakemore Hyde Park, WiFi coverage was spotty check in is late after 15 00 and check out is early by 11 00 Late check out available at a charge Also the hotel charges guests a deposit of 30 gbp per night towards any extras which is refundable on check out so guests should be aware , Breakfast choice was good We stayed in junior suite and facilities were excellent and bed extremely big and comfy
141068,Blakemore Hyde Park, The broken lifts were very frustrating during our stay One sometimes working lift is not sufficient for a hotel with so many rooms Issues like broken lifts must be a priority and be fixed first We stayed for four days and three nights and only saw one out of the two lifts working a few times over this period 0,No Positive
141069,Blakemore Hyde Park, Unfortunately therw was only one lift working which made it difficult to get to the 6th floor , Excellent staff and service Lovely and clean room with very comfortable bed Good location 
141070,Blakemore Hyde Park, Big room but cooling system went out after first night Hotel provided a fan which did nothing to ventilate the room It was pretty hospital like in that room for three more nights Elevator broke down and used one other elevator or staircase , LIKES Location cleanliness great continental breakfast pleasant staff did I mention location 
141071,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, Location Staff Food Customer service all excellent Staff were so friendly and helpful particularly the lady in the breakfast room Lovely lady 3 minute walk to tube Would definitely recommend this hotel 
141072,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The reception staff were polite and efficient and being allocated an upgrade to a junior suite made my visit even better The reviews for the hotel and true and accurate an I will certainly us The Blakemore again

141085,Blakemore Hyde Park, Having to pay an extra 5 50 pounds for breakfast included rates yes I know it was free for continental but I think if you ve given a free breakfast included just be generous with it My room was also a tad cold nothing too bothersome however , The rooms were really wonderful clean and spacious I got a lovely room overlooking the white mansions of Hyde Park Staff were genuine and friendly Lobby was beautiful Food tasty Location is very close to two train stations

141092,Blakemore Hyde Park, You pay so much extra for breakfast included however when you get there you are told if you want any of the warm breakfast that you have to pay another 5 00 pp I thought this was very sly and in most hotels when you pay for breakfast included that includes all the food I understand it states continental however it would of been cheaper to buy a box of cereal as that is basically all there is to offer , Hotel is nice and clean great location

141112,Blakemore Hyde Park, My only issue is that their wi fi service is so intermittent that I wanted to throw my iPad out the window They need to get a new provider plain and simple But despite this we love staying there and the Italian lady who is the hostess in the dining room at breakfast deserves a raise because she always gets your day off on the right foot We love staying here ,No Positive

141164,Blakemore Hyde Park, Rooms could of been a bit more spacious we had a struggle to get in the door with a suitcase , Maybe the price is a little excessive but it was the best nights sleep I had gotten in ages Room was a little small and compact but cant complain otherwise

141166,Blakemore Hyde Park, Our stay was Thursday 15th December There was a private Christmas party in a room downstairs When this finished the manager closed the residents bar as they wanted the revellers to disperse Although I understand the logic behind this it cut short our evening not at the private party just staying over The closure was made worse as once the revellers had dispersed the exceptionally unpolite bar man who said he was a concierge so it wasn t his job to serve drinks said each person that had waited patiently for an hour for the drunken crowd to leave could only have 1 drink each as it wasn t his job to serve This was at midnight which is not late I have never stayed in any other hotel in London that has closed its bar to residents Will not be staying again ,No Positive

141172,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was a constant motorised noise coming from the ceiling in my room even though the air conditioning was switched off I presume it was the unit supplying another room too The solution would be to insulate the ceiling better , Conveniently located near 2 London Underground stations Queensway Central Line and Bayswater Circle and District Line Lots of small restaurants around the corner 
141173,Blakemore Hyde Park, The small breakfast area The AC was not working so well in my room The walls need to be thicker, The beds were extra comfy and the room was very spacious

141179,Blakemore Hyde Park, For the entire stay we had a sewage smell coming from the toilet They tried to fix the problem but by time we returned on the evenings it was too late for anything to be done Not very happy we had to deal with this based on the amount we paid per nights stay , The overall appearance of the hotel was good and the location was good for Winter wonderland but not if you are attending the theatre district

141185,Blakemore Hyde Park, Unfortunately in the good gesture of upgrading us they gave us the room on the 1st floor directly above a function room We had a busy day ahead of us in London the next day therefore tried to go to sleep at 11pm only to be kept awake by the sound of music and bass vibrating our floor boards I called reception and inquired to when it would be turned off and they said it was their STAFF Christmas party I then said I did not pay this amount of money north of 200 for a room to be kept awake by your staff partying To which the receptionist answered what are we meant to do there are no clubs around here I found that response completely un professional and un acceptable The music was not turned off until nearer midnight and it completely tarnished the entire experience To be kept awake by the hotels staff opposed to guests is something new The next day I raised my complaint with the receptionist and she said management would call me to apologise and explain Three days later management have not phoned me I still wait an explanation , Lovely hotel fantastic facilities amazing room We paid for a suite for a birthday present and they upgraded us to the honey moon suite which was very kind of the hotel made our trip that extra bit special

141228,Blakemore Hyde Park, No meals or in room dining after 10 00 Some snack options would be nice , Clean in good location with decent rooms and fasciitis The Hotel does what it s designed to do no more no less and that was fine by us 
141229,Blakemore Hyde Park, They used some spray when cleaning which gave an odd smell Used to cover something unpleasant We must open the windows and ventilate because we reacted bodily on something to get an acceptable environment , Very good breakfast for a continental breakfast including all cold things like eggs cheese and ham
141230,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff were very rude They do not care about there guests just the money they can get from them Room was terrible and staff were so rude about it after the 3rd complaint did they offer to move us by this time it was to late to pack all our stuff back up and move around again We were lied to multiple times whilst there Would not recommend this hotel to any one So disappointed in a so called 4 hotel Look else where if I was you not worth your time as you not worth there s clearly , Location

141236,Blakemore Hyde Park, I got intercontinental breakfast that contains everything except the hot plates susage and hash browns for me it was fine but that wasn t clarified upon booking and some people may don t like that also check out was at 11 am and they extended it free to 12 pm then you will have to pay extra 50 pounds , super clean comfortable I was upgraded to junior suit location is walking distance from bayswater Queensway underground stations also nearby Padingtons station toilets were provided for water spray which is a bonus for this hotel

141244,Blakemore Hyde Park, The night check failed to wake as according to my wake up request He attempted to blame it on a system glitch when I know in fact it wasn t true He is a very well seasoned member of the hotel staff I witnessed him as he came on to shift earlier that evening reprimanding his fellow staff members at the reception area desk which totally unprofessional Whether right or wrong it shouldn t have been done out in the open As a returning hotel guest it did not sit well Something as such should have been done behind closed doors , Everyone was courteous and treated me with the utmost hospitality money can buy The food and cleanliness of my room will again allow me to have the Blakemore as first choice of stay when I return to London

141271,Blakemore Hyde Park, The fire alarm went off for no apparent reason at 4 00am So not much sleep Great that it works But as it went straight back off It was a little odd in the night , Near the tube station So good location Friendly staff Nice and clean Breakfast ok Would stay there again 
141272,Blakemore Hyde Park, the room was dusty and dirty no matter how many time I ask them to clean it the housekeeping staff were rude They have a weird policy that you are not allowed to order in but they dont offer food from 1 to 5 PM and after 10 PM they had one elevator and we had strollers with us so we had to wait for a while before we got it and the funny thing was that the enternace didnt have a ramp so whatever we wanted to enter exit the hotel we had to carry the strolleres up the stairs the breakfast buffet had the same dishes every day , the room was big comparing to the room sizes in London The toilet was also big and clean and had a water spray hose which Muslim Arab people would appreciate During our stay they announced that they started offer Halal food which I appreciate but didnt try

141292,Blakemore Hyde Park, The continental breakfast was not great and if you wanted a cooked English breakfast you needed to pay an additional 5 50 which is not acceptable when you are paying a high room rate , The breakfast supervisor is a lovely lady and made the experience better than the food on offer 
141293,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had continental included but for the sake of a few pence would have been nice to have been allowed items from the cooked side , To have the breakfast included
141294,Blakemore Hyde Park, they have one elevator only it takes time to got it especially in the morning so you will need to use stairs most of the time which is not suitable for wheelchair users they didn t mention that we have a continental breakfast in the reservation which has very few items so don t be surprise if you want to eat more you have to pay five pounds or you will stick to the available croissant and salad , the bed is so comfy and the rooms are clean well 
141295,Blakemore Hyde Park, One concierge wasn t very nice No complementary water bottle in the room Not enough towels in the bathroom only one for the hands and a small one for the shower , Location excellent Value for the money very good 
141296,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff at the desk and the consierge we re not as friendly even though they do their job The staff at restaurant were wonderful, The place is nice and clean and in the proximity of everything
141297,Blakemore Hyde Park, Except the TV was a pain to use and the picture kept breaking up pixelating digital breakup This didnt really affect our stay fortunately but it really would have if we had wanted to watch TV , All was excellent
141298,Blakemore Hyde Park, Disappointed with the air con as it was too warm but it didn t reach us and didn t feel safe leaving the window open Also the breakfast I paid 180 for my room with complimentary breakfast but if I wanted hot food is have to pay an extra 5 50pp which I thought was disgusting as I paid so much for a room for the night , The bed was very comfy 
141299,Blakemore Hyde Park, too many managers who are not able to take any decisions I stayed before at this hotel while my business travelling to London 3 4 times per year and this time I was just unlucky to have a conversation with un incompetent manager who should learn meaning of flexibility and customer service , close to the Paddington Station Heathrow Express and to different tube stations 
141300,Blakemore Hyde Park, The beds were too soft and we both had aching backs the next day however we are used to foam mattresses at home , The staff were great especially the concierge who we left our bags with 
141301,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent stay with my oldest son The staff was really nice and welcoming throughout our stay Room was comfortable and clean Excellent buffet breakfast and cozy terrace 
141302,Blakemore Hyde Park, not one thing was negative, Continental breakfast was superlative lots of choice beautiful fresh fruits tasty meats cheeses salads Set us up for the day 
141303,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was a fire alarm one night and unfortunately the information given to the residents was poor The situation should have been handled much better now the way it was done wasn t professional , A wonderful location clean rooms very nice service at the reception and at the breakfast 
141304,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast selection and breakfast area were the only things which were a little disappointing, Location staff room were excellent We loved the heated terrace in front of the hotel and the angus beef was delicious 
141305,Blakemore Hyde Park, Not much choice with continental breakfast Same every day Internet was very poor Kept coming on and off so impossible to do any work After complaining twice the staff tried their best but still was no improvement , Large clean room very comfortable and clean Great spot near Hyde Park and Notting Hill and Oxford Street 
141306,Blakemore Hyde Park, The lift was very slow lots of people waiting at same time as there seemed to be only one lift in operation even staff were using this lift to bring their housekeeping trollies upstairs thus causing delays at busy times , the shower was glorious The breakfast room was very well organised the staff were very welcoming Good variety for breakfast Bedroom was clean the bed was very comfortable Will definitely stay there again 
141307,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bar staff have major trust issues Aproaching the bar to order a drink I was stopped and told no need to go the bar as my order would be taken at my table Myself and my wife were then asked several times while sitting having the said drinks that we need to pay for them I asked if there was a problem and was told that I would be surprised how many people don t pay and walk out This was on the first night of a 4 night stay that cost 1250 I was hardly going to take off for the sake of one round of drinks after paying the hotel fee upfront At check out today while waiting of our taxi to the train station we were also told to leave the bar as my two children were eating a sandwich that was bought in as they had a restaurant below the bar area when I said we were only waiting of a taxi the barmaid waitress was unmoved and adamant that my children must go outside to eat there sandwich or order from the menu Thanks for that Very untrusting suspicious staff that need a lesson in manners and also need to realise that they have left a lasting impression Hotel was very good and the cleaning staff were friendly and helpful the hotel management would do well to reverse the roles of bar staff cleaners A shame that the lasting impression of this hotel was the bad experience of the bar lounge staff I won t be using this hotel again only because I felt I was looking over my shoulder all the time and was uncomfortable all the time while in the bar If your wanting a relaxing time my advice is to ignore the waitresses and pay up front at the bar Also plan your escape a bit better than I did as in don t try and fill any time away from this hotel on the day of checkout and return as your not very welcome once you have checked out , Very clean and a great location Desk staff very good
141308,Blakemore Hyde Park, Organisation was very poor had to check in twice and despite several promises that it would be done the bed was never divided into two and I had to share a double bed with my teenage daughter , Location was convenient and facilities good 
141309,Blakemore Hyde Park, The breakfast was a little pricey and considering the quality of the rest of the hotel a little under par Parking could be an issue so I recommend travelling by train if staying here , The staff were so friendly and helpful the bed was enormous and the building and room were decorated and maintained to a very high standard The location is superb and surprisingly quiet in the room itself Will definitely be returning 
141310,Blakemore Hyde Park, Rooms weren t soundproofed as described TV reception in room was bad channels kept going fuzzy We put on our booking we d arrive before 3pm but unfortunately no rooms were free , Air conditioned rooms staff were friendly hotel was clean was a 5 10 min walk to tube
141311,Blakemore Hyde Park, The hotel took payment twice and before we had even arrived Would not refund straight away and took 7 days for money to be returned Appalling staff attitude , The rooms were comfortable
141312,Blakemore Hyde Park, The aircon in our room had a bit of a vibration and so we had to turn it off not great in mid summer , Well located near tubes and not far from Paddington Station Staff very friendly and hotel clean and comfortable
141313,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast time as stated above You, Well located Excellent accommodation Very friendly and efficient staff I would have liked breakfast to open 15 or 30 minutes earlier Overall worth its stars for sure Ill have no hesitation recommending 
141314,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Room was quite big and quiet when I booked I asked for a room in the upper floors and they did give me a room in the last floor I appreciate that Location close to Kensington Gardens Staff friendly Breakfast included 
141315,Blakemore Hyde Park, The Internet was a little bit less than the usual it seems there was a problem, The atmosphere the employees specially Ms Necolita Ms Cesila the rooms 
141316,Blakemore Hyde Park, The breakfast is good but could have had more variety , The bed was extra comfortable Toilets where cleaned and as expected in the picture Close to hyde park oxford street and queensway 
141317,Blakemore Hyde Park, TV was complicated and I could not find instructions but it worked in the end A bit noisy from the street but not too bad No breakfast before 7am and I had to leave without breakfast, Room was pleasant quite comfortable and larger than some others I have had in London hotels There were handy shops nearby to get some basics like water and fruit and biscuits and magazines One member of the housekeeping staff very kindly gave me extra teabags and milk when I asked I had everything I needed in the room
141318,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing Really, I Really enjoyed my stay Friendly Staff wich was Really helpfull Rooms clean And spaceius And clean Nice area for a decent rate 
141319,Blakemore Hyde Park, Staff cleaning in the lobbies at inappropriate hours a puddle of water in the main lobby right in front of the entrance that could have made someone slip, The bed was very comfortable and the location of the hotel was great in a nice area close to Hyde park and the tube
141320,Blakemore Hyde Park, The fact I had to leave, Exceptional hotel with the staff making our stay with their friendliness and helpfulness Such a pleasant stay in this hotel over the weekend and will definitely be back again 
141321,Blakemore Hyde Park, The continental breakfast was adequate but could have been better and for the price paid would have expected the cooked breakfast to be included not an extra ,No Positive
141322,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast inclusive can be truly inclusive and not that we had to pay additional fee , Location is very good Close to underground restaurants convenience stores 
141323,Blakemore Hyde Park, Difficult to see how it could be provided in the building but more lift accommodation would have been useful at times , Very pleasant and very attentive staff showing interest in their residents Well prepared and tasty food Very comfortable bedroom and bathroom 
141324,Blakemore Hyde Park, 20min walk to the underground station 10min walk to the nearest bus station the continental breakfast is a rip off and worth it at all Book without breakfast is far better , Rooms are clean and spacious
141325,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bathroom too small Room not ready on arrival at 3pm Noise from the underground and washing machines Cock roach walking across the bedroom , The location Very good access to Hyde Park Size of the room 
141326,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast room area too small when Hotel is full , The location of the Hotel was good The staff were all friendly and helpful The room was clean and well appointed Free Wifi 
141327,Blakemore Hyde Park, Our beds were extremely saggy I asked the front desk if we could switch rooms and they said nothing was available Consequently I had a sore back the entire five days The mattresses should really be replaced in Room 611 also the room was TINY not like the web pics at all We had a waitress who seemed to know NOTHING about the menu First saying there was no iced tea available we had it the night before then charging me 4 5 pounds for iced tea when she served me Diet Coke 2 5 pounds None of the serving staff seemed very friendly in the main floor restaurant , Enjoyed the continental breakfast good selection The morning hostess was very nice 
141328,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had two tv s but one didn t work for our daughters bed viewing told staff for five days and wasn t resovled , Staff where good and friendly location is good hotel was very clean and room got serviced every day 
141329,Blakemore Hyde Park, Though the staff were professional and helpful they weren t very welcoming , The property was close to transport it was well presented good size rooms comfy bed and very helpful staff 
141330,Blakemore Hyde Park, A manual to use the 3 remote controls , extremely convenient to all transport systems Very clean food excellent great value for money Will definitely stay again
141331,Blakemore Hyde Park, All good , The whole look and feel of the hotel from the outside to walking in to a welcoming reception area and modern comfortable room Good quiet area of London 
141332,Blakemore Hyde Park, Would have preferred earlier check in time rather than 3pm , Lovely hotel good continental breakfast and comfy bed Appreciated the magnifying mirror in the bathroom this is often overlooked by hotels 
141333,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were incredible every single one was polite and charming The bed was AMAZING Breakfast was delicious and quick The room was quiet and huge We were so thrilled to find a hotel which could cater for 3 people in one room 
141334,Blakemore Hyde Park, We arrived at the hotel a 1pm We wanted to order lunch but were told the kitchen wasn t open by the staff behind the bar At 1 30 we sat at a table on the terrace no one came to serve us I finally went to the bar to order drinks I asked again if we could order food We were told they needed check And then we were told we could We ordered The waitress got our order completely wrong We paid over 200 for one night This didn t include breakfast I feel it was very expensive for what we got The service in the bar and the terrace is not what you d expect from a 4 star hotel , The hotel is clean smart and in a nice location The reception staff were helpful and friendly 
141335,Blakemore Hyde Park, The concierge wasn t very helpful when trying to book theatre tickets he said there were no tickets to the show we wanted we later booked tickets online to the exact same show , the cocktails in the lounge were delicious the staff were very friendly and helpful when we were there too early they showed us where to keep our bags and a nice washroom we could use while we waited room was simple but comfortable
141336,Blakemore Hyde Park, A bit more info at the reception desk would have been helpful It would also be good to be clear that people need to bring the card they made the booking on with them when they check in, Lovely hotel in a perfect spot for Hyde Park BST festival 
141337,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was to hot air con not working no bath No room service chef gone home at 11 no food People chatting in corridor Electric going off and generator putting emergency lights on at 4am waking us up No phone line to ask what was happening as could here people outside our room Cleaner knocked once and walked in at 10am after we only got to sleep at 5am coz of all the problems Went to breakfast only to be told no tables had to wait 20 mins then had to rush breakfast Ask for coffee tea No butter or milk Farce from start to finish Then had to wait 30 mins to be able to complain , Nothing 
141338,Blakemore Hyde Park, I asked for a room with a view on one of the higher floors and I got a room on the first floor looking out onto a concrete wall and some sort of air vent It was a horrible view There could also be a few more selections of pastries at breakfast , The general feel of the hotel was relaxed and the staff are really friendly There is a particularly friendly and approachable lady at breakfast that greets you as you come in I didn t catch her name but she is small in height middle aged with short hair perhaps of Spanish or Italian origin 
141339,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had no bottled water in our room, We love this hotel we always stay here and always get a room upgrade we went to see Stevie wonder in Hyde park perfect 
141340,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were asked to pay in advance which we thought was unusual The upgrade next to the spa in the basement didn t feel like an upgrade as it was noisy and dark,No Positive
141341,Blakemore Hyde Park, Being booked in for a 3pm check in and only one room ready and was told to go back after the concert and it would be ready Which was not good enough as we had been traveling all day and wanted to freshen up , Nice tranquil setting
141342,Blakemore Hyde Park, No biscuits or enough milk Air c in not clear how to work so v hot Noisy trains Very slow check in service Slow lift Expensive for one night Disappointed as stated x3 before and had better service facilities rooms and value for money, Comfy beds
141343,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bed was hopeless I thought it was just my room but I soon found out that my sons room also had the same problem with the bed Too soft and you will sink into it My wife and me suffered from severe back pain sleeping on it Im willing to bet most of the rooms have the same bed condition We complained and the staff said he will look into it and give us another room But he soon disappeared and when we met him later in the lobby he just smile and said hello like we never complained at all Rooms have been already charged and there is no such thing as cancelling and getting your refund back We knew the terms so complaining wouldnt help Continental Bfast is included in the package and if you want a full English bfast pay an extra GBP5 I do not understand why they need to do this as it creates a negative impression among customers and I have heard many of them whispering about this scam like technique around the tables Honestly do not take the bfast option as you will be left very very disappointed Its not worth the money at all There are other places nearby offering a hearthy hot bfast for GBP5 only Save you a pile of money For the money you spend here there are many other hotels nearby which do not charge as much and have much much more comfortable beds All the hotels in London brag about walking distances to restaurants and public transportation I believe that this hotel has quite a distance to go to the tube and the restaurants around Bayswater as compared to the others I would not recommend to others to stay here Stay around Paddington area is much better , The hotel room was clean and from appearance this hotel is newly refurbished Good facilities and the staff was quite friendly This hotel was among the priciest in the Bayswater area and from appearance it gave the impression that the room rates was worth the money The rooms are just slightly bigger than your average London hotel rooms There is a flat screen TV but I believe it is not cable TV and the Channel options are very basic very far even for my standards as compared to back home 
141344,Blakemore Hyde Park, Inconsistent supply of bath towels Cockroach in bathroom Staffing is minimal Had to look for concierge staff no bellboys or others to help with bags as one would expect for a four star hotel Single elevator was so slow we always ended up using the stairs , Continental breakfast was good Staff were polite 
141345,Blakemore Hyde Park, Staff a little abrupt wait until you start eating cooked breakfast before letting you know it s only continental breakfast included in the room rate, Good location Excellent outdoor seating area Comfortable bed Clean room
141346,Blakemore Hyde Park, The t v in room didn t work no water on first day for a shower not enough attention from bar staff and so few used the full breakfast upgrade that it was standing a long time and not worth the extra payment suggest they charge a couple of pounds more to everybody and offer this as part of bed and breakfast,No Positive
141347,Blakemore Hyde Park, Service was below average Waited for the room on check in and decided to order cocktails and sit outside The drinks took 30 mins to arrive and then only after chasing the staff and with no apology Breakfast was average however the meats cheeses and juice available on the continental option were low quality produce , Location and suite beautiful great bathroom and a fridge which was an excellent bonus Close to Hyde Park and nearest tube 5 mins walk 
141348,Blakemore Hyde Park, We liked everything , As we booked this hotel knowing nothing about it Walking into the hotel the foyer is very impressive absolutely beautiful I loved it right away and receptionists were so helpful and friendly The room was bright airy and had a fridge iron Safe hairdryer things you don t normally at the price we paid The restaurant was also excellent great service great food and pleasant staff Al in all we couldn t find fault with any aspect of this hotel We had a very pleasant happy stay x
141349,Blakemore Hyde Park, I booked a room with breakfast for 10 days but I was surprised when I got to the breakfast room they informed me that I cant eat from the hot dishes which include the English breakfast eggs beans etc since its not free and I have to pay extra 5 Pounds if I want to You will only be allowed to have breakfast from the cold dishes which weren t clean at all I found hair twice in the plates then i stopped eating anything from the plates I only had sealed food like bananas apples and yogurt The glasses were so dirty from the inside and outside I didn t even enjoy one cup of coffee The carpet of the room smelled funny and we had to switch on the AC every time for it to go away The hotel is located at a nice quiet area few restaurants are around BUT the tube station was a bit far we had to walk for at least 15 mins to get there I have stayed at many other locations in London and this wasn t the best Overall I found it to be too pricey with no value for money I wouldn t stay there again , I liked the bed and the bathrooms which were comfortable and clean The staff were nice and they listened to our complaints specially Bulbul the manager at the breakfast restaurant 
141350,Blakemore Hyde Park, Lack of understanding at breakfast Earl Grey is not English tea for breakfast Breakfast floor was full of crumbs I was in a twin room the towels were folded and put away but I did not know which was mine Noisy condensors outside the window, close to station and shops bath mat in the bath tea coffe in room
141351,Blakemore Hyde Park, One small lift for a hotel that size is a bit of a joke We waited 5 mins one time for it Need two lifts , The staff were friendly very helpful and willing to help Room very comfortable with quality beds and bedding Bar area pleasant
141352,Blakemore Hyde Park, Could have included hot breakfast within the price , Stayed here with a friend for a few days and was great The rooms were clean and the bed was comfy And only a five minute walk from Queensway tube station 
141353,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, From the time of arrival to departure we felt well cared for thought the welcome was warm staff helpful at all times The location was ideal for the concert in Hyde Park no tubes required just a lovely stroll away Finished the evening off with a drink on the terrace perfect Would happily return 
141354,Blakemore Hyde Park, No comments that really come to mind, The hotel was lovely bit of mix up with d special dietary requirements at breakfast but was all sorted with no real problem The showers are to die for love the rain shower xxx
141355,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only instructions for the air conditioning unit were in French so our room was too hot Did mention it and it was sorted although the instructions were still French , Have stayed in many London hotels and this was by far the best Good location lovely area very friendly helpful staff Breakfast was excellent Room a good size very clean and comfortable Close to Kensington Palace only a short walk to the tube Would not look anywhere else
141356,Blakemore Hyde Park, Paying extra for hot Breakfast and breakfast over all poor Also a twin room was requested but just two beds pushed together, I was not impressed for 185 00 I was required to pay extra for hot breakfast I have been in many hotels from 3 to 5 stars and never had this and the continental breakfast available was poor for a 4 star hotel tinned fruit not acceptable I ordered a twin room but this was two single beds pushed together so extremely cramped although great location and hotel clean etc not value for money 
141357,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bed was a little soft for my liking but not uncomfortable Decor a little dated and tired looking but ok and clean Got in late from the airport and arranged a late checkout despite this was woken early well before before normal checkout time by very persistent housekeeping who didn t speak English so couldn t explain that I had a late checkout Receptionist did apologise and not her fault but I did hear housekeeping bashing on all the doors along the corridor so am sure I wasn t the only one who may have been affected , Room size was good quiet location close to Paddington station and Hyde Park Pleasant staff at Reception Good aircon 
141358,Blakemore Hyde Park, I found the bed and pillows quite soft it would have been nice to have had a choice of a firmer pillow but that was just down to personal choice , Staff were always happy to help Breakfast selection was fantastic Room came with great facilities Also in a great location for transport with a choice of 5 local tube stations within a 10 minute walk and bus stops 5 minutes away 
141359,Blakemore Hyde Park, The two single beds might as well have been a double Some space between could have been good as he farted lots and snored throughout the night, Was suitable for my colleague and my purposes
141360,Blakemore Hyde Park, Extra charge for cooked breakfast 15 charge for a taxi ride 5 minutes down the road booked through the reception Hail a cab it s 10 cheaper , The comfortable bed politeness of staff helpfulness of staff area of the hotel it s really close to everything especially Oxford street So worth booking the hop on hop off bus tour for sightseeing as it goes right past the road by the hotel hotel is so clean and the Terrace restaurant staff were beyond amazing to help with my boyfriends 21st Celebrations I can t thank them enough for accommodating my special surprise needs Compliments to the chef the chicken stir fry and spaghetti bolonase was amazing Thank you Blakemore staff for such a wonderful stay Banners and Balloons on photos weren t put up by staff they were my own purchase 
141361,Blakemore Hyde Park, I believe standards at this hotel has slipped My room safe did not work and had no instructions for use I asked twice and left a note nothing happened My digital television did not work properly I did not mention until departure but it was so bad it is impossible that previous guest did not complain , I have stayed many times at this hotel the location is superb Close to Paddington station easy to navigate around London on the underground from this starting point 
141362,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hairdryer wasn t working , We were upgraded to a nicer room We was told that the tv wasn t working in the upgraded room This wasn t a problem for us Had we have wanted a TV we could have stayed in the original room booked Breakfast was good 
141363,Blakemore Hyde Park, The TV in the room had a very bad reception and was almost unwatchable, The staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel was situated in a quiet location The continental breakfast was excellent as was the bar food 
141364,Blakemore Hyde Park, Service has declined massively since I stayed 2 years ago Just not worth the price , Nicely placed relative quiet and close to busses and underground
141365,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was just a minor issue with the house keeping but it was dealt with immediately , I think the staff were very friendly and efficient There were no delays with anything and were helpful with everything they did 
141366,Blakemore Hyde Park, The breakfast that you think you pay for isn t that good it s just cereal like musket and some fruit you have to pay extra for sausages and stuff like that , The room Had a lot of space And extremely clean I loved the little touches like the way the bed was made 
141367,Blakemore Hyde Park, We needed few extra days to enjoy the city even more , My wife twisted her ankle one evening coming back to the hotel and the staff offered us a incredible pair of carbon fiber crutches to reach the hospital Thank you again 
141368,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only criticism Mattresses were too soft, Hotel situated in a quiet residential area very near to buses Tube stations 10 mins on foot Checking in and out was quick and efficient The room was clean and spacious with plenty of cupboard space Bathroom was a bit small but it had everything one needed including a large modern shower unit It also had a hand flush instead of a toilet brush Plenty of shower gels and body creams provided Didn t eat in the hotel so cannot comment on food All the staff were very helpful and friendly Will certainly return 
141369,Blakemore Hyde Park, This was my second time staying in the hotel but sadly there may not be a third Unfortunately I had to complain about the fact that something had gone missing from my locked bedroom and despite a very prompt holding reply from the manager well over a week later I have heard nothing further , The hotel is clean and comfortable and the continental breakfast puts many I ve had elsewhere to shame 
141370,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and ordered a taxi for me as I had an exam at the other side of London Taxi driver was very pleasant and professional aswell The visit was a mixture of business and leisure Breakfast very good 
141371,Blakemore Hyde Park, Fortunately I didn t have a room near the lift as the noise of it arriving and announcing the floor etc would have driven me mad especially at night , The welcome was good Receptionist was very pleasant when checking in and also polite at check out I was upgraded to a Junior Suite which is always a very positive thing for a hotel to do when they have the space available 
141372,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Beds were extremely comfortable staff nice and friendly and helpful the decor the interior of the whole hotel was amazing would stay again without a doubt 
141373,Blakemore Hyde Park, Got stuck in the lift and when we called the emergency line they had no idea why we were calling dont use the lift Stuck for about 10 minutes between floors 1 and 0 Breakfast host was more suited to a restaurant than buffet breakfast very full on and not actually that helpful Breakfast room was so busy and the staff were frantic not many spoke english so couldnt understand what we wanted , The room was beautiful very quiet and comfy big bed Reception staff were welcoming 
141374,Blakemore Hyde Park, We found that the desk clerks lacked a little something when it came to service orientation , The rooms were very comfortable lots of space and very comfortable beds Proximity to the Tube and other areas of London was excellent The continental breakfasts were excellent and there was plenty of food It was like having the full english breakfast without getting carried away We were also very impressed with there jack of all trades who was working in the morning breakfasts but was also sent to our room to fix the TV and later helped with checking in on their computer 
141375,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The location of this hotel was in a very up market area of London and near most local attractions Check in was very quick and staff were accommodating The rooms were spacious clean and of a good standard The bed was exceptionally comfortable and breakfast was a winner 
141376,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff very pleasant and friendly room comfortable and welcoming after being out all day lovely seating area for evening drinks at the bar Good central location with easy access to underground Bed comfortable and shower very good Breakfast lovely good selection of what to have 
141377,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was a bit small but that wouldn t deter me from staying again , Comfortable bed lovely view helpful and friendly staff relaxing coffee bar area nice breakfasts reasonably priced and good quality room service food easy taxi ride from the west end 
141378,Blakemore Hyde Park, You can hear people walking above your room I was waken up a couple of times due to heavy steps on the floor , It was a very nice and clean hotel The staff was very friendly and helpful It s very close to Kensington palace 
141379,Blakemore Hyde Park, Didn t like that we could hear the tube every couple of minutes I know that can t be helped but didn t hear it the first time we stayed the month before so was a little disappointed this time, Breakfast was lovely bar area was really nice
141380,Blakemore Hyde Park, Take care when asking for a taxi to Heathrow According to a taxi driver we asked about fares it should cost about 50 pounds If you book through the hotel they ask for 60 , Rooms were neat clean and had one of the best beds ever 
141381,Blakemore Hyde Park, Just a bit more explanation when checking in I was asked if I wanted them to take 120 of my card to pay towards drinks and food I spent while on my stay which I did not take the option This seemed to prevent me having the choice of running up a room tab which was not made clear at the start this did not spoil my stay though , Great breakfast choices and nice varied evening menu Staff were friendly and helpful with smiling faces which made you feel welcome and relaxed 
141382,Blakemore Hyde Park, The view would of liked to have been at front of building but it wasn t a problem as don t spend much time looking out window But that s all I could critisise really , Breakfast was good Room was very spacious and beds were very comfy Couldn t fault anything in there everything we needed All the amenities you need even an ironing board Staff were more then helpful and polite I would definitely want to come again sometime Oh and close to lots of things shops parks restaurants etc 
141383,Blakemore Hyde Park, Attitude of reception staff who insisted we owed extra money when we didn t , Lovely continental breakfast with a good choice Spacious room with a good sized bathroom nice to have s bath aswell as shower Enjoyed a meal in restaurant with good food and service
141384,Blakemore Hyde Park, The picture of the room on booking com was misleading in terms of size The breakfast is very limited , the cleanliness was fine and staff was very friendly and helpful
141385,Blakemore Hyde Park, The lift was very slow and didn t like the voice saying doors open etc Movement in the room above could be heard and one night it was especially bad about midnight for over an hour That was rather annoying , We loved the location being close to Kensington Gardens Hyde Park Bus stops and Paddington Railway Station We enjoyed the variety offered with continental breakfast but didn t try croissants as they cannot be compared to those we had in France The lounge was a very nice area and the restaurant was very good also 
141386,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Room Bed very comfortable Staff very attentive and helpful beyond a fault Easily got an adapter for our voltage converter Bar Restaurant and outside smoking area Luggage taken up to room Concierge staff wonderful Desk had precise wake up service called Taxi s when needed One could have continental breakfast or full breakfast add tl charge Very organized and again staff very attentive and service orientated

141393,Blakemore Hyde Park, Barman could not provide all cocktails on the menu as he did not have any fruit Maid entering the room before checkout They should check that residents have checked out first , Very comfortable large room as there was 3 adults Lovely outdoor terrace area where we enjoyed cocktails till late Good choice at breakfast with something to suit everyone 
141394,Blakemore Hyde Park, Was disappointed that there was no complimentry water in rooms nor were there items in mini fridge bar so there was not even the option of having something without having to call room service Not convenient for some guests Breakfast was included but only cold breakfast To get the hot breakfast it cost 5 more This was not clear at reservation and not a very nice approach to guests Very sneaky extra charge in my opnion and was disappointed by it and how I was asked to pay BEFORE eating , Staff friendly and helpful Beds were extremely comfortable Liked having the bidet hose with toilet which is often not an option everywhere 
141395,Blakemore Hyde Park, Noise from upstairs rooms Television difficult to get working and image quality poor Breakfast could be improved with fresh croissants fried eggs better breads selection etc , Location
141396,Blakemore Hyde Park, My room cannot connect free wifi for 3 nights and I have always asked the staff of reception there was no any help for me , The staff of reception is good
141397,Blakemore Hyde Park, Trying to be charged 100 00 for useing and Ecig I would never smoke in a room But they were lovely and did not charge me The bed was not Comfortable I have a bad back And you could feel the springs in the bed The sheets were lovely , The Location was lovely The Hotel was very nice I love the patio and bar The staff works very hard I would stay here again

141399,Blakemore Hyde Park, Have to pay extra for cooked breakfast Should be included in the price Continental breakfast was good, Friendly staff very helpful Good location clean large rooms comfortable bed 
141400,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Likes the location the staff were terrific the hotel was lovely I appreciated the upgraded room Only neg is that the carpeting in the room should be cleaned or replaced 
141401,Blakemore Hyde Park, There were no complaints as far as I am aware , Unfortunately I paid for the visit however this was a gift The guests whom stayed were very grateful for the upgraded room and I must thank you for your due diligence throughout the stay 
141402,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hotel isn t very well sign posted from the tube station , Staff were lovely very helpful and kind Luggage could be left on the last day which helped as our train wasn t until late 
141403,Blakemore Hyde Park, reception manager very poor Had to wait till 3pm to have our room then even though room had been paid for four months prior she wasn t going to let us stay due to us not having the card i paid with with me , position of hotel near to venue
141404,Blakemore Hyde Park, Walls seem to be very thin as we could hear upstairs foot steps VERY clearly and when they had the shower on half 12 at night seriously , Room service was very tasty and prices also pretty good Rooms are very spacious and clean Good location 
141405,Blakemore Hyde Park, When we arrived our room was not ready so we checked our luggage in while we went for lunch When we got back the desk clerk chased down the bellman to get our luggage He retrieved our luggage and placed it carefully in a corner that was about 2 feet from where we were standing instead of handing it to us and then walked away never speaking a word So we didn t know if we were to take it or if someone would bring it for us We took it and went to our room A very awkward early experience The room could benefit from some updating Floor tile was cracked in several places the bathroom and would move when walked upon The hairdryer is attached to the inside of a drawer on the desk I suspect this is done to prevent theft but it is highly impractical since the mirror is off to the side and the cord of the hairdryer is not long enough to reach the mirror You have to dry style your hair blindly Internet service though free was very unreliable I attempted to write this review earlier but couldn t get on the internet Cleaning staff was inconsistent sometimes they left coffee and cream packets other times not On one occasion when we asked room service to bring up cream they brought it in a small metal creamer We left the creamer out so the cleaning staff would pick it up and they never did Instead the cream was left to spoil , Located walking distance to several tube stations Easy to get around to the hot tourist spots and restaurants Common areas of the hotel restaurants bar lobby were very nice would rate them higher than the overall rating Food and service at the Terrace Restaurant is excellent 
141406,Blakemore Hyde Park, No tourist information in hotel dreadful wifi toilet wasn t cleaned properly lights tripped on first evening got the impression that it was not unusual noisy room Executive Twin No 12 from underground trains when we complained we were told we should have asked for a quiet room it was our first time in the hotel so how would we know A hook in the bathroom for a towel would be welcome , Location good room comfortable good breakfast staff friendly
141407,Blakemore Hyde Park, Wi Fi was intermittent but the helpful staff resolved this issue quickly each time , The staff were marvellous nothing was any trouble and they looked after us superbly The continental breakfast was plentiful and delicious The croissants were deliciously buttery The bed was huge and very comfy The room can get very warm but there is air con to counter this The location is great beautiful area and a stone s throw from Hyde Park Highly recommended 
141408,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bed and pillows were not comfortable room was to noisy just near exit where door start banging from 6 am maid knocked on the door 8 45 am where check out time is 11am , All requests were delivered just on time 
141409,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, For this particular trip the location was very useful However we think this is a good reliable hotel where we have stayed before Thw staff are friendly and helpful 
141410,Blakemore Hyde Park, I book a room with breakfast included but had to pay for an upgrade to get English breakfast , The staff at the restaurant was great and the outside terrace was excellent 
141411,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only thing is that there is only one lift still a lift thought which is not always the case so there s some waiting time to go up and down , Everything was so amazing There is really no better place to stay in London for this amount of money The beds are amazing the locations is good and the restaurant on the hotel is SO good The rooms are big and airy with two amazing Windows and the bathroom is so so nice Just come here already A speciel thanks to the waitress Valeriano who was amazing to us and entertained both me and my grandma 
141412,Blakemore Hyde Park, The view from our room onto a white wall but it s so trivial against the great stuff Also I don t think there s anything you can do about this but I was driven back inside from your Terrace by a bloke chain smoking cigars which was a shame because it s beautiful out there , Everyone was so friendly lovely relaxed atmosphere Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Food fantastic Room really well equipped the fridge was a big plus and the shower although a bit complicated had a good pressure Everywhere was so quiet and yet it s so close to shops the park pub restaurants and the tube I thought I had been spoilt by a night in The Shard a few weeks before but this came pretty close 
141413,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, It was my first time to visit London The hotel located in Perfect location with easy access to hyde park underground with everything you could ask for The room was huge The bed was very big comfortable The staff were very helpfull Easy and fast check in and check out I only ate breakfast at the hotel with plenty of choices which was included in room price but had no complaints I would definitely stay here again 
141414,Blakemore Hyde Park, The Gym was very small and basic The cleaners had an habit to arrive quite late in the afternoon to tidy my room , I liked the area and the room was very nice The continental breakfast was quite enough for me and I didn t feel I need to upgrade 
141415,Blakemore Hyde Park, The noise Didn t get a wink of sleep the noise from outside kept me up all night Shame because the bed was very comfy , Staff couldn t of been more friendly 
141416,Blakemore Hyde Park, we were told we had a continental though cooked breakfast was available but not to us and even if we had paid a supliment for a sausage would have more inclusive, The staff at reception were very friendly
141417,Blakemore Hyde Park, , Very silent surroundings Beautiful livingarea and not far from underground Perfect breakfast Very good space in the room also for suitcases Well working and free wi fi in our on 5th floor
141418,Blakemore Hyde Park, Rooms overheated Difficult to lower temperature as was fixed throughout building apparently therefore had to sleep with windows open , Friendly staff who remembered me from last visit excellent beds very good breakfast ultra handy location
141419,Blakemore Hyde Park, English breakfast not worth the extra 5 50 per person Bathroom could have been cleaner Shower door did not close completely , Excellent location near Hyde Park between Bayswater and Queensway tube stations Quiet room 
141420,Blakemore Hyde Park, WiFi is very slow on the room Continental breakfast was not so diverse The bed is too soft for my opinion noise from the street and from other rooms could be easily heard inside the room , The Hotel is located on a central area right next to Hyde park 5 minutes walk from the nearest Tube station 3 minutes walk from the nearest bus station The staff are really nice the rooms are comfortable and well kept 
141421,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was VERY small We have stayed at the hotel before and had a much bigger room for the same price as I recall I asked if we could have a bigger room and the lady at reception very kindly said we could but not until the next day so we left it because we couldn t be bothered to move all our stuff having unpacked etc We appreciated the offer of another room though so thank you for that , The staff were very friendly The hotel itself is very smart and clean in a good location The breakfast was nice although I prefer the cereals to be in closed containers rather than all open and uncovered It s just a hygiene thing but I am a bit fussy like that having seen someone sneeze all over them once 
141422,Blakemore Hyde Park, The guests above our head had children who were jumping on the floor from 6am onwards each morning and then again the evening Whilst Reception did try and sort this it never stopped Next time I will ask for a room on the top floor , Wonderfully friendly lady who greeted us at breakfast with a huge smile Very clean great bed And a very nice breakfast 
141423,Blakemore Hyde Park, In the order I asked for a silent room At the 3rd night out of four there was a terrible noise came from another room Not only the night manager was unable to locate the VERY noisy room it seems as if he doesn t have the authority as well as the minimal ability to solve the problem so I ve had to wait till the morning It has totally KILLED my 4th day I never write bad things about staff but this was unusual When hotels cover old woody stairways with mats they should at least have a night manager that doesn t insult their residents time after time , 95 of the staff was excellent I liked the way Yuhana treated me for a noisy room and an insulting night manager She was very pleasant and professional Most of the staff is very very careful Also the hotel is extra clean the continental breakfast is quite good the beds are comfortable and I also liked the location 
141424,Blakemore Hyde Park, More English teabags in room when we arrived there were only 2 and when topped up the next day we were only left 1 not very good don t you think Bathroom rather small and compact Was rather noisy at night you could hear other people talking in their rooms heard tv s on and lots of noise from the road so not much sleep , Room very clean Staff were all very polite and always smiling Service at the bar also very good Breakfast lots of choice 
141425,Blakemore Hyde Park, my mom lost her ring in the room and they did not want to help , I was going to write a decent review but my mom lost her ring in the room and they did not want to help 
141426,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast included was continental If you wanted cooked it cost an extra 5 50 , The hotel was really clean and the staff very friendly The evening meal was very good The bed was the comfiest we have ever had in a hotel 
141427,Blakemore Hyde Park, nothing, the staff is very kind and helpful rooms have a good size compared with London Hotels breakfast offer a good choice and qualitative food the location is fine near to hyde park but not central
141428,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were fantastic from the front desk to the concierge The girls in the bar area were a delight to deal with My daugher is 8 and speaks Polish and one of the ladies was lovely to her It made her day so many thanks to the lady with blonde hair 
141429,Blakemore Hyde Park, The check in at 3pm its too late And they always knock the door way before 11am to to ask ab check out when sometimes u are resting, The reception is very polite And the hotel is clean and confortable
141430,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing could be better, Wonderful hotel room we were upgraded could not ask for a better room we will go back there Breakfast was also lovely and the staff
141431,Blakemore Hyde Park, the only thing I can think of that I didn t really like was the hot section of breakfast wasn t included when we had paid for breakfast additionally But for the hot section of breakfast we had to pay extra which I assumed it would of be included , I enjoyed the high spec of the hotel and room The staff were very friendly and helpful too 
141432,Blakemore Hyde Park, On 3 separate days we went out at 10am and our room was not made up, Nicoletta and Christine were excellent They made our breakfast and morning most pleasant 
141433,Blakemore Hyde Park, Well we scratched our heads and could only come up with we wished the breakfast facility wasn t in the lowest level But the food was wonderful and again staff always very nice so who are we to complain , Very nice spacious room in quiet location close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens but not far from small shopping venues and local eateries And an easy jump on the Tube at Queensway for the zoom in to London central Staff was just as helpful and friendly as one could ask for 
141434,Blakemore Hyde Park, Although room was spacy bathroom was little bit smallish Two persons can not move normally inside , Great value for a money and quite good location near the central line Clean comfortable and nice hotel Breakfast continental was fairly fair We also had a great dinner at decent price Would reccomend 
141435,Blakemore Hyde Park, While breakfast was good there were some discrepancies that were unaccounted for when making the booking Breakfast was supposedly included in our rate but only continental i e cold breakfast croissants et cetera This wasn t an issue because for a small fee we were allowed to have the hot full English breakfast but would have appreciated this having been made clear to us beforehand , The rooms were impeccably kept and the hotel staff were very polite and helpful A three minute walk from Hyde Park and about six minutes to the nearest tube the hotel is located in an exceptionally quiet part of London with relatively easy access The 390 bus route also runs to Bayswater Road 24 hours and runs right through the heart of London through Mayfair Oxford Street and right up to King s Cross Will definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to friends and family coming to London in the future 
141436,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were given a downgraded room without notice We didn t find out this until the second stay and complaint to the hotel when we checked out We were told the manager would contact us to solve the problem Even I called a couple of times later on but never received any feedback since then ,No Positive
141437,Blakemore Hyde Park, The Mattress is soft and it sinks when you sleep on it It causes back pain The curtains does not close completely from all around Hence if you want to stay longer in bed it will be difficult due to the sun light The doors has 2 CM gap on the bottom and that is of course big disaster for privacy or noise , The location was really minutes walk from Paddington Hide Park and bayswater station Everything you need it is around you The staff were the best friendly smily and helpful at all time 
141438,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The room was very comfortable and spacious The staff were friendly A thoroughly enjoyable stay The food was good and service excellant We would stay here again if visiting the Hyde Park area 
141439,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hotel has only one elevator and it is as slow as the hotel Internet It is not unusual to spend 5 minutes waiting for the elevator , We booked a club twin room which is very spacious with most comfortable beds Breakfast is basic but adequate Room is impeccably clean Hotel staff are efficient and friendly It is located near 3 tube stations Paddington Bayswater and Queensway Although the 15 minutes walk to the tube stations can be a pain when it rains there are plenty shops convenience stores banks and restaurants near the tube stations We enjoyed walking in this very lively and safe neighborhood We tried several restaurants They are delicious and reasonably priced On our departure day Blakemore allowed us to leave our luggage for pick up in late afternoon We are very happy with this nice hotel and enjoyed the lovely neighborhood 
141440,Blakemore Hyde Park, Two extra days , Staff excellent from the front of desk and supporting concierge to the hard working room service team Breakfast superb great restraint team wish I was staying for longer than an overnight show break Thank you 
141441,Blakemore Hyde Park, My bed was so uncomfortable felt like it had a hole in the middle Asked them to change it but if they did it was still the same Rooms need some upkeep , Hotel is nice staff are friendly location in central
141442,Blakemore Hyde Park, No room service, The hotel is in a good and quiet location Staff are very helpful and smiling all the time The restuarant s food is outstanding Will definietly recommend this hotel to everyone who is looking for a high standard hotel with value for money 
141443,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, The beds were really comfortable bathroom impeccably clean and I liked that I could open the bedroom window as I like to sleep with it open Had continental breakfast which was generous fresh and plentiful waiting staff friendly and attentive Able to leave bags at hotel after checkout to pick up later that day Very close to Paddington station so easily walkable and enjoyed walk through Hyde Park in to London Enjoyed so much I have cancelled my reservation at another hotel in London in May and booked here again for my trip to the Chelsea flower show 
141444,Blakemore Hyde Park, Having to pay extra for English breakfast I am English staying in an English hotel in England I don t want continental breakfast Advertise including breakfast included on advert should include continental English extra It cost me 44 for 2 people for 4 nights for English breakfast not good , Comfortable bed
141445,Blakemore Hyde Park, Payed for breakfast to only then find out that it didn t include a cooked breakfast and had to pay extra wasn t impressed Beds and pillows uncomfortable Could hear the lift from our room which was a suit also got woken up at 2am by another guest showering , Loved the location Loved the chandelier as you walk in Really great shower room 
141446,Blakemore Hyde Park, We forgot a bag in the room and just 20 min after we came back to ask for it the man at the front desk immediately said no sorry there is nothing without even check After some minutes he just lift the speaker and pretend he was speaking with someone just to make us go such a shame after a nice stay ,No Positive
141447,Blakemore Hyde Park, Everything perfect, Friendly staff everyone of whom wished us good day Food excellent Clean rooms with everything you could wish for Definitely recommended 
141448,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only had the one night here and did not spend too much time here as we were out all night but there was nothing that I can say I didn t like , Quiet clean really large and comfortable beds Lovely bathroom art deco touches also lovely Friendly staff
141449,Blakemore Hyde Park, The stay wasn t as good as my last stay here in 5 years ago My boyfriend and I stayed for 11 nights but the house keeper didn t refill the teabags and coffee even I finished certain flavours The bed sheets were dirty even they were newly changed Wifi was bad in room lost connection all the time Stayed in the 4th floor but there is only one lift in the hotel and it was slow the lift was busy especially in the morning during breakfast time took so long to get in and go downstairs Also both windows in my room were broken they were like falling off at any time , Friendly staff and convenient location and room is spacious 
141450,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff were very rude and abrupt at reception and at the concierge The food at breakfast didn t have a very big variety unless you paid extra for a full English which didn t look too appetising , Location was good room was very nice aprt from tv being in the corner and unable to move Also the room was far too warm and the air conditioning wouldn t work Also the fire alarm went off numerous times 
141451,Blakemore Hyde Park, Staff quite rude and unhelpful Ripped me off on a second night stay booked the first night on booking then needed to extend another night and seriously increased the price Then I was sat in the lobby area and overheard somebody walk in and book there and then much cheaper Complained about this and they said they couldn t do anything as the rate fluctuates Not a good way to make somebody want to come again Rooms a bit on the small size, The breakfast was fantastic In a nice quiet area peaceful
141452,Blakemore Hyde Park, The wi fi wasn t great The room entry cards didn t work on a couple of occasions so we had to go back to reception to get them reprogrammed , The room was clean but a little small Nice quiet location very close to the tube station Nice gym Friendly staff 
141453,Blakemore Hyde Park, The key for the room didn t work and i was left wondering on the 5th floor what to do I went back to reception told them about the problem the door doesn t open and the girl at reception said it is fixed went back to the 5th floor in their elevator which i felt its gonna fall dawn any second but i reached 5th safely thank god to find that my problem haven t been solved and i went back to the reception for the third time to be told that they have to send someone to check it for me and look for the problem with the door they took 30 deposit when i arrived for a room that doesn t open and a mini bar that was empty Will not go there again for sure, The location was great and the room was clean specially the bathroom
141454,Blakemore Hyde Park, No bath robes or slippers Tea bags not replenished Glasses used by bedside not washed and replaced , Staff very friendly Comfy spacious room Good shower and TV Room located exactly as requested 
141455,Blakemore Hyde Park, No parking, It was amazingly room beautiful staff lovely and friendly room service and the food amazing My husband and I was very pleased with the hotel and would stay again in the BLAKEMORE HOTEL
141456,Blakemore Hyde Park, the staff the breakfast was the poorest ever and I give Zero for oriental breakfast nothing was complementary no water not dental kit no slippers The wifi is bad and was not working for three days out of 4 they told us the local calls are free of charge and once we checked out they charged me 19 pounds for minutes call i asked why you told me its free they said sorry by mistake if by mistake they should pay the charge , the location near queensway and big bus station 
141457,Blakemore Hyde Park, poor enough english from some staff which made communication hard fab otherwise , it was really nice in a lovely location so comfortable stayed 2 nights and would have stayed more if we were there longer we went as a young couple we got a good deal online 
141458,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was an annouing green LED light on in the ceiling near the door inside of my room i assume this is some kind of health and safety thing It was enough to light the darkened room I stuck something over it The breakfast wasnt up to much Paid for an english breakfast but there was no black pudding I ordered a fried egg and got a 1 egg ommlette, Good location Great comfortable rooms The chefs special at the restaurant was fantastic 20 for 2 courses scallops followed by a steak 
141459,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast had added charge at breakfast time This should have been explained before as we would have gone elsewhere for breakfast Small area for breakfast too the whole experience was rather stressful ,No Positive
141460,Blakemore Hyde Park, The WiFi was very poor in our room The lifts are very small and were quite the challenge with our baby buggy , Very nice staff and a lot of friendly faces The food was very good and the room service was superb 
141461,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bed could have been a bit firmer One of the bath sheets was frayed and had seen better days , The breakfast was good and staff friendly It was lovely to go for a walk in the park before dinner and a run before breakfast 
141462,Blakemore Hyde Park, Booked a suite with a TV in bathroom Was told none of them worked and was not informed of this previous to booking otherwise would have not hooked with them Also location appears nice but one street away it can turn into what looks like a council estate Be careful,No Positive
141463,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful Excellent environment for a business stay Restaurant food also very good Would strongly recommend this hotel I use this hotel every couple Of weeks and will continue to do so 
141464,Blakemore Hyde Park, They charged me the cost of the booking before I arrived which when I was booking was told that I would not be charged until I was checking out They also wanted 60 in case I ordered room service They also charged my friends money also despite the fact that I had already paid It took a week for my friend to be refunded her money therefore she was left short money for her holiday in London as was i and we couldn t do as much as we would have liked There was all foreign staff which I have no problem with however they could not explain the reason for this clearly and were rude at times The wifi was very bad the only service was in the reception , Nice looking hotel nice beds 
141465,Blakemore Hyde Park, I expected a better quality for the food in the restaurant and for the breakfast The wifi was not working properly and I was constantly disconnected , The room was very comfortable and the team was very nice 
141466,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room was small and stuffy and hot Bathroom smelt of cigarettes Not worth the money for a 4 star hotel Lobby staff judgemental and rude I think it s stupid that I had to pay extra money for a full English breakfast that was supposed to be provided within the price of the room Especially when there wasn t really much choice other than a full English The wifi didn t work neither did the TV at one point We were given what looked like the smallest room on our floor I just thought I could have received a lot better service for what I paid for The staff just looked at me as if I was stupid just because I m only 19 I m still a paying customer I still deserve equal service and that isn t what I received , The lobby is nicely decorated and the bed was comfy There were all the required facilities in the room and a lot of information in a booklet in the room 
141467,Blakemore Hyde Park, I would definitely stay here again My minor quibbles would be the fact that the shower is over quite a high bath that was a little difficult to clamber in and out of the dodgy wifi and nowhere to put the wet soap , We had a lovely room on the top floor and totally enjoyed our experience at the Blakemore Hyde The staff were very friendly and obliging and the location was a quiet spot just around the corner from the action The beds were comfortable and the water was hot Close to central and district lines and bus stops including the Big Bus hop on and off The surrounding area is an interesting mixture of cultures and grand terraces 
141468,Blakemore Hyde Park, The menu in the Terrace resturant was very limited with same Daily Specials always the same, We had booked a junior suite as we thought our Grandaughter was going to be us unfortunately there were just two of us to stay at The Blakemore We offerd ed another room on the ground floor that was much easier to use with a lovely bathroom However if you want a cab there are usually cabs out side if you ask in the hotel it will be a hire car very very expensive 
141469,Blakemore Hyde Park, The elevator service took forever and seemed to have a mind of its own , I liked the option of having my coffee in the reception area rather than the crowded breakfast room The location was outstanding and the staff helpful and efficient 
141470,Blakemore Hyde Park, we were placed in a room for invalid people where everything in the toilet was built very low for us wi fi signal in this room was very poor annoying noise from the bathroom and when neighboring doors were closing, very comfortable bed located in a quiet place friendly stuff
141471,Blakemore Hyde Park, I thought my breakfast is included however there is extra charge for having a hot breakfast , The decorations of the room is very modern and the bed is very comfy I love the bathroom is very clean and tidy 
141472,Blakemore Hyde Park, The temperature in the hotel was too hot Had to wedge the window open to cool the room down Heating controls didn t appear to make any difference , Continental breakfast was good with lots of choice 
141473,Blakemore Hyde Park, Have nothing to say as we were very happy , We were impressed when the girl on the check in desk gave us an upgraded room it was our 48th wedding anniversary so that made it special 
141474,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only thing I hate is the location of the room It was terrible Never stay in the room number 506 It s near the elevator and it is impossible to sleep due to high amount of noise , Breakfast location staff
141475,Blakemore Hyde Park, I can t really think of anything I did not like , The staff were always very warm and welcoming across the time we spent at this hotel The room couldn t be faulted it was contemporary and comfortable The breakfast hall was also very nice The facilities were also to a very good standard 
141476,Blakemore Hyde Park, Could supply more tourist info about London and guidance on how to use contactless cards on buses trains , Great location on main bus route just around the corner from underground station 
141477,Blakemore Hyde Park, As continental breakfast includes maybe just an extra 2 for cooked breakfast not 5 50, Friendly staff very clean good service Good location near to Hyde Park
141478,Blakemore Hyde Park, thinking the price we paid it is ridicilious that we had to PAY for the slippers the breakfast included in the room price is only the continental and we had to pay 5 5 pounds per person for the hot breakfast air condition was blowing directly towards the bed there is not even a bottle of water in the fridge , staff were very polite and helfull the location of the hotel is very good just 5 minutes to quinsway metro station
141479,Blakemore Hyde Park, Found the charging system a little confusing ie prepayment of one night s accommodation plus 60 not sure why this was necessary, Lovely clean room Friendly staff Very good breakfast Quiet location
141480,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Amazing value for money Very clean staff all very friendly and helpful particular mention for the breakfast waiters Large well equipped room no street noise very comfortable bed We would definitely stay here again The breakfast was superb too 
141481,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Great hotel fabulous find The reviews lived up to my expectations and more I had a ground floor room which was very spacious for a London hotel Large ensuite Very clean
141482,Blakemore Hyde Park, We paid for a breakfast then were advised on arrival that an extra charge would have to be paid for breakfast , Lovely room excellent breakfast pleasant staff 
141483,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was nothing in the mini bar Moreover wi fi was poor and did not work sometimes , Bed was comfortable and room was clean Price was fair and location was good 
141484,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were hungry after returning from a play since we ate an early dinner and were disappointed that room service ends at 10 Would have liked it to go later at least on a Saturday night , The bed was comfortable and the hotel was really clean and nice We took a nice walk through Hyde park in the morning and it s also close to a tube stop 
141485,Blakemore Hyde Park, nothing, The continental breakfast was excellent value for money and the beds were very comfortable The staff were very very friendly and couldn t do enough for you 
141486,Blakemore Hyde Park, I have asked later departure for a couple of hours as I had to go directly to the airport and this was denied without extra charge , the location the room very clean 
141487,Blakemore Hyde Park, It s hard to find something to complain about but the coffee tea cups in the room were far to small we had to borrow cups from the breakfast room Please provide plenty of face cloths , Location value staff and food were all excellent 
141488,Blakemore Hyde Park, Low wifi signal 5 minutes walking to nearest bus or underground station, Very excellent staff they make upgrad for better room to me Very clean comfortable room excellent breakfast
141489,Blakemore Hyde Park, A minor point of concern is that sometimes there is some noise of little children who are running in the corridors without correction by their parents , Fine well appointed clean room good beds friendly and welcoming staff in both reception and breakfastroom as well as in the bar The hotel is centrally situated There is an excellent busconnection nr 94 round the corner on Bayswater Road direct towards Oxfordstreet and Piccadilly Circus All in all one can notice that this is a very well managed hotel and I can definetely recommend it 
141490,Blakemore Hyde Park, I didn t like finding someone s soiled underwear in a paper bag in my bed I didn t like that unless I paid for early access to my room I would not be allowed entry until 15 00 I arrived at 09 30 knowing that I would be too early to check in and saw people departing however the room was not cleaned and ready until 14 30 According to reception no rooms were ready I have never stayed in a hotel that took someone 5 hours to clean , Restaurant staff were very friendly nice way to start the day
141491,Blakemore Hyde Park, Smokers standing outside the main doors, There was almost absolutely nothing to dislike about this hotel It was quiet well furnished clean and comfortable
141492,Blakemore Hyde Park, A little more smile and courtesy from the people in the restaurant would be very nice , Very helpful and pleasant people on the reception and in general 
141493,Blakemore Hyde Park, We upgraded to a cooked breakfast while we were downstairs but were told we could not put it on our bill So we had to go to the room to get payment and pay it separately We were confused as to why we couldn t have had it added to the final bill , We loved the room 116 it was very specious and comfortable 
141494,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, On arrival we were greeted by the loveliest woman The hotel was beautiful Our room was spotless and our bed was the comfiest ever The shower was luxourious Breakfast was delicious and service was brilliant The hotel was in a great location with a short walking distance to Queensway tube station
141495,Blakemore Hyde Park, My card had to have a holding pre authorisation charge few that would only be released within 5 days of leaving hotel , Beautiful memory foam bed Lovely continental breakfast Room set up correctly for the amount of adults staying very clean and spacious room 
141496,Blakemore Hyde Park, The kitchen staff wasn t the most inviting and whispered amongst one another which made me very uncomfortable expect a young Italian girl who held conversation with me made me feel very welcomed , The night manager was absolutely amazing and does an amazing job managing his staff He exceeded my expectations and was very friendly Thank you again for all of your help 
141497,Blakemore Hyde Park, Great place but I was disappointed that We weren t allowed to have hot breakfast because we have booked the rooms through booking com I think that s bad,No Positive
141498,Blakemore Hyde Park, Well the spread of the continental breakfast was pretty limited I know some guests already mentioned about this but was pretty surprised how limited it was I ended up eating two croissants with jam and nutella They did provide us with hard boiled eggs on Friday and Saturday then on Sunday maybe due to the amount of guests they no longer served them If you would like a better meal you have to upgrade it with a certain amount of money and you ll be able to get the rest of the buffet spread which consists of scrambled eggs hash browns mushrooms etc To be honest we have stayed in other hotels in the UK which had a similar room rate even ones cheaper and they provided us with a much wider spread for breakfast Hope they could improve this But nevertheless breakfast is just minor for us The main thing is that we enjoyed our 3 nights stay , The room is big and very comfortable The toilet is small though but not a big issue Generous with towels and pillows Previously I stayed in two other hotels with similar rates in Bayswater but Blakemore definitely wins 
141499,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was nothing I didn t like thank you, I liked everything about this hotel very well located and very clean the best hotel I ve been to in a long time thanks for my stay appreciate it loads
141500,Blakemore Hyde Park, Unfortunalty the receptionist when we were leaving made no conversation about our stay we just payed the bill and walked away very disappointing as other than this we would have had nothing that we didn t like , The friendly staff we were always welcomed with a smile and a greeting particularly from the ladies doing the rooms The clean fresh smell of linen each time we entered the corridor and our room We enjoyed lovely meal in the resurant with food being at reasonable prices which is not always the case with some London Hotels 
141501,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was a green light that was always on in the room and made it difficult to sleep at night I could also hear the hotel music from my room which wasn t ideal , The bed was very comfy and the room itself was spacious with modern d cor It was clean and inviting 
141502,Blakemore Hyde Park, poor room sound insulation kept awake by people up stairs walking over the floor on and off through the night green emergency light far too bright never had it above a bed in any other hotels Doors slamming on and off through the night and then woken early with the train next to the window which nobody mentioned Meats and cheese etc selection very basic for continental breakfast , clean premises good decor 
141503,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only drawback is that wi fi was weak and sometimes unreachable at some spots when in the room I was on the 5th floor However it didn t cause me any trouble , Spending four nights at the hotel gave me the chance to fully enjoy the room which was warm and comfortable and with fantastic views of the rooftops I particularly found the shower soothing due to the rain system As far as breakfast is concerned both meals and service were beyond excellence In conclusion I definitely recommend this hotel and will return in the future 
141504,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast was poor Pastries weren t good and there was not enough selection of breads No grapefruit juice The option of cheeses was also very limited The breakfast lets down a very good hotel , The room was very spacious welcome fruit basket was great 
141505,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, My husband and I stayed here recently and I must say it was excellent It was only a 10 min walk from Paddington with tube stations within a very short walking distance So great for location We were originally given a ground floor room that looked out at a blank wall Not the view of London we really wanted However as soon as I said we really would prefer a different room the staff were very good and moved us straight away The staff were excellent throughout and our room was tastefully decorated with a large bed and a fantastic rain shower We only booked for the continental breakfast but my husband upgraded to the full breakfast for 5 and had a beautiful big cooked breakfast too We loved staying here and would definitely use it again 
141506,Blakemore Hyde Park, No do not disturb sign for door Cleaner wanted to come in before we had been for breakfast would have preffered later , Decent size room and very clean Beds really comfy Location surprisingly quiet but yet a short walk to tube stations 
141507,Blakemore Hyde Park, It is nice that the room is warm but it was even too warm that night The view from our room window in 0 floor was towards a wall , Breakfast was good and well organised The location near Paddington station and Hyde Park was excellent 
141508,Blakemore Hyde Park, Reception as checking in the girl there seemed a bit moody but overall nice , Stay was great lovely large room nice bathroom friendly staff specially house keeping dark haired girl that knocked on door in the morning 
141509,Blakemore Hyde Park, The bed was very comfy but the rooms appeared smaller than on the website , The staff was very welcoming friendly and helpful Although it was quite close to everything There was no noise that bothered me 
141510,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was to hot and it was difficult to regulat the heating or open the window The tea at the breakfast is improofable But after all the horror experience with British airways a good feeling Don t book British Airways , Real great this time Nice people at the reception and the room was good and spacious And the Internet worked also wonderful Even the breakfast was great After all the horror experience with British airways a good feeling Please don t book British Airways 
141511,Blakemore Hyde Park, The breakfast was very sparse cooked option looked miserable and not alot of choice for continental Most of the staff were lovely except for one young lady on reception in the evenings who was decidedly sour seemed bored with her job and bothered when asked a question , Bedrooms were lovely lots of hot water and lots of space Great coffee 
141512,Blakemore Hyde Park, The lift music that was playing in the hallway outside my room until I complained at 3am and it was turned off , Room was very nice quiet with a comfy bed and great bathroom
141513,Blakemore Hyde Park, The price is little expensive It is noicy because the maids talk so loud close our room The Wifi is weak and sometimes when you connect it is disconnected regraly , It is clean and tidy The staff are cooperative 
141514,Blakemore Hyde Park, 1 Was double charged and hotel don t realise until I called and rectify it I was charged by booking com once and by hotel reception desk again 2 Couldnt control the A C Very warm so have to open the windows Should have asked assitance from room service but I didn t 3 I mentioned as special request that I will be arriving between 12 00 1 00 but the receptions said they room won t be ready till 3 but we got another room different from requested room with in 15 mins, Nice clean and calm place for stay
141515,Blakemore Hyde Park, If you need internet dont stay there at least not in room 406 and even after many calls about this problem these 3 days of 4 I booked it was never working more than 5 minutes at time had to move to another hotel to do my work ,No Positive
141516,Blakemore Hyde Park, The size of the room I booked a club and was supposedly upgraded to executive yet it was the smallest room in the whole hotel Still doesn t make sense , The convenience of the place and where it was in central 
141517,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hostess at restaurant could used a little coaching Forced smile did not convey the welcome feeling the rest of the staff did Breakfast room service would be a plus , Good atmosphere very pleasant hotel and bar area staff Wait staff at restaurant lovely 
141518,Blakemore Hyde Park, The check in process was very slow other than this everything was perfect , The staff were all friendly and helped us with any queries we had We had a double club room on the ground floor The room was plenty big enough and the bed was very comfy 
141519,Blakemore Hyde Park, I hate to say that the food was poor quality tasteless and cold it was a shame for a lovely hotel please blakemore take this on board and up your game your worth it, the relaxing atmosphere beautiful hotel
141520,Blakemore Hyde Park, There was nothing that could be improved on, all the staff were extremely pleasant and nothing was too much bother for any of them The club double room was really comfortable and clean The bathroom was luxurious and very modern Would highly recommend and will definately be booking again
141521,Blakemore Hyde Park, Train track noise laid in bed irritated me somewhat even though i had requested a quiet room Beautiful dining area and the food was excellent although a cockroach was spotted under a breakfast table Free breakfast was provide for after complaint Food at the hotel in the evening was cold and tasteless ,No Positive
141522,Blakemore Hyde Park, I thought the bait r area was a bit small but service was excellent Didn t realise there was a two tier breakfast system Continental and English Hot and cold , I loved the overall feel of the hotel Very friendly and courteous staff 
141523,Blakemore Hyde Park, My only complaint was that the room was too warm at night I did adjust the air con but it made no difference I should have asked staff for help The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotless , The location was handy for tube stations small restaurants and shops The neighbourhood felt safe The staff were polite and friendly and the breakfast was good although we did not sample the cooked section It looked good too 
141524,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, A real surprise I visited London regularly before retiring in 2015 both for business and leisure and never stayed anywhere that could match the price and quality of the Blakemore I wish I had found it earlier 
141525,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Its hard to say what we liked about the hotel most as we liked absolutely everything When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade from standard room to junior suite The staff at the reception were extremely polite and fast both with check in and check out the room was cosy well equipped and quiet We also enjoyed the variety of food during the breakfast We would definitely choose this hotel for our stay again 
141526,Blakemore Hyde Park, Breakfast was included in the price but did not include cooked breakfast just a continental breakfast Late check in time of 3pm, Beautiful bedrooms bathroom interior Close to Paddington station around 7 minute walk 
141527,Blakemore Hyde Park, No soundproofing at all you cold hear steps from the upper floor and the corridor Cold rooms and A C turning on automatically Very small TV compared to the room size, Large rooms Very nice bathrooms
141528,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room was very good but a little on the small side making the bedroom and the bathroom seem a bit cramped , A modern fresh friendly and comfortable hotel in a reasonable location 
141529,Blakemore Hyde Park, Staff on reception could be more helpful and pleasant Lighting in bedroom could be better Hair dryer had a far to short of cable There was a plug hanging out of the wall , Dining staff very friendly and helpful 
141530,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location quiet room comfortable bed Efficient service and staff helpful with luggage Did not really get to use other facility as only a short stay Will definitely recommend to friends in future 
141531,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing it was a real treat staying here , Upgraded to the honeymoon suite Pure luxury The staff were so accomidating and helpful Highly recommended 
141532,Blakemore Hyde Park, Over priced for what it is and where it is Breakfast average at best and charging extra for English not really justified Bit of a drains smell in bathroom , Nice room spacious Reception and bar area very modern and welcoming Great location for Hyde park and city Staff were pleasant and helpful 
141533,Blakemore Hyde Park, When we checked in we were given a very small room When I reserved the room on Booking com I was looking at location price and room size I found this room and it was listed at being just over 200 square feet in size The room we were first given was around half of that I immediatly went down to the front desk and showed them the room listed on the website was over 200 square feet The clerk said she had to talk to her supervisor She returned a few minutes later and said she had a room available at that size What would have happened if the room wasn t available All in all we liked our room and got what we paid for The bed was a bit soft , We liked the location which was walking distance to Paddington Train Station Nice lobby The room was also very nice 
141534,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were only there for one night but in comparison to other London hotels we have stayed in we could not fault the place for what we paid , Nice comfortable well presented bedroom and ensuite which was much roomier than experienced in previous London hotels Good variety of food offered with the inclusive continental breakfast was going to have the cooked breakfast but did not feel the need to Friendly efficient welcoming staff and seemingly plenty of them 
141535,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Location was excellent and close enough to subway For the money paid the room was better than any capital city stayed in Breakfast was fantastic Very efficient room service Huge super king bed
141536,Blakemore Hyde Park, No international restaurant weak signal wifi, Clean room and specious have supermarket and restaurants near by near to bus stop and Hyde Park 20 min walk to Oxford
141537,Blakemore Hyde Park, The fact that the staff in particularly the manage refused to look after our delivery if it came whilst we was out As we wanted to quickly leave the hotel for a while but did not end up going , The comfort of the room 
141538,Blakemore Hyde Park, I couldn t find any fault with this hotel, The bar and restaurant staff were really friendly there was nothing wrong with the reception or other staff but the restaurant and bar staffs were exceptional
141539,Blakemore Hyde Park, The reception staff seemed to find it very difficult to trust a young couple to use their facilities It was somewhat humiliating that they were reluctant to provide services such as room service without taking a payment upfront In addition to the booking side of things breakfast was a total let down I had already taken a look at some reviews but did not believe what previous guests had written THEY WERE RIGHT Very little on offer The rooms were also a lot smaller than what is advertised and I am certain that the Executive Room was just a basic Premier Inn room in a different colour scheme Not worth the money at all , Service with a smile at the bar and restaurant All of the waiting staff were keen on doing as much as they could to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable 
141540,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The Hotel was very good modern room new bathroom Breakfast was very good as well with a lot of things to choose from The location is good as well 8 10 minutes from Paddington Station and the area is very quiet The staff was very friendly helpful and professional I would definitely recommend it 
141541,Blakemore Hyde Park, Slightly too hot in the room even though there was air conditioning We were on the ground floor and there was some noise from the tube which must run under the hotel, Large room Comfy large bed Good continental breakfast Close to the park and tube station
141542,Blakemore Hyde Park, Air con was great really cold but didn t go very warm Might have just been in the room, Upgraded to a junior suite for free Bed was massive and very comfy 
141543,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The location of the hotel is in a very nice neighborhood A lot of locals commented that staying in Bayswater is a very good choice The room is very spacious with a nice bathroom The breakfast spread is also good Hotel staff is very professional and helpful 
141544,Blakemore Hyde Park, Offering sliced cucumber and tomatoes to put on top off bread would ve been great That s the only thing that actually comes to mind , The personnel was fabulous absolutely awesome Kind and helpful people Nothing to complain about the hotel itself decor and tidiness etc Breakfast was quite versatile even though me and my friend didn t eat the English breakfast but the continental one which includes a bit less than the English breakfast There are two tube stations within about 7 min walk from the hotel I thought the location was good also the neighborhood is very calm Maybe if you have disabilities or injuries that affect your ability to move the tube could be a bit closer All in all I d definitely recommend this hotel Maybe not the ideal place for families with small kids only because the hotel is a bit finer and it has a lovely calming touch to it 
141545,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Everything about our stay was excellent and of a very high standard Definitely will be returning The staff were very friendly and of very smart appearance Well done to all of you 
141546,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room which was an executive room needed another arm chair especially for 2 people staying for any length of time as we were , The restaurant was good value with well priced wine and a good choice of food Superb breakfast Minutes walk to Hyde Park and Queensway underground ideal for getting around 
141547,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only issue was a faulty remote minor issue Breakfast wasn t amazing and had to pay extra for hot which was a shame , We had a free upgrade and early check in which was excellent 
141548,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room is tiny there are no few amenities Very much you get what you pay for and that it When I travel I like when the hotel and services go above and beyond expectation There were no finishing touches to make you want to go back , modern design eloquent building breakfast was pleasant
141549,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, The hotel is very nice actually the best stay for me after couple of different hotels The rooms are in normal size inside is totally renovated The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast was very good 
141550,Blakemore Hyde Park, One lift meant there were often waits but no a big deal Rooms were also very warm even in London Winter , Great location Walking distance to 3 stations including Paddington which runs express to Heathrow Airport Heaps of food options near by suited to a variety of budgets Breakfast also good I had Continental Breakfast included which included coffee tea juice cereal breads danishes fruit etc Cooked English also available for extra cost 
141551,Blakemore Hyde Park, Think for the price cooked breakfast should be included and not extra not much choice at breakfast , The room were very spacious and the bed very comfy loved it 
141552,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only fault was the room we stayed in was at the rear of the hotel and the noise from the trains was quite disruptive Would ask to have a room at the front of the hotel , Location of the hotel was good and conveniently close to underground stations The staff were very polite welcoming and helpful The club room we stayed in was very comfortable and spacious On the whole we had a very enjoyable stay and would book this hotel again in the future 
141553,Blakemore Hyde Park, Not much choice of intercontinental breakfast that was included in the price if u are wanting full English breakfast in the downstairs restaurant there is a small charge for this, Fabulous hotel set in a great location very friendly helpful staff the food in the foyer Restaurunt is great value for money the rooms are very clean comfortable we are overall very happy with our stay would definitely reccomend this hotel
141554,Blakemore Hyde Park, No nice views as we were given a room below ground level While clean and spacious it felt like we were second citizens especially when we came back after a full day to nap and found by 3 30 pm the room still hadn t been cleaned The cleaning staff finally showed up around 4 pm We were so tired we declined having service , I loved the location cleanliness lobby area breakfast area and room layout The staff was friendly and tried to be helpful The afternoon tea was a delight 
141555,Blakemore Hyde Park, limited but acceptable continental breakfast full English was an optional extra for additional cost though , Practical location friendly and helpful staff Comfortable and clean rooms Good proximity to Hyde Park Portabello rd and Notting Hill etc Straight onto central line at Queensway 
141556,Blakemore Hyde Park, Could not find fault with anything Appears this is not part of a chain which is a shame in some ways as I would like to find other hotels of this standard in other cities , Greeted by friendly staff room upgrade given room absolutely spotless not a mark anywhere Complimentary continental breakfast very good and upgraded to cooked for just over 5 Used bar and had a bar snack in the evening all very good value for money 
141557,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bed was too small for us as we are used to sleep in a big bed Bathroom very very small , Super friendly staff very clean location 2 walk from Hyde Park
141558,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Great value for money spacious room for London this is a big plus Friendly and helpful staff Close to restaurants and the tube where isn t Would definitely stay here again 
141559,Blakemore Hyde Park, First day we found some hair in the bed even though the sheets were fresh The cleaners should pay more attention to details Other days we had no reason to complain about cleanliness fresh towels every day though some had signs of wear , Great location and good value for the price Rooms are a little bit on the small side but we did not mind You can hear the underground trains because the tube line is just behind the building but it was not worse than a normal traffic noise we had a room with the window to the street Included breakfast was tasty and ok for the price Overall the hotel has been clearly renovated already some time ago so some wear out is visible but the bed was comfy so that just added to the atmosphere of the area Very nice and professional staff 
141560,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We liked the smart welcoming foyer the friendly efficient staff the smooth swift check in check out the facility to store luggage without charge for a few hours after check out the free upgrade to a spacious comfortable room the complimentary reliable wifi the location within walking distance of Kensington Gardens Hyde Park Queensway of tube stations bus stops from which one could quickly reach the West End finally the reasonable bill 
141561,Blakemore Hyde Park, The cooked breakfast was tasteless , The bar staff are lovely and very chatty We had a free room upgrade so our suite was lovely and spacious The decor of the hotel is nice A short walk away to hyde park We went to the royal Albert hall so not far from there Would recommend 
141562,Blakemore Hyde Park, Weak WIFI connection within room Heating problems breakfast very poor lack of some basic facilities in room , Location Staff Room service food and room size 
141563,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Everything was great Lovely hotel in a very convenient and quiet location with very nice staff Good breakfast stylish ambience nothing to complain about 
141564,Blakemore Hyde Park, My bathroom was freezing and when I ran a bath it was luke warm , I was kindly given an upgrade to a Junior suite which was lovely and the room was massive with a huge bed and everything i needed Thank you Staff were nice and friendly 
141565,Blakemore Hyde Park, No negatives to speak of , Hotel atmosphere was lovely Staff couldn t have been more friendly helpful Continental breakfast was excellent The area within which the hotel was situated was a very peaceful residential area 
141566,Blakemore Hyde Park, No extraction in the bathroom so all items left in the bathroom got steamed up and could not use the mirrors , Would stay again nice hotel clean room was very comfortable and a good size 
141567,Blakemore Hyde Park, Extra charge for the hot food in the breakfast Only one small lift for 6 floors which sometimes makes its difficult to go up and down , Very good location in London Clean and nice rooms Stayed a week 
141568,Blakemore Hyde Park, I thought for the price of the hotel a full breakfast should be included We paid 5 50 extra per day if we wanted a proper English breakfast as opposed to continental Also the wifi wasn t very good at all constantly dropping out and having to reconnect not very good for those travelling for business , The size of the room was brilliant the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic The room was cleaned every day and was left spotless and the staff were always more than happy to help with anything we asked for Would definitely recommend and will be visiting again 
141569,Blakemore Hyde Park, Although had booked Continental breakfast had to pay an additional 5 50 for hot breakfast which was not hot or enjoyable Asked Reception to arrange for a taxi for us which I believe was a private hire The return journey by normal Black Cab from the same place was half of what we paid for the private hire so DO NOT USE THE HOTELS PRIVATE HIRE COMPANY it s shockingly expensive, The room was very clean and comfortable the staff were very pleasent and the location was brilliant for what we needed 
141570,Blakemore Hyde Park, Having to pay top price for two rooms for a family of four with two children is expensive rooms were not next to each other as requested Ability to perform late check out not existent in my opinion did not show the flexibility that other hotels demonstrate Good facilities just ok service, Location dining area check in excellent
141571,Blakemore Hyde Park, Wifi not working in the room complaint about it problem not fixed An old lady from staff probably checking rooms that had been cleaned walked straight in the room without knocking at the door while I was lying in bed ,No Positive
141572,Blakemore Hyde Park, The hotel removed the money from my credit card months before my visit contrary to their terms and conditions I contacted booking com and the hotel who confirmed that this should not be done The Hotel sent me an email saying it will be refunded but it never was Since my visit I have emailed them twice to give them a chance to explain their actions but have not received the cortesy of an answer ,No Positive
141573,Blakemore Hyde Park, 1 the room was average it looked a bit dated but still okay 2 The worst thing about this hotel was how cold the room was The windows were so drafty it was uncomfertable , The staff were polite and couldn t help us enough
141574,Blakemore Hyde Park, Excellent breakfast but very average evening meal Will stay again but probably eat out , Really obliging staff and beautifully clean well equipped rooms
141575,Blakemore Hyde Park, The room was quite noisy not because of the traffic outside but things like fridge air conditioning etc , Very nice room with reasonable size for London standards Good deal on the room rate 
141576,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had a very cold room especially bahroom with not working heater with no option to make it warmer Phones weren t also working in the room and we couldn t call reception We were offered different room from them which was nice touch Other room was bigger but strangely even more colder and our bathroom was near the windows which were poorly isolated so we couldn t get a bath in it I am usually resistant to cold but rooms in this hotel much more colder than any other hotels in London When asked recepto to heaters in our room we were told maintaince guy looked in our room and it was okay Nothing really changed and we just were to exhausted to complain about it more since we stayed there only for 1 night , Restraunt and their staff Good food 
141577,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, This hotel is exceptional First time we stayed as a last minute reservation due to our friends leaving very close by and convert it in our home when in London This hotel has nothing less than amazing product and excellent service Staff is extremely keen to assist and the hotel is immaculate very private and the rooms are well maintain and equipped 
141578,Blakemore Hyde Park, Would have preferred to have had a better view from the window instead of a brick wall but having a ground floor room has its compensations , Friendly and helpful staff Price Large comfortable bed which we are used to at home Good breakfast selection Quiet location but easy short walk to Queensway or Bayswater tube Hyde Park is within walking distance 
141579,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only issue i had with the stay was the staffs unwillingness to let me pay for things as i went along After having a couple of drinks at the bar i tried to pay for my order and the staff seemed more inclined to get me to charge it to my room which i did not want to do At one point i ordered a drink to take to my room and the bar staff said they would bring the bill over The total was around 11 pounds and when i gave the staff a 20 pound note instead of getting my change they said we will keep this as a tip which i found outrageous I told them no and insisted on my change I would have happily left them a tip for the service as up until that point they had been lovely but to bluntly tell me they were keeping 9 pounds as a tip was a bit over the top , The hotel was clean the staff were welcoming on arrival our room was lovely and the location was ideal for our stay 
141580,Blakemore Hyde Park, Internet connection was poor not suitable for business purposes , Room was nice and cosy although the bed could be better Service was very good Nice restaurant 
141581,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hotel staff is incredible unprofessional and unpleasant Hotel treats guests as guilty unless they prove otherwise In executive rooms on the first level you can enjoy every passing of noisy underground train with wall 30cm from the window On the first floor there are some rooms with heavy smell from bathroom pipes and mold Many times you have to wait in the line for the breakfast but still with no order Never again even for free , Location
141582,Blakemore Hyde Park, The hallways were a bit noisy and wished the housekeeping came a bit earlier than 2 30pm , The room was great and very comfortable The location was great you could get anywhere using both the Queensway tube and Baywater tube 
141583,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Rooms were very nice and clean with comfortable beds and a nice bath Staff were very friendly and helpful After we checked in we found that there was no bath so we asked Staff if it would be possible to get one This was absolutely no problem so we left our luggage and the Staff changed room and took our luggage to our new room while we were visiting London 
141584,Blakemore Hyde Park, Paid an insurance at check in asked several times If this is the payment for our stay and they said yes every time Had to pay again when at check out they said I will get my first payment back but I am still waiting and nothing has been transfered No wifi The wifi worked one time for about 5 minutes and that was it No one speaks english If you want warm breakfeast you ll have to pay 11 pounds pr Person and breakfeast Stealing not friendly impossible to communicate with and overall a building in bad shape Book this hotel if you love noise at night ,No Positive
141585,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We enjoy the siting We have access to most of London from here and its a lovely area where the hotel is based The staff are very friendly and efficient

141662,Blakemore Hyde Park, For the price services were only average breakfast ok room small Poor staff bar manager gave rude reply when wanting to watch rugby world cup on bar TV no other people watching it but decided he wanted to watch his channel England were hosting the World Cup eventually he allowed the four guests of hotel to watch what we wanted but it left a sour taste , The location was convenient
141663,Blakemore Hyde Park, Bar for residents would have been good Accidentally left trousers in room and haven t heard from anyone yet , Loved the location staff layout and pretty much everything I wouldn t hesitate for a second to book this hotel again Almost trying to think of a good excuse to go down to London again soon so I can stay here

141666,Blakemore Hyde Park, I was given a room in the basement That s right At the rate of nearly 200 pounds a night I had basically no windows the only window was facing a wall a few feet away was next to the gym and had to listen to people walking up and down the hallway all night likely employees of the hotel who were obviously working On top of that I woke up to the smell of breakfast food in my room While I love breakfast the smell was so strong and pervasive that I couldn t enjoy it and grew increasingly frustrated for the absence of fresh odorless air , The location is very convenient right next to Hyde Park and a couple of underground stations 
141667,Blakemore Hyde Park, staff seemed rather rude and arrogant travelling with child and got given ground floor room next to bar door slamming all night none asked how our stay was rather expensive , nice hotel rooms lovely location was ok

141683,Blakemore Hyde Park, This hotel has ridiculously rigid procedures around payment authorisation for reservations made and paid with company credit cards I had prepaid for my stay but I was effectively charged again on my personal credit card as a deposit until the cardholder filled out a form signed it and sent it to the hotel together with a photocopy of the credit card and their passport I wasted hours in arguments The hotel manager was stand offish and rather rude which didn t help matters at all Also there was very loud noise at night from tons of glass crushing while being disposed of in containers very disturbing due to the irregularity and loudness of it The continental breakfast was very poor and the English breakfast which came at a supplement was not satisfactory either poor choice and quality of the ingredients not properly cooked , the room and bathroom were clean
141684,Blakemore Hyde Park, They had a problem with the elevators for 2 3 days out of the 7 days I stayed there We were lucky we stayed at the second floor but it was still annoying , The hotel is clean newly furnished and it s right next to Hyde park and Kensington gardens You can t but love it Staff are very friendly and helpful specially Cristina Gabriella and Petra

141691,Blakemore Hyde Park, I didn t like the fact that none of the plugs worked in our room My partner wanted to have a bath and he couldn t because the bath plug wasn t staying down and was the same for the sink I also dont like that breakfast finishes so early and the cleaning maid decided to bang on our door at 9 30 when we had had a late night and didn t want to be up super early so we missed breakfast by 10minutes The lift in the hotel is TINY and very very hot It takes a while to come down and you can only fit 3people in at a squeeze , The room was nice nice view Staff were friendly
141692,Blakemore Hyde Park, For hotel accommodation London has to be the worst value for money of any major European city , staff friendly location in Bayswater was good Room not too poky by London standards 
141693,Blakemore Hyde Park, The main elevator was out for our entire stay meaning everyone in the hotel had to use a tiny 4 person one including staff It was not good There s no way to prevent the showers from getting the floor wet not unique to this hotel And on our last night there was this inconsistent grinding noise coming from the walls It kept me up for hours Would not stay again , Hotel has a good location and is overall a nice place to stay Included breakfast is very handy 
141694,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were in a room on the lower ground floor and wifi was poor However on mentioning this to reception they offered me a computer to use , The room was really spacious and spotlessly clean The breakfast that was included in the room rate was fantastic Staff were very friendly and helpful on check in and restaurant staff were really great with excellent service 
141695,Blakemore Hyde Park, Awful wifi Unusable I paid 7 pounds booking for breakfast and was told it would be another 5 50 for cooked food from Bain Marie Outrageous Aldo had to wait for waiter to see me before getting a coffee rather than the normal refill yourself arrangement Never book breakfast here you will do better to wonder down the road for better cheaper food , Friendly staff
141696,Blakemore Hyde Park, Only one lift and very small So you sometimes had to wait a bit but not a big deal, The rooms have a ton of space comfy beds large bathroom and very clean
141697,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only negative thing I can think of was that I sometimes felt the staff was a bit snobby towards me I was dressed casually on most days but you d think after the first 2 3 nights of 5 they would recognize me but did not except for one of the breakfast staff personnel , The room was spacious comfortable and not noisy at all 1st floor room Travelling alone I never felt unsafe walking to and from the hotel during the night and day The hotel is within 5 10 min walking distance of all modes of London transportation which was great 
141698,Blakemore Hyde Park, We were allocated a room on the ground floor right next to the lift so were disturbed through the night when guests came back and did not respect other guests at a late hour , Room was clean bathroom was a nice size breakfast included was continental with good choices The location was good for our visit 
141699,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We stayed in a King Suite and the room was VERY spacious clean comfortable and inviting especially for London Bathroom was nicely appointed with plenty of space as well Location was outstanding with access to 3 tube stations and within walking distance to some of the best shopping tourist attractions sightseeing and great restaurants in the city I have stayed in London over a dozen times in the last 8 years and this by far was the best four star hotel we have stayed in for the price I cannot comment on the food as we never took advantage of the free breakfast or other meals however the food looked great 
141700,Blakemore Hyde Park, I was on the lower ground floor so essentially my room was in the basement with a single window that opened into a shaft This was not a problem for the purposes of my visit the room was very quiet and dark But under different circumstances e g traveling with my wife I would have been disappointed No big deal but I couldn t turn off the heat to the towel rack in the bathroom which made the bathroom super hot , Great location wonderful bed helpful staff impressive building clean comfortable newly appointed room very quiet excellent value for the price 
141701,Blakemore Hyde Park, When I had checked my bank acct when we got home there was a discrepancy as 2 payments had been taken I rang and spoke to the night manager who was extremely rude and unhelpful, Quiet location Cleanliness Being upgraded as it was a special occasion The check in staff were most helpful
141702,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were always willing to give a hand and it was great that you could eat there in an excellant restaurant after a long day of sightseeing This hotel is an excellant choice and very handy to transport around London 
141703,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, I loved staying in the green suburb of Bayswater Just a short walk from the beautiful Kensington gardens for jogging or walking Close to Paddington station making the travel from Heathrow airport quick and affordable Very close to 3 tube stations which is a quick tube ride to Oxford Street Picadilly Circus and Bond Street for shopping Very close to Portobello Market and Covent Garden Great central but quiet location 
141704,Blakemore Hyde Park, The only criticisms we have are that we would usually expect from a 4 star hotel bottled water in our room while this was not supplied it was not a great inconvenience When we arrived one of the two guest lifts was out of order this remained out of order throughout our 5 night stay we would have expected this to have been dealt with as a priority as the lifts were not large the hotel has 5 floors , The welcome we received at The Blakemore Hyde Park could not have been warmer this welcome was continued throughout our stay by all the Staff we came into contact with The 1st room we were given we arrived a little early for check in so we were offered the 1st room that was already prepared was on the lower floor we prefer a room on one of the higher floors so we asked if we could be moved The receptionist could not have been more helpful She explained that we would have to wait approx an hour but she upgraded us to make up for the inconvenience The Concierge also took our bags and placed them in storage until our room was ready also took our bags to our room for us The food was excellent we never had to wait for service Although it is an additional cost of 5 50 per person to have an English breakfast A Continental breakfast is included in the price it is well worth the additional cost To top our trip off we asked if the hotel would arrange a taxi to take us back to St Pancras we were ferried back to the station in a private car belonging to a company working directly with the hotel so we didn t even have to wait longer than 2 minutes to be on our way 
141705,Blakemore Hyde Park, Two lifts one very small service lift Main lift was out of action for most of our stay causing inconvenience for staff and guests alike , Very good location for what we wanted to do in London Spacious room very good inclusions excellent breakfast Evening flight on day we left allowed us to leave bags until late pm no extra charge and organised taxi to airport 
141706,Blakemore Hyde Park, Very noisy room on the ground floor near the lift constant banging doors vibrations from the underground, Location size of room and furniture fittings
141707,Blakemore Hyde Park, The service the staff hs difficulty in understanding proper english the rooms lack many items weight scale slippers etc Breakfast not that fresh Gym had maintenance nobody had even put a sign post or a notice to inform us of that i went to workout and found it closed then asked the front desk about it Definitely not a 4 star hotel , Nothing nothing at all 
141708,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We loved the location It is in a lovely area of London adjacent to Hyde Park We were able to walk to so many great places including Kensington Palace and the London Museum of Natural History Bus stops and tube stations just around the corner as well as great shopping and restaurants 
141709,Blakemore Hyde Park, Couldn t connect to wifi bit noisy next to lift shaft , Great location pleasant staff lovely ambiance in the terrace bar and quiet and peaceful overall Room upgrade was gratefully received 
141710,Blakemore Hyde Park, That all Employees didn t understood and spoke enough English They even had problems to understand each other So therefore you couldn t really talk to them , The hotel itself and the breakfast
141711,Blakemore Hyde Park, The heating system in the room was difficult to regulate It either was piping hot or freezing cold Setting the exact degrees didn t solve the problem , Large comfortable room The staff at this hotel was very helpful and friendly The respectfully delt with any problem or matter in a professional way Breakfast staff were very tentative 
141712,Blakemore Hyde Park, I had booked a double room for me and my daughter but the room was a bit on the small side The 2 single beds were separated but you could only just get your arm between the 2 beds , The staff were very kind and helpful and the hotel very clean
141713,Blakemore Hyde Park, We had no complaints except for the taxi we booked at the end of our stay which was expensive A, Everything about the hotel was good to very good and we enjoyed our stay We would recommend the hotel to family and friends 
141714,Blakemore Hyde Park, We booked a club room however on arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite on 2nd floor Well the bathroom was so small that when you stepped in door opening out into bedroom you were virtually on the toilet no room to swing a cat When sat on the loo my partners knees touched the door frame There was mould in the tile grout in the shower and the rain forest shower head dripped all night The heating in the room had no thermostat and as a result the radiators were on it was 21 degrees outside the air con didn t kick in to compensate The light on the telephone flashed all night saying there was a message eventually we put it on the floor with a pillow over it as we couldn t stop it even though we cleared the message The pillows on the large bed were lumpy like cotton balls inside The receptionist was very rude on the phone when the following day I queried a payment of 30 taken on my debit card for expenses it wasn t cleared off when I payed the bill as I had been told It was my job to phone the bank to put a stop on it ridiculous , Leaving 
141715,Blakemore Hyde Park, Everything about the hotel and staff we re rude the staff couldn t understand English The bathroom in our room had cracked floor tiles the room needed painting and maintenance work carrying out the mini fridge was empty we asked for it to be filled up and they reception refused Loved London hated the hotel , N A
141716,Blakemore Hyde Park, Given the number of rooms of the hotel the lift was pretty small and would sometimes take a couple of trips before guests are able to come down up to the lobby room , The rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly Location wise it is good A little far from the Paddo Station but still a good location anyhow 
141717,Blakemore Hyde Park, Hotel has terrible soundproofing between the floors You could clearly hear the walking of adults and running thumping of children from the floor above to which the hotel was unable to do anything about And in the absence of parents being nearby we also had to stop children from running up and down the hallway of our floor it s a hotel not a playground This hotel should review or implement a policy for ensuring children behave properly if they wish to also provide a relaxing ambience for other guests Wifi very slow , Location was good 
141718,Blakemore Hyde Park, Rooms need sound proofing as could hear every door open and close along the corridor , Location 5min walk to Hyde parkand 5 min bus journey to Oxford St Staff excellent and hotel clean and cab be recommended 
141719,Blakemore Hyde Park, Walls are very thin Can hear people in next room No dining room breakfast coffee and a roll They charge for anything else , Nice decor Excellent location
141720,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff very friendly and welcoming One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in in London especially for the price we paid Would definitely recommend and hope to return again 
141721,Blakemore Hyde Park, It isn t really bad but is there no way you could have an earlier room ready service found this was inconvenient, The high standard of cleanliness and customer service
141722,Blakemore Hyde Park, The fact that when we arrive at 4pm the room was not ready until 4 45 Went to breakfast arrived back and locked out of room as the room allocation was till 11am Went and explained the room was not ready on arrival and locked out at 11am not acceptable staff renewed card till 2pm t, The hotel was very clean and room was larger than normal for a London hotel 
141723,Blakemore Hyde Park, Nothing, Just 1 nights stay after trip to Berlin Delightful staff spacious room good location for Paddington station Well appointed classic style hotel 
141724,Blakemore Hyde Park, Room was lovely however tea and coffee in room was not enough for two people had no mini bar so had to get water etc for room Staff spoke poor english so made check in complicated Staff didnt make me feel welcome Lift was broke so had to use stairs and was not offered help to carry luggage to room When paying foe the remaining nights upon arrival I had to pay another 90 deposit fpr any extras that I miggt have during my stay I was annoyed that this was not stayed before arrival or when booking Cooked breakfast was poor sausages were hard under cooked scrambled egg For my three night stay I believe the room was the only highlight which is disgraceful for an supposedly up market hotel for three nights I would pay around 250 300 for this hotel at the most way over priced , Bed was comfy and relativ clean Very nice bathroom 
141725,Blakemore Hyde Park, The beds were ok but not as comfortable as we like them I guess we re spoiled As a suggestion the hotel may want to put toppers on the beds , The location was excellent Next to Hyde park and with tube stations close enough We went to pick up our daughter from LAMDA summer school and the staff was very helpful in explaining directions on how to access the tube to get to where we wanted In addition the staff was courteous and welcoming The room was very clean 
141726,Blakemore Hyde Park, the location was t so great the nearest bus walk is 5 minutes walk the bed was uncomfortable and we gave our complaint but they didn t do anything anout it the rooms are too small no appreciation of the special occations like honeymoon , I liked that it s clean staff were nice and helful 
141727,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, Lovely hotel friendly helpful staff rooms were modern and comfortable upgraded to executive room on arrival however disappointed with the view we looked out onto a brick wall 
141728,Blakemore Hyde Park, This hotel is appalling mainly due to the awful reception staff painting and sanding was taking place in all accommodation common areas during our 4 day stay On the last night of our stay toxic adhesive fumes filled the entire hotel the reception managers solution to this was to move us to another room which would have also been inundated with fumes understandably maintenance work needs to be done and there will always be guests in a hotel but the managements total inability to understand what they were asking guests paying full nightly rates to put up with as beyond a joke We checked out and moved to another hotel nearby which was fantastic , The room was fine and clean 
141729,Blakemore Hyde Park, door stop in a silly place why oh why a metal door stop in an unassuming place the poor sole of my right foot and my friends cheap iron it did not heat up well lack of wall mounted full length mirror instead there is one inside the wardrobe door but this is narrow The mattress is way to soft ended up with a bad lower back No biscuits with the tea and coffee and no water in the fridge lack of tv channels unadjustable wall mounted tv position bad wifi connection, I have stayed before and always wanted to return The staff are friendly and requests are catered for I had requested an early check in but the staff said they were unaware they made a priority for us to check in asap which was brilliant I didn t like the pre auth hold of 60 pp for extras such as room service etc as this is not mentioned on booking com upon booking and so I refused to pay as I was already on a budget and the staff accommodated that so perfect Will definitely return 
141730,Blakemore Hyde Park, our upgraded room had windows overlooking trainline or tube that was very obvious in the evening the wi fi was useless and frustrating for a so called 4star hotel, close enough to 2 tube stations comfy bed rain shower
141731,Blakemore Hyde Park, The worst about this hotel and what drove me nuts was internet It was horrible I complained several times and once even it tried to fix the problem and it still did not work properly Traffic was very slow did not work kept kicking you out of wifi I will not be staying in this hotel anymore unless they fix there internet Heating did not work for some reason It did not bother me too much as it was August and it was not too cold yet despite of heavy rains and cooler weather Free breakfast was only continental and pretty basic I had to pay extra to upgrade to a proper english breakfast Mattress was extremely soft so much that I was falling inside Not good especially if you have back problems , I stayed in Club Double room It was of ok size for typical uk hotels It had plenty of amenities such as iroining board tea coffee machine etc I really liked that they had a usb charging portal for iPad iPhone as I forgot my charger at home It was a big relief that I did not have to run around to buy another iphone charger Staff was friendly Bathroom was small but it was ok layout and a spacious shower cabin 
141732,Blakemore Hyde Park, on checkout day housekeeping annoyed me 3 times How hard is it to wait until someone has checked out in order to try and come in to clean I don t understand why they came 3 times on checkout day Also there is absolutely no sound proofing at all Can hear all outside noise can hear every single movement from above so when housekeeping is cleaning the room above you can hear absolutely everything can hear all that happens in the corridor and even the tv of the adjacent room Did not make for a comfortable stay even though the room was nice enough TV was also painful to use Couldn t get it working properly and the remote sensor didn t work while sitting on the bed , staff were very friendly room was nice bed was comfortable and good location Lobby restaurant was nice but stuff were a little bit pushy to try and get us to move from having a drink in the bar to having a meal 
141733,Blakemore Hyde Park, For business travellers there should some drinks in the fridge as they might be arriving and leaving soon no time to go out and find just a bottle of water ,No Positive
141734,Blakemore Hyde Park, The staff was very rude and non cooperative except for one young lady who really tried to help They night we arrived our AC wasn t working and the reply we got from the staff was that you can sleep with your windows open The property manager was extremely rude and lacked any kind of customer service He didn t show any interest in resolving the problems My over all experience was below average and would never recommend it to anyone , The location was good very walkable
141735,Blakemore Hyde Park, When I ordered breakfast when I booked it wasn t made clear that I only paid for continental I had to pay an extra 5 50 on top of the 7 50 I had already paid which I thought was quite expensive It needs to be made more clear when booking , The room was spacious the bed amazingly comfortable and the shower was spacious and very nice to use 
141736,Blakemore Hyde Park, There is nothing I can say not good I had a complain from one room and the team responded quick to swap to a better room , Nice located place very near to bus and underground very suitable for a vacation in London I stayed for 6 nights and we had multiple rooms small stores are close for late dinner and for getting quick snack It is wonderful place
141737,Blakemore Hyde Park, the bed mattress is bad the corridors are very narrow there is great variation in the rooms size no standard wi fi is very slow it can not be a 4 stars hotel , the working staff are very nice friendly and helpful the location is very good
141738,Blakemore Hyde Park, The concierge staff needs to be more clear and be able to understand needs of clients and not just assume Otherwise he was helpful , Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable Lovely rain shower and a clean bathroom Quaint bar with excellent choice of food and drinks Lovely staff at the bar 
141739,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, The rooms were very clean with new facilities and well equipped Very convenient location near to Bayswater and easy access to bus and tube services Great stay 
141740,Blakemore Hyde Park, The triple room number 310 was located over pipes that made a constant noise all night In addition the staff does not know the slogan the customer is always right because although the room was already paid with my husband visa I was charged an extra night deposit and they took almost a month to refund my money Without even respond to emails sent to them , The best the situation 
141741,Blakemore Hyde Park, We found the rooms while well equipped a little too small The Internet access kept dropping out One evening and one morning there was no hot water, The location and the staff were very friendly and helpful
141742,Blakemore Hyde Park,No Negative, We have stayed at other hotels in that area and this was our first experience with the Blackmore Value for money better service and a happy staff will get any future bookings and referrals

141746,Blakemore Hyde Park, No sky sports channels Limited tv channnels , Location is ideal as between 2 tube stations and the bus stops are also conveniently located The staff were very helpful We had a special request and they handled it very effeciently Room service very effecient
141747,Blakemore Hyde Park, Took a few hours for our rooms to be ready, This is an ideal location to explore London Close to tube stations around the corner from Hyde Park Shops and restaurants close by The staff is what made our stay 5 days so great Nigel and the ladies at the bar were very attentive and helpful We will absolutely stay here next trip to London
141748,Blakemore Hyde Park, Minor issue the TV remote did not work the problem was corrected with the minimum of fuss , Positive helpful attitude of all of the staff with whom we had contact 
141749,Blakemore Hyde Park, They took a full payment before arrived without telling me Then still charged me the day I check out When I noticed it and expressed my concerns they told me it was a pre authorised payment check but the money left my bank, Only the location
141750,Blakemore Hyde Park, Very small room tiny shower breakfast which was included was continental not specified before booking before we checked out the housekeeping entered the room and cleaned the beds and we didn t feel comfortable to stay longer that was before 10 and we could check out at 11 , Bed location breakfast choices
