416100,Barcel Sants, No complaints, The rooms are clean tidy and comfortable The only problem which is very minor is that there is no milk for coffee tea in the room This may have something to do with temperature one needs to go to the restaurant for a cup of the same The breakfast is superb all round with great choices to serve all and again very clean and well laid out The staff are really professional in all aspects of the hotel business This is the fifth time we have used the Hotel whilst in Barcelona travelling through to the South 
416101,Barcel Sants, Staff was not paying attention to the clients and some of then were even rude when I checked out on a Saturday morning there was only one person from staff in the welcoming area so the wait was too long, The design
416102,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Great service Breakfast deliver to room was huge Ordered two for two adults and 2 kids in middle school and we had food left over The location was perfect and the staff was beyond helpful Couldn t even tell we were on top of the train station but we easily walked to our train with luggage in the morning 
416103,Barcel Sants, Tiny shower and toilet cubical Not a real rooms too close to the beds and allows no privacy , Great location We were on the 7th floor and therefore had a great view Rooms were clean 
416104,Barcel Sants, Shorter wait time to speak to a receptionist , For travellers coming from the airport this hotel has a fantastic location It is literally above the Barcelo Sants train station which is just 3 stops from El Prat airport Note if you take the train make sure to get some euros in the airport Credit cards were not accepted when I went to buy my ticket It s about a 15 30 minute walk to the train station depending on which terminal you arrive in The ticket is only 4 10 euros so a real value to get to the hotel In some towns the neighbourhood hotels around a train station are not so nice This is not the case with Barcelo Sants train station Perhaps one of the cleanest most chic train stations I ve ever seen There s a small shopping mall and you can find some decent food If your a gourmet do your research on restaurants as most of the restaurants near the train station are tourist traps One was absolutely awful Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait to see the receptionist which is a minor annoyance However there are so many benefits to this hotel Besides the convenient transfer from the airport the hotel uses a fresh room fragrance in the lobby hallways Really nice touch I had a standard room I had luggage for a 2 month stay in Europe and the drawer space is pretty sparse with 2 people don t expect you ll be able to fully unpack The overriding feature of my room was the quietness The soundproofing is amazing The only thing I could occasionally hear people in the hallway but zero outside noise I was on the 6th floor so not sure if the lower floors are as quiet Also there are blackout shades which were fantastic since there is a very large window which takes up most of one wall I was about 24 hours in transit to Barcelona since I had to drive to my airport in Los Angeles I was exhausted and also had jet lag 
416105,Barcel Sants, Longest checkin of my life Although we were served almost immediately it took almost 20 minutes until the receptionist entered all the data of all our 4 family members into the coputer let me sign a data protection form a confirmation form that one of our children was less than 17 years old which reduces tourist tax and had the payment done which was requested for the entire stay immediately at checkin Considering the data protection form there is no way to cancel the acceptance of recieving promotion mails materials immediately you have to do this later on your own initiative at least as I understood Rooms are isolated against the outside traffic noise almost perfectly but absolutely not against the inside noise from the corridors and to some extent from neighbouring rooms 22 Euro for breakfast is much too expensive as good it may be So we kept our hands off , Directly over the Barcelona Sants Central train station Comfortable bedding Nice room design 
416106,Barcel Sants, Price It is outrageously expensive for what one gets The fake future atmosphere, Location Convenient when you arrive in a late flight and have an early train in the morning or vice versa 
416107,Barcel Sants, Sitting at restaurant Not all chairs are comfortable , Space themed hotel in an excellent location if you plan on taking the train to the airport or to cities near Barcelona Great breakfast 
416108,Barcel Sants, We were on our way home from another area of Spain and were attracted to the location of this hotel as we were travelling home by train from Barcelona Sants railway station early the next morning We made a one night booking with the express intention of having dinner in the hotel restaurant to avoid going out to a restaurant the booking website indicated that the hotel had a restaurant We were therefore surprised and disappointed to discover when checking in that the main hotel restaurant did not open for dinner on Sunday evenings Although the meal we had in the Coffee Shop was very acceptable we had not seen any information when booking that warned us that the main restaurant did not open on a Sunday evening The air conditioning in our room was not very effective Even when the thermostat was set to 18 degrees it not seem to cool the room to that temperature and when left running at night seemed to turn itself off at some point during the night This was surprising because in my experience Spanish hotel rooms usually have very effective air conditioning , Very convenient location for the station 
416109,Barcel Sants, They did not sweep the room floor but tidied up the bed and the sink , The location was perfect Very accessible to all places you wanted to see in Barcelona Bed and pillows were really comfortable The shower was great too 
416110,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Everything This hotel was amazing to stay in Great big room with amazing views towards Familia Friendly staff and very relaxed quiet atmosphere Will stay again Loved the bathroom area Big roomy glass shower So quiet even though it is above the train station Massive fireworks display outside the hotel when we stayed was spectacular 
416111,Barcel Sants, Room was cramped possibly because there were 3 of us and an extra bed was brought in The bathroom had no fan Access from street level was hard to find and use due to small elevator , Convenient to the inter city train station and subway Modern decor 
416112,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Ultra modern super clean cool design easy to get from Airport and easy metro ride to most attractions Awesome comfortable beds We loved our stay Mercadona supermarket nearby was a nice bonus 
416113,Barcel Sants, Breakfast is excellent but feels pricey at 22 Euros each We bought coffee and croissant in the station before catching our train , Convenience for trains that were our arrival and departure method plus all forms of transport into town Above all very comfortable and efficient Still love the Kubrick theme 
416114,Barcel Sants,No Negative, We were only there for 1 night and only due to a different hotel losing our passports and a missed flight The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a good nights sleep The location is excellent for train connections around Spain and to the airport 
416115,Barcel Sants, Nothing it was super really super , The hotel is REALLY spacious We had a junior suite which was exceptional The facilities from the Nespresso coffee machine and large quantities of capsules daily through to the hairdryer and Bulgari toiletries were really nice touches The bathroom was exceptional a huge and I do mean huge bath and a shower that could have held a rugby team The room was cleaned throughly with fresh linens and bedding daily all exceptional quality The location of the hotel above the Sants station is ideal if you have a late arrival or early train departure We are quite energetic and walked backwards and forwards into the older part of town its quite safe to do so but be prepared it is quite a long walk there and back You could easily get a taxi or metro if you don t want to walk but if you do you get to see some great restaurants and bars I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again if I arrived by train and would recommend it and the wonderful staff highly 
416116,Barcel Sants, The room was about small , Clean modern with unique decor The hotel is above the main train station in Barcelona Plus it was a wonderful place to stay when traveling through the city by train
416117,Barcel Sants, restourant does open at 0830 pm only even later if you do not insist evening bar would have aspected a more professional one, location nice room
416118,Barcel Sants, Staff was not very nice They could not bring a towel to our room so we had to come pick it up ourselves We had to remind them couple of times to bring hair dryer replacement For the price we were paying I think we should ve got better service , Good location 
416119,Barcel Sants, The one suggestion I would make is that the lighting in the rooms and the hallways between the rooms could be brighter , The location is superb right on top of the main railway and metro station which has decent affordable restaurants particularly Como The hotel is also reasonably close to the airport as well as the port and there s a taxi stand right outside the hotel The staff are professional friendly and helpful they allowed us to check in at 9 30 in the morning although check in time is 2 p m gave us maps to the city and provided correct information on the taxi fare to one of the places we wished to visit The decor is science fiction themed which we found original and interesting and we also liked the rooms which followed the same theme and were clean and neat with big floor length windows 
416120,Barcel Sants, No tourist information in room Two tea cups but only one saucer One set of spa slippers for two General darkness, Excellent bed Very friendly and helpful staff
416121,Barcel Sants, As I arrived late at night the guy on the boarding desk was confused and not helpful at all I explained to him that I will pay for my stay tomorrow in cash but he kept telling me that he need to make a payment through my credit card And he gave me the wrong information about my room he sent me on the E floor where there was no rooms at all so I had to go back again downstairs to clear this out Other staff was great and really helpful , The hotel is great It is on a good location and it is very clean and comfortable 
416122,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The staff was great super helpful in suggesting places to go and making reservations on our behalf The location is excellent and easy to get to from the airport and to major sights around the city Highly recommend 
416123,Barcel Sants, The staff were a bit unhelpful when we first arrived Also the location wasn t the best as you had to get a taxi everywhere , loved the space theme the room was lovely with great views and the room itself was really cool and comfy 
416124,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Our next train was 4 hours after check out time We were able to store our luggage at the motel and we were able to wait in the comfort of the lobby until our train came This made the wait so much easier 
416125,Barcel Sants, Air conditioning and fridge did not work well Poor tea and coffee facilities Very expensive breakfast , Convenience of hotel to trains Helpful staff 
416126,Barcel Sants, The only negative point is that if you wish to extend your stay for a few hours as we did because we had a flight late in the afternoon the cost per hour was a bit high approximately 10 15euros per hour But they provide storage for the luggage for free , We really enjoyed our stay in Barcelo Sants It was right outside the metro station actually above it and very close to the city center The hotel has a special design kind of spacial the room is very comfortable and through the large window the view is amazing In regards to the bed there are no words to describe The staff was very kind wiling to help us 
416127,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was great with bathtub regular shower and a rain shower Right under the hotel run two metro lines the blue and the green line and there is also a train station The proximity of the hotel to places of interest is close e g you need only 10 min on food to Plaza Espanya the museum of Catalunia and the magic fountain 
416128,Barcel Sants, Staff in restaurant were unfriendly and snooty Food was very expensive and chicken was not properly cooked It was more pretentious than welcoming There was a very strong emphasis on business rather than leisure travellers which puts off leisure travellers , Theme of hotel as a spacecraft was great Wonderful views of city The lift direct to the railway station Super rooms especially showers and beds 
416129,Barcel Sants, N A, Friendly staff excellent location well especially if you arrive or leave by train Fine room Didn t try breakfast or any hotel facility because I arrived late and left early but I expect it to be all in good order as it seems a very professionally run place 
416130,Barcel Sants, Separate cubicles for shower and toilet and wash handbasin in room Much prefer a conventional bathroom Did not understand the outer space theme Very dark corridors ,No Positive
416131,Barcel Sants, check in checkouts takes too long breakfast overpriced elevators sounds very rough and slow drainage at shower, access to metro lines L3 L5 takes you whenever you desire air condition room cleanness comfy mattress rain shower luggage storage after check out possible
416132,Barcel Sants, No complaints , Staff very good helpful Did not get all their names But very efficient Ina the customer service desk was well informed went all out to help Will return Location great easily accessible 
416133,Barcel Sants, When we arrived at the hotel shortly after 3pm we were greeted by a very busy reception desk with 4 reception staff serving needing to queue for about 10 minutes to check in , We decided to make several first time visits to Spanish cities travelling by train Barcel Sants Hotel is ideally located with the entrance being just outside Barcelona Sants Railway Station offering excellent links to many Spanish cities and towns with a metro station in the complex with direct and connecting links to various parts of Barcelona Once we had checked in and allocated our room on the top floor 7th floor with an amazing room very space themed and on raising the electric window blind we had an amazing view over the city The room was very clean well soundproofed giving us a good night s sleep in a very comfortable bed with good air conditioning The whole hotel was amazing with a similar space theme like the room Breakfast was good with a good selection of coffees and choice of things to eat The hotel offered a very good free Wi Fi and used it in both the room and the restaurant 
416134,Barcel Sants,No Negative, We wanted to stay close to the train station It was perfect for that It is very central and close to attractions There was a nice place close by for breakfast There was also many restaurants for dinner about a 10 minute walk away 
416135,Barcel Sants, Have to enter hotel from outside of Sants train station , Very convenient to Sants train station for traveling in and out of Barcelona Rooms were quiet very clean with modern decor Stayed on 7th floor and views of city were fabulous Neighborhood around hotel was generally safe and had small local shops restaurants with friendly people Would stay here again 
416136,Barcel Sants, The toilet style was a bit unusual but we got used t it Head shower was amazing , Bed was very comfortable and room was very clean There was a very pleasant ambient smell everywhere 
416137,Barcel Sants, Nothing , Good location above the railway station on the metro taxi bus routes Very comfy beds room facilities Good choices for breakfast from 7 10 30 Central location gives you easy transport choices Our second visit but not our last We were delayed 5 hours by rail arrived at 2 45am to be greeted with a friendly face a reserved room although the hotel was full we were late a kettle for a hot drink before bed Recommended 
416138,Barcel Sants, The view as we was on first floor and the roof could of been a nice balcony That there isn t a pool and it could of been a tiny bit more cheaper , The bed was so comfy didn t wanna get up even with Barcelona right on our doorstep Staff are A and the hotel is stunning and clean 
416139,Barcel Sants,No Negative, I went for a convention within the hotel so for me it was easy access back to the room to refresh The location is fantastic for transportation everywhere The staff are friendly but not everyone speaks English i e when I checked in the lady did not understand even though I had an email from one of the reception staff They had to fetch the person on the email The breakfast is very good with a huge assortment The beds are comfortable The TV only plays one English Channel which is the News 
416140,Barcel Sants, I and my husband stayed for 2 nights in the hotel On the day of check in there was only a pair of slippers in the room I dialled 4 for housekeeping service but the line was diverted to restaurant instead I then called front desk the male staff advised me to go down to get the slippers by myself otherwise I had to wait long time for housekeeping delivery OK I went down to the front desk but there was no stock of slippers I then left my room number to a male staff and returned to my room Waiting for about 45 minutes no housekeeping service came I called the front desk again and it was answered by a female staff The female staff said I gave the wrong room number to them Finally it took about 90 minutes to get the slippers from housekeeping since my first call to front desk , great location just above the train station
416141,Barcel Sants, nothing, Everything clean modern the big shower nice comfortable bed everything was super for the price and best location if you take the train the day after 
416142,Barcel Sants, The room and the hotel itself is very dark since they have a space theme Not a big issue just something to get used to , The room was modern and comfortable and I loved the rain shower We were catching a long distance train the next morning so it was the perfect place to stay as the hotel is right above the station 
416143,Barcel Sants, There is nothing in this hotel that we disliked and we have already recommended it to our friends, We liked everything about this hotel the service in all parts of the hotel was second to none and access to and from the hotel was very good
416144,Barcel Sants, The cosmos style sounded interesting but the quality of the materials and hardware was not good The toilet has a slide door and it does not fully close One morning the room had a strong ammonia smell and later the toilet was not flushing at all They repaired all along the day but they left a damped cloth and took one of our towels Borders and corners of the furniture have several scratches and it does not look good , The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well 
416145,Barcel Sants, The A C in the room was not working on arrival A call to front desk was ignored A second call resulted in a technician visit who said the filter was displaced in the ductwork He readjusted the filter and left Still NO A C working unless you think a slight waft of air is sufficient This may be suitable for Europeans but it is definitely not suitable for North Americans , The hotel was very clean and extremely modern The computer terminals were free and available The location above the railway was convenient 
416146,Barcel Sants, Unfriendly staff If you work in the service industry the expectation is for you to be friendly and hospitable Staff at the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons would never have acted like we were bothering them but then again we chose to stay at this futuristic hotel for convenience , Excellent location above the train station Easy to get too 
416147,Barcel Sants, It was not possible to ensure a double bed room even weeks in advance my boyfriend and i had to sleep in separate beds on the first night of arrival then pack the next day before 12pm again to be moved to the double bed room that got vacated That was a bit inconvenient given we flew in Barcelona very late and got to the hotel only around 1am the previous night Apart from that however a wonderful and convenient stay , Very clean new and comfortable rooms fab views from our 7th floor room Easy to catch a tube to go anywhere as the station is literally 2 min walk downstairs 24 hr reception is very convenient as we flew in at night 
416148,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Returned to this wonderful hotel themed like something out of 2001 A Space Odyssey It s right above the Sants train station where the train from the airport conveniently takes you directly Be advised that due to the futuristic design the bathroom sink is not in a separate room on the other hand the shower room is one of the best of any hotel I ve been 
416149,Barcel Sants, Staff very rude at night not helpful at all Cleaners never replaced toilet rolls had to keep ringing and asking Left dirty mugs cups and plates in room for 2days Had Tea and Coffee but no milk had to buy own , Rooms very mordern great location and very comfy beds 
416150,Barcel Sants, I am not a big fan of bathrooms where the door cannot really be closed just sliding door , The style is great feels like entering a spaceship The room was spacious and clean too The staff were very friendly and helpful 
416151,Barcel Sants, Bad smell in seventh floor corridor but room was OK Poor noise insulation for such a modern refurbished hotel, Location access to public transport Spacious room Huge bed
416152,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The hotel upgraded our booking to a suite one due to our late check in The room was so spacious with excellent modern designs especially for the bathroom The staff was helpful in handling our left luggage 
416153,Barcel Sants, Room rate not cheap considering it was a very last minute booking Hotel was a good way out from the centre of Barcelona Air conditioning was on the blink so room was extremely hot , Booked hotel last minute Hotel great for train station 
416154,Barcel Sants, Low lighting in the shower and toilet area Not enough lighting in the room No windows to open in the room One lift worked only at the entrance of the hotel Gutter smell on the 7th floor for 3 days Even though we complained nothing was changed Shower was blocked the first night, Spacious room Excellent location Right next to the underground easy to access
416155,Barcel Sants, The scenery of the room is not ideal especially at night because the light outside was very shining , I really enjoy the gym because it is very professional 
416156,Barcel Sants, Very crowded there are many conferences in the hotel, Great localization if you look for the base for moving around Catalonia literaly on top od Barcelona Sants train station Good breakfast selection i especially recomend smoothies Star Wars design of the hotel 
416157,Barcel Sants, Not much to do in the area Also the pics of the Hydrogen restaurant shows molecular gastronomy but that was not on display when we did the tasting menu That was disappointing Also some of the ingredients were not available due to the public holiday but there was no reduction in cost , Space theme was lots of fun Housekeeping team were excellent and very efficient 
416158,Barcel Sants, The noise in the hallways and between rooms as I could hear guest walking by my suite I had to call down twice to get security to come up to get the other guest to move into their own suite , Very convient as it was located right above train station and public subway
416159,Barcel Sants, Room was slightly dark on an evening Bathroom could be a bit more private, Easy access from the station Lovely hotel Lots of choice for room service
416160,Barcel Sants, There was a bad smell on the seventh floor where I stayed sewerage smell Almost disappeared on the third day of my stay Room was cleaned daily but the pillows were not comfortable to me Not a lot of English choices on TV Limited number of channels Walls not insulated properly You can easily hear the TV in adjacent rooms No tissues in the room , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was was amazing Especially Ricardo 
416161,Barcel Sants, Door would not automatically lock when shutting the door I would need to check the door more than once to ensure it is locked , The hotel staff were great and location was convenient as all trains buses taxis and car rentals are available within the hotel premises 
416162,Barcel Sants, breakfast is too expensive cleaning can be better the floor in my room was a bit dirty after the cleaning , Good 4 star hotel spacious rooms with all necessary equipment even tea coffee maker is included excellent location and helpful staff
416163,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The hotel is in very good location just above the Sants Rail Station therefore there is good connection to the airport and other important places in Barcelona Fira Barcelona city center Interior is quite new and very futuristic Staff is nice Breakfast buffet offers huge variety of international and Spanish food everything was fresh and tasty Room was spacy bed comfortable 
416164,Barcel Sants, Service in the bar seemed a little slow due to only one barman being on duty while I was there , Travelling to Barcelona by train the location couldn t have been better right above the station This meant that also the Metro station was close at hand making it easy to travel to the city centre The staff were helpful and friendly In the restaurant the food was of excellent quality The rooms were adequately spacious 
416165,Barcel Sants, Dark gloomy aisle foyer though it s part of the theme and there is a certain smell Very very very smal lift going to the station, Since I had several gadgets it is really helpful to have so many electrical sockets It was clean and recently renovated 
416166,Barcel Sants, Silly decor like a space station Corridors so dark they were dangerous Lighting in rooms inadequate , Staff was especially helpful in getting me into a room early 
416167,Barcel Sants, Access from station is via two timy lifts It s a bit of a bottleneck , Immediately above Sants railway station I was arriving and departing Barcelona through Sants 
416168,Barcel Sants, The sound isolation in the hotel is horrible We could barely sleep Waking up at 08 00 every morning due to walking sounds The hotel does not handle over bookings well We had to argue and almost cancel because the room we requested was originally not available Eventually we got the room that we asked for The air conditioning is very weak the hotel lobby is extremely hot and the hotel apparently controls your AC You go to sleep with AC on and wake up with fan mode full of sweat Then you call the reception to find out they manually disabled AC for your room The toilet room is not very private and not isolated You can hear everything going in the toilets as the only thing used for separation is a sliding wooden door , The design of the hotel is cool The hotel is in the same building as a major public transport station with metro close by 
416169,Barcel Sants, A bit pricy Bed too soft, Great location just above the train station and metro Breakfast was very good in the aspect of quality and variety highly recommended 
416170,Barcel Sants, There aren t many shops restaurants around in the area The entrance to the hotel was difficult to find inconspicuous from the back of the train station Didn t find the lobby or bar to be very inviting , Room was comfy and clean Beds extremely comfortable Even though the hotel is located directly over the main train station it was very quiet Service excellent our mini bar wasn t working upon arrival but was exchanged within 5 minutes assistance with online booking of tickets to tourist attractions even got a piece of cake on my bday The hotel is not centrally located but there are excellent connections with all locations via metro subway or train 
416171,Barcel Sants, At first we were shocked that windows do not open but we get used with it We felt like in a spaceship sealed breakfast is expensive try in the station below is good and half price Good restaurants near by , Rooms are clean and neat Bed was comfortable double we slept 3 together with our daughter 7yo and we had enough space No noises as windows do not open No smells of anykind super Sunny room with view high floor as we requested thank you Direct connection metro though not red line which is main Should change 
416172,Barcel Sants, The parking fee was crazy and there were no discount for the hotel guests it was even more expensove than in the city centre Everything else was good , The view through the window was simply amazing The breakfast was really good too 
416173,Barcel Sants, Heat oppressive upon entering room at least 90 F with full sun hitting window and no AC When I called reception who promised to send someone but no one came Later the AC was on but again off in the morning Lighting was poor without shade up , Clean efficient Bed comfortable Quiet 
416174,Barcel Sants, I like the hotel and I usually stay there However there are some very little details to improve Some of the facilities in the room need a little more attention and maintenance , Nice modern design that is not run off the mill The location of the hotel is very good Although it s pretty far from Placa Catalunya it s very easy to get there as the hotel is literally located on a metro station and the main train station of Barcelona Nice breakfast with good and helpful staff 
416175,Barcel Sants,No Negative, I needed a Hotel close to the Barcelona Sans Station so this one was very practical a bit expensive for me since I arrived at 23 pm and left at 7 am and also breakfast was not included The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very good Perfect stay for Business purposes and in the case you need to stay close by the station 
416176,Barcel Sants, Lighting in the corridors was unnecessarily dim was this supposed to be atmospheric Breakfast not included which made the hotel was a bit overpriced , Extremely convenient location for train travellers Excellent multi lingual staff Room had everything you could want including fabulous view of Barcelona Our arrival was much later than planned 11pm so it was great that restaurant was still open 
416177,Barcel Sants, Air con didnt work could ve opened breakfast on morning of marathon earlier 6 instead of 6 30 like other hotels in support of runners , Very comfy bed
416178,Barcel Sants, We hated the toilet with sliding door as smells and noise came in to the bedroom Only one coffee sachet per person No milk No water unless you want to pay 3Euro per bottle, Comfortable beds and clean room
416179,Barcel Sants, Restaurant not open for dinner on Sunday , Very convenient if travelling by train comfortable and clean rooms and a wonderful choice of food for breakfast 
416180,Barcel Sants, The toilet in the room is not very private as door does not close seal properly, Location bearing in mind our onward journey is from Sants train station
416181,Barcel Sants, Some people might find the black and white colour scheme off putting but we found it fun, We flew into Barcelona and left 3 days later by train The station is in the basement of the hotel but train noise is never even noticed The perfect hotel for train users into or out of Bar Our bedroom had the best illumination we have experienced in years In addition to local and international trains the is also a Metro station in the complex and the Hop on Hop off bus stops accross the road
416182,Barcel Sants, Bad isolation Somebody has left his alarm non stop working for 45 min in the room next to mine wasn t able to sleep or cover this sound by music from TV Also smell of the water wasn t good Towels are old hard and gray , Style of the spaceship lovely idea but the true nightmare for geeks as it mix the elements from the Space Odyssey 2001 Star Wars and Star Trek but anyway I was very happy to see R2 D2 in the main entrance Cozy rooms great view friendly crew tasty breakfast comfortable bed very clean 
416183,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Beautiful sci fi decor Had a great time taking photos Very comfortable bed Turned up very late for dinner but it was no problem Great affordable wine with simple meal in the cafe Right above Sants station so perfect for arriving from airport and going on our way by TGV to France 
416184,Barcel Sants, Personally I think the bathroom should be in a separate room but it looks very modern There was tea and coffee facilities but no milk The tv doesn t have any English channels other then the news , Hotel was gorgeous and quirky Staff were very helpful and spoke very good English Room was spacious and clean they have put in a lot of detail with the space theme It s a great location with a short walk to shops and restaurants in all directions Plus plenty of options for transport bus taxi train Would defiantly recommend and would stay again Thank you 
416185,Barcel Sants, Little over priced The door to the toilet shower area should have a secure hook as rooms not always shared by married couples or those in a relationship , Location is perfect Beds very comfortable Very helpful reception desk
416186,Barcel Sants, The open toilet shower concept is a bit odd took me a while to find the entrance , Location right above Sants station recently renovated and clean room and the hotel 
416187,Barcel Sants, Breakfast was a bit pricey, In a good location above the metro and renfe lines rooms were comfortable with all toiletries supplied the electric blinds were great Staff were also very helpful
416188,Barcel Sants, I was charged 60 Euros for the 3rd person but the room was missing amenties for the Rd person such as towels cup and from the 2nd day onwards the toiletries were for 2 persons we brought this to the attention of the front desk but still missing extra cup and tea bags refilled The scent used in the lobby was chokingly repulsive which gave us headaches Not worth paying for a small room with such low customer service , Location
416189,Barcel Sants, I stayed in one of the most basic rooms The bathroom was split between shower and toilet which were very small and had direct access to the room It was perfect for a solo traveler but may have been a concern in terms of privacy if having a companion , I was stuck in Barcelona because of a delayed flight so I had to book something for the same night Room was clean and comfortable The Sci Fi theme carried throughout the hotel made me chuckle the right hint of humor Staff were very polite and helpful The breakfast buffet is pricey but delicious and it has plenty of variety Oh and right on top of Sants train station so awfully convenient if arriving departing from there 
416190,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The central location right above the train station was nice The neighbourhood around the hotel is quiet and quaint and has a very authentic Barcelona feel to it The hotel itself was wonderful and quiet There were parties going on downstairs but you wouldn t know upstairs The space theme was nice and being Christmas there was a floating Christmas tree Hotel rooms were cleaned promptly Both days i came back at 2 p m to drop things off and the rooms were finished The beds are huge and the wifi is excellent enough to stream Netflix 
416191,Barcel Sants, Rooms are a bit small I did not like the spacious look either its an interesting theme but not my cup of tea, Very nice hotel The breakfast was incredible staff was really nice Had a great view over Barcelona and the location is perfect if you are using public transport Its really close to Camp Nou aswell if you happen to go see a Barcelona game 
416192,Barcel Sants, Shocking that we were charged for use of the gym This was never made clear and we were asked to sign a health and safety declaration only They then inserted the charges under our signatures once we had left the gym absolutely disgusting I would never recommend it now as they were underhand and deceptive , Excellent breakfast buffet
416193,Barcel Sants, The bar is honest to say bad Prices are high and cocktails are just ice So sad, The idea and concept of the hotel is amazing The cloth of staff rooms and halls have the same idea what makes this hotel extraordinary We loved that 
416194,Barcel Sants, Only Lifts from Ground floor to Reception Area are unsure shaking sometime jumped and need better maintenance But I m sure Barcel Sants will fix this ASAP and my next review will be without this section , Themed Hotel StarWars CosmicSpace floors with illuminations looks amazing Buffet breakfast with variations of food everyone will find something for himself Communication is awesome Train Bus Metro 1min from Hotel entrance 10min by Metro to Catalunya Cleanness Freshness Amazing Views from apartment West View also wall illuminations in apartment for night time Apartments will all equipment inc ironing small bar tea coffee Toilet and Shower is with door but open space glass with mirror between bathroom bed so very intimate Apartments very quiet I m happy with equipment Also Cosmic Bar with very helpful Staff Overall Hotel Staff is very flexible and very helpful to find any solutions Very happy with accommodation with Barcel Sants Will recommend to friends and I m sure in future will use again Barcel Sants services 
416195,Barcel Sants, We stayed during a Tech Ed Fair and so our room was smaller noisier and twice as expensive than our previous stay 9 days before The receptionist was in traing and failed to activate our room key and made no apology , The beds were the best that we slept in during our 10 days in Spain The sheets were lovely and crisp compliments to your laundry staff and housemaids 
416196,Barcel Sants, the space station theme was a bit weird and sort of outdated Need a better business center with printers had trouble using computers in crowded noisy lobby then sending things to front desk to be printed Breakfast option was overpriced but good cafes right next door in train station, bed was extremely comfortable rooms were very quiet huge shower was terrific Location next to the train station with access to metro was great 
416197,Barcel Sants, 1 The staffs in the breakfast buffet always try to take away the plates of dishes making a lot of noises although we were still eating They never ask us if we finish eating and they made much noise when taking away the dishes So we couldn t have relaxed breakfast during our stay 2 The room was much more tinny than expected and the bath space was just separated with a thin wall , Location
416198,Barcel Sants, although very handy for trains metro and the tour bus it was a good walk to the main attractions , The bed was very comfy the room exceptionally clean and the whole ambiance of the hotel was lovely The staff were extremely friendly and helpful we didn t book breakfast but there was plenty of places to eat around the area at reasonable prices 
416199,Barcel Sants, more colors in design, the hotel is up of Barcelona Sants with very good bundle with airport train 25 min Catalunya place Rambla metro plaza de Espagnia Poble espagnol walking 20min Clean and quiet room This is the second time when I booked this hotel 
416200,Barcel Sants, The Star Wars Theme was rather laboured and tired and the social spaces such as the bar were not relaxing but rather austere, Location excellent for railway and also metro access to city
416201,Barcel Sants,No Negative, bed was too comfy view of the room was awesome location was really good lots of restaurants around close to beautiful historical place Really cool building like a space ship 
416202,Barcel Sants, Maybe the entrance not direct connection to the hall from station and could be better if entry either from station or the front entrance in Sants, Premises were great
416203,Barcel Sants, Lower price will be way much better , Great location if you travel by train it just at the 2nd floor of the train station That can let you take early train while in Spain you need to take more time to check in than in France for security check and ticket check like you take a flight 
416204,Barcel Sants,No Negative, To my surprise the Hotel is SciFi themed I was greeted by R2D2 when entering the hotel and the they paid attention to details Even the fonts used for all the signage is close to the ones used in the Star Wars movies The hallways look like right out of a starship and even the elevator doors are painted like the doors in the movie The hotel is conveniently located on top of the Sants railway station so right from the hotel one has access to all public transport Also a huge taxi waiting area is located there so it is never a problem to pick up a taxi And all taxi drivers know the hotel and therefore are able to take you there The staff are friendly helpful and speak good english 
416205,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Super comfy beds with loads of pillows we did not want to get out of them Super convenient directly on top of train station with no train noise whatsoever Super nice breakfast selection the best we found in Spain 
416206,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The bed was amazing was huge and very comfy Room was just perfect very modern and staff were very friendly Would definitely return to this hotel Was a perfect location right above the train station made it very easy to explore the city 
416207,Barcel Sants, Nothing , Friendly helpful staff as well in the bar Nice modern and clean room great view with all you need The space station interior in the lobby and floors are a nice idea Perfect situation just upstairs central train station Good relation price quality I like this house 
416208,Barcel Sants, Difficult to find when going out from the train station Twin bed instead of the requested double bed, Easy access to the airport free upgrade very nice and spacious room
416209,Barcel Sants, Heavy metal rock concert in nearby park started at 2200 and finished at 0230 We needed to get up at 0530 to catch early train Very little sleep Will never visit Barcelona again Please pass on this information to Barcelona Tourist Board Unbelievable ,No Positive
416210,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Its a very pratcical Hotel as the location is perfect if yoy are planning to depart early to the airport or cach a train as it is on top of the Estacio Sants Central Station It s very near to plaza Espanya and the best is that the rooms are super cool as they are inspired on star wars not that I am a big fan but its very cool the designing The best of all the price that you pay for it Higlhy recommended 
416211,Barcel Sants, The rooms were very small and very economical they didnt have service to take our luggages to the rooms we found few bugs on our bed which was very disturbing , The location was good and close to the sightseeing attractions yet you have to use taxi or metro which we didn t although the hotel was located above the metro station and the train it was clean overall 
416212,Barcel Sants, Didn t like the Bathroom no privacy Toilet quite claustrophobic door does not close all the way , Very clean helpful staff Good breakfast Very comfortable bed Nice Restaurants a few minutes from the Hotel Hotel restaurant closed on Sunday night Lovely city view from our room 
416213,Barcel Sants, Price of water in mini bar Having to ask each night for milk to go with coffee It was never voluntarily left by chamber maids, Modernity Excellent location for public transport Friendly and welcoming reception staff Cleanliness of hotel
416214,Barcel Sants, Nothing, The location that it s above the train station makes everything super easy You can take the metro the train to go to Figueres and be at the airport in about 20min The stuff and the interior design 
416215,Barcel Sants, The hotel entrance is a little weird and a little bit hard to find for the first time , Breakfast was awesome It was really easy to get from the airport to the hotel and back The room view was great 
416216,Barcel Sants, The walls are quite thin and not sound proof You can hear the other person talking in the hall The only minus point I can think of , The hotel was spacious and nice designed The bed is huge king size and super soft Cleaning is perfect The staff is very friendly as they helped me immediately with some ad hoc questions and troubles 
416217,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Hotel is literally located above the metro train station 20min direct train from the airport Lovely neighbour with local atmosphere close by Nice big rooms 
416218,Barcel Sants, in my room just outside the glass widow there is a large barren terrace, Room wash basin area and toilet design are very very good Felt very rich and comfortable 
416219,Barcel Sants, breakfast not included and the restaurant wasn t available or open in the evening for supper , location it was convenient for our short stay and connecting trains
416220,Barcel Sants, The noise was unbelievable Doors walls and floors were far from soundproof We could hear everyone down the corridor the surrounding rooms and the rooms above and below That was a big disappointment The bar at the hotel is a joke and though this hotel chain is famous for their design this time it was just inconvenient than anything else You needed extra effort to close the bathroom door the lightning was very poor and the closet was good only if you were carrying a t shirt and a pair of socks , Location was very convenient as its just above the metro and train station The surrounding area not that great though 
416221,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Clean Comfy Right above a metro station Airport 20 mins metro City centre 5 mins metro FCB stadium 15 minutes walk Percect for exploring as a couple 
416222,Barcel Sants, Lobby could have been a little cleaner Space displays need to be updated , The location was great right above the train station We took the train from the airport for 4 euros each stayed 2 nights and t h end took the high speed Renfre AVE to Madrid from rhetoric same place 
416223,Barcel Sants, Difficult to find hotel entrance if you are on foot i e don t arrive by car No directions to hotel in Barcelona Sants station Payment for accommodation is obligatory at check in this is not obvious in booking confirmation Restaurant is too brightly has uncomfortable seats Restaurant menu is extensive but unimaginative and relatively expensive Hotel Torre s opp is a much better option washbasin and mirror are open plan and are not enclosed in a bathroom area, Above Barcelona Sants mainline station so handy for train travellers Breakfast is extensive but not good value for money when compared with local cafes
416224,Barcel Sants, 1 The room was filled with a sort of old unpleasant perfume smell or some sort of very powerful soap smell to the point that my clothes were smelling the same after leaving the hotel 2 The overall feel of the place was not so pleasant Dark not well illuminated that gives you a claustrophobic hostile feeling 3 The hotel was so busy that you could find long queues at the reception desk 4 Hotel did not have tissue boxes in the room and when i asked for one they said sorry they we re out 5 Hotel room did not have spoons in the room how am I supposed to mix my coffee in the morning , Wide range of breakfast buffet items 
416225,Barcel Sants, Very expensive both restaurant and bar 20euros for a burger They charged me for mini bar that I have not used after expalnations I got the money back , The bed was extra large and the room very confortable 
416226,Barcel Sants, If toilet used room can get a bit smelly perhaps fan or more secluded toilet area , Fantastic bed and very very clean The staff were exceptional All in all this hotel was fabulous and I look forward to returning
416227,Barcel Sants, Like the most hotels in Barcelona they have awful ventilation system They even don t have separate ventilation hole in bathroom , Really good staff and location perfect breakfast 
416228,Barcel Sants, My room wasn t serviced and the receptionist was unfriendly and not interested I didn t get the whole Space theme it seemed rather strange , The location for the mainline train station and metro The room was really spacious and very stylish 
416229,Barcel Sants, The whole building smells like the chemicals they use for cleaning I think It s not possible to open a window guests are completely dependent of the airconditioning system for fresh air Furthermore I disliked the separation between the toilet shower area and the sinks making use of only a poor wooden sliding door that doesn t close that well also It doesn t suit my preference for a minimum level of privacy when I am making use of the toilet or shower , New clean building Nice staff Convenient location as it s on top of next to a train metro and bus station and a OK location between city center and airport 
416230,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The location is a very good We had a lot trips from Barcelona to another Spanish city and UT was realy suit Moreover the rooms are very quiet because all trains go underground The hotel and rooms are very comfortable and clean It has a very interesting design like as spaceship and perfect overview Good cosmetics and a lot It was changed everyday 
416231,Barcel Sants, The breakfast was very expensive The toilet and shower were not in a separate bathroom but instead was only a door away from the bedroom , Breakfast was super tasty The bed was amazing The view was great 
416232,Barcel Sants, the only down side there was no ventilation in WC room , the location of the hotel was amazing from the airport a straight train to the station located below the hotel a wide and delicious range of fresh breakfast the Cleanliness and daily changed bed sheets buses and metro just below helpful staff not to forget the great space hotel theme it was a pleasant stay
416233,Barcel Sants, The design of having the tolit in like a closet was so bad They do not provide free water at the room olso no tissue or napkin , They have good resturant Breakfast was good with many options 
416234,Barcel Sants, Should be made clearer that gym isn t part of the hotel even though it s in same building 15 for a single training session Would have grudges paying 5 to be honest , Bed was really comfy staff very friendly location excellent and maid service was exceptional 
416235,Barcel Sants, The tea and coffee supplies in room were a bit deficient no milk for tea and only decaf coffee green tea Very minor inconvenience , Very spacious and immaculate room excellent location right above train and metro Perfect location to explore all areas of Barcelona and escape the crowds at the end of the day 
416236,Barcel Sants, The tallest stuff at the reception desk is not nice and service is really bad The facilities are very poor in the room and the light in the room is so weak ,No Positive
416237,Barcel Sants, Expensive for what it is I would recommend asking for a room that isn t near the elevators my room was and it was quite noisy , Really comfy bed clean room excellent location especially for travellers
416238,Barcel Sants, I could hear noises from next rooms water in the minibar should be complimentary try to book upfloor rooms to avoid noises from the street, Perfect location above Barcelona sants station with direct access from the stations There are many signs at the station directing to the hotel especially near mc cafe Excellent breakfast with a lot of varieties Helpful staff Direct access to the airport with train to terminal 2 Trip with one stop with metro to terminal 1 In front of the hop on hop off touristic bus stop Great panorama view from rooms relaxing beds Wifi was great in the room Check in an out just took a minute although I arrived at 10 30 am We loved the decorations of the hotel Journey to the airport takes about 30 min by train Trains to airport runs every 30 min At the reception there is a screen showing the time table of the trains as shown in sants station so u won t waste a lot of time waiting for trains at the station
416239,Barcel Sants,No Negative, After staying in some old apartments it was so refreshing to stay in a room that was so clean white and bright It is not the area you would stay to explore Barcelona I would suggest Gothic area but just passing through to catch train next day was great 
416240,Barcel Sants, Unfortunately on the night we stayed there was a carnival of some sorts going on outside the hotel with very very loud music which went on until 3 in the morning We had to leave the hotel at 5am so this wasn t great there were sins up telling us this on arrival but I wish the hotel had mentioned this when we booked, Location was great for us as we needed to catch a train to Paris very early in the morning 
416241,Barcel Sants, The windows could not be opened and the air conditioning was set from the central system We could not set the temperature to our comfort zone which was upsetting because I was sick at the time and in the room was 18 degrees If we started the air conditioning it was freezing if we turned it off then airless ,No Positive
416242,Barcel Sants, 1 The air conditioning has issues was malfunctioning some nights and is not reaching target temperature 2 I had issues with payment from my cards due to issues with the limit they got me an exception to pay for 1 night and then they were firm and left a notice in reception not to go up to the room unless all nights are paid in an unpleasant way Was not happy with the situation overall yet the hotel is good on other aspects , The hotel was very very close to Barcelo Sants station which is connected to everything in BCN the hotel is also clean and smells well a good hotel on the overall 
416243,Barcel Sants,No Negative, You couldn t hear any noises from the corridor or outside They had 2 3 layers of curtains so if you like to sleep in dark you re going to love it Breakfast options were really good I liked that they had 6 different types of milk there incl lactose free milk Metro and trains are just 2min walk away 
416244,Barcel Sants, The staff at reception could be friendly and smile It felt like we were inconvenient for being there , Great location can get the train to and from the airport and easy to get around the city Beds were very comfortable 
416245,Barcel Sants, The toilet door in our room couldn t be closed because the way it was designed , This hotel is located in a very interesting place and it is top of central railway station in Barcelona You can have all kind of transport from this hotel Metro Railway Bus Taxi and sightseeing bus Hotel has been designed with a concept of out of world and it made little bit different from other hotels Hotel room was very clean and we had a good rest after visiting the city during the day We had breakfast during our stay and we really enjoyed it 
416246,Barcel Sants, Bedsheets weren t changed during our stay My wife and I couldn t sleep together as the beds were 2 singles put together which if you move towards the middle you fall through The hotel s space theme is not really practical or does not fit the Barcelona atmosphere , Large lobby and metro right under 
416247,Barcel Sants, bedsheets weren t changed during the whole trip The space theme of the hotel is kind of ridiculous after you see it the first time I see no point or benefit as a guest to feel like I m walking into a spaceship or whatever it is , Location of the hotel is right on top of the metro but you need a metro to get anywhere 
416248,Barcel Sants, A bit loud our neighbors were a strange mix of people shouting crazily on phone for hours singing like mad or smoking in the room hotel is non smoking Well all people have their own idiosyncrasies , It s an interesting space themed hotel with orbit inspired rooms Nice view from the hotel windows Warm welcome and a pleasant surprise Prosecco chocolate strawberries for our wedding anniversary 
416249,Barcel Sants, How difficult it was to find the entrance it s not obvious there are NO SIGNPOSTS in the station just a small 1 once you are on top of the station entrance, King size bed extra pillows handy bed table surreal outer space decor
416250,Barcel Sants, The lighting was awful Hopeless if you wanted to read and quite impossible to read in bed Lighting was gimmicky with a light which came on if you walked past it It would not stay on if you wanted it to and it came on unexpectedly a couple of times for no reason during the night , The bed was excellent with a really firm mattress good pillows and really nice quality bed linen 
416251,Barcel Sants, There is not any welcome atomosphere in this hotel They won t explain you anything but you ask them There is not any support for your luggage and room service are very poor Although there are some nice pepole but my experince as a gest was not satisfactory , The rooms and bed are big and clean The location is close to metro station and make the transportation very easy 
416252,Barcel Sants, Room designs could have been better Catalunya is a better location for sight seeing i could mot go to gym as they charge eur15 per day , Location is just above Sants subway and airport connector railways Rent a car companies and city rooftop sight seeing buses are all right below the hotel All rooms have open view of the city with no obstructions which is refreshi g 
416253,Barcel Sants, The hotel has space travel as its theme No doubt this sounded like a great idea when it was originally put to the board as a concept but in reality they ve gone a bit too far and it s ended up spoiling what would otherwise be quite a nice station hotel Corridors are so dark you can hardly see the room numbers and the lighting in the rooms is not much better A triumph of style over substance We arrived mid evening and hoped to eat at the hotel There were two fed up looking women in the cafeteria and no one in the much advertised a la carte restaurant The one waiter on duty seemed completely unfamiliar with the concept of a la carte and only offered a very poor menu of the day Not at all what I d expect from a four star hotel restaurant offering particularly one with a supposed reputation for food We ended up taking a metro a couple of stops and eating elsewhere , Well located if you re taking a train from Sants station Also good for getting to metro buses taxis etc 
416254,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The room was clean spacious and modern The hotel was above the main metro station so it was easy to get around the city and see the sites Would definitely stay there again 
416255,Barcel Sants, Could hear a lot of noise from outside music we playing until 3 am The floors are very thin and also noise outside the rooms is very loud Would only recommend as a business hotel or one night stop over Access to main attractions is a long walk or taxi , Immaculate and very clean Beautiful rooms
416256,Barcel Sants, Second visit of two very poor maintenance with irritating faults Need to buck their ideas up Noisy funfair until 3 am in spite of double glazing , Good value and convenient for what it is 
416257,Barcel Sants, Everything was fine, Nice comfortabe bed good shower The breakfast was great glad we did not pre pay with our booking as they had a special discounted price when we got there 
416258,Barcel Sants, Although an excellent location directly above Barcelona Central Station the hotel is a little tricky to find There is just a very small sign above a corridor that then leads you to the lift to take you up to the hotel Once you know where you are going no probs and can highly recommend this hotel , Ultra modern hotel Rooms of an exceptional standard in terms of both cleanliness and facilities 
416259,Barcel Sants, Staff in reception was a bit cold also part of space theme Having sinks in a room rather then in bathroom does not provide enough privacy , Nice hotel space theme Excellent breakfast expensive but it was included in our room rate Close to Barcelona Sants station This was important to us as we ve stayed for only one night between two flights Bed is very comfortable 
416260,Barcel Sants, Very noisy through the night Joint rooms Unsafe ugly back door entrance if you walk there the main entrance is on first floor designed for cars Not so courteous at the reception , Very convenient location right next to the main train station A feeling of luxury in the room huge TV with programs in different languages Easy to find signs in the train station 
416261,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Liked the design of the hotel futuristic and spacious and very comfortable Staff were very friendly and welcoming at reception restaurant and bar 
416262,Barcel Sants, A few more British tv channels, Very good food very comfortable bed great location for the train and tourists bus Local bars excellent value for money Very quiet hotel considerering it s above a train station and bus station would use again 
416263,Barcel Sants, Very noisy there is a festival held around this property and they made a lot of noise till 4 a m which caused very bad sleeping experience also the sound proof very weak in the room and you can hear people at corridors and foot steps above your room , In Major transport station which is nconvenience to travel to other state or within city
416264,Barcel Sants, It is a fairly large hotel which lacks a personal touch The only hotel staff we saw during the stay was the staff at the reception and our only interaction was during checkin and checkout The entrance to the hotel at the ground floor was very challenging to find It is almost like a hole in the wall There was some work going on and there were no signs Also there was only one operational lift to the lobby floor from the ground floor where the station is located It was really small and seemed like a fair amount of wait every time Not at all adequate for a hotel this size This was not an issue however from the lobby to higher floors , The room was nicely done up although the layout was slightly unconventional and needed some getting used to The location worked out really well for us 
416265,Barcel Sants, Evening food offering was very poor Staff are helpful and efficient but not warm or friendly Descriptions of rooms online can be a bit a bit confusing , The rooms are amazing And a fantastic location The breakfast is brilliant too The family interconnecting rooms are perfect for families with small children 
416266,Barcel Sants, Liked it all , Great location and lovely clean hotel Staff were helpful and cheerful and the room was excellent Great for catching my early morning train as it is right above the station Left my room and 5 minutes later was queuing for my train 
416267,Barcel Sants, Lifts from station to hotel very tired and slow, Great breakfast very good soundproofing air conditioning etc And the staff are friendlier than they used to be 
416268,Barcel Sants, Price When we booked room was 358 00 for 2nights This increased mainly due to weak pound but paid just over 400 00 for 2 nights, Location adjacent room for kids space theme large beds amenities view we were on 6th floor 
416269,Barcel Sants, Hotel entrance is a construction site Room AC set at 18C centrally controlled The Iron in room is old and does not work The ironing board in room broke damaging my leg Staff attitude treat the place as bed factory not an hotel, Location
416270,Barcel Sants, Transparent Wall in the restroom bathroom hence if you turn on the light in the Night in the restroom there is light in the bedroom aus well Very disturbing ,No Positive
416271,Barcel Sants, The restaurant was barely fair and way too expensive The computer terminals are out in the open for all to see what you are doing there are only 3 of them and they appeared to have a virus and worked very poorly with inadequate Internet connection The hallways are far too dark Be careful in the train station I was robbed of my passport and credit cards , The facilities are excellent and the staff extremely helpful Also it is directly above the Sants train station from where I left for France 
416272,Barcel Sants,No Negative, We stayed in this hotel because of it s location to the railway station and found it to be excellent It was next to the hop on hop off bus stop and we didn t have any trouble getting around The hotel room was spacious and well appointed 
416273,Barcel Sants, Construction work onsite So called Family room actually 2 twin double rooms with connecting door and double the price , Excellent Location just above the Train Station
416274,Barcel Sants, As explained by many reviewers the sliding toilet door and missing toilet brush One hint on that topic the public toilets in level E restaurant level have proper doors that close with flour and ceiling Would be nice if breakfast personnel tells you at late arrival that they will start emptying the buffet at 10 30 , Breakfast was 15 euros big buffet where nothing was missing Scrambled and boiled eggs we avoided both strange texture and taste but you can order omlets or fried eggs made on the spot As we had breakfast late never before 9 there was hardly any queuing for coffee Location is good quiet but central not for walking but to take public transport Beds are very comfortable 
416275,Barcel Sants, Minor points Gym not open on both visits Nothing explaining Stanley Kubrick connection Mushrooms at breakfast disappointing very minor point , The whole place is a talking point Comfy beds spacious clean stylish different fabulous breakfast
416276,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Beautiful modern hotel Staff professional and courteous one of the ladies helped me getting in touch with the local airline in order to resolve some issues with my tickets 
416277,Barcel Sants, I didn t get the space theme a bit odd it s not Houston , Location at the station Good sized rooms Huge windows with views of the city Problem with the bathroom basin fixed instantly the plug was stuck no big deal FREE safe 
416278,Barcel Sants, It s mean that gym not included in the price Drinks at bar very expensive beautifully presented by helpful staff but price not justified really , Design of the hotel is great Rooms super clean Breakfast amazing attention to detail Reception staff super helpful You can walk to some amazing local restaurants for tapas and you are right in the tourist bus route 
416279,Barcel Sants, Rooms could do with sound proofing you could hear noise from neighbouring rooms A bit far out from main areas for tourists Although the hotel is above the metro station its not within walking distance of the beach or las rambla in the heat of july, Design of the room was very good helpful staff 
416280,Barcel Sants, Very expensive in relation to what it offers Contrary to advertisement not even coffee tea making facilities in the room Practically no separation between bedroom and bathroom Staff seems to be disinterested in clients needs Generally very disappointing,No Positive
416281,Barcel Sants, The electricity seemed to go a few times on my second night day which was annoying and the construction going on outside doesn t look the best , The air conditioning was good and that floor where you get the ice is like an oasis in the desert 
416282,Barcel Sants, Access was through a temporary building site The overhead shower invariably flooded the bathroom floor Finally I really couldn t see the point of the space craft theme pervading the decor of the hotel It seemed a somewhat infantile notion in a business environment or maybe I m just a grumpy old man , Clean and the air conditioning worked well Excellent access to rail and metro 
416283,Barcel Sants, Walls very thin you could hear much noise We stayed here 11 years ago and the futuristic d cor was dated then Nothing has changed Hallways dark We had an overflowing shower and instead of moving us to another room they insisted on doing repair and clean up until after 11pm All in all it s location that prompted us to use this hotel But there are other hotels in same locale that we will probably use next time Staff overall was caring and efficient , Location to train subway and taxis 
416284,Barcel Sants, Lights are very dim even if you turn on every lamp in the apartment its still pretty dark i know the theme of the hotel is space but its not practical , Bed was very comfortable and the apartment was clean View of the city from the 6th floor was amazing Location is perfect enterance to the train station is just below the hotel 
416285,Barcel Sants, The hotel theme is too fancy for my business travel Room is small Fitness center not free, Great location Accomodating staff Room is new
416286,Barcel Sants, When arrived the room wasn t ready and they asked me how I want it when in my reservation already have the information of 3 beds and the confirmation that will done before my arriving in at 21 00 p m also told to the hotel in my reservation but in the end I got a 1 double bed and a extra bed that I need to wait for them to bring the linen in there was put outside down and we need to rearrange the bed The toilet door didn t close properly I couldn t turn off the air conditioner , Very near of the train station and clean 
416287,Barcel Sants, Small room No fan in the toilet Sink in the room Very tight You have to pay for a bottle of water shower door not closing well , Close to metro Clean property Fair value for the price paid Comfy bed 
416288,Barcel Sants, The toilet is devided to two parts I don not like it , The room is big and the location is nice Tour bus just 2 minutes walking and you can go to popular places 
416289,Barcel Sants, A lot of thought appears to have gone into the aesthetics of the room but very little into practicality There is no wardrobe no drawers no shelves not even one coat hook So nowhere at all to put clothes or anything you just have to keep it all in your suitcase For a hotel of this price this is bad , Best possible location for Sants Station if you need to catch a very early train or if you are arriving very late above the station so you don t even need to cross any road Amusing space theme Great wifi Comfortable bed Powerful and spacious shower Everything clean and functional 
416290,Barcel Sants, Entrance after 23 00 not available from main street need to use a car park entrance located on the 1st floor in other side of the building Poor soundproofing you can hear noises from neighboring rooms and corridor , Perfect location Very clean clean every day Comfortable Friendly staff Safe include price What is include Wi Fi Download 5Mbps Upload 5Mbps Air condition 16 32 degrees C Iron and ironing board TV 42 Bed size 180cm 6ft Tea and cofee set Fridge with splits Starting set shower gel soap conditioner razor blade slippers towels toothpaste The hotel is located above nearly all possible transports The metro L3 and L5 300m 4min walking very good railway from airport R2N is located under the hotel You can use railway express to drive to PortAventura Water Park or Roller Coaster Park free railway when you buy ticket to any of the park in the till Option to leave luggage in deposit room and collect it later 
416291,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The bed was huge and very comfortable even if we could not find each other in the same bed Location was perfect for public transport It takes around 5 min from hotel to la rambla street by metro Hotel space concept was very funny breakfast was enough and it was 15 for one person 
416292,Barcel Sants, Due to what looked like renovation work the bottom entrance of the hotel was hidden apart from a couple of signs to point you in the right direction we actually didn t find this until we done a complete 360 of the hotel So could definitely do with a few more signs around the station and outside also there s two sets of stairs that you can take up to the hotel these would have been better if they d been signposted too as we only noticed when we came out the main entrance Obviously this could be something that the hotel could improve but I wouldn t let that stop you from staying here , The whole hotel was absolutely amazing to look at and our room was just fantastic with a great view and especially the extra large bed Location was perfect and it was so easy to get around with the metro and trains being literally underneath The city tour bus was only a 5 minute walk too which was perfect to take in the sights Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone I knew coming to Barcelona and next time I come visit will be staying here again 
416293,Barcel Sants, The bed and pillows were too soft for me and some attention to house keeping slipped for example we only received one large towel on one room fresh up , The novelty space theme and the great location above Barcelona Sants station made travel around the city easy There are also a good selection of restaurants close by 
416294,Barcel Sants, hard to find the entrance to the hotel as it s above Sants station and there aren t any signs, great hotel once you get inside comfortable room and very modern
416295,Barcel Sants, Rooms were not soundproof INA and JUAN tried their best to compensate us for this inconvenience Location is bit far from the city center however easy access to metro station, Design cleanliness comfort and staff especially guest relations manager INA and JUAN receptionist who did their best to make sure that we are happy
416296,Barcel Sants, i thought this would be a more contemporary atmosphere and not as much of a hokey Star Trek theme park Walls are very thin and people arriving all times of night Very much a train station type of hotel , convenient for car drop off most staff were professional 
416297,Barcel Sants, Gym to open earlier than 10am and or later Clearer signalling in the station , Travelling by train with an overnight at Sants this is the perfect hotel Good food comfortable beds Thought provoking Kubrick design 
416298,Barcel Sants, Could offer breakfast in the same price , nice location over the main bus train station nice design and style comfortable room good wifi helpful stuff
416299,Barcel Sants, Hard to say what could be improved on Have had better breakfast for much cheaper tariff , Spotless Beautiful rooms comfortable beds Hotel experience was excellent I stayed with my 7 year old and she was enchanted with the whole place said it was like staying on a spaceship Perfect location for the station We had travelled by train from Scotland so it was a welcome relief to find a hotel right on the doorstep Breakfast was ok would definately return Not cheap but worth it Wifi good 
416300,Barcel Sants, Made to wait half an hour at check in as they messed up They made a second mistake and were made to pay for breakfast at checkout although we didn t have it as we left early Rude and incompetent staff , Nothing much
416301,Barcel Sants, I arrived at 1130am and there was no where in the hotel serving food after a 13 hour flight the last thing I wanted to do was go out for food , Booked it specifically because of it being close to the train station 
416302,Barcel Sants, Really noisy We could hear the people walking in the room above us and we could hear other guests in the hallway from inside our room At 3am we were woken by a screaming baby from another room This should never happen in a hotel Walls are paper thin and cheap like the toilet paper they use From far off this hotel seems great but when you look closer they have missed quite a few little things that make a hotel worth the price tag Sound proofing being the biggest The rooms are set out weird like a studio This is ok if you are a single person but if your a couple You risk waking your partner to use the bathroom as the lighting is all in one room Location is great for the train station but a bit far for most other attractions I would recommend this hotel if you re passing through Barcelona for a night otherwise I would go further into the city centre, Close to the train station Reasonably comfortable nice large bed Great block out blinds we kept sleeping in they were so good Good wifi 
416303,Barcel Sants, Trendy design made hotel difficult to negotiate and irritating at best , Accessibility to urban and suburban locations was great Exploring the city easy 
416304,Barcel Sants, Don t be last down to breakfast Things run out and are not replaced Too busy getting ready for their conference guests , Very comfy beds Good breakfast selection if not down unless your one of the last down 
416305,Barcel Sants, That on that price breakfast was not included and the alternative to buy one was too expensive , location is excellent to visit different locations of the city with transportation not by foot Room was clean and spacious bed was comfortable and the shower was perfect after a long day to the streets 
416306,Barcel Sants, No breakfast and the access from the street was not the best but I assume the reparations were part of the train station , Absolutely great Although breakfast was not included apparently none is including it nowadays the room the facilities the corridor wow and the people were really great I loved its theme related to Kubrick s Odyssey 
416307,Barcel Sants, The house keeping was subpar at best Our bed skirt was filthy and it took two complaints to get it changed Our pillows had blood on them and the sheets had pubs on them The bathroom smelled like pee and the floor was not swept when we checked in , The hotel was very hip and the location was amazing right above the metro and main train station for high speed transit All the staff spoke english 
416308,Barcel Sants,No Negative, A space themed hotel with egg chairs on each floor and jumpsuit wearing staff Clean modern hotel rooms with plenty of space and a decent view Accessible from the train and central for days of exploring if you are taking metro 
416309,Barcel Sants, The only thing I had mixed feelings about was the breakfast buffet it had a great selection but was a little pricey , I loved that this was right above the sants estacio train station and near a main bus hub so literally we could go anywhere The hotel staff was friendly and the hotel was very tidy and clean I also really liked the space theme 
416310,Barcel Sants, The bathroom is open so there is not real intimacy I also asked for a late check out and at the beginning the personnel was not helpful I had to call 3 time and then they told me that the late checkout was until 2 pm with an extra charge of 15 eur , That the hotel is over the train station so access to the train or metro is really easu
416311,Barcel Sants, Nothing, Ideal location for our early morning train journey and an afternoon exploring Barcelona check in staff welcoming room 414 very nice clean good view and lovely and quiet would never have known one was above a major railway station at 15 Euros breakfast was good value Greeting in reception from R2D2 was the icing on the cake 
416312,Barcel Sants, The hallways need better lighting , We chose this hotel for comfort and it delivered The bed was great as were the air conditioning and shower It was a real respite from the heat And the concierge Ina was amazing Made reservations printed tickets helped us figure out transportation This hotel was great 
416313,Barcel Sants, Only one English speaking channel on TV Our shower went from cold to scorching and was hard to get right We had tea coffee but no milk available when requested , Very funky hotel styled on a space station On top of the station so brilliant to get to and from Rooms were modern clean and with a HUGE bed Not the cheapest of places to stay but get a top floor room and just enjoy the amazing view from the floor to ceiling windows Also no noise from outside Great stay 
416314,Barcel Sants, Walls seem a bit thin but not a major issue , Location was great as its just above the main train station so easy to get to town ie La Rambla 15 mins and out of Barca too There are shops n cafes for breakfast at the train station itself Room was very clean reasonably spacious and seems new with very comfy beds 
416315,Barcel Sants, Was told on checkin that the room had twin beds as requested but it was a king so we had to change rooms , The decor is a Space theme very futuristic Hotel is situated directly above the main Railway station so it is convenient to transport 
416316,Barcel Sants, Check in took a little bit longer than we hoped which may have been due to the timing of our arrival which was several hours late because of train delays , Streamlined modern design made this a fun and relaxing stay The beds were super comfortable due to the linen choice assortment of pillows and mattress Remote controlled room darkening shades were also a hit 
416317,Barcel Sants, Breakfast the usual help yourself cooked or buffet style very clean and tidy looked good but most of the items were only slightly warm at best cold scrambled egg not my choice It will look better when front renovations are finished now June 2016, Straight off the Paris train to bedroom in 15 minutes flat Very efficient staff very quiet rooms and English speaking a bonus Thank you Barcelona doesn t seem to wake up early on a Saturday 
416318,Barcel Sants, Unfortunately despite the hotel s very good location the access path is far from being ideal Depending on where you re coming from you either have to walk all the way across the rail station if you arrive during the day in order to access the only hotel entrance on all 4 sides of the rail station or go all the way around the entire building and it s a pretty massive building you have to circumnavigate if you arrive after midnight when the rail station is closed Alternatively you have to go up some stairs located on one of the corners of the station hotel building and then walk across a car rental parking lot to access the ground level entrance of the hotel Pavement and renovation works undertaken outside the station hotel building don t really help with the ease of access to the hotel entrance either Apart from that there s no other major con worth mentioning although they could be a little more generous with their instant coffee and sugar sachets Also why is there NO milk for the coffee in the room , Very good location with excellent transport links the hotel is literally sitting on top of the Sants rail loads of local regional and national links and metro 2 lines station The space theme is really nice and it gives the hotel a nice twist for those who would like to experience more than just a standard modern contemporary hotel room The rooms are very clean comfortable and reasonably spacious with a very nice and big walk in shower cabin and cool electrical window blinds you can completely shut down Bonus points for the little extras in the room IKEA style breakfast tables shaving vanity toothbrush packs and the ice cube dispensers on the 1st and 2nd floors excellent to have at hand especially during the summer months If you re lucky enough you may even get a room with some very nice views of the city I was able to spot the tip of Sagrada Familia even though my room was on the 2nd floor Would definitely stay here again 
416319,Barcel Sants, Quite far away from beaches , There is a metro station just under the hotel so it is very easy to reach everywhere in the city Very nice decoration A good choice to stay in Barcelona 
416320,Barcel Sants, Location is not a negative but should be mentioned If you are in Barcelona on business it is great for commuting however if you are on leisure it is at least a 50 minute walk to the main tourist areas but as mentioned earlier transport links are great , Smart sophisticated astronomical design in the hotel excellent links to the metro hotel is on top of Sants Estaci metro station and to tour buses Nice tapas restaurants On Passeig de Sant Antoni close by Well decorated rooms nicely designed with big windows Great friendly staff as well with excellent cleaners 
416321,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful Location great as hotel is literally above the railway station Hop on hop off tour buses out front Very trendy decor space age theme 
416322,Barcel Sants, Nothing , Great location on top of the railway station for an overnight travel stop on the way down to Malaga Close enough to restaurants the red bus tour Very modern hotel 
416323,Barcel Sants, I would say that breakfasts are too expensive 20 Euro I would pay 10 but not 20 The site staff gave us bill for city tax twice the second time we had to explain that we had already paid Friends of ours that were in the same hotel had the same problem so be attentive to bills Generally the hotel is very good , The situation is really great Rooms are very clean and nice 
416324,Barcel Sants, The hotel is rather far from the main touristic attractions 3 km of walking you better use subway to get to Rambla The negative side of the thematic design is darkness in elevator s hall corridors and your bathroom Shower hose in our room was leaking and the toilet brush was lost somewhere in the outer space The room door was not soundproof and we heard all the noises from the corridor The hotel was busy on a weekend we stayed there and a check in procedure was rather long In the midnight the alarm clock suddenly woke us up and it was not easy to switch it off , Design is unusual and inspired by outer space travelling The staff has a bit futuristic uniform There are some places where you could take thematic photos with an austronaut at a spaceship captain s bridge The bed was so large that my wife sometimes was not able to find me there The outdoor noise did not get into the room You would not hear any sound from the railway station located under the hotel The location is perfect if you plan to use trains 
416325,Barcel Sants, Some staff had attitude but others were super helpful Would be very inconvenient for any visitors with eyesight problems the corridors are dark , Very convenient if travelling by train and easy to get to from the airport take the local train not the metro Expensive breakfast but still worth it Points for daring to style the hotel in the 2001 space odyssey style even if it s cheesy at times 
416326,Barcel Sants, Cafe lighting nitrogen and hydrogen far too bright Room very compact for two sharers Shower overflowed if you used the big overhead shower , Loved the sci fi theme of the Hotel Kettle in the room Convenient on top of Sants station handy for airport and two metro lines Minimalist modern decor Comfortable beds Electric light block blinds Cute bed reading lights that flip back into panel Wi fi good 
416327,Barcel Sants, Long walk to access the green rail line to La Rambla Not much room to get dressed after showering unless you stood on the wet floor of the long shower Staff had some difficulty finding our booking , Staff were very accommodating Room was spacious with plenty of mirrors Washbasins were separate from shower and toilet Was convenient for early morning TGV departure 
416328,Barcel Sants, The cost of breakfast was a bit high , Hotel was right there in the railway station The room s were spacious very clean and a great view of the City Would be very happy to stay there again 
416329,Barcel Sants, No breakfast, The hotel is designed as astronomic style the bed is awesome location is perfect as well although it is above the central station We can take Metro to where we want 
416330,Barcel Sants, Not ideally situated for sightseeing No milk provided for tea coffee making in room despite several requests Eventually had to get a glass of milk from the bar which we kept in the minibar An attempt was made to charge me for this on checkout which I politely declined to do , Good access 
416331,Barcel Sants, 20 minutes to check in I think they lost my booking God awful room allocated no windows ideal for 3 travelling youngsters sadly I am no longer one Buffett restaurant closed because of convention The Bistro menu very poor selection no impressed at all, perfect stop over location to break the journey
416332,Barcel Sants, No pool and need to pay for the gym usage , Amazing hotel friendly and efficient staff Very clean and centrally located right on top of the main train station on Barcelona Wifi is super fast and there s a massive round table as communal work space Highly recommend this hotel 
416333,Barcel Sants, The wifi connection is not really strong in room Sometimes it is down and I need to go outside the room first or to lobby to get it connected The staff when we checked in is quite friendly However they didn t give consistent information For example on the day we arrived we are given the room with poor wifi connection and they said it is because a problem in server so that they gave us new room but I think the connection is still poor Also when I asked for an electric kettle in the room one said that it is not complimentary for my room type and I need to pay 5 euro per day and on the other day the other staff said that they can give it to my room , The location of hotel is near the station so it is very convinient to use public transport such as tram metro etc The room design is also very modern and comfortable enough 
416334,Barcel Sants, Nothing at all , Great location to start a day in Barcelona lovely staff hotel is immaculate and well themed The rooms and corridors are incredibly modern and stylish and the beds area so comfortable Second time here and won t be our last 
416335,Barcel Sants, Staff is unpolite entrance is kind of spooky narrow dark and uninviting , Nice original interiour great location on the train station close to Montjuic
416336,Barcel Sants, There is some building work going on in front of the hotel so one has to go out of the station and onto the street to actually get into the hotel The signage could be improved , Perfect location for us as we arrived by train from Girona been to the Costa Brava and left on the fast train to Paris fairly early the next morning Loved the decor very new and stylish Our room was lovely Very quiet and extremely comfortable Tea and coffee making facilities as well as an interesting view of all the taxis Had a quick breakie downstairs in the train station There are several places to get food plus a pharmacy a McDonald s etc Wifi great Would highly rate this hotel if you are travelling by train 
416337,Barcel Sants, The bathroom design, Modern hotel nice and clean rooms Rooms well equipted Great breakfast Just above the metro and train station easy and quick connection to city center no noise or interference recommended 
416338,Barcel Sants, The location is very convenient for catching a train less so for seeing Barcelona s sights , If you ve ever fantasized about the Pan Am spaceflight towards the beginning of 2001 A Space Odyssey you ll love the d cor And the location can t be beat if you need to catch an early morning train from Sants 
416339,Barcel Sants, You re in the middle of everything so bring your plugs if you want to good night sleep At least before 3 AM I didn t mind , Location was excellent and the clothes washer made all the difference 
416340,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Everything of high quality and an excellent location for travellers using Barcelona Sants station with the entrance very near to the station main exit Very smart and breakfast good quality and plentiful 
416341,Barcel Sants, It is in a really ugly area of town , Comfortable and clean hotel with easy access to public transportation including shuttle train to the airport Clean modern basic 
416342,Barcel Sants, Desk staff were a little slow and some not up to giving much information regarding situation of hotel and things we were looking for , The bedroom was excellent with loads of space and set out very differently with all accessories well appointed Best shower in a hotel room ever 
416343,Barcel Sants, Cost of mini bar my wife had a a little tube of pringles and was charged 6 50 saw them later in a local shop for 1 20, Loved the huge bed very comfortable especially the pillows fabulous rain shower Very convenient for the airport with the hotel being right above the station also it was great for getting the metro for the same reason no problem recommending this hotel though the space theme might not be for everyone or maybe the layout of the bathroom
416344,Barcel Sants, There are nothing around if you want to just eat something near the hotel or take a stroll , The rooms are clean and well maintained As the hotel is above the train station it is easy to take metro to get to city center 
416345,Barcel Sants, Directional signage to the hotel from the rail concourse area needs increasing Took almost half an hour to find you , Check my trip advisor contribution under raze88
416346,Barcel Sants, There were no signs within the Barcelona Sants station for the Barcelo Hotel The entrance door was outside at the rear of the station to the right of the building Access to reception was down an unmanned corridor on the ground floor which led to a lift lobby area Being a solo female traveller and arriving late in the evening there were a few people hanging around the outside and it felt a bit unsafe and uninviting for a hotel of this rating , The room was very well laid out and comfortable The location of the hotel was ideal as I was travelling on the train from Malaga and after a long journey having the hotel above the station was very welcoming There was no noise from the trains within the rooms The space theme was really interesting in the main areas if not a little stark but I liked it and it was a shame I only had 1 night there Breakfast was buffet style with a good range of food and an opportunity to have your eggs cooked personally by one of the chefs any way you wanted them The staff were friendly and helpful and I called room service and they responded very quickly despite the hotel being very full 
416347,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Location is wonderful Direct line to airport Multiple buses and trains subways on site Two hop on buses on site Direct line to Sagrada Familia We were 6th floor at end of floor quiet All new Helpful staff Restaurant on site and restaurants in the railway subway station directly below 
416348,Barcel Sants, There could be better signposting from the station or alternative the hotel needs to provide some directions, Great location in you are coming into Barcelona by train at night and departing the following morning since it sits on top of the station Very modern and quite funky with fantastic super king size bed which was very comfortable
416349,Barcel Sants, No easily detectable signs directing guests from the station to the hotel entrance on the rear side of the station building Hotel reception on 1st floor upstairs from ground floor stairs and two lifts available one not working when I was there Do plan sufficient time to get to trains , This hotel sits on top of the train station Barcelona Sants Very practical Room on 4th floor spacious nice clean Breakfast from 07 00h onwards only Check your train schedule 
416350,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Great position on top of train station metro and bus station sigle route from airport etc If you are in Barcelona for sightseeing everything is reachable from this spot via public transport this is the best hotel for you Clean and renovated rooms in spaceship style GREAT breakfast buffet Good working wifi 
416351,Barcel Sants, Bad Access to the trains will be better when construction is completed 95 done now , Convenient to Trains Metro taxis and buses with fabulous views Outer space interior with excellent multilingual staff Far out 
416352,Barcel Sants, The dark corridor made it quite difficult to find room numbers The walls were quite thin so could hear people in the rooms to the side above The frosted glass pane sliding door of bathroom door had a tendancy to bounce back when it reached the end and being able to see in albeit through frosted glass while someone was sat on the loo was a bit weird Only news channels in English despite having multiple other languages across the channels , Bed and pillows very comfy Loved the bed trays the electronic blinds to create full black out The quirky style of the hotel and theming ran throughout every aspect Free wifi available 
416353,Barcel Sants, Did not have a room booked for the second room on our booking Staff on check in were poor , Position rooms cleanliness Staff were generally excellent see negative below 
416354,Barcel Sants, The first lift into the lobby was alarming , The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows Air conditioning was centrally controlled and you could completely block out the light Hotel has a quirky space theme Lovely shower Very handy to the metro UK Aussie travellers should note that kettle is not standard in Spain 
416355,Barcel Sants, Pillows Not the most comfortable pillows , You can t ask for a better location Very central Although it is located next to a busy rail station and a bus depot it is surprisingly quiet once you enter the hotel area It cost us less than 20 euros to arrive at the hotel from the cruise terminal by taxi And from the hotel to the airport it was an easy train ride and very very cheap fare 
416356,Barcel Sants, Booking com failed to explain that the hotel was right above the Sants Station but instead gave us an address on the opposite side of the station , The bed was nice and firm and the location above the main rail station made access to all points a rapid experience 
416357,Barcel Sants, The noise of people letting the heavy doors slam Also we were awakened by loud construction noise at 1 30 in the morning , The location for having to take an early morning train 
416358,Barcel Sants, Breakfast quite expensive , Excellent location next to Barcelona Sants train station and a short metro ride to the main sights A clean and smart hotel 
416359,Barcel Sants,No Negative, I found the Mac computers available to be difficult to use After 3 days I asked staff to help me The member really didn t want to take more than a minute and problems again The night we were to check out I asked Ursula for help She was wonderful and stayed 30 minutes after her shift ended to help us Other staff was very friendly 
416360,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The staff of the hotel is sooooo rude service is very bad My booking was non refundable i paid full amount but they were unable to find my booking i waited very long n no one offer me chair or water very bad experience
416361,Barcel Sants, The breakfast Since we have continental breakfast and at 20 per person for the buffet we opted to have breakfast at the bar It cost 10 5 euros per person for a tiny glass of orange juice a cup of coffe and a toast that we had to reorder because it wasn t well toasted we couldn t feel but being ripped , If you travel by train the hotel is located on top of the station It was our case 
416362,Barcel Sants, location not really near anything interesting unless you count the trainstation price of breakfast ridiculous there is no way people eat eur 20 worth of breakfast in spain most people stick to a cafe con leche and a tostada in the average bar that costs eur 4, very good beds modern room
416363,Barcel Sants, The long wait to check in We also booked a suite on booking com and they checked us in into a one bedroom for disabled people After realizing this we had to wait again to bring up this issue We were later given the suite but it all seemed like a very long process , The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable We had a great view of the city and it a huge plus to be right above the train station and taxi stand 
416364,Barcel Sants, The checkin waiting time took 30 minutes For over 2 hours there was a constant queue of 20 people or so waiting for checkin Not a good experience when you just arrive tired from a long trip Need to improve that ,No Positive
416365,Barcel Sants,No Negative, We stayed in this hotel on our outward journey and also on our return This time we also took breakfast and it was extremely good and a wide choice of food was available
416366,Barcel Sants, We faced an issue with our booking its was saying in booking com its paid but the hotel did not receive that , Every thing was very good staff location Really loved it 
416367,Barcel Sants, Hotel decor designed by a 11 year old child who thinks of nothing but space travel Extremely noisy open plan lobby First entry to the room and foundthe heating was like a furnace No visible instructions on how to lower the window blinds Noise outside the hotel very little Inside very noisy Access from station via a goods lift , Only the access to the train staion
416368,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The hotel was very convenient for onward train travel from Barcelona Sants station and the space theme was quirky The room was comfortable and very spacious and we would consider this hotel again if travelling in the Barcelona area of Spain
416369,Barcel Sants, 1 A male receptionist staff who was on duty on 7 4 2016 during my check out time between 12 45pm and 1 pm was lack of courtesy rude and lack of customer service skills He raised his voice and said that the check out time was 12pm instead of 1 pm I replied to him by saying that I ve already informed his nightshift male colleague that I need a late check out time before 1 pm instead The night shift male staff assured me that I could check out before 1 pm and it was free of charge , The location is really good Easy access to metro RENFE Trains Taxis buses and close to Tourist Bus tour The room is spacious and comfortable For Muslims tourists there are 2 Halal Restaurants Apamea and Ali Kebabish located within the radius of 700m from the hotel facing the Avenida Tarragona 
416370,Barcel Sants, The location was good because its accessible to everything, I liked the cleanliness of the hotel and its contents but I didn t like the food I b thought it was very expensive and no much variety for different cultures
416371,Barcel Sants, Rather detached vibe from staff which I suppose is to be expected in a huge hotel in the centre of the city Very busy awkward access to the hotel from street level up down , Wonderful design v comfortable rooms layout v good Loved the space theme Beds v comfortable Loooved the electronic blinds Drinks in Bar reasonably priced unlike breakfast as addition to room cost central location excellent V comfortable Good night s sleep 
416372,Barcel Sants, Staf was cold and i think owerwork , Realy good hotel The room was new stylish and very beautifull Wiew from window was fantastic we have seen all Barcelona Breakfast was very very tasty and a large range of different food 
416373,Barcel Sants, Separation between toilet shower and sink lack of privacy if not travelling with your partner , Location for the Nou Camp plus weekend attractions Breakfast offered a varied choice and nice space 
416374,Barcel Sants, Could have done with better sound insulation between the rooms the guest next door clip clopped round his her room for a good half hour at 2 in the morning , Good view of the Barcelona skyline from the picture window Interesting theme space travel although I can imagine it might get a bit irritating after a while you don t have a key you have a boarding pass and so on Next to no noise from the station below 
416375,Barcel Sants, It is not possible to open the window in the room and air conditioning did t work properly in result there was no fresh air in the room and it was hard to breath , The hotel is located on the train station so it was very convenient for us to travel Design of the hotel is very interesting rooms are very clean spacious and well designed 
416376,Barcel Sants, Lifts were a bit jittery Space theme is more accurately 70s retro style If you are staying in Barcelona for leisure then you need to be closer to the street called La Rambla I stayed at a hotel much closer in during my proper stay in Barcelona I only stayed at this hotel after coming from Madrid and to catch the next day train connection to Paris , It is at the train station convenient for travelling Breakfast very excellent I thought check in was very good too I would stay here again 
416377,Barcel Sants, Nice hotel finding the entrance could be better signposted , Service in reception very good they all spoke many langues whilst the food choice for breakfast was very good it could have been kept to a warmer temperature I did witness the restaurant manager with no gloves manhandle all the smoothies via the straw to mix them up The rooms were very nice and clean with comfortable beds not much privacy if you were two friends sharing as out of shower into the room same with the toilet with a sliding door so you must like the person your sharing with Very good shower and excellent water pressure We would stay here again in a great location 
416378,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Everything was fabulous such az design and location and 100 staff they were very polite and helpful They did not forget my note that It was my honeymoon and they surprised us with a great bottle of champagne they gave us a perfect room in 7th floor and it had an amazing view of barcelona 
416379,Barcel Sants, Service for repairs was not satisfactory as the AC was malfunctioning and no one was sent to check For the price breakfast could have been included , The comfort hot water supply of toileteries By European hospitality standards the facilities were fantastic 
416380,Barcel Sants, Nothing, The bed was enormous and room extremely well equipped The vies from room were fabulous The spaceship decor was amazing All staff were polite courteous and spoke excellent English
416381,Barcel Sants, Dreadful rooms shower is completely open toilet door is pathetic these are not rooms for those who value a little privacy Also hotel design must have been created by a frustrated astronaut lighting is terrible staff surly, Great location and large bed
416382,Barcel Sants, The layout of the open bathroom The rather dark corridors, The beds were very comfy and the king size was perfect for us and our 1 year old The location was excellent just above sants station very convenient if you are taking an early morning train the next day 
416383,Barcel Sants, You can hear pretty much everything outside your door but the other guests were very quiet so I slept fine , The breakfast was extensive and of a good quality The room was clean and large and I forgot some items so the complimentary toiletries were a life saver Comfortable bed
416384,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Right above the station so the location is incredibly convenient I thought the space theme sounded silly when reading the hotel description but upon arriving found it to actually be really neat The hotel is one of the nicest I ve stayed at 
416385,Barcel Sants, Noisy doors when clicking shut got woken up by the noise when other guests got back to their room in the early hours That s the only thing I can fault , Smooth check in helpful staff comfortable room free Wi Fi Great hotel 
416386,Barcel Sants, Nothing that comes to mind , The location of the hotel was perfect especially as we had an early train the next morning The choice of the space theme was quite novel though they really didn t take it far enough however that s a personal opinion since I m in the space industry Everything worked and we were able to catch a train on time the next morning 
416387,Barcel Sants, The hotel entrance does it no favours In fact it would put most people off from staying there Pity the hotel and staff deserve better, The room was modern clean and very comfortable
416388,Barcel Sants, Brilliant white paint and bright white light overwhelming to an aging tired traveller The duvet was thick stiff and too hot We had a rucksack stolen from reception having left our bags only a metre behind where we were standing at the desk be warned , Travelling through Barcelona so it s very convenient In a different mood I might have enjoyed the space age effects 
416389,Barcel Sants, Nothing to explain , Perfect location if travelling by train or plane 5 mins walk to the train and 20 mins by train to the airport Love the space theme Breakfast Air conditioner and shower are REALLY good Facilities are new and clean They helped send postcards which was very helpful
416390,Barcel Sants, I was told to go to the bar for a meal but they sent me to the restaurant The whole of the floor was full of people running around playing games shouting and blowing whistles It was noisier than a football match I wasn t surprised that the open plan restaurant was deserted I went to the railway station for a meal , Very nice room everything you would need and very clean Really comfortable bed I was catching a train the following day so it was very convenient 
416391,Barcel Sants, The rooms are geared toward a space travel theme It wasn t to my taste , This hotel was recommended by a friend and I understand why It was lovely comfortable and convenient to everything in Barcelona The staff was gracious and helpful I would stay there again if I had to return to Barcelona 
416392,Barcel Sants,No Negative, very good lovation anf very comfortable room it looks like W hotel design good reception staff kind and helpful location just several steps from railway station it takes 2 mins from hotel to take tratin to airport terminal 2 in case of terminal 1 you should takr free shutle bus
416393,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Super cool for this aging couple Perfect if you are transiting Barcelona There are a number of great little tapas places within a short walk across the way to help alleviate the big city corporate vibe as needed 
416394,Barcel Sants, In our last day they didn t clean the room to well leaving the dirty glasses and coffee mugs and not replacing them with clean ones They also didn t refill the mini bar and fridge The same happend in our friends room next door Also the bathroom is an open space with the room and isn t a intimate space , The view from the 6th floor Good wi fi signal
416395,Barcel Sants, No slippers no hair conditioner small room dripping water all over the toilet no free drinking water didn t put us in a top preferred floor with a nice view , Spacious lobby and the design of the hotel accessible metro and train station very nice buffet breakfast but quite expensive
416396,Barcel Sants, Maintenance was a bit spotty and the space theme was dated Staff was too busy to be bothered When we checked in we asked about the airport train and were given specific information including departure times and track number That information turned out to be incorrect resulting in an adventure on the wrong train not what you want when trying to catch a plane We made it anyway , We stayed overnight for convenience while traveling It was indeed convenient The bed was wonderfully comfortable 
416397,Barcel Sants, The bathroom and the toilet do not have a ventilation fan I had to pay extra 15Euros to use the Gym in the hotel , The location is on top of the subway and you have good access to everywhere through subway
416398,Barcel Sants, It was a double room and I noticed only one pair of slippers in the room and after I went to the reception to ask for a second pair as we were two persons the man at the reception said the second pair was not complimentary and that I had to pay 5 euros ,No Positive
416399,Barcel Sants, Nothing, Staff are all very nice I have sent few email enquiry all reply promptly besides The location is excellent just next to the Sants station Your must choice for the stay if you need to take any rail The space theme of the hotel adds mark quite interesting and never been to a hotel like this With reasonable price comfort bed perfect location nice staffs I would highly recommended One more thing my check in time should be 2 3 However I arrived a bit earlier and that s so nice the reception let me enter the room originally I planned to luggage storage in hotel first perfectly I can enter the room Thank you so much 
416400,Barcel Sants, Totally not like a 4 star as advertised Does not even have a concierge to help us with luggages Lift was small Room was small Not recommended for family unless u need to catch a train early morning like us Definitely not worth the price we paid , Just the location because we needed to catch a train early morning 
416401,Barcel Sants, Rooms in this hotel completely without soundproof your will hear everything around I can t sleep at all No ventilation in rooms and there are impossible to open window Strongly don t recommend Max 3 Fitness is not included you have to pay 15 day, Nice view from room staff
416402,Barcel Sants, Room was very hot on arrival Had to be very insistent before anything was done Breakfast was good but room was like a works canteen as crowded with people from one company and had to share table with large group Long queues for coffee Bit naf charging to use gym , Good location right on top of station so convenient for travel Comfortable beds One member of staff very helpful when she overheard me complaining about hot room 27 degrees Nothing would have been done if she hadn t intervened 
416403,Barcel Sants, Though its the central station the hotel was not located centrally where most of the nice things are , Right above Barca Sants station which was very convenient because we had a late arrival at the airport 
416404,Barcel Sants, I never seemed to find any of its restaurants open though I think there are three restaurants It was the strangest thing , I loved this wacky hotel It really does feel like you stepped into 2001 A Space Odyssey I believe that s intentional Staff is great the location unbeatable and the room clean and interesting The price was great 
416405,Barcel Sants, There were no coffee making facilities in our room although others had them and we never did get them despite a couple requests Communication in English was sometimes difficult at the front desk although this is an international business hotel , Very nice modern room with an excellent rain head shower in bathroom The hotel is located directly above the Sants train station and has a great view of the city 
416406,Barcel Sants, Breakfast expensive Elevators are small, Very modern design and unique character Location inside main train station Direct to the airport and connect all to city Staff very helpful
416407,Barcel Sants, The first room allocated was not as clean as usual and was very hot 28C as measured by one of the maintenance staff and not adjustable We were moved to a second room which was better but again it was not possible to regulate the air conditioning and we spent a miserable almost sleepless night because it was so hot We had to sleep with the door open to get some cool air in We reported this to reception on checkout , The staff were very accommodating and tried very hard to help us particularly Sergey from reception 
416408,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Great location for getting around as is above Sants Station Easy train from to the airport and access to the metro to get around town Geat room very comfortable 
416409,Barcel Sants, Hotel staff are not very much customer oriented They operate behind the counter more or less like an office clerk over his paperwork , Good location and easy connection to almost anywhere you want to go Very clean Reasonable room rates 
416410,Barcel Sants, Dining facilities adequate but expensive and seemed to be little used we breakfasted in the train station Front desk often busy checking guests in out which made it hard to get information , Convenient location if travelling by train Room was comfortable clean and well equipped Great top floor view over plaza Pleasant 20 minute walk to the Montjuic area that includes the Fundacio Joan Miro the Museu National d Art de Catelunia both very worthwhile 
416411,Barcel Sants, Nothing , I travel for business and even though this was vacation Barcelo Sants provided me everything I needed including fast WiFi and very easy access to the city via the Metro and to trains and airport via taxi I also like designer botique hotels when I travel and this one qualifies which makes the stay even more fun 
416412,Barcel Sants, nothing, perfect location for getting about immaculate well serviced rooms excellent quiet rooms with comfortable beds love the well designed additions and fridge tea and coffee making facilities were very welcome 
416413,Barcel Sants, The dark corridors The lack of cheerful reception staff The dirty nug in our room The 36hrs it took to fix the t v Remote , The access for the station we were travelling to and from The comfortable beds 
416414,Barcel Sants, It was too hot in the room and yet pleasant in foyer, Airport train AVE train Metro all in beneath the hotel which made it extremely convenient Hop on tourist bus at door step
416415,Barcel Sants, The check in process took a time and the member of staff answering the phone whilst dealing with us In fact staff answering phone seemed to take priority whilst customers for in a queue , The location of the hotel made it easier for us to travel through Barcelona
416416,Barcel Sants, too dark hallways leading to the rooms elevators too small quite expensive , located above the sanz train and metro station very practical if travelling by train to and from the city great breakfast buffet overall decent comfort
416417,Barcel Sants, Washbasin in the room price cafe , Unusual design location is close to railway station Plaza de Espa a 
416418,Barcel Sants, The corridor to the room was very dark I have a Sight problem so felt very vunerable as I could not see people in the corridor very well Scarey , Ease of access for th train station
416419,Barcel Sants, The restaurant is pricey and only had veal and some sort of sea food available both of which I wouldn t eat, The location was ideal for rail travel the bedroom was spacious with fantastic views 
416420,Barcel Sants, Nothing bad as we did not purchase but the cost of food and drink was high We balked at 15 euros for a gin and tonic and went to a bar across the road instead , The location was perfect for us as we arrived at the station did not want to carry heavy cases around then used the excellent metro system on the doorstep to get around and then left a couple of days later on the airport train Easy the room was great comfortable with floor to ceiling windows and views of the city Better than tv Good eating options locally 
416421,Barcel Sants, Nothing much to do around this area , The location is just above the train and metro station So you have easy access to everywhere So if you want to travel anywhere within Barcelona or anywhere within Europe this is the right place to stay The city is not too far by the metro about 4 5 stops away Staff was friendly and cooperative Rooms were also comfortable Wifi was fast and had good connection 
416422,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Great location for transport Railway station and subway are right downstairs with lift access and bus station is just outside Helpful staff and comfortable room in good condition 
416423,Barcel Sants, Check in incredibly slow and I felt staff made absolutely no attempt to be welcoming I know they are probably very under staffed but a smile and an I hope you enjoy your stay would have made a lot of difference , Very convenient for railway station
416424,Barcel Sants, Just a bit expensive but overall worth it , It was right above the metro and train station so although it wasn t in city central it was really easy to get to places The interior design was very modern and funky and the cleanliness was top notch
416425,Barcel Sants, AC was not working but they fixed it This is a dead area at night So don t expect any activities there if you plan to stay at the hotel at night You have to pay for gym and other facilities Very few English speaking TV channels , Very friendly and helpful staff Modern Clean A Hop on Hop Off bus stop is just in front of the hotel Easy access to public transportation through bus metro station and even train if needed The station is just below the hotel Tip Buy the T 10 ticket for using all public transportation in Barcelona from the metro station below the hotel 
416426,Barcel Sants, Food services breakfast lunch diner are somewhat expensive and not very creative Better going to restaurants just outside the hotel , Great location just above the Barna Sants train station Easy commute to go in and out of Barcelona with publlic transport The hotel is very clean Staff very professional and the decoration is perfect for Sci Fi fans 
416427,Barcel Sants, It is far from Las Ramblas but subway makes it possible Mass transit usage is necessary here , Hotel is right at the train station allowing for easy transit from airport and around Barcelona Subway access is right there as well Cabbies out front make it easy to catch one for dropoff at cruise port Higher floors have great view of Barcelona 
416428,Barcel Sants, The staff member who checked us in was quite unfriendly barely made eye contact took a phone call whilst dealing with us didn t smile when i asked a question about the bill rather than answer the question he just pointed at the bill and i was none the wiser a very poor first impression of the hotel Bathroom layout was fine for a couple but may have been awkward for friends or colleagues sharing as bathroom door didn t completely close shower opens into room and neither of them lock , The hotel is in an excellent location for airport trains and metro It is modern clean and comfortable 
416429,Barcel Sants, Nothing in particular other than cold food at breakfast buffet , Very convenient for Barcelona Sants train station which means ideal choice for those arriving in Barcelona by train from Paris for example which we did Also excellent location to access Barcelona tour bus which parks just outside Taxi to cruise terminal with two cases was Euros 26 Great sized and clean room 
416430,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The hotel was large and generally nice The room was nice and had a very nice shower The hotel is probably more suited to business travellers than leisure travellers There isn t really much around the hotel however there is easy access to the Metro and Train as the hotel is literally on top of the Barcelona Sants train station The space theme doesn t really add anything to the hotel and is a little strange 
416431,Barcel Sants, Hated the noise particularly the electronic ringing every time a lift arrived It goes on all night and the doors to the rooms aren t soundproofed If you re near the lifts you won t sleep , Liked the unusual room
416432,Barcel Sants, There was a large street party going on during my stay and it was so loud that I barely slept You can definitely hear everything going on outside , Very friendly staff big breakfast with lots of options big bed cleanly room
416433,Barcel Sants, I consider barcelo my hotel and its ny 6th stay at barcelo but imagine this stay i had a train to seville and i was so tired and i slept and didnt woke up on time and i packed my luggage and went down to check out and i was late there was several customers waiting and i asked the front desk that please am late and i need to check out quickly he answered me that ots not my problem honestly the worst response i ever had,No Positive
416434,Barcel Sants, During our stay between 24 28 august 2015 there was a street festival on every night with loud music playing right through until 2am We barely slept which hindered our energy levels Don t visit last week in august Hotel was perfect besides this , Breakfast was delicious Rooms were cleaned every day Excellent location beside train station with no noise of trains 
416435,Barcel Sants, No free Gym No free water I guess Nothing around but if you walk for about 3 5 minutes you will find shops and restaurants near by, The hotel is just above the train station the main central and connecting to all the lines The hotel is little far from the main square however everything is easily accessible from here since it is right above the train station even if you want to do interstate travel or within the city all the lines are well connected we had no problems travelling around Barcelona Wifi signal was very good Staff was very friendly helpful and willing to assist AC was not working but it was fixed and they also provided complimentary bottles of water a fruit platter and a block of chocolate
416436,Barcel Sants, Maybe the only thing that i can mention was something went wrong with the flash toilet tank but the The facility was created soon by the hotel engineers , LOCATION was the best SUPER EASY ACCESS to everything and everywhere by bus taxi and metro super easy access means just a few steps from the privacy of your room to any point of interest of the city Also barcelona hop on hop off busses and a kiosk of barcelona tourist information and tickets are right in front of your hotel door And because the hotel was built over the barcelona s main train station you have straight access to some dinning and essential shops such as mc donalds bakery pharmacy and more What else do you want THE HOTEL has an ORBITAL and GALAXY atmosphere that makes you feel and experience very different Compared with other ordinary hotels THE ROOM was very COMFORT and CLEAN especially THE BED so soft and comfort and includes 3 size of pillow for your choice DEFINITELY CHOOSE THIS HOTEL AGAIN FOR THE NEXT TRIP 
416437,Barcel Sants,No Negative, I had great experience with you guys Im recomanding your hotel to everybody who is going to Barcelona I Was getting engaged in your place so with help of ina everything was great 
416438,Barcel Sants, Room service and mini bar prices were high so kept away from them didn t try the restaurant or the bar facilities because of this Better to eat out locally , Location first great to get around Barcelona from a good local district The Room was very clean and comfortable light and spacious Very comfortable Bed
416439,Barcel Sants, The use of fragrance in corridors and common areas gives a sense of lack of fresh air and of an artificial environment It doesn t improve the experience , The furniture of the rooms and the overall design of the hotel The location was also very convenient as I was travelling by train 
416440,Barcel Sants, No working TV Reported to reception not fixed My 2nd visit here definitely not as good as the 1st Expensive stay for a room with no TV , Great location if arriving by train Big room with large bed and superb views Themed hotel like a space station Silent air con 
416441,Barcel Sants,No Negative, Clean comfortable hotel with ultra modern and stylish features Excellent value with a good location from which to explore Barcelona Very clean and comfortable
416442,Barcel Sants, The lights in the hall went out one night which made it very difficult for my father to find our room , First of all THEY BROUGHT ME CAKE It was my birthday I went out to run errands and my father went out to explore his surroundings When I returned a generous slice of chocolate layered cake was waiting patiently in our room candle and all It was more than enough for both of us I felt very special Everything else was terrific My father is a tall elderly man with mobility challenges He is the type to go for campgrounds over hotels but that wasn t feasible for this trip I needed something close to public transportation at the end of our trip so I booked this room thinking he would simply have to tolerate it Instead he loved it He said it was the most comfortable hotel of the five we had stayed in He was very excited about the large shower with two different shower head heights The shower is large easy to walk into and has shower heights for both tall and short people He loved the view the bed light the abundant sockets and the comfort of the bed 
416443,Barcel Sants, The only little gripe would be that the glass shower screen was not totally shower proof and water would leak out onto the bathroom floor Also the location of the hotel is very good if you don t mind taking the underground I don t think its centrally enough placed if you were looking to walk everywhere The space theme in the communal areas may not be to everyones liking , The location of this hotel was perfect for us as we arrived by train from Paris and were taking a train out next morning The beds were fantastically comfortable and the room was well fiited out 
416444,Barcel Sants, Everything was perfect , We had Lux room 601 and it s was AMAZING It s was my present for my boyfriend birthday We spent amazing time Super clean wonderful interior NEW furniture HUGE soft bed hydro massage bath two toilets super big panoramic windows It s unforgettable experience We are always traveling around the world and staying in a different 4 5 stars only hotels but this room was one of the best we ever been Personal super friendly We have got bday present from the hotel which was very nice of them We still under emotions and happy after our stay in this hotel last weekend

416446,Barcel Sants, While I was there there was a small carnival set up next to the hotel that was a little noisy until 1 2 am , Convenient location you can take the airport train to the station directly under the hotel Rooms were well designed and large junior suite and the space motif of the hotel was interesting 
416447,Barcel Sants, Corridors a bit too dark and there was no one else in the restaurant around 10pm We would have been happy with a light meal in the bar but I don t think that was an option , Beds are unbelievably comfortable 
416448,Barcel Sants,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent great range of food for breakfast Second time we staid we had to ask for another room as there was a festival on outside and we has to get up early The staff was very helpful in listening and changing our room 
416449,Barcel Sants, We requested a twin room and received a double room they did sort their error out but we had to move our own luggage from one floor to another very unprofessional, Great hotel for a short stay or traveling go other cities with the train as the hotel is literally above the train station 
416450,Barcel Sants, Breakfast should be included in price of room , Good location everything in close distance to the metro Bed was excellent Very clean Shower was great Got a bottle of champagne as we were on our honeymoon very nice touch

416453,Barcel Sants, Quality of staff seemed to vary at times they were very competent at other times other staff seemed unable to resolve simple issues It s a busy hotel and overall I think they were fine but this did get my attention , Clean comfortable and well appointed Iron and board are supplied which is handy There s also an electric kettle and coffee tea much appreciated I m not sure this is the norm in Spain Location is convenient and noise is not an issue at all 
416454,Barcel Sants, I was not a fan of the space theme It was really dark our room was painted black , The location was the best part of the hotel It s right above a major train station which is about a 20 minute train ride directly from the airport We used a taxi twice only because it was too late but the train to get everywhere else 
416455,Barcel Sants, The district around the hotel itself well not a touristic to be honest, Good service and nice idea of the hotel you will enjoy it if you like Space Quite good location close to the Spain Square and fountains 10 minutes walk and to the metro 1 min We didn t have breakfasts but if you want plenty of cafes are at your disposal right beneath the hotel yes it is on the top of train station but you don t recognize it 
416456,Barcel Sants, It takes a lot of time to Check in staff when we arrive was so rude most of then super snob he s not wearing a name plate that s Why i cant mentioned here , Room location was good comfortable night receptionist was accomodating 
416457,Barcel Sants, Day staff were less friendly Gym and breakfast should be included to make this a complete luxury experience , Night receptionists were extremely accommodating Our room on the 7th floor with king size bed was the best we ever stayed in Breakfast was great Hotel design is minimal and great attention to detail
