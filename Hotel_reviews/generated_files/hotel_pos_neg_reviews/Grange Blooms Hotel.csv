235882,Grange Blooms Hotel, Breakfast price seemed very high 23 95, Arrived early before 3pm check in time as we were seeing a show at 2 30 and needed to leave luggage Hotel checked us in and gave us an upgrade room that was available complimentary along with a plate of cake with Happy anniversary written on it had previously emailed 4 hotels asking if we can leave luggage prior to check in and the fact it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary This hotel was the only one that bothered to reply Excellent room with real dark wood furniture comfy bed excellent bathroom with plenty of gels and soaps Good TV with many channels Tea and Coffee with plenty of both available along with Milk Receptionist sent up Soya milk F O C as my wife can not drink dairy Check in was quick staff brilliant and location superb All in all a lovely hotel very reasonably priced including the room service menu My only slight grump was that the breakfast was 23 95 which seemed unreasonably steep compared to great prices on room menu strange I highly recommend this hotel 
235883,Grange Blooms Hotel, Was booked to Grange Blooms Hotel but when we arrived we were directed to the hotel next door Grange White Hall Apparently it s the same the building is connected and of the same standard but it didn t look like it and we didn t appreciate the bait and switch to a hotel other than the one we booked , Location was good Next door to British Museum short walk from St Pancras Train station Staff were friendly Area was quiet especially as our room faced an inner courtyard garden
235884,Grange Blooms Hotel, Room was small and very hot it was impossible to regulate the room temperature Bathroom was small and a large step up into the bath to access the shower , Clean and in a good location 
235885,Grange Blooms Hotel, The bathroom was tired needed a fresh paint the toilet needed a good clean Decor furniture could do with update , The room was airy very comfy super king bed spotlessly clean sheets and towels very well equipped bathroom toiletries 
235886,Grange Blooms Hotel, Management should ensure that all the room doors do not end 5cm above the floor It really steals privacy and makes the room very noisy We changed the room then and the second room was fine , Good value for money in London To me the style is typically British Close to Tube station various bus stations and a nice wee park around the corner Perfekt PT connection to almost everywhere in the city and to Heathrow airport Rooms are small but clean and big enough for a weekend city trip 
235887,Grange Blooms Hotel, No plug sockets next to bed so cant charge phone or any devices next to you have to keep getting in and out of bed to answer phone etc when charging had to boil kettle on the floor as again no plug socket unless you unplug tv shabby bathroom and when you look up to the sky light in bathroom its FILTY I didn t feel it was clean very shabby and dusty when I tried to move bed to look for plug sockets again very diet under bed so it s being cleaned thoroughly , location is good 
235888,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Staff was extremely pleasant and helpful Room was large clean and well decorated Location is absolutely perfect two minute walk from the British Museum and the best dining and shopping 
235889,Grange Blooms Hotel, Hard to complain about this hotel, Convenient location just a couple of blocks from the nearest Metro Staff were friendly and helpful Excellent for short or long stay 
235890,Grange Blooms Hotel, Could not swing a cat in the room or the bathroom No safety rails in bath to enable a safe entry and exit into and out of the bath for a shower Had to squeeze past the end of the bed to get to the other side of the bed ,No Positive
235891,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Spacious clean and comfortable bed and bathroom Stylish classic interior Have stayed at different hotels from the Grange hotel group in this neighborhood and wouldn t want to stay anywhere else Compared to other hotels in London this is really good value for money 
235892,Grange Blooms Hotel, The 1st floor windows can be walked up to via all the flat roof space and the lock on the windows was flimsy at best The door into the room did not seal so could not be a fire door it let plenty of noise and light through from the creaking floor outside You could listen to conversations from other rooms , Comfortable bed high ceilings 
235893,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, The hotel met all my needs but Stayed on my own and walking back to the hotel at night I felt a bit nervous as the street did not have many people although it was close to the x2 tube stations It may be because it was Bh
235894,Grange Blooms Hotel, Very worn decor and a poor breakfast despite it being free , Clean and friendly staff Quiet yet accessible location The staff were very efficient in offering us alternative accommodation and a free breakfast when a leak developed from the room above 
235895,Grange Blooms Hotel, Nothing really For a short overnight stay and the price I paid this was suitable , Chose this due to it s location near Russell Square Decent hotel with lovely staff was offered an upgrade from single to double room due to my preference of room location Standard facilities and clean rooms Walking distance to Russell Square tube station a Tesco and a Sainsbury is around the corner plus some food places 
235896,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Staff allowed my ill partner late checkout until a room was available in a sister hotel around the corner as we could not return to our apartment due to late running building works and had to extend our stay 
235897,Grange Blooms Hotel, Could ve had more tea and sugar in the room and room perhaps could ve been a touch warmer , The staff were very friendly and accomadating The style of the room was nice and homely and there was plenty to watch on TV when you wanted to
235898,Grange Blooms Hotel, My room was a single but even taking that into account it was small Difficult to find anywhere to put the suitcase small It was impossible at times to get cold water from the mixer taps, Room was warm bed was comfortable and the staff were most helpful Located on a quieter street in Bloomsbury off of Russell Square My bedroom faced the rear over the garden and was very quiet Room was also reasonably clean and quality of room service two night stay was high I would use the hotel again because it is very well located for the British Museum and Senate House 
235899,Grange Blooms Hotel, We were first put in a room that was quite small and stayed in that a night The next day complained and we were put in a much larger room which was very good of the hotel , Location was excellent and staff were very helpful 
235900,Grange Blooms Hotel, I paid more than other guests from abroad as happened to be waiting by the desk when someone was checking out Not fair is it booking com , The staff were really really good very helpful and friendly For a single room it was a good size and very comfortable The location was fabulous 
235901,Grange Blooms Hotel, Hot Water and shower broke down but no problem really , Comfortable spacious bed with superb decor Fine historic building and location Staff willingness to help Easy access to all venues we enjoy in London 
235902,Grange Blooms Hotel, The room was very small as was the bathroom The sink in the bathroom was tiny and very low making it difficult to use There was no shelf in the bathroom and therefore nowhere to put toiletries The room did not have temperature control or air conditioning and was a bit too hot There was a ceiling fan although we were asked to turn it off because the people in the room above complained about the noise Hotel was nice but a little overpriced costing me 450 for 3 nights I think 100 120 per night would have been more reasonable , Excellent location D cor of the hotel was very nice much more character than a standard hotel 
235903,Grange Blooms Hotel, Advertised a whiskey library which didn t exist and you had to use the bar in the sister hotel , Position of hotel comfortable bed staff very helpful 
235904,Grange Blooms Hotel, Disappointed that the Library whiskey bar was not open as a number of colleagues and myself had thought it would be a great place to make a bit of a get together Having to walk down to the White hall hotel a few doors down for food or drink was a bit odd Not a great issue but not ideal , The Grange Bloom is a very nice hotel very jolly British The staff are lovely and helpful and the food is also very nice if somewhat basic The room was very pleasant and extremely clean with easy access via a lift It was ideal for my work in the British Museum as it was so very close The resident spook was wonderfully polite and chose not to haunt my room anyway However there just was not anything really special to make this a great hotel Good enough value for central London you could do an awful lot worse as it does have remarkably high standards for inner London just quite bland 
235905,Grange Blooms Hotel, Massive gap under the door you could hear everything in the hallway Had to plug the kettle in on the floor as there were no plug sockets where the tea station was The bathroom was below average for the price And my boyfriend wanted to surprise me for my graduation with decorations which he paid for But the decorations said happy anniversary , Comfy bed
235906,Grange Blooms Hotel, In need of some furnishing updates eg dark and heavy swags and tails Mattress for me a little too soft One piece of damaged furniture that should be removed , Very friendly and helpful staff Nice sized room Good bath products Nice and warm weather very cold 
235907,Grange Blooms Hotel, Nothing, Clean modern room Generous amount of toiletries tea and coffee Good location walking distance to west end Staffs very friendly I was upgraded thanks
235908,Grange Blooms Hotel, There was no toilet roll holder which meant having to hold it to unroll not very hygienic particularly st this time of year with the winter bugs , Very comfortable homely there was fruit in the room which was a great treat staff were very welcoming friendly
235909,Grange Blooms Hotel, Cleanliness could have been better Hairs in the bathroom Rooms could have been bigger We were in an executive room supposedly it was tiny Floor was wonky everywhere , Location and staff were good 
235910,Grange Blooms Hotel, The shower over a bath wasn t cleaned well at all and there was lots of hair over the shower walls and bits of dirt on the walls that all came off with the shower head showering over them so the cleaner obviously hadn t bothered to clean the walls There was also a clump of girls long hair in between the pillows though the bed did appear to have been freshly made We Googled exactly what 4 Star actually meant after being disappointed with what we were expecting versus what we got We asked for a complimentary late checkout when we arrived and were offered 12pm instead of 11am and advised our booking would be updated so we wouldn t be called before 12pm We received two phone calls before 12pm the first at 11 18am to tell us checkout was at 11am so we explained we were given a 12pm checkout and then a second call at 11 58am to let us know checkout was at 11am Pretty frustrating , Good location off the main busy roads nearby so much less traffic quieter The bed was comfortable and the curtains were great and made the room into a blackout room except for the cracks in the door showing the hallway lights The room heating was so good in a room with a very high ceiling that we had to turn it down when we arrived 
235911,Grange Blooms Hotel, The breakfast was not included and was expensive at 23 each so we walked round to the Bella Roma cafe and had one for 6 50 with a view of the British museum , The room was very nice just one night stay hotel away from all the London noise but close to the theatre in Drury Lane where we were going and 15 20 min walking distance from kings cross St Pancras station
235912,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location come out of the station turn left cross at the traffic lights enter the gardens if they re open walk diagonally to the opposite side and you ll see Montague Street on the right It s clean tidy old fashioned but stylish Highly recommended 
235913,Grange Blooms Hotel, We were told to walk to the next hotel which we hadn t booked The room they showed me had a dirty toilet used and not flushed The next room was enormous and clean the bed was a pull down one from the wall no bedside cabinets or electric plugs tea making facilities good but there was no plug for the kettle nearby The staff asked when we left had we enjoyed our stay we said no they said had we enjoyed breakfast we hadn t had it they told us that the receptionist when we booked in had offered us a complimentary breakfast we were not told of this We voiced our dissatisfaction the manager did write to us but the outcome of her review has not been forwarded to us Altogether a poor experience , nothing
235914,Grange Blooms Hotel, Repair the bathroom window as a terrible draught comes in no handle to secure the window from draughts Surprised only 1 radiator in the bathroom and none in the bedroom , All was very comfy and very clean 
235915,Grange Blooms Hotel, There were no pillow protectors fitted We did not have breakfast at the hotel as we thought it was far too expensive we may have considered it at half the price , Quiet and more than comfortable enough to sleep despite the single glazing 
235916,Grange Blooms Hotel, Just the bathroom was a big small , Location so wonderful staff very friendly and hotel quite clean and comfortable No complaints at all it s not a luxury hotel really but a perfect spot from which to explore London and the British Museum
235917,Grange Blooms Hotel, Nothing to do with the hotel really but consideration from other guests regarding noise would have been good , We stayed in the Theatre Royal room which was lovely and quiet with a comfy big bed 
235918,Grange Blooms Hotel, The bathroom was very small and the zink extremely low The cab driver the hotel called for us tried to rip us off pretending Heathrow Express was cancelled this Sunday Thought this very bad since the company cooperates with Grange Hotels , Excellent location in nice area Quite good value for money in a pricey area 
235919,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Charming old style hotel on a quiet and beautiful street in lovely Bloomsbury Our room opened onto the cute little garden in the back Complementary tea and fruit Staff was accomodating 
235920,Grange Blooms Hotel, Room v small and bed not comfortable, Free wifi but kept dropping out so I would not pay for it Room was really small bed was very soft too soft for me If I wanted a drink I had to go next door and breakfast was over 20 which even for London is too much
235921,Grange Blooms Hotel, Booked this hotel months ago made it perfectly clear to hotel and booking com my wife has disability and in wheelchair My wife had to walk up stairs to entrance and down to depart was told there would be a makeshift ramp on arrival Should have been told hotel not suitable when booking The lady on reception read my email on arrival as she said she wasn t aware Disappointing break, Friendly staff
235922,Grange Blooms Hotel, FIrst room smelled badly of smoke Changed rooms and the room was brown and badly lit The decor was like a one star hotel The bed was a fold out from the wall The carpet was old and stained Nothing like the photos Avoid ,No Positive
235923,Grange Blooms Hotel, First room we were allocated we found water pouring from the ceiling light fittings having been relocated the room lacked air conditioning a fridge adequate power points or hot water pressure shower For this day and age a modern television with more than five channels should be considered the norm Our four poster bed had not been cleaned properly and both the room and bathroom appeared generally tired 170 for one night should command higher standards very disappointing We would not recommend or return , Not very much
235924,Grange Blooms Hotel, Unfortunately my room backed onto the lift shaft The lift was in use most of the night and was extremely noisy I slept VERY little during the two nights I stayed at this hotel , All the staff were polite helpful professional and friendly The room was a single room but spacious enough for one person 
235925,Grange Blooms Hotel, Layout of room no drawers in main room no air conditioning and poor extractor fan in bathroom hair dryer would have been better and more effective in main room and had to tighten shower head as leaking water pressure took 5 mins to get good flow then intermittent towels were hard too no bottled water in room either , Location and garden
235926,Grange Blooms Hotel, Sound proofing nor brilliant so snoring neighbour and all night rattling ceiling fan nearby were a nuisance on last of three night stay, Freebie fruit in room and on reception sweets with a good selection on the hot drinks tray in room all good plusses
235927,Grange Blooms Hotel, Receptionist not very friendly and didn t make us feel particularly welcomed A smile goes a long way Electronic booking in on tablet took too long Nice room but small as it was a corner room Within a minute of us arriving in the room the mini bar a packet of crisps and a couple of miniatures on a tray was whisked away Have stayed in other Grange hotels numerous times before and not experienced this , Great location as we were attending an event at the British Museum Could not have been more convenient Covent Garden very easily accessible too 
235928,Grange Blooms Hotel, Room on first night had no shelf or space for toiletry items in the bathroom more annoying than it sounds The wifi didn t work Second night upgraded to room with normal bathroom shelf space and good working wifi Pompous drapes around the bedhead full of dust which rained down every time we moved Some sort of fan or other machinery droning all night long nearby with no obvious way of switching off Water pump in loft space ran loud whenever someone used water Restaurant basic and unimaginative shame as the garden setting is very nice , Great location around the corner from the British Museum Lovely old fashioned boutique style with delightful garden Helpful staff 
235929,Grange Blooms Hotel, Lack of breakfast included in room fee is a serious shortcoming Lack of microwave and refrigerator in room is very inconvenient Computer facilities inadequate Rear patio garden nice but needs better upkeep , Nice room if a little small with French doors overlooking rear patio garden Coffee maker in room is convenient 
235930,Grange Blooms Hotel, We thought breakfast was in the deal it wasn t and at 23 something it s a seriously expensive option we didn t take up We had a ground floor room which was convenient but unfortunately the hotel structure in general being quote old transmits quite a lot of noise so anyone moving around in adjacent rooms or the corridor was very noticeable Unfortunately the reverse switch broke on the fan rendering it unusable and we weren t there long enough to get it repaired , The hotel has great character and is very nicely located for exploring There s also a great cafe in the park opposite Convenient for the tube it s a good base to get around from it s nicely appointed and to a good standard without excessive formality Comfortable room nice big bed very narrow bath though all the usual amenities and although no air conditioning a 10 foot ceiling with a ceiling fan Away from main roads so no significant external noise VERY personable and helpful staff 
235931,Grange Blooms Hotel, The TV didn t work for us no biggie or we would have called Reception for a fix We could have done with more power points for charging the various devices , The bed was very comfortable indeed perfect mattress great pillows slept like at home and I m quite fussy The toiletries were generous the bathroom was roomy enough and the shower was good The room size was bigger than average for London for the price The location was perfect too The hotel was quiet being on the edge of the British Museum there was very little traffic noise 
235932,Grange Blooms Hotel, Entire hotel overheated Fortunately we could open the window before we expired There is no refrigerator in the room and this would be annoying for longer stays Bathroom floor was as slippery as ice even with dry feet and no water on floor Really perilous Room was tiny nowhere to put luggage , Cannot beat the location Extremely comfortable bed and luxurious bed linen Appreciated the fresh fruit in the room and tea and coffee making facilities We have stayed several times before and find the accommodation and service consistent Love the fact that we could open the window Excellent shower
235933,Grange Blooms Hotel, For what we paid we were very happy , The room bed was very comfy We were upgraded to a double instead of twin beds which was a nice surprise We were also able to leave our case for a few hours after check out We did not have breakfast so cannot comment on food however there was a nice bowl of fruit in the room 
235934,Grange Blooms Hotel, At midnight I decided I wanted a snack I ask for two items marked as available 24 hours by an asterisk a Parisienne sandwich and vegetable samosas The concierge told me vegetable samosas aren t available at this hour I mentioned that it was marked as available He replied But I ll need to turn on the oven If you really need the samosas I guess I can do that stressing the point if I really need it and indicating his preference to not bother with more than he needs to do I replied no that s fine I don t need it Just bring me the sandwich When he finally arrived with the sandwich he set down the tray and doing so knocked out the TV s box He apologized and proceeded to tell me things weren t going well for him I told him not to worry about it and I m sorry to hear things weren t going well Of note some of the other staff were friendly and would treat me with a smile Other staff gave me strange looks with neither a greeting nor the semblance of a warm welcome I pride myself on being a warm kind generous person So to be met by such expressions by the staff was a bit disconcerting and unexpected Not sure it was worth the price but then little in London is , In general it s a beautiful hotel in a really excellent location quieter than something on any main streets but also central and and extremely convenient A place with such a location couldn t possibly fail 
235935,Grange Blooms Hotel, The location is a little noisy for traffic and the TV only had 5 channels , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and upgraded us to a four poster bed for free 
235936,Grange Blooms Hotel, Free wifi Cheaper breakfast Staff banging around in a store room next to our room at all hours , Great location Friendly staff Reasonable price Very clean Ideally located for London tour buses 10 minutes walk from theatre land 
235937,Grange Blooms Hotel, The breakfast menu was a little over priced , The concierge service was excellent really appreciated all your help and allowing us to leave our luggage whilst we went to explore The rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel s location was excellent Thank you we will definitely be back soon 
235938,Grange Blooms Hotel, Quality of the bathroom supplies could have been a bit better , Friendly welcome and we were up graded to a very comfy king size room Room was very clean 
235939,Grange Blooms Hotel, I could tell that the hotel done its best effort to keep the room clean but because the hotel is quite old I saw the accumulated old dusts at the corners of the bathroom and also the glass screen of the bathtub , The staff were quite helpful and flexible The location was good only 5 minutes walk to the Russell Square Almost the next to the British Museum Good neighborhood It is not avoidable of small rooms in London thus I recommend you to book a double room I was glad I could stay at the room with a bathtub especially in this cold season 
235940,Grange Blooms Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included in our deal so we didn t get to see the breakfast room We understand that the dining room is in the sister hotel next door So the only facility we saw was a lovely but small sitting room , Lovely traditional elegant but homely decor Exceptionally clean reception staff very polite 
235941,Grange Blooms Hotel,No Negative, Thank you so much for the lovely staff for giving us such a nice room for our anniversary I hated to ask but it was very much appreciated Also loved the seating area outside only wish we had more time to make the most of it 
235942,Grange Blooms Hotel, The temperature was very high in the lobby corridors and the room although the radiator was not on in the room Not too much of an issue though as we opened the window nice to be able to on a second floor room , Very friendly staff allowed us to leave our bags before check in time so we could go round the British museum Room was lovely well appointed light clean and fresh 
235943,Grange Blooms Hotel, There was an extremely loud droning noise in our room which was on and off from about 7am we are assuming it was something to do with the water system as the guests started showering in the morning ruined a Sunday morning lie in The shower door was broken and if you moved the shower head higher so that you could wash your hair the shower turned off There was no breakfast team available in the room The room was also stifling hot when we arrived I appreciate it is cold out and guests like different temperatures but we turned the radiator off and needed the fan on all night I can only assume our room was adjacent to a boiler When mentioned to the member of staff on reception as we checked out she seemed to laugh and said any thing else as if we were exaggerating A rare weekend away was marred by choosing to stay at Grange Blooms, Comfortable bed
235944,Grange Blooms Hotel, Found it tricky as the shower door was restricted to pull out from the sink being in the way as I m disabled and struggle to bend to reach taps etc and there was not enough plugs it was awkward having to move stuff around constantly, The location was good
235945,Grange Blooms Hotel, Very thin walls we had room 3 which is the worst room possible We were woken in the middle of the night by the night guard and the receptionist talking to each other We could hear every single word I don t know if the hotel was fully booked or our room assignment had to do with our cheap booking com rate of 82 GBP but it was very poor regardless Besides room service didn t do a very good job as there was an old bottle in our room upon arrival TV was very old and remote did not work due to receiver way below the bed and behind stuff You have to get up to adjust volume or change stations Like said our rate was 82 Sterling which the hotel in another room is maybe worth but if you have to pay the full rate you can get more bang for the buck elsewhere , Nice room good location in Bloomsbury right behind the British Museum fresh fruit in the room spacious bathroom very comfortable bed
235946,Grange Blooms Hotel, Small room but as it had a high ceiling it didn t feel too cramped, loved the decor a refreshing change from so many bland boring hotel rooms Also liked having a proper bathtub Very friendly staff great location Didn t go on the outside terrace but like the idea of it and had a nice view of it 
235947,Grange Blooms Hotel, The Windows weren t double glazed and we re old and rickety so there was a draft and noise The bath ad shower was old and felt uncomfortable to use the sockets and switches were old and discoloured and there was no big light just lots of lamps , The staff were very helpful the location is good very close to Holborn station the bed was very comfortable 
235948,Grange Blooms Hotel, I had booked a last minute trip to London with my partner and decided the hotel rooms looked great on the booing website so went for it I was happy with my booing until I got to our room The room was very small there wasn t enough room to fold down the iron board and iron not with two people having to manoeuvre around it each other The double bed was disappointing it wasn t a double bed It was a 3 4 bed with a single duvet on the top Sleeping in the bed was annoying enough when you re a little bit cold during the night and are trying to keep covered with a duvet but can t because it doesn t even cover your body completely It was a midnight tussle for some duvet warmth between us both as only one person would be fully covered by what the hotel management consider a double duvet on this double bed which didn t even fit us two on Laying down on our backs side by side meant that my arm would drop off the edge of the bed It s NOT a double bed and I m annoyed it was described as a double bed and even more annoyed I had to pay for it , Friendly staff and a great location
235949,Grange Blooms Hotel, Nothing the hotel is lovely There is a short flight of steps you can t avoid at the Russell Square tube station , We had a long flight from Australia and the reception staff were wonderful about booking us in early I had emailed and asked if it was possible and they were so accommodating as well as giving us over 60s a ground floor room If you are a history archaeology buff as I am this is the hotel for you right next door to the British Museum and around the corner from the main entrance The underground station Russell Square is a short flat walk away 
235950,Grange Blooms Hotel, Free wifi was unreliable Minor quibble Although the room came with an electric kettle it had to be placed on the floor in order to be plugged in , Extremely courteous helpful staff 
235951,Grange Blooms Hotel, Nothing the hotel can do about traffic noise most of the day and night as the hotel is on a busy street No a c it wasn t needed but the open window for air let in noise from the street , The location was good easy walk to shops restaurants parks underground British Museum The room though small was comfortable tastefully decorated had updated plumbing and in room snacks 
235952,Grange Blooms Hotel, Hotel getting in need of modernisation , Location
235953,Grange Blooms Hotel, Small things like towel rails hanging away from wall Bedside lamps very loose Lovely curtains but really dusty , Adequate for our stay in London
