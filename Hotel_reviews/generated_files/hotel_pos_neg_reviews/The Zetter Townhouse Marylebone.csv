129397,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, I wish breakfast was included , Amazing decor vibe and location The staff was very friendly and the rooms are beautiful The hotel bar is also an amazing fun bar The location is perfect for sightseeing without being in the middle of the chaos 
129398,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, It is expensive for a hotel that doesn t have a pool gym or spa Also the menu at lunch is the same menu for dinner as well as room service On top of that it is quite limited especially if you are vegetarian However they do offer afternoon tea which I didn t get to try but looked lovely , The location is fantastic and the bedroom is beautiful Most importantly it is quiet 
129399,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone,No Negative, It was such a quirky spot with a lot of personality Actually felt like I was in London perhaps in a different time though and the staff were exceptionally friendly I would definitely stay there again
129400,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, nothing, lovely small cozy hotel very comfortable and quiet with an excellent cocktail bar if you re looking for something different Staff were very helpful and friendly breakfast good although eggs were overcooked location is great and we were lucky enough to get a discount for the room so it was also good value we felt very at home and i would definitely stay here again 
129401,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, The room could have benefited from a full length mirror felt like I was dressing blind , I called the morning of my check in and found out my room was ready at 7 30 a m which was a huge relief after hopping off a night train and assuming I wouldn t have my room until 3 p m Reception was always incredibly helpful despite my frequent calls They were friendly courteous and relaxed which made me feel right at home and I could really tell they genuinely cared about my comfort Bed was great especially after a long day out Heated towel rack was a savior The small bottles in the fridge of their house cocktails were an adorable touch 
129402,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, No milk in room and didn t fancy requesting it while wrapped in a towel coffee percolater not brilliant but still a lovely hotel, Lovely decor comfy big bed lovely polite staff
129403,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Nothing really Just make sure it is the type of place you would like , Different hotel Not your run of the mill establishment Small cozy could be a bit too cozy for some with a bar dominating the entrance Great location for West End visitors 
129404,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, a bit more options on the food in the evening we were looking for a meal rather than bar food but we stayed as the ambience was lovely, we were kindly upgraded very nice thank you The hotel d cor and the general atmosphere was superb we had a lovely weekend
129405,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, My mother in law banged her head on a piece of pretruding furniture in her room They emailed the hotel to let them now and prevent it from happening to other guests but didn t get a reply , Loved the quirky bar lounge area Rooms beautifully colourfully and uniquely decorated Brilliant location 
129406,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Pillows desperately need to ventilate or replace to new ones, Super nice staff Cozy place Restaurant with wonderful and delicious surprises Beautiful bathroom in the room
129407,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, The breakfast should be a bit upgraded to the same perfect level as the rest of the hotel, Wonderful at home comfort feeling Superb Boutique Hotel in perfect form
129408,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone,No Negative, The interior decoration and attention to details of the decor are exceptional very cosy atmosphere Friendly and attentive staff and to top it delicious desserts and cocktails 
129409,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Gave me a room underground Lower ground although I ve asked for a high floor There are windows and light coming in At the first night there was no option to change the room Later they did offer but we got used to it and it was Ok They Charged me in my local currency 3 5 of extra payment fee for what althouhg I have asked to be charged in pounds No refrigirator , The location is very good Very close to marble arch and oxford street Room well decorated and very clean Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast is high quaity but not too many options 
129410,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Well It s not really a hotel so don t expect those types of amenities There is really no reception when you walk through the front door you literally walk into their bar which is super nice by the way There are very limited food options snacks basically and no dining options Although within a few metres from the front door there are several great dining options Because I was there on business it should be noted that the bedroom was not so great for doing work the desk is an antique and so was the chair meaning pretty uncomfortable So not great for the business traveler but awesome for a weekend getaway , Very nice atmosphere room details and finishes are of a very high standard 
129411,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Construction work nearby But didn t bother me much Some door and window knobs need fixing Left a note about it They probably fixed them already Will check next time I book there , A catch in London Generally quiet and wonderful helpful staff Didn t feel very busy Bed was comfy but the best part was the design it s a proper boutique hotel 
129412,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Big step up into the shower which is in the bath are baths really necessary in 2016 cocktail bar is cosy but didn t sell regular cocktails like mojitos which is a shame , Location is brilliant rooms are well furnished bed very comfortable fixtures and fittings all lovely the hotel has a really warm and welcoming feel and the staff are friendly and welcoming 
129413,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone,No Negative, We loved the little things that made a difference an Australian adapter in the room on arrival the refurbished classic cast iron radiator as a towel rail the Roberts radio Bluetooth speaker and a hot water bottle Then of course there s the usual stuff friendly and professional service a super comfortable bed and pillows and beautiful bathroom that could only be English 
129414,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, The size of the room was tiny which is familiar in London , The check in and out was so smooth The staff receipant was cordial The bed was comfortable The location was excellent
129415,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, All their deluxe room s bathrooms are equipped with disability features At first sight it does not give a pleasant feeling if you ain t one Some deluxe room bathrooms should be without those features Though if your pocket permits go for the next category , Excellent Location Extremely cozy and private place Ideal for romantic couples and not advisable for bigger families or groups Most beautiful and comfy bar in the neighborhood though a little pricey The moment you walk in it gives a feeling of home Wish I could extend my stay for a little longer 
129416,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, The bed was a little hard I was too hot with the down comforter and there was no top sheet , The staff was very friendly and helpful It was also in an excellent location Close to the tube and walkable for meals

129418,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Not much privacy once the curtains were open Our room seem to be in direct view from the other rooms across the street It would have been better to have blinds to allow natural light and privacy , Nice and clean and the staff were very friendly 
129419,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Booked 4 poster bed Was given club room as this was ready and told this was an upgrade When researched found this was a less expensive room than was booked and charged for While waiting for room to become available was offered a coffee and found this charged to my bill at the end of my stay Felt misled and cheated on both counts , Good location Comfortable bed Clean Querky 
129420,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, If I had more time to enjoy the bar and eating area next time , Loved the d cor I had to change arrangements dates of stay while I was there and the staff made it all too easy I needed a cab and the staff went our of there way to track one down not just flag from street as there were none

129422,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, I would have liked an iron , Coming in from the rain it was like walking into a wonderfully welcoming home I just wished I hadn t arrived so late so I could have enjoyed a glass of wine in the very cosy bar I really liked you could have fresh milk in the room and that there was a cafetiere and fresh coffee 
129423,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, Service at breakfast was really disappointing We were told we couldn t have cappuccinos but strangely heard another couple order a cappuccino successfully The milk given to my wife for her filter coffee was actually off Ketchup had to be requested several times And the doors to the staircases all had sticky handles a bit yuck , Very trendy we stayed in the room with the Union Jack four poster bed Check in staff were friendly and helpful

129426,The Zetter Townhouse Marylebone, based on my needs nothing missing if i was staying longer the facilities were minimal i would prefer i walk in shower with a bigger shower head but frankly that is just being picky, great staff comfortable bed great spot great bar
