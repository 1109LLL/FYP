111525,Landmark London,No Negative, This is by far the best hotel I ve ever stayed in and I have traveled a lot Everything was define from the comfy beds to the design to the extremely friendly and professional staff to how comfy it was for the children they absolutely loved it and made us promise to holiday in London again this year just so they could return to this hotel For me the bar was so cozy and nice the spa facilities well on the money I m still sleepy from the relaxing massage and facials I got yesterday lol Yes it is expensive to stay but it is a 5 star hotel with great value for money You will feel so good so much that you d forget you coughed out a mini fortune So staying here whenever I m in London 
111526,Landmark London, When booking I requested a quiet room and I got one right next to the lift which was very noisy all night My duvet had no duvet cover on it just a sheet the kettle and air con were broken The hotel was full of functions and weddings so you felt like you were staying in a conference centre I complained about the room and they took the cost of my breakfast off the bill but given I only had toast it wasn t really worth it I definitely wouldn t stay there again ,No Positive
111527,Landmark London, The hotel was a longer walk from the facilities shops cafes etc of Marylebone High St than we realised The only local facilities were at the train station at the rear The bathroom was dated At this price we expected more for our money breakfast was not included there was no fruit in our room no chocolate at turn down Our receptionist was not warm or welcoming and originally could n t find our booking We were not advised of any of the hotel facilities We were only given the pool children s swim times when we asked We were not even advised that there was a rear entrance where it was easier to get a taxi so when we left through the front entrance to go out to a show that evening there was no doorman and we had to walk some way down the street to get a taxi On our return our taxi dropped us off at the rear where there was a doorman and this was clearly the more active entrance At this price we expect a much more proactive friendly helpful service from the staff We recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel which had much smaller rooms and not the same Wow factor of the Landmark but it was more modern the staff were much more friendly and helpful and the pool was much nicer soft lighting and a more tranquil spa like experience we all thought it provided much better value for money , The children loved the impressiveness wow factor of the hotel as you walk into reception They also loved the huge bedroom one of the largest we have ever stayed in and the fact that the room s balcony overlooked the stunning conservatory area They also loved the pool The children used room service from the children s menu and thought the food was absolutely superb It arrived promptly We were pleased that for the first time in our extensive experience visiting hotels the children were provided for eg there were 4 robes 4 pairs of slippers 4 glasses in the bathroom this never happens even in 4 and 5 star hotels The spa area was lovely with complementary newspapers fresh fruit and herb and fruit flavoured water on tap Lockers were free and spa robes and slippers were provided We appreciated all these little touches We asked for a quiet room which it certainly was We had no sense of the big busy main road outside The beds were big and comfy and we all had an excellent night s sleep 
111528,Landmark London, Nothing in particular maybe for some people wants to charge their phones and keep it beside them when they are a sleep they should take a break from using it but overall everything is perfect , Staff are friendly location is perfect where behind the hotel there is Marylebone underground station and finally the breakfast was amazing 
111529,Landmark London, Can t think of anything , Very comfortable room excellent helpful and courteous staff Only ate breakfast at the hotel which was very good with a very wide choice For a large hotel in central London it was very peaceful and relaxing Finally the Landmark is located in an area of the city with which I am not that familiar with but it is very well placed within easy walking distance of many attractions including Lord s Cricket ground which was why we were there Robert Marsh
111530,Landmark London,No Negative, Fabulous from start to finish I had a refurbished superior room which was lovely in every aspect Bathrobes slippers provided plus hairdryer Loads of restaurants nearby 15 minute walk to Selfridges 
111531,Landmark London, There aren t door men all the time, Every thing especially the room because it was big and the beds too In addition the lobby was one of the best lobbies i ever experienced
111532,Landmark London,No Negative, This is a great location if you need to catch a train north Marylebone High St is also within walking distance The pool and spa is great and if you need to get out for a walk before work or travelling regents park is just around the corner
111533,Landmark London, Nothing loved it all and can t wait to go again , Everything was perfect the welcome at check in from both Concierge and Reception was spot on the room was beautiful both comfortable and clean and the Room Service and Mirror Bar team were superb Love this hotel 
111534,Landmark London, Breakfast has no ala carte option and a bit overpriced , The room is bigger than expected and it s been nicely refurbished The location is also good as it s right next to the Marylebone station 
111535,Landmark London,No Negative, We had a fabulous stay at this remarkable hotel As it was a special occasion for us we wanted to stay at somewhere really special and this fitted the bill perfectly The staff were so attentive and courteous our room was spacious and very comfortable and the location opposite Marylebone Station was perfect We didn t get time to try afternoon tea in the lovely Winter Garden so hope to do so next time we visit 
111536,Landmark London, I was given a morning paper each day even though I had not requested it but rather to have been given too much than not enough , The Landmark is gorgeous including the newly renovated gym and spa facilities and all staff throughout the hotel were extremely attentive I loved the White Company products in the hotel room and the complimentary water was a welcome touch As a new guest I also felt very privileged to be invited by the General Manager to a cocktail and canap s evening I would highly recommend this hotel especially since it is well situated close to Marylebone station and to our London office which will often host overseas travelers like myself 
111537,Landmark London, Being told by valet that there was no parking No hello welcome just no parking Check in was painful and check out was worse They even sent us a bill for someone else s bar tab and try to overcharge us for mini bar and lunch , Good facilities nice spa good breakfast
111538,Landmark London, at checkin they asked to pay if i remember correctly 100 per night per room in addition to the price confirmed in booking com to hold and return when checkout But intstead i requested a full payment in advance for my stay to avoid having my money on hold So problem solved , Very nice hotel nice hospitality good location right in front of a metro station and a 15 mns walk to oxford st Rooms are clean and spacious 
111539,Landmark London, The quality of the food in the TwoTwentyTwo restaurant was only average considering the cost , The hotel was spectacular inside particularly the Winter Garden Restaurant
111540,Landmark London, The room we got for under 300 had little natural light and wasn t a superior double room as advertised in booking , The breakfast 5 star esp staff
111541,Landmark London, Wifi signal was a bit iffy from time to time , Ambiance room size decor and comfort Service was top class Winter Garden was amazing Love this hotel 
111542,Landmark London,No Negative, Excellent location right in front of Marylebone Station and a short walk to Baker Street Very convenient to get around Marylebone is generally a lovely area Our room was big old fashioned in a good way and generally we have no complaints Kids loved breakfast buffet in the Winter Garden they are still talking about it not included with the room rate but certainly handy 
111543,Landmark London, The spa facilities weren t available however they did supply breakfast complementary , The staff made our stay so personal it was for our honeymoon and they provided champagne and a romantic set up which was a nice touch 
111544,Landmark London, pool and all sport facilities were closed very unhappy about this as i booked hotel for pool and spa they told me this during check in it s not fair and we were extremely unhappy about this they had to contact me before we could go to another place but there was only a pool and it was not in the hotel so we didn t So easy to give a phone call and let the client know that all the hotel facilities are closed as you also pay for that , room was nice we had a family room room was spacious near underground wich makes everything easy nice restaurant in the hotel
111545,Landmark London, F B staff could have been more professional and accommodating , Very classy and comforting Very comfortable bed and nice size of bathroom Excellent breakfast 
111546,Landmark London, as above, A beautiful hotel that feels like it has been unloved of recent Palatial but feels it has seen better days The gym and pool were both closed a fact not mentioned when booking I would have chosen another place if I had known The management offered access to a nearby gym pool but it s not the same heading down the elevator in sports clothes or bathrobe is a treat for me Leaving to go to an outside gym is different The service in the cafe was slow and without much care Some staff unduly snooty The bar was cozy but overly pricey A shot of a good Scotch cost GBP 18 A local bar charged GBP 8 I m fine with extra cost for the plushness but that s too much for me 
111547,Landmark London,No Negative, All individuals working in the hotel were very helpful fast and respectful therefor the hotel is the best hotel in london from my prespactive They even upgraded my room without any extra charge They clean room twice a day The lady who takes care of services asks daily about any thing the room occupier needes Even after they finish their services The food was amazing specially the and the coffee ristretto the best in london because the coffee in other places was not good even in the very known cafes The shrimp cocktail and the thai was amazing It has the taste of thai spices in it 
111548,Landmark London,No Negative, Everything the rooms are amazing g Great location great staff lovely building everything is great Love it so much and it so comfortable that we just wanted to stay and hang around in the rooms as they are so cozy
111549,Landmark London,No Negative, Excellent hotel Very convenient to Marylebone train and underground station Staff were extremely helpful and our room was ready when we arrived at 10am Bedroom was spacious and beautifully decorated Bathroom was very large Food was excellent in the bar
111550,Landmark London, Just the quality of the mattress as described , The Landmark is a top quality hotel and the location is great being right next to Marylebone main line station and underground It is also close to Marylebone High Street which if you have not checked it out before do so it has great shops and a great atmosphere We were travelling for a birthday treat and part of our itinerary was Sketch in Conduit Street afternoon tea like you have never had afternoon tea book now and 42nd Street at the Theatre Royal Drury Street fabulous show with great cast fab sets lighting and great orchestra I had visited the Landmark when down on business just for a pot of tea on the Storm Doris day Doris Day for short when a train home was proving very illusive I liked the look of it and decided that we should pay a bit more for our upcoming visit to London to enhance our experience It was an excellent decision The hotel has an internal central atrium which is a special feature of the hotel The bedrooms surround this atrium and are on 6 floors Some rooms overlook the atrium and some have an external aspect Breakfast and lunches are served in the atrium and the Gazebo on the mezzanine level is a great place for an informal drink light lunch in squishy sofas or seated at tables The staff at the Landmark were without exception attentive helpful and always welcoming We were in the standard double room which was spacious well furnished and very clean The marble bathroom was lovely with White Company toiletries and lovely big fluffy white towels The shower was fine but the water pressure could have been better for filling the large bath The only slight gripe with the room was the mattress and this is the only reason I did not give a 100 score You could see on entering the room that the mattress was not level and flat always a bad sign It was also thinner that I am used to in good hotels 
111551,Landmark London, The hotel in midst of renovations and with poor air conditioning , A big beautiful 5 star property in Marylebone with beautiful atrium and excellent service
111552,Landmark London,No Negative, The bedroom was very quiet no noise from other guests and the bed was extremely comfortable The staff were efficient polite and very helpful The main areas of the hotel were very spacious and we enjoyed a relaxing drink in the mezzanine area with a pleasant selection of piano music in the background 
111553,Landmark London, i did not like the attitude of one of the security guys when i went around taking photos of the hotel i explained to the guy at no time have i ever pointed my camera at any of the guests as i respect there privacy and besides i know the law i just feel like he could of handled it a bit better with a bit more tact, did not try them
111554,Landmark London, I don t like they re not helpful that much The noise i couldn t sleep because all sounds get into the room and when you asked for something they took a long time to get it to you, The design of the hotel is marvelous
111555,Landmark London,No Negative, Loved the whole place decor and furnishings were magnificent staff were wonderful Our room was really spacious with a fabulous bathroom can t fault anything Fantastic breakfast a bit pricey but the opportunity is there to eat as much as you want with an unbelievable choice Stayed in a family room with my sister and our two grandsons who were totally in awe of the whole experience wish we could have stayed longer 
111556,Landmark London, Pillows weren t very soft or comfortable but that was the only drawback to the whole room, Fantastic Sunday champagne brunch in the restaurant although not cheap Beautiful building Really friendly and helpful staff on reception Extremely clean everywhere Fantastic location for seeing London and getting around the city 
111557,Landmark London, Wait for breakfast seating on Sat and Sun mornings 10 to 15 minutes Room was very hot air conditioner could not cool room, Family room was very large Great meals and service overall Staff amazi g
111558,Landmark London, The mattress was too firm for me I need a bit of cushioning yet with support A pillow top or layer of foam would have helped I actually had difficulty falling asleep as a result , As you enter the lower lobby area of this grand hotel you are struck by the sheer magnitude of the atrium area at the top of the beautiful stone staircase Magnificent fresh flower arrangements are everywhere comprised of orchids or roses The reception team is genuinely warm and welcoming and check in was quick and efficient The Concierge desk boasts four members of the Clef d Or and they were very helpful Service is prompt and gracious my room service arrived earlier than expected and was very tasty As a single traveler I opted for a smaller accommodation and was shocked at how large my room was Queen bed and comphy chair with beautiful fabric covers along with pretty drapes and tasteful artwork Large console for mini bar fridge snacks tea and coffee service kettle and biscuits drawers for the hairdryer and laundry bags with a very large flat screen on top A large desk is next to the console with outlets for different voltages and the hotel book with stationary envelopes and post cards There s a Beautiful marble bathroom with huge tub and separate shower and across the hall a huge well lit closet with robe and cushy slippers They even have an umbrella for you to use Fantastic housekeeping staff kept my room immaculate every day Incredible location with the Marylebone train station just behind the hotel for rail and tube destinations Station also has great coffee and food a Boots pharma and grocers Terrific neighborhood for back street runs or stroll and Dorset Park Was incredibly sad to check out 
111559,Landmark London, I know its a luxury hotel but 7 50GBP for a Espresso is taking the biscuit No sockets by the bed , The staff were amazing from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out
111560,Landmark London,No Negative, Landmark is such a nice place to stay I have never experienced a traditional English fashion hotel before and I have to say that landmark certainly proves to me that it is a good one to start with I am quite satisfied 
111561,Landmark London, Restrictions on pool access for children were not stipulated at the time of booking and were only added last week no apology from the hotel despite our strong disappointment, Rooms are large for London s standards Architecture is wonderful so is the furniture Cleaning staff do a very good job
111562,Landmark London, Food very expensive but posh hotel so kind of expected it, Spa facilities my friend had aromatic massage before we left following morning said it was best one she s ever had and would use it again hotel was very nice as was staff bonus point was exit from train station was opposite rear entrance of hotel which we both found out after jumping in taxi only for driver to point to entrance brass necks all round
111563,Landmark London, The air conditioning struggled to keep us cool in the night and made a lot of noise also I would suggest that a family room should have at least one king size bed as I cannot imagine that any of your guests sleep as couples in a queen size at home , Lovely bar and restaurant area 
111564,Landmark London, Can t think of anything that I didn t like in the hotel, The bed pillows Duvet were extra comfy the bathrooms are massive Overall Very Calm and luxurious atmosphere in the hotel
111565,Landmark London, The spa area and pool was dirty unfortunately The attitude of the ladies at the spa desk and pool area was unfriendly and stuck up Did not make us feel welcome and I have been to spas from around the world The pool and jacuzzi area was dirty and there were no robes slippers for us guests We had to go back to the room and get these before we could start our relaxation so disorganised Such a shame as this was the major let down to our trip , The waitresses Saturday evening at the winter garden for our dinner were absolutely faultless Impeccable service and attentive at all times You girls should be proud of your achievements We have dined around the world and we can say that you girls are amongst the best with service and delivery of overall dining experience 
111566,Landmark London, The superior deluxe bedroom was smaller than we thought it would be for the price we paid , Perfect location to get to central London attractions The staff were very helpful and polite 
111567,Landmark London, Don t use the hotel hair salon though The hairdresser is the most dogmatic and belligerent stylist I have ever met If you don t want to be listened to as a customer then go by all means Thinks he knows how best to do your hair and does not listen even though you complained the whole way through , Great location and friendly staff
111568,Landmark London, Pls put a good scale as we are in need to weight our self every day , I like the waiters specially their manager the Tunisian one he is really experienced knows perfectly how to behave customers and make them happy Many thanks to him and to his staff 
111569,Landmark London, More convenient hours for the children s pool time , The staff couldn t be more helpful and the hotel was just gorgeous Excellent food on the room service menu too
111570,Landmark London, A staff in winter garden quite rude to us at breakfast We has been the number of time before and that is the first bad experience , The room very big n comfortable and clean The receptionist very helpfull to let us late check out due to flight delay 
111571,Landmark London, Mattresses need updating, Cross the street to a great Underground station Get anywhere in London in less than 30 Plus the Marlybone High st are has all you could want shops and eating Beautiful hotel Great Staff Beautiful room 
111572,Landmark London, Too hot in the public rooms Didn t serve food all day in the restaurants we checked in at 2 30pm and couldn t get a sandwich unless we ordered room service Bed was to firm for our taste Over veiw is there are much better 5 star hotels within the same price bracket , Staff in the mirror bar Size of the room Convenient for the tube 
111573,Landmark London, First I realized that making booking through booking com is not a good choice because hotels provide the worst and lowest standard of rooms for any booking made through your website In addition to that my original booking was for twin bedroom but at the time of the check in the hotel asked me to pay additional 60 per night if I want to get twin beds The facility in the room provided was very poor The tap in the toilet was broken and they send a man to repair it while we were out of the hotel without informing us or even putting a notice on the door that someone is on the room We are Muslim coverd ladies and when we entered the toilet uncovered we were shocked and embarrassed to see a man This situation was very humiliating and not acceptable in our culture IT is very bad experience as there are other issues happened to us even after they changed the room In conclusion I decided not to make any booking through your website,No Positive
111574,Landmark London, Rooms look like they could be any old 1 star hotel room extremely expensive an overall tacky vibe to the hotel Simply a name high price and area that make the hotel seem fancy inside is just a large holiday in with a pretty main room where you can eat , There was a swimming pool
111575,Landmark London, No space available in the car park, All the staff we met were very helpful and friendly Lovely big bedrooms Excellent choice of food at the breakfast buffet Really conveniently located hotel just in front of Marylebone Station 
111576,Landmark London, The breakfast was good but i paid for 2 full English breakfast but changed the order too i full breakfast and ham and toast no also we wanted salom but had to pay extra for that come on now landmark 60quid for breakfast on a Sunday, Lots of things the room size was very good and the view
111577,Landmark London, We were allocated a smoking room which we didn t know until we were in the room itself The stale smell of smoke in the room was disgusting and as there were no external windows it was made worse What surprised me was that they have a whole floor of smoking rooms and it appears that most of the family rooms are on the designated smoking floor which is utterly crazy Whilst the staff were helpful to try and relocate us they couldn t as the only other family rooms were on the smoking floor For a 5 hotel it needs a refurb the communal carpets were dirty The kitchen extract was feeding directly into the pool spa area so smelt of fried sausages , Breakfast was excellent a real variety within the buffet 
111578,Landmark London, We had to change rooms as both of our rooms smelled so badly of smoke , The staff were brilliant and could not do enough including upgrading us to better rooms as our original rooms smelled of smoke The breakfast was great 
111579,Landmark London, Wish I had more time to take advantage of the spa Looked really good , I would certainly recommend the full English breakfast one of the best I ve had 
111580,Landmark London, Staff in the lobby were not very nice people the treatment I received was a bit like who s who in the hotel I felt the more money or the posher you was the better treatment you received , Great rustic feel especially at Christmas valet parkers and baggage handlers where very friendly 
111581,Landmark London, Parking a little expensive if you happen to need it But it s London why drive , We interacted with reception staff restaurant staff concierge door men cleaners and even the engineer All interactions were extraordinary when it came to attention to our queries and genuine helpfullness We couldn t have asked for a better experience especially as we stayed for 14 nights No slip ups or issued faced during the entire stay Tasteful decor well maintained hotel and a great location 
111582,Landmark London, Nothing in particular , Beautifully quiet spacious comfortable room The staff were all very attentive and couldn t be more helpful We look forward to a return visit 
111583,Landmark London, Nothing Wouldn t change a thing , I ve stayed in most hotels in London over the years I now only choose to stay at the Landmark The hotel is beautiful The staff are always wonderful and make you feel comfortable I ve stayed in several hotels where the staff look down there noses at you certainly not the case at the Landmark I would describe the service and stay as very similar to a stay on a top quality cruise Exceptional
111584,Landmark London, Was very disappointed with the lack of communication on usage of the leisure facilities with children Children can only use the pool for thirty minutes a day on a weekend This is crazy given it sells itself as a family hotel We also found the restaurants stuffy for children It seened like the hotel cared more about the people using the restaurant from outside of the hotel than the residents of the hotel itself Although the rooms were very comfortable in size the size of the beds were far too small and the mattresses were hard , Thought the room and hotel looked lovely The overall room size was good although the beds were quite uncomfortable and small 
111585,Landmark London, Surprised that there were no visible front door staff We came back on three separate occasions with luggage shopping etc and did not see anyone Not a great first impression for a 5 hotel, Great location huge rooms that are beautifully presented and all staff are lovely Richard the concierge also secured us a great last minute table at a lovely Thai restaurant 
111586,Landmark London, No faults whatsoever , Everything about the hotel was lovely staff were great and room food and facilities were amazing great location definitely going back again a big thanks to David the supervisor for the advise and sorting my girlfriends little birthday surprise cheers David and big thanks to the landmark hotel c u again soon 
111587,Landmark London, The only reason that I rated the facilities as good rather than excellent was because I didn t have time to use any of them Fabulous hotel , This is a great hotel Staff were excellent and extremely helpful Room was very comfortable and spacious Lovely special touches like carol singers round the Christmas tree in the evening 
111588,Landmark London, Burgers at 222 on Lower Level They were quite tough and tasteless , Staff was very helpful I was under the weather and thry checked on me repeatedly throughout the day Rooms were cozy and clean Restaurant was good 
111589,Landmark London, Food outside table upon arriving at the room seemed They wanted to clean our room once we were inside seem a bit unprepared in that respect Black marks and scratches on the cupboard doors and inside bathroom area 31 per person for breakfast They charge your card a deposit and say they will refund you Waiting on the refund , Staff and hotel decor was great Classy hotel in an awesome location Room was very spacious
111590,Landmark London, The check in out area is very busy and there can be a wait , The landmark is incredible Beautiful inside and out Very relaxed atmosphere and the livr harp piano gave it that extra edge Beautiful room and everything you need is a phone call away Ten minute walk from Oxford street and it is right outside the train station Couldn t fault the place 
111591,Landmark London,No Negative, The valet parking was swift and efficient Check in effortless Our rooms was comfortable and very clean We enjoyed the bar restaurant in the basement good service We liked the mirror bar Great location Great stay 
111592,Landmark London, The brunch gets booked up months in advance so wish we d have thought about it sooner , Great location beautiful hotel We made use of the pool which was great Just steps from the station so great for the tube All the staff were very friendly Would definitely stay here again 
111593,Landmark London, The breakfast is very poor There is a lot of choice but most of it isn t nice If the cost is included in the stay its ok but to charge 26 31 is disgraceful Its probably the worst cooked breakfast of any hotel weve stayed in,No Positive
111594,Landmark London, I asked for an extended check out time as my flight was late in the evening even with extra fee but they said that it was not possible , The classic design and the staff who were very helpful
111595,Landmark London, The design layout of the room is a bit dated , A true luxury hotel in the grand tradition Extremely large rooms with high quality amenities Nice spa facilities Location very close to the Marylebone station 
111596,Landmark London, We were scheduled to check in at 3pm however our room wasn t ready We had to wait for over an hour for access to our room , Wonderful dining Our room was comfortable and quiet Great location for a bit of pampering and relaxation 
111597,Landmark London, Nothing , The staff were immensely courteous and friendly The facilities particularly the spa and swimming pool were fabulous and it felt like we were abroad on holiday particularly in the Winter Garden 
111598,Landmark London, The hotel is in need of a facelift it has a lot of potential which is not being explored The spa for example needs to be urgently renovated , Very big rooms which is rare in London we also had a nice view from a big window 
111599,Landmark London, Two small things I collected our son and as a special treat told him he could come for a swim in the pool to be told children not permitted after 1030 it was half term No movies available and as we wanted a big chill in our room after a hectic weekend this was disappointing, The welcome we received was genuine and friendly Our special occasion was acknowledged and the ambience of the hotel was delightful 
111600,Landmark London, The procedure of check in needs to be considered more generous in as far as early check in is concerned I think the staff acted to the instructions policy of the hotel the policy could be more generous to the clients to encourage them to visit again , The ambience cleanliness and food were all good The staff was generous and courteous and met the expectations 
111601,Landmark London,No Negative, We were given an upgrade on arrival and the room was beautiful The whole hotel is amazing and the staff are so attentive Breakfast was well worth the money it was superb
111602,Landmark London, We were initially put in a smoking room after explaining to reception that we would prefer non smoking they were extremely helpful and moved us to a different room Breakfast was not part of our room deal unfortunately as a family of four it was too expensive to pay for per head shame as the choice and standard of food looked great , Bed was very comfy bathroom was very spacious Staff very friendly and helpful Food in the restaurant really nice along with staff who were great fun kept our children topped up with crisps whilst they waited for their food 
111603,Landmark London, It was disappointing to find out the pool had restricted access to children as this is promoted as a family friendly attraction of the hotel and was a big reason why I chose this particular hotel The beds seemed on the small size considering the luxury status the rest of the room exuded , We arrived early at 11 30 we were aware check in was at 3 but hoped a room would be ready or we could use the pool until it was time to go to our show The lady on reception had 3 options for us a room ready in 20 mins but may have some noise from a wedding later a room ready at 2 3pm or an upgrade that wouldn t be available until 6pm We decided on the upgrade as we were going out anyway We said we d take the children for a swim have some lunch then head out then we were told the pool had restricted hours for children Sensing our disappointment she rang down and asked if they were busy as they weren t they allowed us to take the children down for a swim which was very accommodating The room was beautiful and even had a play tent we decided on room service for dinner which the children thought was great All in all an amazing experience for us all Thank you 
111604,Landmark London, None , The hotel is absolutely beautiful The Spa inside is very good and the staff are really helpful We also had dinner at the Winter Garden and the food was lovely and they also gave us a surprise treat when they learned that we had just gotten married the day before 
111605,Landmark London,No Negative, We stayed for two weeks and found the staff friendly and helpful We truly enjoyed our stay Location is great Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely return 
111606,Landmark London, they put dirty teaspoons in our room basically i think they were not changed from previous guest bathrooms were pretty basic i just didn t see the buzz my bed was too hard it is a wow in the reception but not when you get to your room you are disappointed , the spa facilities are great intact very good the garden restaurant is brilliant the meal was lovely 
111607,Landmark London, The only blip was that we put a pair of shoes outside our room to be cleaned in a bag we found in the room provided for that purpose but when we looked outside the next morning the bag was not there neither was the complimentary Times we had ordered A call to reception quickly resolved this however shoes Times were brought to our room the shoes had been cleaned very well , An elegant hotel with its tall atrium Our room was spacious well appointed The location very close to Marylebone Station was excellent for us as we were catching a train at that station the next day 
111608,Landmark London, The mattress old and the pillows could be better, The service It was excellent All my 5 bags were lost and they push to the courier who had my bags to get them The bell captains are the best 
111609,Landmark London, Timing for kids at spool were restricted and kids couldnt enjoy due to the limited time , Great hotel good location and cheerful staff They are kids friendly which was my main concern as i had 2 year old and wasnt sure about it but all the staff were very helpful and kind 
111610,Landmark London, Nothing Well maybe some sunshine , Large very clean and wonderfully quiet bedrooms great bathrooms and the most comfortable bed I ve ever found in a hotel Very friendly and helpful staff Highly competent too Superb meal in the Garden Room 
111611,Landmark London, The rooms are big and fonctional but the decoration is a little old The personel at the reception desk has to be reviewed urgently as I have got unusual bad welcome and weird issues at the check in and check out with two different employees who are definitely not happy to work there , Very stylish hotel with a good service in general 
111612,Landmark London, Some of the pool staff were awful Unhelpful and unprofessional They simply did not seem to care about the clients One male member of staff went around the pool 45 minutes before closing saying we are closing now the staff need to go home A US couple just walked out saying never again A German sounding couple told me they would not be returning This all suggests poor staff selection lack of proactive management and a very poor micro culture in the spa staff My family were also woken in the early hours by drunken wedding revellers , The infrastructure is wonderful The reception staff were pleasant and welcoming The food is highly recommended 
111613,Landmark London, We loved everything , This hotel is gorgeous Very well maintained with really friendly staff Breakfast was simple but superb Wish we could have stayed longer than 3 days 2 nights Note although located next to Marylebone station we walked to the London Eye via Oxford St and Selfridges 
111614,Landmark London, The tube was right across the street but it only had one line Otherwise no negatives at all , Beautiful room Staff was very friendly and accommodating They even let us check in early after a red eye flight 
111615,Landmark London, After shopping we returned to the hotel on Saturday lunchtime to find no bar open The only place to have a drink was on side tables adjacent to the main restaurant which were clearly not for that purpose I really think a hotel should have a bar open at 1 30 pm, Smoking room and spa facilities
111616,Landmark London, No sound on TV when arrived but was sorted Water controls for bath didn t work and needed and engineer on Sunday morning which meant we were late to meet our friends for breakfast which was advertised at one price then had service charge added for breakfast which was basically a buffet No bar open at 2 00pm when we arrived so had to go to station to get a drink , Very upmarket but at a cost Valet parking worked well and was good value for London
111617,Landmark London, Breakfast not being included and being quite so expensive with no cheaper lighter alternative We were out for lunch so couldn t justify the 30 per head breakfast but no light room service alternative although plenty of local places to choose, Excellent service beautiful room and hotel Little touches thought of for our anniversary celebration and all the staff were excellent 
111618,Landmark London, 1 Source of room is not adequate to me P S but my mother perfect weak light in the guestroom different people have different preference so it depends 2 It s suggested to offer USB charger outlet or a USB hub with multiple outlets most of the US brand hotels are offering it now and it won t cost the hotel a lot i guess 3 There s only ONE elevator on EACH floor Our guestroom located at the North Wing while the elevator located at the South Wing We need to walk almost 2 blocks distance to the guestroom from the lift good exercise in the morning and a walking test after a day long shopping smile However we love our room because of the amazing view of Marylebone Station , 1 This is an old but well maintained hotel 2 all staffs are friendly and polite except a wateriness working in the Winter Garden impolitely keep chasing us to pay the breakfast bill 3 although the guestroom is a bit out dated design but everything is well maintained looking new and clean 4 polite friendly efficient and professional check in and check out 5 smart and friendly doormen it took only 2 minutes arriving my guestroom after my making call to the switchboard 6 big guestroom at very attractive price i believe the guestroom can occupy 2 more sets of 3 seats arm chair 7 polite and friendly housekeeping staffs 8 Very big bathroom toilet is in a individual room inside the bathroom the bathtub is extra large size the walk in shower is very sizable too All made with marble luxury 9 Very large flat screen TV with lot of channel available 10 Roomy closet and main entrance almost a junior suite in Paris hotel I like the little table next to the door which can hold my shopping bags 11 Soft light source in the guestroom which gave us a good sleep 12 Wonderful view of our guestroom lot of red brick building and the main entrance of Marylebone Station and Taxi stand 13 Convenience location just 30 seconds walk to Marylebone Station 10 minutes taxi ride to Hyde Park Corner 10 minutes taxi ride to St Pancras International 14 The Two Twenty Two bar is a great place to taste high quality of Fish and Chips this is my second favorite fish and chips in the town 15 Winter Garden serve excellent breakfast don t forget to try the Scottish egg there much better than the one we got from the cafe in Tower of London 
111619,Landmark London, Nothing we couldn t fault anything , Beautiful hotel we were lucky enough to be upgraded and the room was fabulous The staff were very attentative excellent 
111620,Landmark London, Breakfast was a little disappointing for five star , We had a free upgrade which was very nice Really friendly staff Late breakfast and check out meant we didnt have to rush 
111621,Landmark London,No Negative, Staff were very courteous and helpful Food was excellent especially the breakfast We were travelling as a group and we re looking for adjoining rooms to be near my elderly parents the hotel was full and the staff very kindly upgraded my parents to a suite which was very kind Highly recommend 
111622,Landmark London, There was nothing we did not like , Large comfy bed Fittings and furnishings were lovely The spa pool and sauna was superb The room was not ready at check in which we expected due to being quiet early but on our return our bag had been placed in our room for us which was a nice touch 
111623,Landmark London, The only glitch was that we had requested our room to be serviced when we were clearly going out physically requesting it in person at the concierge desk We had forgotten the do not disturb sign on and think that the use of common sense on part of the staff would have been in order during the situation where one wouldn t have requested the housekeeping and then not granted access to the room Needless to say the room wasn t made up by the time we returned which was frustrating and it was too late to ask them again at that point Otherwise no other complaints , Located ideally with direct access to Marylebone Station and a three minute walk from Baker Street station the Landmark epitomises luxury and comfort in the city of London The room was spacious and neat the bedding was comfortable and the staff were for the most part helpful and attentive We had dinner at the hotel scrumptious and drinks at the very cosy mirror bar While the rates are high they aren t out of the ordinary for a five star hotel in London Would stay here again and definitely recommend it to others 
111624,Landmark London, We visited the Mirror bar which was full and quite busy Perhaps there should be another bar area also and the only other one we noticed was in the 222 restaurant , Spacious hotel beautifully furnished and very comfortable room 
111625,Landmark London, The breakfast is too expensive especially for a family The swimming pool seemed a bit worn off and why is the water so muddy , The decoration of the hotel is very nice and the bar is good Gym equipment is good 
111626,Landmark London, I have been staying at the landmark for 10 years some the furniture is a bit beat up Needs a touch of renovation a few member of staff are just focused on getting a tip rather than service , big rooms and bathrooms perfect location for me at least for the most part staff was excellent good food beautiful lobby with big skylight 
111627,Landmark London,No Negative, Excellent from every aspect All of us wife son and my self absolutely enjoyed our stay Will definitely stay with them the next time I visit London 
111628,Landmark London, Couldn t open windows so had to have air con on all night which resulted in sore throats and a cold Quality of choice for tea and coffee making facilities the same as in a 3 hotel Poor comparison to Firmdale hotels , Brilliant location
111629,Landmark London, Unfortunately our room had been smoked in prior to our arrival not the hotels fault but the only fault we could find , Just an all round excellent hotel 
111630,Landmark London, The mattress on my bed I have a bad back I had to ask for a doona to be put double on the mattress for me to lie on and this was done immediately on request and it was satisfactory but not ideal , I have stayed at numerous Hotels around the world but my Landmark Hotel experience is the best I have experienced The staff and service are faultless so courteous prompt to attend to ones requests The Hotel itself is so beautiful everywhere you turn there are amazing features and the flower arrangements which are changed weekly are breathtaking I loved the bathroom in my room the tap fittings and only an Aussie would mention this but the toilet paper is amazing The whole atmosphere as you walk around is a feeling of goodwill I have just arrived back in Sydney this morning and my thought was that I miss my daughter London and the Landmark Hotel I cannot wait for my return hopefully next year The location is great close to all forms of transport and interesting shops I will recommend The Landmark Hotel to my friends with confidence Thank you for a wonderful stay 
111631,Landmark London,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in a great location Breakfast was very good Staff is very helpful and attentive Rooms are spacious and very comfortable Very comfortable bed 
111632,Landmark London, Spa service was poor Therapist was kate for my treatment no apology or explanation Check out staff was unprofessional and uninterested Had to make a formal complaint from home about small matters that could have been sorted at check out Instead the issues were shrugged off by check out staff Shocking for a hotel of this calibre The complaint was dealt with in a mediocre manner I spent in excess of a grand for a one night stay Not worth the bother , Great check in and super room
111633,Landmark London, Nothing, Breakfast was lovely Fantastic staff so welcoming and very very helpful with any questions Always acknowledged the children and very friendly and kind to them 
111634,Landmark London, Leaving , Being spoilt from the moment we arrived at the hotel and our cases were whisked away to our room Little added touches for our grandson s 18th 
111635,Landmark London, As a Solo traveler this is an expensive option as the rooms a large enough to have a party in which is not much use when you are on your own , Location adjacent to the station which is great 
111636,Landmark London, Breakfast was a little disappointing limited options and Sometimes it felt a bit too warm inside the room , Magnificent glass roof atrium cozy rooms excellent staff nice doormen superb location next to Marlybone station and lively atmosphere 
111637,Landmark London, Be prepared for a loud noise from the door lock a few seconds after closing the door it made us jump every time even though we knew it was coming , Location location location One minute walk from the station Warm rather than stuffy welcome at reception Spacious comfortable room Swam unimpeded lengths in the 15m pool before going out for dinner No hassle about trains home after dinner just fell into bed Ate brunch out in Marylebone High Street followed by a walk in Regents Park before collecting our cases stored by the obliging concierge and strolling across to catch our train home 
111638,Landmark London, We were looking forward to a real breakfast on the morning of our departure but when we arrived there was a 20 30 minute wait for a table so we had to go elsewhere to eat I got the feeling that quite a few of the people eating were not residents so the hotel should either keep tables free for resident guests or make it clear on check in that a reservation for breakfast which is a complete oxymoron to me is advisable , We arrived at the hotel well before normal check in time but our room was already ready for us which was a real bonus and made the rest of our day much more relaxed The room itself was spacious quiet comfortable and as is always the case at the Landmark beautifully appointed Staff were uniformly friendly and courteous The bar is intimate with good ambience and an excellent selection of drinks 
111639,Landmark London, As there are some VIPs coming the staff is impolite to other guests You can set prohibit areas but beyond that areas you can t ask the guest where you are going I suggest the hotel close the whole hotel and reject all other bookings when they need to serve the VIPs , Spacious room
111640,Landmark London, Me and my partner could not find no faults with the hotel, FOR A FIRST EXPERIENCE IN A TOP CLASS HOTEL IT MEET TO ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS ROOM EXCELLENT FOOD PERFECT CUSTOMER FOCUSED QUALITY OF SERVICE FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM EXCELLENT 
111641,Landmark London, Swimming pool could be wider and bigger Heating system not that great Prefer radiators instead of combined blow heating air con which never really works , Great location right next to Marylebone Station 
111642,Landmark London, Staff at the door bell boys or porters are very annoying they keep comenting on how many bags i have in my hand after shopping , Rooms are spacious location is perfect
111643,Landmark London, The restaurant more expensive than the famous Savoy restaurant with a low quality of service due to the poor level of some waiters and medium to poor quality of the food The swimming pool service no respect of privacy you have to be faced with intrusive visits of the woman staff in the changing room Never saw that before Inadmissible , The welcome on arrival the spacious and clean room the breakfast
111644,Landmark London, The television was a bit dated and hard to use , Fabulous building We were able to check in at 11am meaning we could get sorted and get out The location is great walking distance to baker st with lots of places to eat and drink The spa was a lovely extra T he room was lovely and very peaceful 
111645,Landmark London, Staff not engaged restaurant host terrible not helpful at all could not sort out the table we choose in an half empty restaurant Pure laziness Shoes didn t turn up in the morning I have to ring and waited till 8am Cleaning terrible especially in the swimming pool area Room was clean , Location Facilities
111646,Landmark London, The bed didn t have a proper duvet cover it was just two bed sheets sandwiched together with a dirty duvet under , Excellent hotel stunning interior and great gym
111647,Landmark London,No Negative, Had a wonderful stay with my wife 3 children aged 8 5 3 months We booked for 2 nights for Christmas All the staff were amazing very friendly and polite and always willing to help The family room was spacious and very clean We booked the 5 course Xmas dinner and wasn t disappointed with the quality The breakfast was very good The kids enjoyed the swimming pool and hot tub was great I would love to stay here again as all the family had a wonderful time Just wanted to say a big thank you to all the staff for making it a wonderful stay 
111648,Landmark London, Rooms are tired and require an upgrade Housekeeping needs a rev up numerous things not done each day and absolutely no need to open a guests drawer to place a breakfast room menu in there Upon objection registered at front desk this was stopped , Beautiful winter garden and public space Excellent food services especially concierge services were outstanding Position of hotel directly opposite Marylebone station very convenient Professional staff 
111649,Landmark London, The spa very disappointed with kid s hour and the increased noise levels during my treatment It was not very relaxing , The d cor is splendid and the staff really cater to you plus the location was prime
111650,Landmark London, Noise music from the life band playing in the atrium can be heard innthe rooms facing the atrium Unacceptable if you want to finally sleep long hours , Beautiful atrium and spacious rooms 
111651,Landmark London, Location of tv in room Would have preferred tv to be on wall in front of the bed and not have to turn sideways to look at it Bath water wasn t very hot even after we had turned it full on to Hot The decor of the room was very plain and a little dreary, The bed was very comfortable and spacious for two people The room was spacious
111652,Landmark London,No Negative, Great location helpful staff excellent food very clean attention to detail AND a very quiet room which is saying something in London Excellent value we will return 
111653,Landmark London, Food was not great esp breakfast had it delivered to the room Expensive tray charge, Amazing big room with roll in shower ideal for wheel chair travler Location beside Marlyborne statin meters from vital baker street with tons of shops and resturant 
111654,Landmark London, A very long wait for breakfast we went and ate elsewhere The air freshener smell everywhere was very unpleasant The traffic noise made it difficult to sleep , Excellent staff So helpful and professional The Spa area was just perfect The good size room and Molton Brown bathroom products Lots of clean towels every day 
111655,Landmark London, Service charge for bar drinks cheeky as one cocktail was 17 pounds Breakfast overpriced so skipped that and ate outside , Spa is lovely Staff warm and friendly Treatments great 
111656,Landmark London, The temperature of the room was a little too high even with a c on and the mattress on the bed was a bit too hard so I didn t have the most comfortable nights sleep , The hotel environment was breath taking The atrium area was beautiful and the spa was excellent Our executive room was fantastically luxurious with a great view out over the atrium Breakfast was delicious and very enjoyable to eat in the atrium dining area 
111657,Landmark London, not an inside court facing suite They are definitely nicer the ones overlooking the winter garden I usually always get them , the wintergarden breakfast and bed very comfortable 
111658,Landmark London, No fresh milk in the room inward facing room I like daylight We normally stay at the Athenaeum but have tried the Ritz and Sanderson On balance I prefer the Athenaeum , Lovely building good gym and pool
111659,Landmark London, The concierge gave us a bum steer about a pub He didn t know it was limited to 2 bookings on Sunday , The ELEGANCE The flowers The Winter Garden 
111660,Landmark London, We had no bad experience However the location of the bars and there opening hours was not clear in the beginning but we soon learned , The spa swimming pool and its facilities especially the soft drinks and fruit available there also the soft fruit in the room suite which was very spacious welcoming and practical 
111661,Landmark London, Coming into the hotel on Sunday night when the Bayern Munich football team were arriving we were stopped from entering one of the lifts which was obviously reserved for the players Whilst we are reasonable people we are also paying guests of the hotel and whoever you are no one wants to feel like a second class citizen , Beautiful hotel setting rooms and very helpful staff A real treat 
111662,Landmark London, It was a small thing but we only had towels bathrobes etc for two people even though we were three and waited for them to inspect the room after cleaning it It was immediately rectified when I called housekeeping though Our bathroom was too cold but that was the only minus as regards the comfort of the room , The staff particularly the doormen were exceptionally kind We had a chat with Kevin every time he saw us and he helped us with various information for our stay Location wise it was excellent for travelling with the Tube Marylonebone station was right behind the hotel The water in the pool was warm and pleasant which isn t always the case at even the best hotels Lovely breakfast buffet in a splendid atrium
