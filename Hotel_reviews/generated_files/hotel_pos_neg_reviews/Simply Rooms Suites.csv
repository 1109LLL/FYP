103716,Simply Rooms Suites, nowhere to leave your luggage except under the stairs at reception so didnt feel safe to leave luggage, good value and an upmarket hotel room in a converted victorian house complete with air conditioning and a short walk to the train station
103717,Simply Rooms Suites, Room wasn t ready when we arrived so got moved to a floor much higher up with no lift Had a dirty towel and bathroom had mold Struggled to get through the thin hallways to our room as they were stacked high with washing , Comfortable bed and nice looking room Good toilet roll for once which is always nice 
103718,Simply Rooms Suites, Top floor was a bit of a huff and puff wouldnt recommend if you have bad health would request a lower floor as there is no lift , Very modern and simple
103719,Simply Rooms Suites, Inadvertently signed off paying in U S vs GBP He did not point that out when he asked me to sign I should have read what I was signing carefully , The reception helped me lug the bag to the top floor 
103720,Simply Rooms Suites,No Negative, Friendly staff pleasantly surprised by facilities quiet comfortable air con in room enjoyed my stay good value for money would happily stay there again 
103721,Simply Rooms Suites, Lack of cleaning dust and a sticky and unclean floor Top up of tea milk and botteled water as promised did not work We had one bottle of water from wednesday til saturday Beds were not done during two days and i had to clean the toilet myself a blue detergent was splashed out in toilet but not removed When I checked in at 16 pm the staircase was filled with dirty linen garbage and a very bad smell from suageproblems was dominating the whole staircase After reclaiming most of the problems were solved but it is not ok to use ones holiday on these matters We are not comming back to this hotel it was not a four star hotel at all just very simple all the way through And the price is a rip off 630 pounds for 5 days , Bed was ok
103722,Simply Rooms Suites, The shower was a bit old and could do with an upgrade but it worked fine, Staff were very friendly location was great and the room was a good size and included a mini fridge 
103723,Simply Rooms Suites, 1 RATS Rats squeaking all night from somewhere around the room 2 Wash basins were clogged Had to change room because the hotel owner decided to paint next door room at 8 00 pm We couldn t stand the paint smell 3 Double bed was so BIG that only one person can sleep easily 4 Every time had to login to their hotel registration site to gain WiFi access and that too deliberately of very slow speed so that customers can upgrade to faster speed Even my 3G speed was faster than hotel wifi 5 If anyone travelling by car please avoid this place location as the parking charges near hotel are 37 per day 6 Rating from me 0 Zero Star , Nothing 
103724,Simply Rooms Suites, My stay was a DISASTER I suggest the name of the hotel is be changed into Simply Crooks Thieves I have to tell that my room was filthy and my experience became even worse after my stay A few hours after having checked out I realised that I forgot my electircal toothbrush in the bathroom of my room I called the hotel they said that they had not found anything in my room As I knew for sure that I did leave it in the bathroom I called back a few hours later then they said that they would check with the cleaning person again One day later I called them and they said that indeed the cleaning person had found the electrical toothbrush but had thrown it away I asked why they first said they found nothing and lateron got another anwer I did not get an explanation furthermore they said that this was something between me and the cleaning person who I don t know I even don t know whether the person is a man or a woman and that the hotel has nothing to do with it I proposed that the hotel would give my electrical toothbrush back or a compensation of 40 euro After a month I still got no answer If I try to call them they even don t pick up the phone anymore Congratulations Simply Crooks Thieves ,No Positive
103725,Simply Rooms Suites, Very difficult to connect to the internet , Great location because I was attending an exhibition at the Olympia and it is very close 3 min walk Nice room nice staff 
103726,Simply Rooms Suites, floor was dusty enough to make my socks a bit grubby that s it , Comfortable bed fantastic shower and water pressure perfect location for work meeting in Kensington village close to tube
103727,Simply Rooms Suites, The bathroom was a little small , The room was clean and comfortable there was a hairdryer and an ironing board along with tea making facilities Ideally located for Olympia The staff are friendly and helpful 
103728,Simply Rooms Suites, No food facility or breakfast but there is a good breakfast place around the corner 3 4 minutes walk away The rooms are very small but do the job , convenience and location
103729,Simply Rooms Suites, Our room was close to reception so a teeny bit noisy in the night when someone was talking a lot Nothing major , We were pleasantly surprised at the hotel as we chose it purely because it was the cheapest Yes the twin room was small No 2 but perfectly adequate with ensuite power shower flat screen TV and mini kitchen with fridge for us to self cater The guy on reception was incredibly helpful 
103730,Simply Rooms Suites, I had a sync clogged and told it 2 times to the portie But it was not fixed until my departure My colleagues booked a twin room And on arrival they tried to give them room with 1 bed Only when they told they are about to call booking they was given the right room The personnel does not speaks well English No breakfast, I was staying there for exhibition in Olympia and for that it s a perfect place Literally 3 min walk And to the center of London food access by bus
103731,Simply Rooms Suites, No lobby In my opinion this hotel is good but doesn t deserve 4 star , Comfort and clean Good staff specially a receptionist called Andre from Portugal 
103732,Simply Rooms Suites, Just little things thought entrance reception area could do with a good clean Also tea station wasn t refilled properly and iron was not good but overall v satisfactory , Well laid out room with everything we needed
103733,Simply Rooms Suites, Noise outside on Saturday night early hours of morning Air conditioning operation not explained Large window blind keeps dropping down when lowered Was the same last year so not fixed , Unfussy and easy going versus a hotel Simple and uncluttered 
103734,Simply Rooms Suites, improve the smell of the room to something better the nearest station is the kensington olympia overground the west kensington 8min walk in the map is farther than i thought , the bed is comfy and there are extra pillows the cost is reasonable for a hotel in london 
103735,Simply Rooms Suites, Shower wasn t clean upon arrival remaining hairs from last visitors in the sink The mattress was uncomfortable ok for short term but not for long time , The staff was very nice friendly and helpful It s a good deal for a private room comparing with prices of Airbnb or hostels more central 
103736,Simply Rooms Suites, Mixed rooms up and had to move after showering second night was messed up and had to take bags with us to check in again on second day third room was dirty and beds were slept in ,No Positive
103737,Simply Rooms Suites,No Negative, Customer service was brilliant asked if we could book another night and they was happy to help no trouble at all The bed was really comfy nice shower and the Air conditioning was a bonus 
103738,Simply Rooms Suites, Could hear quite a lot of noise from other rooms but wouldn t put me off staying again for a short stay , Brilliant location for Olympia and staff on Reception extremely polite and helpful Rooms decorated very nicely 
103739,Simply Rooms Suites, There was 4 flights of stairs only one mug and reception were unable to give us another one as they didn t understand our request The shower fell to bits when we used it and the water wasn t very warm , Location was perfect and the staff on arrival were very friendly
103740,Simply Rooms Suites, Staff answer phone with a grunt Poor English Gave totally wrong info on parking Many people cancel this hotel due to this wrong info When pointed out to the clear street sign still no actual understanding of parking times No coins available for meters Let s the place down as its great apart from the lacklustre staff, Good location clean and modern
103741,Simply Rooms Suites, The room was very small The cleaning was very bad The beds were badly made the towels ware not changed very bad experience Wouldn t stay there again , Location
103742,Simply Rooms Suites, Mini fridge in bedroom did not work Constant noise from outside so did not sleep well But for the price I can t really complain , The location was good and the hotel was very clean and decor was lovely Also the staff were very friendly 
103743,Simply Rooms Suites, Small twin single beds and shower room was tiny Staff were all pleasant and it did the job for a night Would not choose an extended stay there Also parking was an issue the following day , Location was pleasant not too busy and in a nice area Also close to Olympia 10 mins walk
103744,Simply Rooms Suites, This three floor hotel is more like a family owned business which does not have elevator and didn t offer us help with our luggage when we checked in The room we had is small and the floor was creaked when people start moving They don t have restaurant and had to go somewhere else to have breakfast Also there is 10 mins walk to the tube station , It s clean and close to TLS contact 
103745,Simply Rooms Suites, Very very small rooms i am sure we will get the bigger rooms in London for same price lot of noise from air condition system, Staff very polite and helpful 
103746,Simply Rooms Suites, One of the rooms we had booked had someone come in the room in the middle of the night This was appalling of a hotel given this was paid for We would not expect our privacy to be jeopardize and also this is a massive security infringement I Was really disappointing with this ,No Positive
103747,Simply Rooms Suites, The kettle was very dirty and there were used tea spoons on the table which was really nasty , the hotel is easy to find and in a quiet area Also the room is quiet 
103748,Simply Rooms Suites, The shower wasn t great I m afraid , The location was brilliant for our needs The room was extremely comfortable and the idea of having a kitchenette in the room was great meaning we could make our own drinks and not run out of condiments like in most hotel Was pretty quiet too given the location 
103749,Simply Rooms Suites, Superficially it was fine although there was no voluntary effort made to replenish any of the refreshments until requested , It was convenient for the Hammersmith Apollo
103750,Simply Rooms Suites,No Negative, What s not to like I am only afraid that if I say more loads of people will turn up and they will be full the next time A real find beautifully appointed and quiet in London Great food around the corner 
103751,Simply Rooms Suites,No Negative, Great place could not fault anything short stroll to bus tube and restaurants Managed to park right outside the door and as we stayed a Saturday night only had to pay for a couple of hours parking for the whole weekend The room was very well appointed considering the price and spotlessly clean My wife loved the speaker system in the bathroom Would definitely recommend to anyone needing a short stay in this area 
103752,Simply Rooms Suites,No Negative, first of all the steep stairs no lift tiny room noisy bathroon as there was a speaker in our bathroom bringing all the noise from the other room very outdated rooms dirty ironing board air conditioner dripoing water just 10 min post turning it on mobile phone was nearly ruined not happy at all not going there ever again
103753,Simply Rooms Suites, The bed was very small I m 180 and half my legs were out of the bed The sheets were small too so either my feet or my upper part of the body weren t covered Had a dirty towel , Nice location
103754,Simply Rooms Suites, Very small room with tiny windows that you can barely see out of Kind of like being in a basement I found some bugs in our room too The daily housekeeping was mediocre they left us without toilet paper once and put two spoons we had used and left on the counter away in the drawer without washing them The room was way too small for what it was Could barely use the kitchenette and the two of us were tripping over each other , Good location close to transit and some attractions walkable Friendly staff and the rooms were relatively comfortable Wifi was good 
103755,Simply Rooms Suites, The location was a little out of the way and would have been hard to find if we hadn t had gps on our phones Luckily it wasn t a problem for us but I would suggest looking up directions beforehand if you don t have maps on your phone That being said the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from West Kensington underground and easy to find your way after you ve been there once , The decoration was great and we got a nice little tray of goodies with more than just your standard teabags and instant coffee Definitely very good quality for what we paid for 
103756,Simply Rooms Suites, a little more space and extra drawer and wardrobe space , The nearness to the venue we attended The bed was comfy and the room air conditioned
