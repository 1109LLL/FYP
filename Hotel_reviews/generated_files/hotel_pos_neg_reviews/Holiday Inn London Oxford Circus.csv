215482,Holiday Inn London Oxford Circus, Radiator in room could not be turned off very very warm Lots of noise from service staff at 4 30 am Substantial building works going on next door and very noisy until about 6 00 pm, Fab location for Central London Very welcoming staff
215483,Holiday Inn London Oxford Circus, Generally it was a good hotel the staff were courteous enough but in our room the shower leaked and wasn t the cleanest the bed light fitting was fitted poorly and was a hazard as it kept swinging down and there were trays of food left down the hallways for extended periods of time even though staff were about please note that despite these few qualms I would stay again , Generally it was a good hotel the staff were very courteous and the food was good
