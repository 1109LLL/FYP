28758,Thistle Kensington Gardens, We had a family room with an extra bed the mattress was pure springs and went to complain and they did nothing until we got back in the evening and complained again they also forgot to tidy our room , It was in an excellent position and enjoyed walking through Kensington Gardens
28759,Thistle Kensington Gardens, No Porter No security at entrance at ground floor so any one can enter the hotel property dangerous because reception at first floor Furnature outdated and full is scratches bathroom very old design and bad smell room carpet is very old and full of stains overrated hotel bad manners and attitude from the Asian porter breakfast with v limited varieties suitable For foreigners but not for Arabic ppl for sure and too much expensive 18 person Pictures in booking com not same as reallity Bad experience in this hotel I will not return back ever , Location

28762,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Very small room stubbed my toe many times trying to walk around bed Not much room for anything else besides bed No fan in bathroom not fun Bathroom did not have proper door was saloon type door 2 small swing panes a little odd No small fridge in room No coffee maker Not much room to place luggage, Location Room cleanliness Kettle in room with complimentary coffee tea biscuits Comfy bed Quiet
28763,Thistle Kensington Gardens, No wash face clothes were given You had to request everyday The carpet needed shampooing thus discarded completely The elevators were small and dysfunctional , The location was excellent near the Queensway underground and bus line to Piccadilly circus also in walking distance to Marble Arch and directly across the street from Hyde Park 
28764,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Room described as double deluxe was quite small You can get better room for the same price in different hotel, Bed was really comfy staff very helpful
28765,Thistle Kensington Gardens, First impression of the hotel was not great with Service station in front of the hotel No fridge in the room and during summer needed to keep water and drinks cool Always had trouble using the card keys to access the lifts and then the rooms Lifts access was a nightmare Water fridge in foyer with complimentary drinks was often empty , Great view over Kensington Gardens Bar was relaxing Breakfast was excellent Location was superb for holiday makers Room was always made up beautifully everyday Bed was very comfortable Interaction with staff was always good Front desk restaurant and room service staff were always helpful and lovely to deal with 
28766,Thistle Kensington Gardens, For the price we were not impressed Upon arrival 20 minutes beyond check in the room was not ready We had somewhere to be so I explained we couldn t wait at which point a different room was found It had a bit of a cigarette smoke smell to it and the bed was very uncomfortable We aren t usually ones to leave bad reviews but other than the location I could not see how the price was justified , The location particularly for an event at Hyde Park was great It is also close to tube stations so getting around was very easy 
28767,Thistle Kensington Gardens, During a phone call to the hotel they said they would either give us an accessible room or a walk in shower as my husband is disabled We got a bath but as it was just one night we managed The air conditioning was not working in the room and although there was a fan it was very hot I would not like to have stayed in that room more than one night for these reasons , Parking available was important Room clean and comfortable Staff friendly Breakfast was very nice Good location near tubes and Paddington station and Hyde Park Near to restaurants and shops

28769,Thistle Kensington Gardens, 2nd floor room 206 constant clonking noise either from lift shafts or generators that were outside our bedroom window the show cushions and runner on the bed were filthy if you are going to have them on beds then at least clean them regularly Bedroom floor looked like it hadn t been vacuumed in a while and was dirty Made sure I wore something on my feet at all times , Staff pleasant and good location for Hyde park
28770,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Lifts had gremlins during my stay and took about 20 minutes at one stage to get to my room Room had iron but no ironing board , The park view from the 9th floor is great Room is comfortable and feels like it has had an overhaul recently Although it was rather on the small side it is ok for a short stay I had an Executive room and looking at the room map on the door it looks like the standard rooms are not much more than cupboards The bathroom was super small but to be fair it was nicely done with a good shower

28772,Thistle Kensington Gardens,No Negative, It was great being across from Hyde Park We could walk up to Portobello Road and to Knightsbridge It s great having the Waitrose grocery below the hotel so we could grab a sandwich or soda before going up for the evening I was especially thankful for the free bottles of water in the lobby the hotel supplied This helped so much each morning as we were on our way out for the days adventure 
28773,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Very small rooms Expensive car parking costs and little or no information about which buses tube to get to and from the hotel into the centre , Location was good and ready access to local buses Rooms clean 
28774,Thistle Kensington Gardens, A small complaint The carpet in our room was rather shabby and the little table next to the bed could have a drawer or some space underneath But in my view this is not that important but if refurbishments have to be done it could be considered , The reception and welcome of Esmeralda was exceptionally friendly and helpful Although there was obviously a computer problem she made every effort to provide a spacious room with a view on Hyde Park My husband who arrived later was also warmly welcomed and my friend got a room on the same floor It was great to step out of the hotel cross a road and enjoy a walk in the beautiful park Queensway with shops restaurants and two tube stations are very close A perfect stay 
28775,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Room could be a bit bigger but it was still ok for London , Great location hotel staff super friendly and helpful providing advise and appropriate support Very nice breakfast Very reasonable price for airport shuttle The basic room was clean comfortable Surroundings are quiet and nice You have all sorts of transportation available nearby including the tube and city bikes It s an ok value for the money for London as everything s expensive there

28819,Thistle Kensington Gardens, For a 4 stars hotel you d expect more than what they had to offer no bell boy for the luggage it is a building where u had to get to the 1st floor for reception So dont expect a lobby elevator is so tiny it barley fits 3 people We had many bags and they wouldnt fit in the elevator room key card keeps jamming and he elevator wont start without it There is actually an issue with the elevator as when u press your floor it taked you back down or i stays in its place even when u insert your room key housekeeping dont answer the phone You should try calling many times until u gey lucky reception dont answer the phone You should try many times wifi was horrible It kept disconnecting And when u r connected it is unbelievably slow Informed the reception about it and they said the Tech team was not available bathroom was very very tiny bath towels were not clean at check in One had hair and lipstick on it room carpet old and unclean no refregerator scratched up furnature the sink in the bathroom was jammed the water kept floating the house keeping make the bed only and clean the toilet The trash can in the bed room stayed the same the sink in the bathroom kept floding The water would not drain , the location as it has a stop for many tour buses entrance for the hyde park a gas station on the same building as the hotel that has a mini market

28824,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Only 2 pillows on the bed so would have been nice to have 2 extra pillows in the wardrobe in case wanted Tea coffee facilities in room minimal i e 2 teabags 2 white sugars etc so you had to choose cuppa at night after long day walking about London or one in the morning before going for breakfast , Staff were very friendly Our room was ready when we arrived an hour early so we were able to check in straight away Bar reasonably priced for London Breakfast fabulous great choice constantly being refreshed

28828,Thistle Kensington Gardens, The breakfast was appalling all the breakfast items where cold and considering the fact we went down at 9am I find this bizarre we queued for twenty minutes but when you consider one large table is used by staff to sort knives and forks while around 6 7 tables remained uncleared from the previous diners The air conditioning didn t work which meant sleeping in a sweat box for two nights,No Positive

28846,Thistle Kensington Gardens, 1 The road in front of the hotel was under construction by bus it may take up to 40 minutes plus to get to marble arch 2 The house keeping in the hotel is till 2 30 pm you have to be out of the room by that time or your room will not be cleaned 3 The room card is also used for the lift to get you to your room but it is sensitive enough to activate the lift you may remain for 3 minutes or more trying to get the lift to function, 1 The room was overlooking the Hyde park very nice view to wake up on 2 There is grocery store Waitrose underneath the hotel this was very handy 3 The hotel is 5 minutes walk from both Queensway station and Lancaster gate station 4 The hotel is 5 minutes walk from restaurants shops and gift shops of Queensway road

28849,Thistle Kensington Gardens, The staff at breakfast struggled to accomodate us as we needed a standard height table for the high chair They suggested a high table and a low one first At dinner they had run out of burgers for the kids menu We were given an adult cheeseburger and charged for a kids meal A nice jesture but they should have given us the option to choose something else as actually the burger was way to large and dense The travel cot did not have a blanket with it There should be a baby changing table in the toilets by reception The lifts were a little small and only just held two adults and a buggy , Location was excellent and we had a lovely view of Hyde Park The bed was comfortable and there was enough space in the room 
28850,Thistle Kensington Gardens, personel Sometimes my colleague and me were treated like guests and sometime we were treated like trash Especially on friday the 18th at check out time The ladies at the desk were unable to hide their contempt for us and other guests They also tried to get me to pay a bill that was not mine When I could finally see the bill after many requests almost begging it proved the fact not to be mine There was no apology only a disdainful look My colleague tried to print his boarding pass at the desk in vain Only when a friendly Italian colleague from the desk employees went to interfere we finally got the print , location they cannot screw that up
28851,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Cups dirty in room and wooden tops on drawers damaged Stains on carpet but it was just somewhere to sleep while we looked round London and got a great deal so fine, Good location right next to central line underground Excellent breakfast and comfy bed

28855,Thistle Kensington Gardens, For an executive suite we stayed at room 919 have to say the bathroom was tiny and this is why comfort and value was average We have stayed in many Thistle hotels before so this one was disappointing but to do with room and bathroom size Can t imagine what the standard rooms would be like , Bed and views were great 
28856,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Breakfast was poor for 12 Machine coffe which was awful Had dinner when we got to hotel and was disappointed with lack of choice on menu Was expensive for a lite bite , Good location Bed was very comfortable and stayed in nice quiet room 
28857,Thistle Kensington Gardens, A few issues with the room but the staff whilst miserable duly sorted straight away Charging for parking at 25 per day when it used to be secure but now offered to anyone from the street is very unfair Noise from families with kids playing football is an issue as it would seem they get preference as never any rooms available to over look the park but the families with kids always have these rooms , Location was perfect for me
28858,Thistle Kensington Gardens, When we came back from the theater me and my partner decided to have a drink at the bar My partner was asked what he would like but he wanted to see the wine menu first so once he went back to the bar 2 minutes later the bartender tells him he can no longer pay by car or cash and can only room charge it It would have been really ideal if he told us that from the start instead of wasting time looking t the menu only to discover we had to go back out for a drink ,No Positive

28921,Thistle Kensington Gardens, The hotel is above a petrol station so from the outside looks like it won t be much but actually the rooms etc are great so don t be put off Only minor thing is the pillows are not very comfy a bit cheap so an upgrade on the quality here would improve the overall comfort The interior of the wardrobe could also do with a quick paint to bring up to the standards of the rest of the room however a very minor aesthetic issue that didn t detract from a great stay overall , Reception staff were very friendly helpful upgraded me for free and kindly retrieved something I left behind in my room Room was spacious huge bed lovely view of Hyde park from the top floor and good air con Very quiet despite being on a main road Great location 5 min walk from Queensway tube Free wifi Would definitely recommend

28925,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Service charge in bar and bistro does this go to staff who do the work I am by no means averse to tipping but prefer to do so in a freer way I didn t take breakfast but got the impression the breakfast room was quite small What does value for money mean If you want to stay in a reasonable hotel in central London it is expensive , The friendly staff and good location for bus and tube routes The hotel was quiet and my room was cleaned and serviced to a good standard The standard of food in the bistro bar was also good I woulod stay in this hotel again 
28926,Thistle Kensington Gardens, You had to use key card for elevator that often work after 3rd of 4th time to press the level number If you left your key card behind or your partner had it The hotel is expensive but unfortunately most hotels in london are this at least had amazing location right across the kensington gardens , The bed was very comfortable and room was quiet even tho the windows were off to busy Bayswater road If you closed the curtons the room was pitch black Room was spacious and clean Loved the choice at the breakfast it was delicious Coffee wasn t very good but it is the same at most hotels

28931,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Quiet Small enough for it to feel intimate Friendly and helpful staff but food selection very limited Breakfast was always a challenge because the kitchen staff took a long time to top up finished food in the buffet , Convenient location A short walk to Queens Way subway A comfortable walk to Notting Hill Gate and Portobello Market Lots of cafes pubs and restaurants in these I mentioned And Kesington Gardens is just across the busy Bayswater toad 
28932,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Unappealing from the exterior but not a big issue The whole point being that you re paying to stay inside right Reception area feels a little dated and bar restaurant wasn t better than average , Good location close to Paddington and Bayswater Handy garage Waitrose on the ground floor Pretty good room service menu tasty fish and chips for a hungry tired business traveller Would stay again

28937,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Overall breakfast was good but some pastries were served cold , We arrived 2hrs before checkin time and the room was already available at 12pm Check in was straight forward and receptionist was friendly and knowledgeable 
28938,Thistle Kensington Gardens, The attitude of one of the staff members at the reception when dealing with the late check out request was appalling I have requested a late check out when booking via booking com yet it seemed that there was no communication or updates to the hotel regarding this matter Therefore my card did not work on the elevator nor in the bedrooms When approached to the reception I was disturbed by the attitude shown by the member of staff at the desk , The size of the deluxe king bed
28939,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Room is not clean Dirts scattered all over carpet Ventilation in room is bad Uncomfortable and hard to breathe Air condition is not working well Really would like to get out of the room as earliest as possible Very small room comparing to price , Room view of Kensington Gardens Location is opposite the garden

28952,Thistle Kensington Gardens, For 100 a night room expected a slightly larger room The room was so small it was not easy to walk around the bed without maneuvering around something like the desk or wall mounted TV The draw in the desk where the Tea Coffee was couldn t be opened without physically moving the bed out of the way , Good decor in room very clean very comfy bed decent selection of complimentary tea coffee with kettle Well located opposite Hyde park Good selection for breakfast Friendly and helpful staff London Bus Tour pick up point right outside hotel Near london underground Train station Walking distance from Edgeware Road Marble Arch Oxford Circus Access to many bus routes Well situated

28955,Thistle Kensington Gardens, No storage space for anything other than hanging clothes No space for my suitcase The TV was poor very grainy picture the Menu Guide and info buttons on the remote did nothing so it was difficult to find the normal channels some which actually weren t even there and the radio only had 2 stations Compared to Premier Inn the technology side was poor If I d paid full price for my stay I would have been more upset to have a poor TV in a luxury hotel However the fault card in the rooms allow you to call repairs to attention excellent idea , Lovely staff polite helpful and happy The safe in the room was very helpfull and a good quantity of sockets in useful places like by the bed perfect for charging ones phone Excellent breakfast quality of food and choice available the best I ve had in a hotel The self service ran smoothly with no ridiculous queues for hot food I enjoyed a beautiful morning walk through the park opposite gate is directly across road from the hotel all the way to Marble Arch Excellent location for the tube and busses stop on the opposite side of the road perfect for late night returns to the hotel without the expense of a taxi Loved the shower and the style of the bathroom and room all in all I felt pampered and safe which was just what I needed as I was staying here while my partner had surgery in a London hospital I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to anyone who asks

28960,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Breakfast time was an unpleasant experience with the staff unable to cope with a full set of tables More needs to be done to stop the stench of cigarette smoke flowing up the stairs stinking out the bar resteraunt area , Locationwas great close to the tube and directly opposite kensington gardens Evening Bar staff were superb Rooms were kept spotless 
28961,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Breakfast buffet was a bit chaotic reminiscent of a rugby scrum , The room was small but perfectly formed it compared well against other similarly priced hotels in that area 
28962,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Breakfast was good but the organisation in the restaurant was exceptionally slow poor This resulted in a long queue waiting for tables This was obviously not a one off occurrence as there was a sign on reception advising that queues at Breakfast were common place , The hotel was clean comfortable in a good location with pleasant staff 
28963,Thistle Kensington Gardens, Big queues for breakfast but no more than any other London hotel Self service coffee machine kept breaking down 1 of 2 leading to more queues at breakfast , Location on the Central line was good for travelling around London Convenient walk from Paddington Nice restaurants nearby in Queensway Staff busy but nice
