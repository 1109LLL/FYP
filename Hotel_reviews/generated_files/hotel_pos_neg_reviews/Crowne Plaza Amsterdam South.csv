326208,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nespresso machine would be nice and breakfast was a little bit expensive, Excelleny staff very friendly helpfull kind Hotel is really clean and relax It seems a little bit far from city centre but very close to metro tram and it takes just 5 10 minutes to reach city centre 
326209,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, An outstanding property in all ways well connected to the city center close to the train station and tram line the room was of a good size and the beds were incredibly comfortable after a day walking around the city A very warm staff rounded out the experience
326210,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Some help desk staff very bad they don t have customer service skills, I stay on suits room it s very nice and comfortable I recommend this hotel
326211,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, There was no toilet brush in our room Thats basically the only negative thing that comes to mind , A really great hotel The staff was so nice and helpful our room was spacious and clean and they fulfilled our wish for an upper level room We had a huge bathtub and super comfortable beds What we loved the most though were the sound proof walls Never got such good sleep in a hotel before I also really loved the location and environment A nice safe and atmospheric business district with a lot of water around and its only a 5 minute walk to the metro We would certainly stay here again 
326212,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing This is a superb facility , Absolutely wonderful Staff This is my 4th year staying here for a conference and I absolutely love it The Club level is a MUST as it gives you access to the private Club Room for breakfast Snacks and Happy Hour from 6 30am to 10pm There is always someone there Paola with a smile to assist you when needed They really make me feel special and welcome every time I visit This last time as I was checking in Stefan the bar tender came over to say Hi and asked if I would like him to make my favorite drink I was astounded he remembered And it was very good The Free WiFi is very good and fast enough for me to stream movies whenever I wanted to Location is spot on close enough for a leisurely 30 minute walk to the Rai or a 5 Uber if raining and within 5 minute walk of Amsterdam Zuid rail station to get to city center or anywhere you need 
326213,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, There is no parking but there is parking in the next building it costs 60 day, In good location away from city center crowds yet still easily access by tram or metro Rooms are large and clean and friendly staff
326214,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Very nice place good location in the business area 5 minutes walk from the the tram and train 15 minutes by tram to the city center Very friendly staff nice room and breakfast 
326215,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Great Hotel Very clean and the staff were very friendly Martha who worked in the front counter was a big help and her customer service was outstanding 
326216,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The housekeeping staff did not provide toiletteries generously and some days didn t even care to replace used ones When we checked out we were told that some rooms had some picture frames which were damaged and some rooms had some nicks on wood We were handed over a 1000 Euro charge upon check out The Front office manager was kind enough to settle for half But I wasn t too happy with the development and overall experience only due to this , The Club Lounge was comfortable and well equipped and planned Room sizes were better than I normally find across Europe 
326217,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Facilities were good but parking and breakfast extremely expensive even for the location Amsterdam Zuid Would advice to book without breakfast and grab some bite at railway station , Facilities were good with adjacent underground parking
326218,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, limited food options for room service but not a big issue, very friendly staff Claudia in particular lovely club lounge spacious junior suite delicious breakfast hotel located close to public transport and well connected
326219,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Loved everything, Just returned home from a fabulous weekend with my daughter staying in Crowne Plaza Amsterdam south Close enough not to be in the huddle and bustle of things with excellent transport links made this an ideal location for us The hotel is situated in the business area of the city only a short walk from train and tram links Station Zuid The staff were extremely friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble to them Our room on the top floor 1121 was immaculately clean and spacious with the little extras that Crowne plaza hotels provide Fantastic choices for breakfast enjoyed in the lovely canal side restaurant kept us going til late afternoon We enjoyed a cocktail each in the bar prepared by the very obliging barman in order to wind down after fitting in as much sight seeing as we were able We had prebooked our tickets for museums this is an absolute must unless you want to spend your precious time in MASSIVE queues Would definitely recommend this hotel and will return next time visiting Amsterdam
326220,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, I found the access and the indication to come by car very poor if you do not know the environment The price of the underground parking is very excessive and there is no reduction from the hotel I paid 60 for just leaving my car at night in the parking this is unacceptable , The room and the bar 
326221,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The location but that s because we didn t realize how far we were from the city center , Our welcome staff was awesome in accommodating us The Bar staff was great The kitchen staff had patience with a bunch of foreigners that liked their meat cooked well 
326222,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Breakfast was expensive at 19 euros per guest , Friendly and helpful staff Nice accommodation If you re planning to visit the centre the metro is only a 10 minute walk 
326223,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Very nice Hotel the staff very kindly We arrived in the morning and it was no problem to get the room Price for garage through the week 60 and at the weekend 15 Great breakfast 
326224,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, No dressing table mirror close to major other hotel construction no shops close by business area Expensive breakfast 24 euros pp, Close to train and tram station Very clean and tidy 15 mins from Amsterdam old town 
326225,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Great location about 2 min walk from Amserdam Zuid metro train station Quiet and relaxed area away from the city center but only 10 min with tram to get there Very friendly polite and service minded staff 
326226,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, As above, Disappointing hotel for the price Parking at 60euros a day did not help Food in the restaurant very mediocre and a poor selection Overall not a noteworthy hotel 
326227,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Arrived late 11 p m absolutely nothing to eat bar was closing no snacks offered or even machines Front desk was very arrogant and dismissive young man No amenities such as water etc everything had a price For us it offered no advantage in business district not close enough to airport OR downtown a nowhere high price place , room was furnished well enough contmp corporate style bed comfortable 
326228,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Caring Hospitable and courteous staff peaceful location Guided us well for going around No shopping centre or markets near by but easy to et to Amsterdam Centraal area by Tram no 5 or metro Not sure if we were allotted the same category of room we had booked for infact I did not care to check it , Location is good Tram No 5 and Metro station very nearby takes about 20 to 25 mins to o to Centraal Breakfast spread was good Would have preferred a room in a higher floor we are in 3rd floor for INR 14 000 the room could have been better 
326229,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, the shower The water from the shower head is extremely small no matter how I adjusted it, room is modern and quite new staff are friendly there are a shopping mall nearby quiet and safe neighbourhood
326230,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, More milk pots in the room would ve been good , The staff were friendly and polite The room was the perfect size for us 1102 top floor Very peaceful and quiet The bed was super comfortable and very big Lovely bathroom Lifts were very good Breakfast was great Lots there plenty of choice Luggage storage after checkout was very helpful 
326231,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Price of breakfast was a bit steep but lots of options so wasn t an issue , Great hotel great city whole stay was excellent Will happily return again 
326232,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Complimentary water was welcome Small point but would have expected two bottles one per guest in room , Firstly all the staff were friendly and very helpful Rooms are spacious Beds and pillows very comfortable Liked the sleep therapy oils nice touch Good location for both Schipol and Central Tram stop to Central is short walk 
326233,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Breakfast quite pricey 24 euros per person so maybe include this in your booking About 3km from city centre but close to public transport and Ubers quite readily available , Arrived in April 2017 with my wife Very nice facilities and friendly staff It s modern with comfy beds so would rate it a high quality hotel Enjoyed the stay there 
326234,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Not much to add here They could have a private parking It s relatively easy to find parking on the nearby streets but it is an extra effort , Comfortable room with a large bathroom Everything looks like new and it has everything you might need The hotel s bar is a good place to have a tasty snack or a drink Helpful and nice staff I didn t get the chance to try their breakfast but it s probably at the same high standard as their other services 
326235,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The parking options Given that the hotel is outside the city center I expected lower cost parking The garage next door is something like 24 Euros per day on weekdays I ended up parking on the street a block away which was free on weekend and small fee on weekdays but with 3 hour limit The price was reasonable but the three hour limit was a serious impediment , Most of the staff were amazing but experienced an incident where service was somewhat sub par in the bar and this is why I did not give staff perfect score I asked for blankets for outside and the bar tender told me he just put them away I wondered why he did not go and get them for us With that said the second night we visited the bar we had excellent service from different bar tender Breakfast was delicious and the omelette chef was super friendly and made us laugh Having the train and tram station next door is very convenient Uber ride into the center is also very reasonable from the location I will stay at this hotel again 
326236,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, room cleaning dusting in particular was done thoroughly after several requests otherwise the room cleaning and facilities were great , very friendly and helpful staff great room junior suite and club lounge modern hotel with great connection to public transport we would recommend it for families as we travelled with 2 small kids
326237,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Accessing the city centre implies a trip by metro Not very inconvenient but be aware , Very good value for money Very helpful and friendly staff Rooms were very clean comfortable quite big for Amsterdam Location is within walking distance to a train and metro station
326238,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, We very much liked that baby cot was set up upon our arrival and everything else was spot on and cared for with great attention to detail We will definitely come back 
326239,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The only thing that can be a bit disappointing is the surrounding area Of course you should know that this is far from the city centre and more like the business area of Amsterdam It is just that there is really nothing to see there in a walking distance But obviously not the problem of the hotel , The staff was very nice especially the waiters in the restaurant what by the way has some very tasty food This is one of the few places where every employee was welcoming with a few words and they seemed to be happy working there The rooms looked nice I loved the leather couch and the wallpapers The hotel in general looks nice and clean really can t say anything bad about it The WIFI was surprisingly good 
326240,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, A bit far from downtown Amsterdam but very close to Amsterdam Zud train station 8 minute train ride from the airport , I arrived from a long flight from Shanghai at 5 am and the hotel was flexible enough to allow for an early check in They even called at 10 am to see if everything was OK unfortunately awakened me but they handled this beautifully by surprising me with a hand written apology note from the Manager and a bottle of nice chilled Cava when I returned from my room later that evening They even apologised again upon my check out 
326241,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, We visited Amsterdam during the carnival period hence the hotels were very expensive , We stayed in a great corner room on the 10th floor The view was amazing and the staff was extremely polite The hotel is reachable from the city center as there is public transportation metro and tram We really enjoyed our stay 
326242,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Breakfast options should be enhanced A bit distant from the city center 5 min walkiing to the nearest tram station plus 10 15 minutes to reach the city center Toilet brush missing a bit weird , We took the Club Room with the access to the Lounge Everything was simply perfect room size accessorizes and the Illy Coffee machine in the room amazing The breakfast was quite good but I would expect a bit more choices for such kind of hotel 
326243,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The price is a bit on the high side for me to justify staying here to my boss , Comfy bed Walk in shower Foreign TV available WIFI connect easily with no password Fitness room on Floor 2 had all I needed Reception staff very helpful gave me a toothpaste as I forgtoand a fitness pack for my gym session Nice bar restaurant area to relax in as well as the main restaurant 
326244,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Car parking is not free However I learnt that parking is a very expensive thing in Amsterdam , Excellent modern atmosphere Comfort level of the rooms is 11 of 10 Friendly staff Close to public transport station to the city 
326245,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The price when we stayed was very high due to an event at the RAI conference centre All hotels were full and expensive , The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable I loved all the facilities provided in the room for instance the fridge the ironing board iron The efficient shower and the lovely hot water on a freezing cold day The breakfast has a great choice of both hot and cold foods from all over the world and the service is efficiency with a smile The reception staff are particularly helpful offering to look after our bags after checkout whilst we did some last minute shopping Altogether a superb hotel 
326246,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The shower head was terrible I was sad to see that I could get a better shower at home , Staff was very nice and helpful I forgot toothpaste and they were able to provide Also everything was very clean The bed was comfortable too 
326247,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Basically nothing , Perfect Hotel with nice staffs Although its not in centraal station i think its closer to museumplein Good if you have large luggage since you dont need to carry them a ling time when you come from Schiphol 
326248,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, That i had to go home lol , I stayed in your hotel last weekend and i booked in on the Friday but i cant remember the girls name who checked us in but she couldn t have been nicer When we arrived to the room a few minutes later the lady phoned to see was everything ok which i thought was a lovely thing It was the most amazing city break I ve been on I got engaged while in Amsterdam so I definitely will be back for another visit I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone going to Amsterdam I couldn t recommend this hotel anymore Also the night we got engaged we went down to the bar that night for a drink or 2 And the bar lady was so nice she didn t know we got engaged but was just so friendly she had no problem in taking our picture I just cant say how much i enjoyed my stay in your hotel 
326249,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Room was way too warm Room temp control didn t seem to work Despite a call to reception to try to resolve the issue room temp remained too warm , Handy location to international airport
326250,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing to grumble about, Superb breakfast great junior suite with canal view friendly and helpful staff as usual It was our second visit to the hotel in a few days and it gets better all the time Thanks for caring 
326251,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, No complaints whatsoever , Located very close to metro tram buses the hotel is well worth a stay a newly built modern facility with well designed rooms and a great breakfast We opted for the junior suite which includes free access to the executive lounge The staff is simply great and the hotel restaurant is worth a visit We will definitely be back 
326252,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing, Everything about this hotel was lovely It was modern and very clean The staff were so helpful with everything and the rooms were great The location was about 10 15 minutes from the centre but the transport was quick cheap and so regular that it wasn t a problem at all I would definitely stay again

326255,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, nothing , Location is good close to the station airport can be reached within 7 minutes city A dam 15 minutes was very clean they complied with my requests
326256,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Not a good destination for a weekend All nearby bars and restaurants are closed during weekend I asked for a room on top floor which staff kindly provided us However very low water pressure in bathroom made taking a shower cold and unpleasant The walk from metro bus stop to hotel can feel long in cold winter even if not so far , Staff staff and staff We had in this trip some of the most kind caring and helpful hotel staff we ever had Fire alarm went on by mistake late at night during our stay making us jump out of bed in deep sleep and go down11 floors However staff went to far extents to make it up to us Nice drinks and food in hotel bar Rooms are clean and well equipped 
326257,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Business center consisted of 2 pcs in an open area no pool, Spacious rooms with writing desks good variety of breakfast offerings location relatively close to train station very helpful staff at reception and bar restaurant

326261,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Breakfast is very expensive 23 50 for a breakfast is too dear , Lovely staff Extremely clean Such comfy beds and nice rooms too Beautiful hotel overall So close to the train station to go elsewhere 
326262,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, I didn t find cotton buds in my bathroom , Despite of a big distance from down town it s just 5 minutes from railway and metro station Amsterdam Zuid It s 1 station from Airport by train and 15 minutes to down town by Metro M51 Very cozy and silent location I had one night on weekend Big and clean rooms Friendly staff Free Wi Fi 
326263,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, A minor gripe but it was very expensive for a room and food The breakfast buffet was okay but 23 euros for okay is a bit much , Very comfortable and convenient The room and facilities were perfect I needed to sleep so a quiet room was essential I wasn t disappointed I really liked the extra effort they went to in terms of information about the marathon 
326264,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, We rented bikes but the tires needed air right away , We were able to sit outside in the evening and have dinner recommended as an option by the host We enjoyed the meal the waiter and the view by the canal 
326265,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, That I only got to stay for one night , From a friendly welcome on arrival to a very warm goodbye at check out everything either worked was clean or was comfortable

326268,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Parking was an issue the Q Park next door charged me Euro 120 for two days Also on one side of the hotel was a large construction site , Easy access to and from the main highways No need to battle traffic going into town center The room was comfortable but pricy 
326269,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Parking could be charged on a per day basis instead of being charged every time you exit the parking lot for hotel guests , One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at The rooms were great The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the stay The breakfast was excellent with so many different options for everyone 
326270,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The tap shower were too hot As soon as turning on the hot tap both go too hot to use , Really like the location just out of the city but close to public transport links Very fresh clean Great cocktails in the Manhattan bar

326272,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, We arrived on a Sunday night It s in the business district so all the restaurants were closed But that encouraged us to ride bikes into the centre So not really a didn t like Just a factor for people with less mobility , We didn t use the facilities at all It was a base for an overnight trip The hire bikes were excellent The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was perfect The aromatherapy pillow spray was a nice touch 
326273,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, ROOM RATES WERE VERY HIGH COMPARED TO SAME DAY ON OTHER HOTELS IN THE SAME AREA, the club room was fantastic spacious and clean the club facilities were very great
326274,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, There was one girl in the reception she was not nice at all she wanted to overrule the other girls she has black hair and ponytail and her skin was a little darker 20 08 about 13 00 Amsterdam south The girl who checked us in was great , Pim was a great guy 
326275,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Price could be smaller Should have less expensive parking inside the hotel , Excellent view and area Nice and quite lounge Excellent bed and the junior suite we stayed was comfortable and beautiful with a very nice bathroom Bedroom could be isolated with a door from living room Staff was very nice kind and helpful Hotel was near to one of the biggest parks of Amsterdam

326283,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, When we walked into the room soft music was playing setting a nice ambience Within 5 minutes of being in our room the front desk called to ask if everything was to our liking The breakfast included with the room was an amazing variety of foods including eggs cooked to order not just made to order omelets but also poached eggs or any other type of egg pretty much anything one could want whether craving a European style breakfast or an American style breakfast The aromatherapy kit of essential oils with properties that aid with relaxation was a nice and unique touch The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable We ordered room service for dinner one night and the food came quickly and was excellent One of the dishes we ordered was the beef carpaccio it was delicious and the waiter said they are so well known for their beef carpaccio that people come from outside the hotel to have it The location was an easy walk to the tram 
326284,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The area while peaceful didn t really have many shops or eateries nearby Also my room wasn t 100 cleaned out when I arrived there was a laundered shirt along with laundry hangers from the previous guest hanging in the closet , The building and the room were very nice clean and modern It was close to a train station and there were bikes available for rent to take to the city center Also I loved the essential oils that were given for restful sleep The bathtub also was very clean and made my stay relaxing 
326285,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, I think the only weak point could be the distance to center for tourists , Very clean spacious room Excellent facilities staffs were very kind and helpful The hotel is close to zuid station Silent environment If you want a hotel with same facility in center you must pay at least twice 
326286,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Location is not in the center of town but public transport connection is very easy Hotel parking is expensive there is MUCH cheaper street parking in the vicinity , Loved the in room coffee machine and extra goodies toiletries The staff were super helpful and provided public transport info and restaurant recommendations

326291,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The breakfast was only average disappointing for the price of the stay No on site parking at all not even for 15 minutes to drop off my luggage before taking my car to a public car park For the standard of the hotel good I think it was too expensive for the location about 5Km from the city centre The over bath shower was rather pathetic very low water pressure I would have preferred a proper shower cubicle and no bath , Easy to find Friendly staff Good location I was attending a conference at the RAI a 20 minute walk 
326292,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, 1 Location It is indeed VERY far from the city center Tram can get very crowded not a pleasure with suitcases etc Taxi to Central station is 20 but at least a more comfortable ride 2 Price is a bit steep considering the location so far away from everything , very nice rooms staff breakfast and overall appearance 
326293,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Everything from checking in rooms club room breakfast etc Location is great in that it s walking distance to the metro yet in a nice tranquil area of Amsterdam

326295,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Quiet location away from the centre Perfect service and good sized rooms with excellent facilities Good connection to the centre of amsterdam with a 10 minute tram ride Well connected to Schipol airport by train which is only 1 stop away Easy location overlooking a canal Tranquil peaceful and good value for money

326298,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Excellent hotel Very professional staff quiet comfortable bed and very clean Close to station and very convenient for the airport A bit far out for the city but easy train journey in so not really a problem 
326299,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing I can think of , Almost everything Although it was not in the central location but frequent direct connections from Station Zuid to Den Haag or the Airport was very helpful and the connections to the city centre and the sightseeing attractions were also very good 
326300,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, If you want a hotel close to the city center this may not be what you are looking for, Everything was perfect Friendly staff spacious and luxurious rooms excellent wi fi speed an reception No complains whatsoever
326301,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Takes 30 minutes to take Tram 5 to get to the city it ends at 12 midnight not really a bad thing just something to be aware of , Friendly staff fluent in English comfortable beds free water cookies and chocolates everyday great housekeeping service AC heat functions very well close to the Amsterdam Zuid South station take Tram 5 all the way into the city 
326302,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Booking com indicated it would be less than 2 kms to the centre but it was way more about 5 km with a difficult walk through roads probably which we didn t try For tourists wanting to visit the centre it is not a good location not much to see around the hotel and the underground takes 20 25 mins to get central station and works just until 24 00 The cab ride is around 30 euros each way , Modern spacious and comfortable
326303,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Location, The staff was very co operative especially one off the receptionist sorry forgot name who helped in local sight seeing tours The rooms were also spacious n breakfast spread was also excellent
326304,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, I paid 100euros as a deposit using my credit card I have checked out for 4 days but I still not receive the deposit back to my account yet , Everything is perfect
326305,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, This hotel is a good bit from the city takes up to 15 mins by train Also be aware you are paying extra for city tax this should be explained when booking or included when you book with booking com, The hotel was real luxury with personal touches I was in Amsterdam for my birthday when we arrived to out room there was a card and chocolate waiting for me to wish me happy birthday and we got a room on the top Thank you The beds were big and comfy The room was clean The breakfast buffet and coffee were really nice I was full for the day 
326306,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, After we had payed the entire accommodation when we booked the time we checked in the hotel blocked another 100 eur from my card After 2 days I still wait for MY money to be refund This is outrageous and a very non friendly attitude towards a hotel client For sure I ll never come back to this hotel , We had bikes to rent at the hotel
326307,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, The room was extremely quiet and so very good for the business traveller to rest during the stay This was the most important factor for me The housekeeping and front desk staff are very prompt and super efficient Excellent
326308,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, They block 150 on your card just in case when you arrive That does not seem so awful when you are back home , The hotel is great you feel really welcome All the staff do their best to make your stay as comfortable as possible Very convenient to get both to the airport and to the city centre Zuid train and underground station tram 5 A nice area where you can go jogging and cycling Rooms are clean have modern functional design Everything is new Electric kettle with tea and coffee was a nice arrangement When we come to Amsterdam next time we ll stay here again

326310,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, What I didn t like was I only got to stay at this hotel for two nights It was a pleasure staking there , Staff were amazing the bedrooms were amazing the hotel in general was amazing Around a 5 minute work to the train and metro stations where you can direct to Schiphol airport and direct to Amsterdam Centraal No one should be put off by the location it takes 10 minutes to get into the centre a must if you re staying in Amsterdam one of the nicest hotels I ve ever been too 
326311,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing, The hotel staff made this an unforgettable stay From checking in to checking out nothing was to much trouble there courtesy and professionalism I would surely recommend this hotel
326312,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing , Had a great stay at the hotel woke up feeling rested the entire 3 nights The bed and pillows were comfortable and despite being a hotel with many rooms I could hardly hear any noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms at night Overall modern and clean facilities definitely value for money All the staff from the front desk restaurants and housekeeping were friendly yet professional A wonderful experience all in all 
326313,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, It was far from city center and there are no shops around hotel to buy something in night I booked room with 1 big bed but I got 2 single beds which was later changed to 1 bed but as a favor to me , Hotel is new and modern 
326314,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, Very nice staff helpful and polite and the hotel is situated close to the Zuid station You have only one stop to Schipol airport further lines to join the city centre You can buy tickets at the reception desk without fees But the best is to rent their comfortable bikes and discover the city by bike It s just amazing The room was very nice with all the things you need to sleep well they even have little aromatherapy samples so you can slap lekker sleep well 
326315,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing Just why it is rated as 4 star hotel, Excellent staff excellent accommodation furniture new helpful staff Many thanks to all the staff for their kindness and support to any request and inquiry A special thank to the duty manager for his very kindness and generosity I am wondering why the hotel is rated as 4 star hotel
326316,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, When we arrived we paid 370 cash for our 2 night stay Then I was asked for my bank card and they took another 370 off the card after I already paid in cash This was very disappointing as I was limited with money in Amsterdam I didn t get the money back on my card till nearly a week later , Beds were very comfortable staff very friendly 
326317,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, When we arrived the hotel reception informed us that they do not have a king size bed as we booked and if we pay extra 50 they will upgrade our room But the main point is we made our booking 1 month ago and you need to keep my room according to my booking In the normal hotels these kind of upgrades will done without any charge Just because of that behaviour shows us how the hotel is looking to the customers And because of that reason i will never ever choose a Crown Plaza again ,No Positive
326318,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing it was a great experience apart from being 10 mins walk from train station and a small mall which was not that great of an experience when it was raining windy and 3 degrees at night , Very friendly staff modern and clean If you are an IHG club member it s a plus you can order special neck supporting pillows they strive to make your experience the best

326320,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Nothing rien nights niks nadat , Not my first stay here and everything I come I get a friendly welcome back Small things like that canow make a huge difference 
326321,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, The first day when we arrived to the hotel although we have paid all completely all the charge they wanted us to pay 150 Euro more as deposite At the end of our trip they paid back but this was not a kind manner , It was so clean confortable 
326322,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South,No Negative, We visited our family in Amsterdam during Christmas From the reception to the manager on duty to the cleaners everybody was exceptional Each one of them took the extra mile to make us feel at home and so we felt This was our fifth visit to Amsterdam and by far the best hotel We will definitely stay in the hotel again on our next visit It was special with sweet memories 
326323,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Though good for business district and schirpol not very close to center about 15 minutes by tram No 5 , Rooms are big and functional desk good for work goof wifi expensive but nice breakfast tasty restaurant dishes helpful and pleasant staff

326326,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, But shower cabin is inconvenient the water from douche can flow to the floor of the bathroom due to design of the cabin and limited capacity of the water drain , Modern hotel with fine location for business trips and frendly staff 
326327,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, Two things I would like to emphasize 1 During our stay the A c in our room didn t work and it was getting really suffocating and hot The complaint was registered and it was taken care in 24 hrs Hats off to Mr Fischer the floor manager And 2 The location of the hotel is in a business Centre and hence you don t get to see any hotels or restaurants nearby which is a negative point But good for business people work at VU medical Centre and closer to Schipol airport , The hotel was just awesome Especially the staff they were ready to render their services at any time Special referral to the Manager on the floor Mr Fischer who was active all the time The rooms and the food were excellent as well The hotel is good especially if you have work in VU medical Centre because it is just 10 15 min walk from the hotel To the city Centre it takes at least 30 min but well connected by the tram bus and metro 
326328,Crowne Plaza Amsterdam South, It was all great until upon check out when the front desk personnel tried to charge for an extra night no show claiming the original reservation had not been changed I showed them the email confirmation of the revised booking on my phone and they asked me to forward to them before they reluctantly took off the charge Not the type of discussion you want to have when you have a flight to catch And it could have been easily avoided if they had mentioned the issue upon check in , Overall a great stay except
