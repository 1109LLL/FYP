195505,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are small , The manager Savio as well as all the staff were excellent Really attentive and professional Hassle free stay and excellent value for the location 
195506,The Premier Notting Hill, but the room is extremely small I had a single room for 2 nights and was so small that was not even possible to totally open the luggage I think the room size will be around 6 square meters with a small corridor at the entrance that actually makes the room even smaller There s one window but is like there s no window Room also noisy because at the ground floor For a 4 stars hotel and for the price almost 160 Pounds with no breakfast It s not worth it, Elegant furnishings but 
195507,The Premier Notting Hill, The hotel next door that I regrettably booked a nights stay in Never again Kensington Court Hotel Shame on you All was good at the premier andcthey should be congratulated on maintains high standards and employing really good helpful staff , I especially liked the cheerful helpful staff Everyday they greeted me with a cheery good morning and when I returned they said welcome back in such a nice genuine way My room was always immaculate The bathroom was nicely cleaned and fittings best and shiny The manager during my stay was a Mr Savio sp and he was so helpful to me every day His attention to detail was second to none and o really felt he genuinely cared that my trip was a success and that I was comfortable This is a very neat and pleasant hotel with excellent professional staff 
195508,The Premier Notting Hill, The bedroom double bed in a single room with very little space meaning I banged myself a number of times on the furniture Also I had to crawl across the bed to open close the window curtains , The staff were very friendly helpful 
195509,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed wasn t as comfortable as we would have expected That was about the only thing we felt could have been improved , The staff were very friendly and welcoming Very good location close to the business venue 
195510,The Premier Notting Hill, Room a little too small I know it s London but the bed was against the wall so someone had to climb over the other person to get out of bed Bed really comfortable although pillows a little hard Despite this I would stay again mainly because the staff they were excellent , Staff very very friendly and keen to accommodate guests request Room clean and window opened which is not always possible at hotels Not far from the tube stop 
195511,The Premier Notting Hill, The room that I have booked was a little bit noisy due to air condition equipment installed outside the building It was like if I was sleeping on an aeroplane , Super clean comfortable rooms in a quiet neighbourhood despite the air conditioned equipment 
195512,The Premier Notting Hill, All good , Family members had stayed at this Hotel the previous year It is in a really great area with a good cafe local pub and laundrette all within a few minutes walk Staff were very friendly and happy to help Our room was small but was good value for money 
195513,The Premier Notting Hill, Bloody generator Doesn t go off until 2 45am Aircon does seem to be an ongoing problem Was told there was a problem with mine and best not to touch it , Hospitality excellent and accommodation too if not for the location of the room No5 ground floor No point in all of this if you can t sleep because of noise Window blocked out so no view 
195514,The Premier Notting Hill, VERY SMALL ROOM BELOW GROUND LEVEL IT WAS OK FOR ME BUT FOR A LARGER PERSON IT MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS NO NATURAL LIGHT AND THE WINDOW ONLY OPENED A CRACK, LOCATION
195515,The Premier Notting Hill, The bathroom was unacceptable for a heavyset person The shower cabin was impossible to get into without hurting myself first time I ever encountered this anywhere , The location is very nice an affluent area with lots of shops and restaurants Close to the subway 
195516,The Premier Notting Hill, Room although had everything one needed was a bit on the snug side size wise , Staff friendly helpful and welcoming Comfortable room with all usual facilities Good location with great pub 30 seconds walk away Train station 5 mins walk Close to Portobello Rd and its market and with Hyde Park not far away 
195517,The Premier Notting Hill, My colleague s room was very small No bacon at breakfast , Nice room although I believe I was upgraded to the accessible suite so might have been particularly good 
195518,The Premier Notting Hill, Could have had stronger coffee and a funny smell in the room maybe because of the carpet , Really nice hotel in cosy Bayswater a bit from main street which means no heavy traffic outside Nice staff clean bathroom Lots of restaurants caf s and secondhand shops nearby Easy transport into central London and beautiful Hyde park in walking distance 
195519,The Premier Notting Hill, The room which I stayed in on the ground floor was extremely small Barely any room at all to move around I m not sure it had a real window either so was very dark , Staff were very courteous
195520,The Premier Notting Hill, Water pressure was not good even I couldn t take a shower properly Another room was arranged the next day Air conditioning didn t work well and the whole room was stuffy , Very convenient location Approximately 7 minutes walk from Bayswater station Sainsbury s and Tesco are nearby for convenient shopping of basic stuffs 
195521,The Premier Notting Hill, No cotton sheets shower temperature control did not work scalding water air vent in bathroom discharged dirt over WC pop up plug in hand basin did not work Staff arranged a room change plug did not work again , Welcoming and helpful staff 
195522,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Someone with taste and style has decorated this property the rich wood trim tasteful paintings clean white bedding modern bathroom plumbing all made the property beautiful and my stay there felt like a treat Their best advantage is they are on a quiet side street a couple of short blocks from a nice busy street full of public transport options and helpful businesses for travelers restaurants shops ATMs Plus they are a short walk to the beautiful Kensington park and within an easy walk of at least three tube stations including the very useful Notting Gate Hill circle line connecting to lots of London touristy things A couple of comfort things I especially valued were the room air conditioner not a given in many London hotels very appreciated in summer and the lift elevator 
195523,The Premier Notting Hill, Honestly for a business person who is using it to sleep it s more than sufficient I had a single room so my room would work for a family but I assume they have rooms that could accommodate more people as well if you ask I would highly recommend though if you are traveling single or a with a companion , They provide breakfast for 12 95 per day which you can pre purchase when you check in if you want It is small but for me traveling on business it was perfect The rooms and command areas are clean and well maintained Savino is very attentive to his guests needs and the entire staff takes care and pride in what they are doing I will definitely use them again on the next trip 
195524,The Premier Notting Hill, First night the room had no AC and the staffs already knew that since there was a fan and a cooler in the room They pretended not to know and wouldn t change rooms until the second night ,No Positive
195525,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Over the years I have stayed at many hotels in London For me this hotel represents the best style of accommodation on all levels that I have found The atmosphere is friendly and the level of staff hospitality is exceptional The rooms are well appointed and tastefully furnished and are all done with the comfort of guests in mind The hotel is situated in a very desirable part of inner London where accommodation of a similar standard in nearby hotels is frequently far more expensive I cannot recommend the Premier Notting Hill highly enough 
195526,The Premier Notting Hill, It was extremely hot when I was in London and the aircon never worked properly despite of reporting it 4 times They kept saying the problem was resolved but the aircon would turn off automatically after about an hour The cleaners didn t change the bed sheets after 3 days and didn t hoover the room The room and bathroom were really tiny but steel comfortable , Location was good staff were nice and the bathroom was very clean 
195527,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was a tad small particularly the bathroom Shower area was barely wide enough for one person and I am just an average sized guy in height and weight Same with the bed If you are a taller person I would think twice about this location at least for the room I had which was a twin deluxe Also the television picture and channel selection was quite poor No real cable provided so there were fewer than 10 channels on the tele , Hotel is in a wonderful part of London NottingHill It s convenient to dining transit system and not too far from key sites Area is easy to walk around no matter the time of day or night Staff was friendly and very helpful 
195528,The Premier Notting Hill, It took three tries for a borderline suitable room two were extremely hot air conditioners were not working properly The building is very londonesque however the rooms are extremely small We had to climb over each other to get to bed it touched the wall on three sides The bathroom is clean but dangerouly small getting in and out of the shower is scary , This hotel is well situated for restaurants transportation and shops We walked thru Hyde Park to palaces and down to parliament builidings tower bridge they are also accessible by bus or tube close by Portabello Market is nearby Great pub on the corner roast beef and yorkshire was fabulous 
195529,The Premier Notting Hill, Stayed in a room with AC that didn t work When complaint to the staff they said they will get it fixed that following day the AC still didn t work when complained again they said that they will take care of it and once again they didn t spent two nights sweating in a room with a very uncomfortable bed On the third day I came to the staff when I was sweating and said to them that I can t take it I left a hotel and when I came back they gave me a new room with a terrible bed although this time the AC did work After terrible few nights I left the hotel although I paid for an extra night It was just horrible expirience that left me so disturbed and ruined my trip to London , Hotel clean ok
195530,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed is too soft The last day of my stay breakfast was not ready waited till 9 30am then gave up No compensation was offered , Location peaceful and food is within reach
195531,The Premier Notting Hill, Staff were incompetent and provided no real service Had no handle on who their guests were at one point we were asked how our stay was we arrived 40mins earlier and he checked us in Room was scruffy and not what I d expect for a prince s square hotel in west London Felt like it was updated 20yrs ago and then they ve given up because you ll always be fully booked in that location Finally and probably most importantly THE BED WAS HORRIFIC so uncomfortable neither of us slept well for our entire stay , Location lovely quiet part of Notting Hill access to 2 tube stations within 5mins 2 Santander bike hire locations round the corner Can be at the Ledbury and Portabello in 10mins too 
195532,The Premier Notting Hill, Didn t utilise any of the facilities on offer there Breakfast additional cost I believe 12 95 Prince Edward Pub opposite offers breakfast from 10 30am for just under 6 , All staff very attentive polite helpful Didn t use any of the facilities too busy Very good location near Hyde Park Bayswater Rail Station Portobello Rd incl market 
195533,The Premier Notting Hill, The air conditioning didn t work and we weren t advised of this before we checked in and there were no alternative rooms available When we complained we were given a very noisy cooler fan which made very little difference , Good location 
195534,The Premier Notting Hill, Air con didn t work shower cubicle was quite small, Very comfortable bed room is equipped with air con free Wi Fi not much to select TV wise but what s the point of staying indoors when there s plenty to do
195535,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was extremely small I have seen closets that are bigger Could not open my suitcase unless over the bed Plus the air conditioning was not working and room was extremely hot ,No Positive
195536,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very hot and the aircon failed to cool the room down The shower was also really underpowered , Location was very good and staff were really helpful 
195537,The Premier Notting Hill, No air conditioning had to sleep with my room door open all night and a noisy fan plugged it the temp in the room was 26 degrees and the room was tiny with only a small window,No Positive
195538,The Premier Notting Hill, lighting on top of the bed is too much bedcover and curtain is so flowery it will look much better with modern touch and less flowery and proper lighting , location is very good walking distance to restaurants shops and train station neighborhood is beautiful 
195539,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was tiny very hot and claustrophobic Entered down a narrow passage at the back of the hotel It was explained to me that the air con wasn t working before I saw the room I said I didn t mind and was offered free breakfast as compensation However if I slept with the window open there was a constant racket from some machine outside The room looked onto a light well The air wasn t fresh I felt trapped Slept really badly and left at about 6am well before any chance of a free breakfast I couldn t stand the room a moment longer The staff were all v kind but the room was horrendous, Too small but nice bathroom Comfortable bed
195540,The Premier Notting Hill, The price Extortionate cost through booking com I saw similar rooms going for 100 less after paying Hotel room was too hot even with aircon on full Terrible pillows Shower pressure was abysmal had to resort to having a bath instead First and last time will be using booking com , Very little 
195541,The Premier Notting Hill, The bathroom was terrible The sink was literally at the level of my knees and I m 5 5 tall The toilet was incredibly old and there was only a shower I met a friend who was also staying at the hotel Her room was smaller but was completely updated with a full normal bathroom My room booked as a Deluxe Double had no refrigerator the bathroom was terrible it was located at street level where anyone walking by could see into the room so I had to keep the drapes closed Upon arrival to my room I noticed the air conditioner was blowing warm air I went to the front desk to let the manager know and hopefully send someone to investigate I was told they would bring me a fan It was hot and humid in the room I asked if they could move me to a room even a smaller room with working air conditioning and I was told no because I had already used the bathroom in the room I was in I guess they expect a guest to hold their water after a long flight and an hour ride by taxi from Heathrow just in case they need to change rooms While discussing this with the gentleman at the front desk another guest began to express the same complaint His air conditioning was not working he wanted to be moved to a different room and also was told no He had the opportunity to check out and go to a different hotel I was stuck with this hot humid room because I had paid for the room back in March through Booking com They offered no compensation not even a breakfast The next morning after a miserably hot night with a fan the air conditioning quit working completely The windows could not be opened to get fresh air I was stuck for the duration of my stay in this room that I had paid over 200 00 a night for I noticed as I walked barefoot in the room that the bottom of feet were now black from the dirty carpet After that revelation I wore socks in that sweat box they called a Deluxe Double Disgusting , The location is outstanding The outside of the hotel is lovely and the lobby is beautiful As for the room the bed was nice and having a nice chair to sit in was a bonus 
195542,The Premier Notting Hill, I had the worst experience in terms of comfort I have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world The basement room they put me in had faulty AC so was like an oven When i complained they gave me a fan and said there was nothing else they could do It was late and I was extremely tired and had an early start so there was no way I could change hotels at that time I was told there was nowhere else to put me I did not sleep at all the heat was unbearable The next day when I complained I was then offered a cooler a mini AC unit which was not offered to me the night before When I asked to change rooms the manager came to see me and immediately apologised and agreed it was extremely hot and offered to change room The only room available I was told was a smaller room than the one I had paid for It was tiny but at least I could sleep,No Positive
195543,The Premier Notting Hill, The presentation of the room on booking com and the given room didn t match at all The hotel gave us a room better name it a cage in the basement without daylight no option to open window extremely hot and a non working airconditioning while the told it was functioning They told us that this was a normal room We had to complain like hell to get a slightly bigger room and a transportable airco and the promise to get an other room the next day Which they fulfilled and we should see as a big favor while it should have been such room for total booking They tried to keep us happy by giving us the breakfast foc The same approach happened to other guests while we heart similar discussions between reception and guests about several topics They don t have the act together, The location of the hotel is excellent Very quiet area close to shops restaurants and public transport
195544,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast was nice but didn t do bacon and had ran out of sausages, We had free breakfast course the air conditioning in the room didn t work so the room was a bit warmer
195545,The Premier Notting Hill, If you are unlucky enough to have a bedroom in the basement the wi fi isnt great , Staff were generally excellent location is perfect and the rooms generally despite being on the cramped side are all clean tidy and well equipped 
195546,The Premier Notting Hill, I had the misfortune of staying at the property during a heat wave in London I was moved twice in those 5 nights meaning staying in 3 different rooms because of problems with the air con They never managed to fix the problems in any of the rooms during those 5 days The staff tried to be polite and civil but were not very helpful Apparently they were still in the process of learning to run a 4 star business , Location was excellent 
195547,The Premier Notting Hill, That was the smallest room I ve ever seen The room was literally full of one big double bed The remaining space was about 1 5 sq m , Very good location
195548,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The facility and staff totally met our needs We had a very enjoyable stay and would return to this property The room was very clean The breakfast was adequate and got us off to a good start The room was air conditioned We liked the location 
195549,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was claustrophobic I travel a lot but I haven t slept in such a small you can not call it a room shoe box under the earth before When I booked I had no idea that it will be under the earth To open the window was possible but you had a dirty wall in front of your face and no normal air circulation Only the air from the air con If you need a submarine experience without fresh air stuck in a shoebox I can recommend the single rooms at ground flour ,No Positive
195550,The Premier Notting Hill, No cancellations even within 24 hours Only 8 TV channels no radio I ended up listening to streaming music on my WiFi, Excellent rehab A lot of similar hotels in the area have simply chopped up the rooms and haven t really done much refurbishment But it was lovely clean and modernized Staff was very friendly and I had quite a nice stay 
195551,The Premier Notting Hill, Everything I have logged a complaint with the management of hotel and I have requested a refund as I did not get what I had paid for At the same time as logging my complaint another guest had found a dead rat in there room so all in all this hotel was pretty shocking compared to what have previously stayed in , Nothing
195552,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally accommodating and professional Although the room was smaller than I had expected it was clean and comfortable and suitable for one or two people The bathroom was also clean and fairly spacious 
195553,The Premier Notting Hill, I got a room on ground zero which I didn t like at first but it turned out to be fine It wasn t as nice as the room in the pictures but it was okay I did miss a small fridge though My only concern would be how to get out in an emergency like a fire There was only one way out from the ground floor up some quite narrow stairs , Great location Notting Hill Gate Kensington High Street Portobello Road and Hyde Park is a short stroll away I took the Airport express from Stansted and walked to the Hotel from Paddington Station It was easy to find The area is lovely and feels very safe The neighborhood is quiet so it was easy to fall asleep at night Very friendly staff The room was clean I would definitely go there again because of the location and the decent price I had a very comfortable stay 
195554,The Premier Notting Hill, The mattress could have been better , I had the pleasure to stay at The Premier Notting Hill recently The location was excellent being close to Kensington Gardens Notting Hill Portobello Road and public transit While my room was small it was completely updated and well organized My room had a beautiful view of the park across the street I was glad to find coffee and tea available in the room The wifi worked great everywhere on the property The full breakfast buffet was always fresh well stocked and clean By far the greatest asset of the hotel is the friendly staff that were always eager to help during my stay Many thanks to Milagris at the reception desk for making me feel welcome and for the excellent service he provided during my stay Also the gentleman that managed the breakfast room I don t remember his name was always friendly and helpful I also appreciate the assistance of House Manager A Zara at check out 
195555,The Premier Notting Hill, The reception staff weren t really nice to their own trainee when I checked in It seems roles and responsibilities weren t really clear and the tone was quite rude Room 005 is a tiny shoebox Just enough to fit a single bed in It also looks out into some form of larger vent or something so opening the windows is probably not recommended I think the description of the room size should be more clear , The location is simply amazing 
195556,The Premier Notting Hill, Room is just simply too tiny for comfort This is THE reason I would not consider returning No view no functioning aircon, Staff always there at disposal and friendly
195557,The Premier Notting Hill, quite a small room but fine as we were only there to sleep, service was great really great location The Prince Edward pub across the road does a fabulous breakfast
195558,The Premier Notting Hill, THe lower staff is very sweet and courteous but the senior staff is rather odd They say things without thinking and act as if doing a favour for the most basic services a hotel big or small would provide Cute rooms but exorbitantly priced for what they are Even considering then the location We paid 130 GBP a night but would ve liked to pay half of that at best ,No Positive
195559,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing , Location The hotel is near Bayswater tube station and the good places for dinner i e Four Seasons Gold Mine Royal China New Fortune Cookie chinese restuarant However it is located in tranquil area I got the room with a balcony and a good view There is microwave in the room Everything is provided in the cupboard so no need to ask anything from hotel staff All hotel staff are very nice and attentive including trainee I will recommend this hotel to my friends 
195560,The Premier Notting Hill, tiny rooms no fridge, My room was so small I could practically touch both walls staff was nice location good no fridge like I said good value tiny rooms
195561,The Premier Notting Hill, I had a single room very cozy the only thing I didn t like was the shower it was a bit too small , I didn t have the breakfast but I enjoyed the hotel and the area 
195562,The Premier Notting Hill, A C not very effective bed way too soft issues with our room keys every time we would come back to the room very few channels on TV BBC1 and 2 missing to start , The personnel was extremely welcoming the bathroom was nice and modern The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet with restaurants stores and the Tube just a few blocks away 
195563,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was a bit too small as well as the shower but apart from that everything was good , The staff was really friendly The bed was very confortable and you have a small kettle in the room with some teas and pastries every day 
195564,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Staff were incredibly welcoming and courteous The room was on the small side for the price but we also appreciate it is London and it is peak season Our room was clean and very comfortable We had a lovely room on the third floor overlooking the square As it was very warm the AC came in very handy though it wasn t feasible to have it switched on all night because of the noise it made The only negative was a group of people outside playing football basketball at five o clock in the morning 
195565,The Premier Notting Hill, We had a basement room with no light at all not the picture advertised but we understand it was fully booked Still the room was comfy and had everything despite being very dark, Bed was very comfy and everything was available
195566,The Premier Notting Hill, Where to begin Run don t walk away from this property I paid for a single deluxe room which I had read was ridiculously small fine for me since I am knowledgeable on the European hotel standards being much different than American ones I was offered a room so small and claustrophobic that you could not raise your arms to the side without touching the wall Bathroom and shower were so small and there was not even a soap holder to hold your soap I had to open the shower door and place my soap and wash rag on the sink I hit my knee several times on the side table just to maneuver into the bed The icing on the cake though is the substandard A C at this property What I discovered was that you have to place your room key in the wall to turn on the lights and for the air conditioning to kick in Room was so hot that you could not sleep When I told them at the desk they did switch me to a better upgraded room and they were very accommodating Simple amenities like fresh ice needed to be requested at the front desk I will say that property is in a safe location though somewhat confusing to find because a lot of the hotel properties look alike Management needs to honestly portray the rooms as they are as I feel very deceived since my original choice was the size of a dorm room with a view of an air duct For any business travelers who are only staying one night this hotel may be acceptable though for anyone wanting to enjoy your vacation and get a decent nights sleep this place is not for you , Accommodating staff who addressed most of my concerns 
195567,The Premier Notting Hill, My booking was described as one for a deluxe room I was allocated Room 312 which is 7ft 6ins wide by 13ft 8ins in length totalling 11 33 sq yds of which the ensuite occupied 1 75 sq yds the shower is 27 ins by 25 ins Of the remaining 9 63 sq yds most was occupied by the single bed bedside table single wardrobe and desk leaving very little room in which to erect the ironing board For admittedly twice the price the following night I had room at the St Pancras Renaissance hotel which was 35 63 sq yds in size So the Premier worked out more expensive 9 53 per sq yd as opposed to the Renaissance at 6 54 per sq yd To summarise Room 312 was small and rather overpriced in comparison The tv was not tuned properly with BBC1 2 missing and reception other channels snowy , No traffic noise but doors banging elsewhere in the hotel
195568,The Premier Notting Hill, Tiniest hotel room I ve ever stayed in No natural light window opened into dark air shaft Tiny shower if you re a larger person you won t be able to squeeze through the shower door No face flannels I had to hunt for the hair dryer found it in the desk drawer Only 8 local channels on TV Not a comfortable place to hang out during the day I basically used it as an over priced hostel , Coonvenient location I walked from Paddington Station Staff was helpful and friendly Nicely decorated room Nice bathing products iron and board hair dryer good towels Ice was delivered to my room when I requested it It had everything I needed but it was so cramped that it wasn t a comfortable place to relax unless you were in bed 
195569,The Premier Notting Hill, I was a solo traveller and in a single room The first room I was given was tiny and I was moved to their biggest single better but still small it is London It was also in the basement and had a window which had been made opaque There was a lot of noise outside on the first night on the second night the same but I called reception and they sorted it out inconsiderate guests , This is a great location for Kensington Gardens Notting Hill and Bayswater I was going to the Chelsea Flower Show and it was a few stops on the Tube perfect Also plenty of places to eat just a few minutes away The staff were helpful and polite and the air con was very welcome mini heatwave 
195570,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Location was great for us in the middle of Notting Hill with a short walk to the underground Room was overlooking a quiet square The staff were all very polite and helpful We didn t have breakfast so couldn t comment on the food but overall a very nice hotel 
195571,The Premier Notting Hill, I booked a single room The room and bathroom were clean and tidy The room however was in the basement and was incredibly small There was nowhere to sit except on the bed OK if you are out all day and are only using the room to sleep but no good if you want to spend time in your room to work or for other reasons ,No Positive
195572,The Premier Notting Hill, I had to be shown 2 3 bedrooms before the Receptionist decided he could offer me a better room The first room was a ground floor room with two air handling units running either side of the window making a lot of noise The second room did not have any window at all I cannot sleep without an open window During this saga the Receptionist kept telling me that the problem was that some of the guests had decided to over stay I said that having booked this room about a week before this issue was not one that was relevant He also stated a second problem I was staying only one night Establishments are free to stipulate a minimum stay If one does not and this one did not they cannot penalise who are staying for one night by confining them to rooms that are unacceptable at this price 182 night in my case After all this I was confronted with a mouse that appeared from under the dressing table the following morning One could not regard this as a good stay , Although it kept cutting off having the free wi fi connection was good 
195573,The Premier Notting Hill, Just a tiny bit noisy from the generator but ear buds sorted that out , Lovely location great for travelling around London Comfy bed and pillows just what we needed after a long day sightseeing Small but very clean hospitable staff 
195574,The Premier Notting Hill, Though I appreciate this was a single room it did feel a little cramped and dark However I would certainly stay here again , The hotel was conveniently located for tube bus and in a very quiet area The staff were very helpful and the room was beautifully equipped 
195575,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was small and very noisy The bed was located against the window with on the other side 2 main ventilation ducts constantly making lots of noise , Nice location 
195576,The Premier Notting Hill, Extremely small room and bathroom stairs between the door and the room very limited selection of TV channels without CNN or any foreign channel no minibar The lift was very slow usually was necessary to push many times the floor botton and to wait before the lift moved The room was never cleaned before 2 3 pm , Good location near Bayswater and Notting Hill Gate stations and Queensway full of restaurants and shops free wi fi a newspapers 
195577,The Premier Notting Hill, Some things in the bathroom were broken soap dish and toilet didn t flush properly , Bed was very comfortable staff was pleasant location was great it was quiet
195578,The Premier Notting Hill, bed a little uncomfy, Nice quiet location slightly off the main road opposite a green Still within walking distance of public transport Hyde Park and Notting Hill
195579,The Premier Notting Hill, 40mm gap under the room door let in noise and light Shower tray filled up 100mm deep every day Single glazing let in street noise Very dark room Very hard bed Cheap pillows , Location and staff
195580,The Premier Notting Hill, Bed was a little bit small queen size for two people Water bottles for the night two small bottles were not sufficient for our night consumption , Location friendliness of staff 
195581,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing, The best thing was their very clean towels which were much much better than any other hotel in London including 5 star hotels The staff were extremely curteous and professional Definitely one of the better B B hotel in London 
195582,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was overly clean meaning it was smelling of harsh detergents everywhere The duvet was probably washed with bleach or something as it was a bit irritating to my skin , Extra attentive staff which makes the first contact extraordinary Went out of their way to provide me with a first floor bed as I dont like ground floor rooms Great location as it is minutes away from bayswater and westbourne grove Also it is so quiet at night i did not hear a single thing Highly recommended
195583,The Premier Notting Hill, Outside the bedroom window there was a shaft with what I think were air conditioning or boiler extractors These came on and off during the night and even with the window closed I was kept awake by them , The staff were very friendly and helpful
195584,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The location is great the staff is very friendly and helpful I had a couple favors and all has been taken care of The view from the room was nice the room had all I needed 
195585,The Premier Notting Hill, Only thing I woluld mention is that it would be nice with a fridge in the room , Very comfortable room With AC Very nice bed and bathroom The staff was outstanding There was a short wait by check in and I was offered a complimentary bottle of water while waiting Every little problem adressed to front desk was solved promptly and with a smile 
195586,The Premier Notting Hill, Didn t have a fridge tv old air con make noise and view from the room , The price was great I needed to stay in london for a day so I choose this little hotel very comfortable room a bit small but was nice 
195587,The Premier Notting Hill, tiny room Avoid ground floor rooms they are very noisy Also the curtains had stains and overall average stay Breakfast not worth it, Friendly staff great location
195588,The Premier Notting Hill, Executive double room with small bed in the basement View of people s feet walking past the window A little noisy from within the building , Good location clean accommodation and very friendly staff 
195589,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The staff were so friendly and helpful especially Milagris Location was perfect for us as tourists as it was very close to numerous underground stations which made it really easy to get to various places all over London city Only a few minutes walk to both Portobello Market and Hyde Park which was great too 
195590,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was sold as deluxe It was a little small for us as we were staying over the London Marathon Weekend We would have liked it bigger Apart from that can t fault Staff were very friendly room was cleaned daily , Clean room Friendly staff 
195591,The Premier Notting Hill, shower door did not close properly and shower head and hose was very poor , really early check in which was very nice and nearly was everything else was brilliant only the shower was a let down 
195592,The Premier Notting Hill, Bottled water only on first day No hair conditioner or body lotion supplied Bring your own for now not to be put out Hotel is breakfast only No bar or food , Very helpful staff and excellent standard of cleaniness Great attention to helping guests with queries Stylish chic hotel in a very sophisticated area of London near to tube station and The Princes Pub across the road for good food 
195593,The Premier Notting Hill, Everything is small room bed bath shower No extra blanket , The bed was comfy although rather small It was nice to have the kettle in the room and to drink a cup of tea after a long day The Premier is very well located beautiful view quiet spot extra central 
195594,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms are tiny even though they are advertised as Deluxe which is blatantly wrong The double beds are extremely short No wonder seeing as the rooms are lilliputian The staff at reception desk were unable to lend plug adapter The noise of A C machines outside was a nuisance All in all this hotel did NOT come up to our expectations , Breakfast OK
195595,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Just a few blocks from Kensington Garden and Hyde Park this nice Bayswater hotel offers splendid combo of style and location That s wether you like a walk or a run before breakfast in Notting Hill area which also offer great restaurants and burger joints Be sure to book the right room according to your preferences as the rooms are rather small in this area The service of the manager Zara and her team including Milagris is unsurpassed They will do anything to accomodate your needs to make you feel at home We would love to come back 
195596,The Premier Notting Hill, The lady at reception is considerably rude For other staffs they are okay but cold and not so friendly Some maintenance works should be done i e lighting bulbs and the lift is super small , Comparing in room facilities and price this hotel is ideal for business traveller The neighborhood is lovely with short distance walk to all shops and restaurants very convenience 
195597,The Premier Notting Hill, Couldn t find any hotel tourist information in our room but it didn t matter because we knew where we going and what we wanted to do , The staff were excellent Friendly courteous and efficient We left some property behind after check out and they located it and returned it to us You rarely get that these days Love the idea of a microwave in our room 
195598,The Premier Notting Hill, The water pressure from the shower was very poor the room was rather cramped for example to get around the bed and finally the breakfast was a big disappointment not particularly warm obviously mushrooms straight from a tin tomatoes grilled but not and poor tasting coffee from an automat , The staff were friendly and we had everything we needed The bath tub was appreciated by our 9 month old 
195599,The Premier Notting Hill, too small room bit noisy at night from windows bcoz of ventilation duct outside window, 5min walk to the nearst station shops and restaurants 10min to Hydepark Quite area Staff was ok 
195600,The Premier Notting Hill, the bed is too soft and the room is so small and the furniture is a little bit old , the location is very good it s near the tube station and there are so many restaurants nearby 
195601,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast not as good as i previously remembered , Stayed here a number of times over the years Great hotel Cant fault it really Always nice to stay there
195602,The Premier Notting Hill, Very very very small room you open the door and suddenly the bed is infront of you There was no place to walk thanked God my bag was small but if you have big bag there is no enough place for your belongings No view at all Cold breakfast and there was no veriety of food just 5 types Do not stay at it the worst hotel I do not know how they got 4 star , Clean room and friendly staff
195603,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, This hotel is perfectly situated The area is quiet and lovely The view from my room was great I found the staff most helpful They went out of their way to accommodate any and all requests My only complaint would be with the bed The mattress wasn t all that comfortable as it dipped on one side I also found the duvet heavy and far to warm and had to request a regular blanket and sheet Other than that I would definitely stay here again Strongly recommend requesting a room in the front of the building I was originally booked into a back room over a very loud air conditioning system Sounded like a jet engine taking off every few minutes The staff were great about changing rooms for me 
195604,The Premier Notting Hill, Only issue is that the single room was too small Whilst this is not unusual for London it was difficult to unpack pack and move or work at the desk and even the shower was a little tight So definitely one of the smallest I ve experienced , Breakfast was good Location was good Staff were friendly and efficient Quality of furnishings bed etc was good 
195605,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, They were very friendly and helped me a lot since I lost my passport wifi is super fast They are the best in this street as they have a decent clean and beautiful lobby the other hotels in this square are lacking so much as I stayed before from bad reception to students until morning outside hotel and drunk The staff is very helpful a diverse staff from all over the world who do everything they can to help They made me feel Home 
195606,The Premier Notting Hill, I had a basement room facing towards the street so that was relatively loud and dark , Staff was really nice polite and helpful especailly with regards to luggage storage 
195607,The Premier Notting Hill, We thought the facilities in the room were rather dated There was a tv that we were not able to turn on however this wasn t the end of the world In addition the bed was pretty strange to sleep on if I m completely honest , We really likes the presentation of the lobby We thought this really made a great first impression on us 
195608,The Premier Notting Hill, One bedroom is very small There is no space for luggage and the shower room is so tiny I m a slim and fit person I could not imagined a big person in the shower room , The property is located in the heart of the city It s walking distance to underground station and some shops I would say the property is okay 
195609,The Premier Notting Hill, No bottle of water in my room , The staff was very nice They tried their best effort to satisfy the needs of the customers I asked for a room change and the new room they put me in was fantastic The location of the hotel is superb Opposite of a beautiful gardrn safe and near tube stations will definitely come back and recommend this hotel to my friends 
195610,The Premier Notting Hill, No bottle of water in my room , The staff were very nice They tried their best effort to satisfy the needs of the customers The location of the hotel is superb Opposite of a beutiful garden safe and near the tube stations I will definitly come back and recoomend this hotel to my friends 
195611,The Premier Notting Hill, There was some machinery type of noise that I reported to the front desk but not much could be done about it and so I have restless and disturbed night, The deluxe bedroom was very small the stuffed with very little walking space The side table in room no 1 was so close to the bed that when I got up at night to go the bathroom my foot banged against it and I bruised my toes
195612,The Premier Notting Hill, First room we had was extremely small not appropriate for two people We upgraded however and they moved our bags while we were out to our new room It was much better Not a four star hotel to me but a well run 3 star , Staff was professional and helpful 
195613,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very noisy due to some AC implant Room temperature very low and thermostat faulty Room and shower cubicle very small TV Screen intermittently going blank , Staff was nice 
195614,The Premier Notting Hill, Definitely dont stay in room 803 which has air conditioning unit directly across from room window and it runs every 15 minutes and it is really noisy You can be sure that you will not sleep all night long As usually when we asked for changing room they told us that hotel is fully booked No help from staff at all , Hotel was nice clean Not so far from the tube station 
195615,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was minute versus the pictures on the website Poor breakfast Poor communal space Noisey outside my room No window and poor ventilation, Clean Friendly staff
195616,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The room was small but comfortable and clean the bed was comfortable and all the staff were friendly and very helpful In particular Savio was fantastic and so helpful especially when I got my booking wrong 
195617,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was tiny but this is made clear in the other reviews My friend had to cancel so I emailed to cancel one of the rooms They asked me to do it thru this website But you can t do that you have to cancel both rooms and re book one at which point the price goes up This is crappy but it isn t the hotel s fault , If you book breakfast in advance it s 10 pounds If you simply show up it s 13 I was told that I could book two minutes in advance and save the difference but I didn t try that Very friendly people all over London It must be something in the water Very convenient to the Bayswater Tube stop which is adjacent to Kensington Palace and gardens No USB port available but the front desk cheerfully lent me a wall to USB adapter The bed was quite comfy The neighborhood is noisy but the windows keep out almost all of the noise 
195618,The Premier Notting Hill, We asked the reception to order a taxi for us to pick us up at the hotel They ordered a private car chauffeur service instead It was 12 pounds more expensive The driver was late I had to use my own phone to give info on postalcode for our destination in Covent Garden And that got us delayed another 5 min since he didn t understand anything I said Finally on our way we found out the fixed price of 28 pounds He didn t have the credit card machine with him We only brought 20 pound in cash since we knew the fare by regular taxi He wanted us to call his manager from our own phone to figure out what to do about payment We refused to do that He said he could stop at an ATM and we could get out and get cash We refused since by now it was obvious we would not make our dinner reservation We were 20 minutes late for our reservation that we made 2 months ago and the reservation was cancelled Main complaint here is the Hoyle should not just order much more expensive chauffeur rides when I as a guest require a London Taxi Also we were given a room for the disabled Unfortunately the room was only helpful to the disabled We did get another room on request the next day But on a 2 night stay it s a hazzle to pack again and unpack ,No Positive
195619,The Premier Notting Hill, Cooked breakfast cheap sausages slow to do poached eggs , Warm welcome room and bathroom very clean housekeeping did excellent job Staff very helpful 
195620,The Premier Notting Hill, Very very small room without window Room 007 I think you should tell that prior to booking No way to fully open the luggage in the room Air Con did not work just a fan Old too soft bed Literally impossible to turn around in the bath room especially in the shower Nice location but impossible to pick a taxi from the street,No Positive
195621,The Premier Notting Hill, Room is too small but do not make any problem if you only sleep in hotel , This is nice hotel for quick visit to London Metro station is 3 min walk from hotel Best value for money you can get 
195622,The Premier Notting Hill, Room a little on small side no desk to use for work but nice for a place to rest your head , Good quality internet connection Excellent bathroom facilities nice shower 
195623,The Premier Notting Hill, Firstly the room wasn t ready The male manager was extremely rude to the receptionist who was only a trainee We were taken on a wild goose chase around the hotel as they hurriedly tried to find a room to fit us in and he even had the cheek to say it was upgraded The breakfast left a lot to be desired with the sausages looking limp and the eggs resembling a pile of sick The cacophony of noise emitting from the man woman buffalo from another room which sounded like their lungs were falling out their nose, The cooling draft from the broken window
195624,The Premier Notting Hill, The TV had a very bad picture and made a loud humming noise so I didn t have it on much which was disappointin as I was travelling only with my baby Whilst the baby crib was useful I didn t put my son in it to sleep for the night as it had no matress just a blanket on the bottom , Lovely room on fourth floor was perfect for an overnight stop and my request for a bath and a baby crib was met Staff were very friendly helpful and efficient I liked the microwave and tea coffee maing facilities AND the bottles of water in the room on arrival 
195625,The Premier Notting Hill, The only problem was the shower wasn t powerful but it didn t take anything away from my stay and i would definitely stay again, Fantastic stay at Premier Notting Hill Great location a short 2 minute walk from Bayswater Train Station Staff very friendly and attentive as soon as we entered The room was spacious and clean spotless for our arrival 
195626,The Premier Notting Hill, The shower was a little slow , I really liked the location and the value for money there I got more than what I paid for which is really good for London 
195627,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Upon arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been automatically upgraded from the Deluxe room to the Executive room Our Executive room was split into two floors a bedroom on the first and a bathroom on the second which had a Jacuzzi bathtub The decor was tasteful and with character deep stained wooden cupboards and wardrobes and a very comfortable bed with a cushioned headboard Definitely would recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again 
195628,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very tiny the bath was strangely designed the bed sagged to one side , The breakfast was very good the staff was very friendly and helpful Room and Bath were very clean and the location in Bayswater was very good 
195629,The Premier Notting Hill, bathroom wasn t clean when we got there pubes in the toilet walls are very thin so you hear the people in the next room as if they re there very small room , good location nice staff safe neighbourhood
195630,The Premier Notting Hill, Small room but this is normal for London Had to move desk as you can t actually sit at it where it s located opposite bed not enough room for chair well stool , Spotlessly clean room with brilliant wifi
195631,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The hotel was very nice everything was clean staff was very nice and helpful We slept in room 310 nice room Breakfast is not extensive but adequate and good Thank you Aparna Zara Neil Tiago Silroy and Albazar for the nice Stay 
195632,The Premier Notting Hill, A room with daylight and a traditional breakfast which unused bacon and pork sausages , I was out in a basement room called Felix single but there was no diredt day light The winow was opaque and there was just a hint of light The curtains were closed in arrival which was clearly to hide the fact that this was not a suitable room There was no bacon or pork sausages I think this may have been to do with religious reasons which should be made clear at the booking stage 
195633,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast selection was quite poor I ended up having something else once I checked out in a coffee shop outside Receptionist on check out was busy on the phone and just dismissed me as I had paid already , The receptionist on arrival was absolutely brilliant She answered all my questions very efficiently Room was small but considering I only slept there it fitted all my needs Bed was really comfy and bathroom of adequate size 
195634,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was tiny and had no daylight When opening the covered windows there was an annoying noise When I asked for another room they offered me a room in the basement without window I accepted another room similar to the first dark and the noise generator air condition went on about every twenty minutes during the night I guess the room was OK for the price as the location is great I just imagined a little more comfort in a 4 Hotel Staff at reception were friendly We did not have breakafst at the hotel as there are plenty of great cafes and restaurants nearby , Good location 5 minutes to subway station 10 15 minutes to the bar restaurant area at Notting Hill 
195635,The Premier Notting Hill, My super small Deluxe Single Room was situated in the basement and was accessible by super narrow corridors it felt just like being on some ship The room had a window but the glass was not fully transparent and of course it had no view whatsoever The air conditioning was blowing only very hot air and there was no way to adjust it other than calling to the reception so I kept it off the whole time The bathroom sink was not working from the very first moment I opened the tap and the water just didn t drain The shower tap was also leaking water Both bathroom failures were fixed the other day when I complained Also during the night outside unit for air conditioning could be heard turning on and off This kind of room absolutely does not deserve 4 stars and this should be reviewed , good location near tube
195636,The Premier Notting Hill, The deluxe room had a nice design and cushions but the room was not much bigger than the double bed No window The shower was nothing for a man in L size or over , Notting Hill area is very nice and when you found out where restaurants coffee shops and busses go from a real nice location for the hotel A bit outside the center but still ok to reach by public transport Very quite hotel Just the fan in the bathroom moored but that is England 
195637,The Premier Notting Hill, The lack of a real window was a bit jarring , The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive It was also pretty quiet at night When a light bulb went out they were swift to replace it The WiFi was easy to access as well 
195638,The Premier Notting Hill, Really really small room To get to wardrobe you have to climb over bed There was toxic smell in bathroom I could not stand even fan did not help , Location was great Breakfast alright 
195639,The Premier Notting Hill, You will be arriving from a late night flight and they will make you wait to fill all the forms and pay for the entire stay on the spot and the manager will have an argument with you about it , Nothing staff are rude especially their manager
195640,The Premier Notting Hill, I wouldn t advise you to bring a cat because there s no room to swing it in one of the rooms Although the bed was big enough it was a little cramped and I stubbed my toe It hurt , It was clean and the bed was comfortable It was in a very nice area of London It was a shiny looking reception and the lift worked 
195641,The Premier Notting Hill, Long wait to check in decor is tired small room booked exec room , Great location near Tube and Notting Hill bars Restaurants Fairly well equipped 
195642,The Premier Notting Hill, poorly sound proofed in the room I slept but didn t really disturb me , Great Location close to all major transportation links Notting Hill is a great neighborhood Staff and Manager were super friendly and courteous Hotel and Rooms were clean daily newspaper and magazines available as well as complimentary water and care products I found the hotel very good value for money 
195643,The Premier Notting Hill, The room and toilet weren t very big but it was more than ok for me I would just add a second chair in a room for two people , The bed was comfy the room was nice and had all necessities even an iron and iron board breakfast was great and had lots of stuff even for me I can t eat gluten and dairy The staff was very friendly and helpful Everything was quite clean and looked good The location was great close to Portobello Road and Hyde Park and to two underground stations and various bus stops 
195644,The Premier Notting Hill, There was zero water pressure in the shower I couldn t wash my hair I told the staff and they said they d send someone up no one ever showed They then called me later to check if someone had come up to fix it they hadn t so they said they d send someone again They still never showed, The bed was like sleeping on a cloud
195645,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful i was very impressed they were able to check us in hours earlier than we expected The room was very spacious and clean 
195646,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms are very compact but do have very good facilities, Very well located hotel adjacent to Hyde Park Easy access to the tube Bayswater station and buses Tons of shops nearby but the hotel is in s very quiet street opposite a park Comfortable if compact rooms and great service Good buffet breakfast at 9 Altogether very good value for central London
195647,The Premier Notting Hill, Very small room and bed , The staff was very kind and helpful The hotel and the room was very clean The location is perfect close to the public transport and to Notting Hill 
195648,The Premier Notting Hill, The foot of the bed almost met the wall so the room was very small Not an issue for a short stay though as we were barely there , Location was excellent in a lovely area off Nottinghill high St The bathroom was lovely and bed comfy Lovely entrance into hotel and staff were great offering us a bottle of water on arrival 
195649,The Premier Notting Hill, I had some noisy neighbours but I didn t feel the need to complain though , I didn t have breakfast The staff at reception were so nice and friendly made me feel most welcome My room was spotless the bed was very comfy and the location perfect with the tube about a 5 minute walk away 
195650,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very small there were spots of mould between the tiles in the shower the elevator was out of order, The bed sheets were very comfy room was modern location was good
195651,The Premier Notting Hill, Ordered delux room Was upgraded to basement Too noisy Walls and windows paper thin Room was next to kitchen Could hear staff shouting and laughing at crack of dawn when preparing for breakfast Heating cannot be controlled from that room Have to phone reception Bed was tiny ,No Positive
195652,The Premier Notting Hill, Curtain fell off in the room allowing in a cold draft and noise Other room the bed had a hole in the middle making it very uncomfortable Single room bathroom was tiny ,No Positive
195653,The Premier Notting Hill, Double room was too small Ok for single Notwithstanding London prices a bigger room would have been appreciated , Excellent location Very helpful and friendly staff especially Milagres Clean room with modern fittings 
195654,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Very good location close to Paddington station Kensington Park and walkable 45mins to Piccadilly area Generally smaller rooms than expected but we did ask for a lighter brighter room with views out the front when we booked and they gave us a better room than originally available 
195655,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was extremely dusty The bath room was too cramped with the toilet seat very close to the wash basin And the shower size is too small where one can t have a proper shower The shower may actually end up being a hazard in case you may slip and you may end up breaking some bones or atleast getting a significant sprain the breakfast didnt have too many chioces , The hotel staff was very friendly and responsive Location was good 
195656,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very small and the room s only window looked out to an even smaller square space with a huge a ventilator pipe The bed also sucks you into the middle so it was not the most comfortable unfortunately , Very convenient location walking distance to Hyde Park Beautiful lobby helpful professional and friendly staff and the interior of the room was great too I booked the place very last minute but didnt encounter any problems at all 
195657,The Premier Notting Hill, Bathroom had a smell of cat litter There was no toilet brush which made sharing the room with my wife very romantic The room was very small and The television had very bad reception picture was terrible , Bed was comfortable Location was fine Free wifi 
195658,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was very small while advertised as a Delux Double there would have been no room for two full sized cases luckily we were sharing a small one So small there was only one bedside table and no comfortable chair , Very quiet location with tall trees on quiet square outside Staff were helpful when we left something behind Nice decor and modern shower room though very small 
195659,The Premier Notting Hill, The mouse baited traps in my bedroom When I moved the bedside table to plug in my laptop I was suprised to see two mouse traps on either side of my bed The area was dirty not suprising they have a mouse problem , Location was fine
195660,The Premier Notting Hill, Our room was located next to store room and stairs meaning it was quiet noisy Also windows are not sealed so the room was pretty cold was not too bad due to warm blankets though and wind was blowing through it eg would not recommend with small children , Location is good 2 underground stations within 5 minutes walk Several places to eat and grocery stores nearby Hotel is nice Bed was good blankets really warm Staff was very helpful 
195661,The Premier Notting Hill, Room very small rather tired looking and lacking a nice view TV was also not great and I didn t like the fact that the bathroom door which faced the bed was see through So much for privacy , Great location in central London close to shops restaurants and London Underground 
195662,The Premier Notting Hill, Could have more variety for breakfast menu , Though the rooms are small the bed was super comfortable We appreciate the complimentary biscuits and fruits upon arrival The location is the best It is convenient to go any places in London It is situated centrally many eating establishments within walking distance and supermarkets too It is a quiet neighbourhood Will definitely come back 
195663,The Premier Notting Hill, I got a premier single room which was tiny They told me that the premium is a double bed but I think they can give a bigger room Traveling single doesn t mean you should get less space , The crew are great kind and generous and helpful The location is fantastic and so queit and lovely 5 minutes from center Notting hill lots of restaurants around and an underground around the corner Tip there s a laundry close by so don t give it in the hotel 
195664,The Premier Notting Hill, I can t say there was anything I didn t like about the hotel and felt we got good value for money , 1 The warm welcome and professionalism of reception staff 2 Minimum need for additional assistance 3 Room was very comfortable and quiet with extras provided including snacks and refreshments 4 Good selection of daily papers available at no extra charge 
195665,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was extremely small and old We have booked for 4 nights On the first night we were given a room as small as a toilet We could barely put our luggage and walk in the room We complained and were changed to another bigger room on the 2nd night But then the key card didn t work on the 3rd night Water pressure in the shower was such a nightmare You won t be able to shower with that The floor in our room wasn t flat Luckily we didn t fall to the room under our floor Fortunately staff was polite , Parking was available around the property
195666,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was tiny Barely enough space to walk even And the bed was super uncomfortable with the mattress being lumpy and hot There was no air circulation in the room , The location is a plus The staff were really friendly and welcoming 
195667,The Premier Notting Hill, The only thing If anything was the room was situated under the reception area room 405 and we found it could get abit noisy with footsteps and door banging But still had a good nights sleep, We loved everything about the hotel location was spot on and the staff were very welcoming and helpful
195668,The Premier Notting Hill, First of all we were asked to pay for our rooms when we checked in which for me is always an alarming sign as you can t see the room and check that everything is as described on the website before paying As it tuned out the pictures were much better than the reality Then we were told when checking in that the heater was not switched on in the rooms 28th of December and that if we wanted the room warmer we would need to call reception as they controlled the heating system from there Of course the rooms were freezing cold and it turned out that the heating system was not working in 2 out of 3 of the rooms that we had rented and the maintenance person had to work on the system in these 2 rooms to make it work While our room was ok yet extremely small my friends room were absolutely minuscule I have booked hotels many times in London and the double rooms they were given were the size of single rooms in other hotels The beds would have been fine for 1 person but definitely not for 2 people as the mattresses were probably of the lowest quality possible or old and had a curve in the centre making it impossible not to sleep on top of another The bathrooms were clean and were probably the only part of the experience close to deserving the 4 stars rating All the little details were there to tick the boxes and make sure that this hotel gets rated 4 stars samples of soap and shampoo hair dryer elevator etc However these details were of the lowest quality possible Finally two of my friends could not sleep because of a noise which they thought was the tube and turned out to be a big pipe sending steam and vapours against their window When they mentioned it at reception they were told that they should have asked for ear plugs To conclude this place feels like a totally unloved hotel a place that would need a big refurbishment and some care to allow it a pleasant customers experience , The place is situated in a lovely and quiet area of London We picked this location as it was a few minutes walk from the restaurant we booked to celebrate a special occasion 
195669,The Premier Notting Hill, The single room was much smaller than we anticipated I even got a cold just because the small bed was directly under the air conditioner Additionally we cannot alter anything for instance temperature by using the remote control of the AC PLUS there s something wrong with toilet in the double room We reported it two days and we fixed it ourselves in the end , The location is great The hotel is closed to three underground stations 
195670,The Premier Notting Hill, From the 6 hotels in the last 3 months this was the best one, Helpful friendly staff Nice view Very comfortable beds Fresh fruit and tea coffee making facilities Clean Nice 
195671,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very small crowded and there was hardly any space for clothes There was just one tall wardrobe which was enough for my coat and three shirts but nothing else The TV was too small and only had 10 channels , The hotel felt tidy and clean 
195672,The Premier Notting Hill, Room at the top of the building and no working lift which wasn t a major problem but just abit annoying The room itself was very small thankfully we were only there one night , Great location and hotel was very clean Most of the staff were very friendly 
195673,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was indeed very small literally without a window but what do you expect when paying only 79 pounds in this good location with the best service with a smile , The staff was excellent very professional helpful and super friendly The location is very good in a nice and quiet neighboarhood in Notting Hill yet 10 min walk to the station
195674,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Last minute booking all dealt with quickly and and a great little room much better equipped than you normally get for the price will definitely stay again
195675,The Premier Notting Hill, The Rooms were too small no place to walk inside the room , It was clean and hygienic and even the breakfast was good in the morning and the staff was too kind at the Restaurant 
195676,The Premier Notting Hill, Beds are way too soft Could hear other people showering in the morning Building work going on outside at 9am , Breakfast was good food nice lots of choice
195677,The Premier Notting Hill, The smallest hotel room I have ever seen in my life for 165 a night A single bed and just enough room between the bed and the wall to move to the bathroom Poor quality TV but anyway there was no way to watch it unless you were standing in front of the room door Incredible , Location rather friendly and accomodating staff
195678,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Fantastic location in a nice area Less than 5 minute walk to tube station Plenty of restaurants nearby Although small the rooms were great very comfortable clean and modern Staff were very helpful and polite 
195679,The Premier Notting Hill, A bar on site is always a bonus, Staff were very lovely requested upgrade for special occasion and the hotel left chocolates and fruit in the room as a surprise lovely gesture
195680,The Premier Notting Hill, It was a very small room but then everything in England is Could have had a newer TV and some more space to put your luggage Didn t feel it was worth how expensive it was , Comfortable bed modern and new hotel room Mini fridge with drinks in that you get for free and fruit and coffee and buiscits Microwave that came in handy Short way to the bus and the bus don t take long into the center 
195681,The Premier Notting Hill, Could serve a nice and healthy breakfast Would be nice with fruit and smoothies and not just bread , Nice staff Beautiful hotel nice rooms Good looking design old but modern The location was great close to the city but still a bit calmer I really enjoyed my stay 
195682,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms and beds smaller than most wardrobes Noisy extraction vents so close to the window you couldn t even open it room 111 Changed room for the second night room 206 and was just the same For around 150 per night I would expect to be able to walk around the bed Not even enough space to open a case and get changed Thoroughly disappointed and would advise everyone to book elsewhere Plenty of other roomy hotels in the same location for less money , Location
195683,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing , The location was fab for our first stay in Nottingham Hill This was a last minute find and it was amazing so clean sleek modern and fresh The room was so clean and had everything we needed Milagris was exceptional he was kind friendly and and a joy to deal with He really made us feel welcome thank you 
195684,The Premier Notting Hill, Lift was out of action as being replaced at the tome this should be rectified by now This meant a 91 step hike from the breakfast room No bar on site but there is a pub 20 seconds walk away No restaurant on site but this is London so there are many restaurants and eateries near by , Room was clean and tidy Free Wifi Complimentary soft drinks and fruit on arrival Fridge and Microwave in the room Comfy Beds Hotel manager accommodated us from 12pm even though checkin was from 2pm I requested printing of my return boarding passes at check out which I emailed a PDF of to reception this was ready and waiting with my bill Very friendly staff 
195685,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was TINY literally a shoebox , Very clean and the staff were very polite and helpful It was also perfectly located for all the main tourist attractions in London 
195686,The Premier Notting Hill, Bed far too short I am 5 ft 11 and was small for me Telly reception awful Fire alarm went off at 4 am on Sunday am no apology made , Shower very good Bathroom really clean Breakfast substantial 
195687,The Premier Notting Hill, when I stayed before the rooms seemed adequate in size This time round the room was smaller than most bathrooms Extremely claustrophobic I was glad to leave Another night would have challenged my sanity ,No Positive
195688,The Premier Notting Hill, First reception was under construction That was ok However Lift was not on service for two days My room was high fl Hot water was not available one morning so could not shower and shampooed by cold water One day 5am false fire alarm rang and we woke up , Location and facility were point of selection 
195689,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed was not very comfortable It looks better in the pictures than in real , The staff were friendly and helpful The location is great and the breakfast was good 
195690,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was supposed to be a deluxe double room but instead it was a dark tiny room with window view to a wall and limited sunlight It was so small that you could not walk around the bed and my wife had to climb over me to use the bathroom We had payed in advance and by mistake the receptionist charged us again We were cool with the situation as it was a simply mistake However we didn t liked the way the manager spoke to the poor girl We were also told by the receptionist that it was Ok if we needed to extent the hour of our check out if needed but we were not allowed in the day after , Location is excellent close to the tube station in a quiet neighborhood Kettle water tea coffe and some cookies free of charge The cleaness of the room was ok The bathroom although very small was the most modern part of the room 
195691,The Premier Notting Hill, This property is not as advertised rooms are cramped and outdated beds are small with ill fitting linen When booking checking in we were not made aware that refurbishment works were ongoing which caused disruptions with no reception or lounge areas DEFINITELY NOT 4 STAR and not worth the prices charged , Location
195692,The Premier Notting Hill, The cleanliness could have been better as one of the towels in the room was dirty which was extremely disappointing The room was very small which didn t bother me but I was only there for one night if I had been there for longer it might have bothered me more as room was quite expensive as the hotel claims to be 4 star , The location was really good It was ideally located next near a tube station The staff were mostly really nice aside from when we checked in and they didn t believe I had a reservation Following this however they were very friendly
195693,The Premier Notting Hill, Room too small not worth for the money I paid The room we lived is totally different from the photo showed in the website 250 per night is not worth for it ,No Positive
195694,The Premier Notting Hill, Room needed a good clean no complimentary water bed would be great for a dwarf i am 5 4 and it was still too short Telephone in the room did not work Overall complete rubbish The place is not a 4 star , Nothing
195695,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was a little bit too small for us Not so good you can often hear what your room neighbour is doing Especially at night More assortment for the breakfast would be very nice for example pancakes or more cold dishes , Our stay at this hotel was very good Very gently and helpful staff all the time Specially the staff from the front office and breakfast Our room was very clean nice and comfortable
195696,The Premier Notting Hill, The stuff is not friendly The lobby is poorly looking The room is extremely small the only window was looking into the other wall close to the window The shower did not work properly The room needs renovation I did not try the breakfast fortunately So I will not stay in this hotel again It could be rated as 1 or 2 stars hotel but not 4 as it is written on their and on your site Terrible ,No Positive
195697,The Premier Notting Hill, Renervations going on Work men banging Was still awake at 3 a m Because 3 vents for two heating system was outside the window in my room Changed my room to 4th floor ut the lift wasn t working When I came in at night the key wouldn t open the door So I had to ring th to tell them Young women had stayed there 4 nights and each night their key woudn t open their door Too many things wrong but staff were very nice Perhaps the hotel should shut whilst work is being carried out The staff were trying their best under very difficult circumstances, Breakfast was good
195698,The Premier Notting Hill, While we stayed for 5 nights and on the third floor there was no elevator working The bathroom faucets were broken in the bathtub including drain Shower rod kept falling down Shower curtain had orange mildew on it The air conditioning was very loud We paid for a deluxe room and slept in a hard old double bed Poor lighting only lit one side of room No view other than large rooftop ventilation system The pictures posted on your website did not come close to what we experienced This is definitely not a four star hotel by our experience , Nothing
195699,The Premier Notting Hill, it was somewhat chaotic at no point did your website tell us that a whole refurb of the reception area was taking place we checked in in a converted bedroom with a trainee woman who was slow and unable to communicate properly in English The room we were given was a single room with a double bed pushed against the window we couldn t walk around it and had no place even to change or unpack when I complained we were told that all rooms in London were small I reassured them that I stayed in London all the time and they weren t They changed our room to a basement with no window but it was bigger and we could at least open our cases They re well decorated and clean The outside of the hotel was dark and I actually fell on the bottom step onto the pavement because I was unable to see though thankfully only grazed but could have been much more serious More and more I feel that hotels in London especially at peak times just want to rip people off , The staff were friendly when we complained about our room and did the best to help 
195700,The Premier Notting Hill, The services of the hotel It is undergoing renovation and they did not let us know ahead of time so you would here the workers all day long The services in the hotel are poor Although they upgraded me to club room but rooms are too tiny barely fit the bed The floor makes too much noise and you can basically hear everything The lift broke down the first day we arrived and we stayed 5 days and they still did not fix it SO we had to go up and down 4 floor everytime we wanted to go out and it is not very practical The room card had to always be checked after you have gone out as they deactivate when put near metro or credit cards first time i ever hear that , Location is excellent close to the tube station quiet neighborhood close to the city center
195701,The Premier Notting Hill, The reason for low facilities mark was only because the lift was not working due to renovations The staff were very apologetic for this but was still a bit frustrating when staying on the top floor I think the price of the room was lower than usual due to the work being done as well so can t complain too much,No Positive
195702,The Premier Notting Hill, Lift not working though I think they have fixed it Cleaners did not hoover room during stay Room is very poorly lit and is in need of a make over updating Tv is small and old and only a handful of channels Even the cheapest tv s today have freeview The manager she walks around barefoot and the staff talk in their language over the guests You can here them arguing during day , Staff are very helpful though a little unprofessional at times I was on crutches and they made my stay easy I had ground floor room I ordered a takeaway at night which they brought to the room for me They offered to bring me breakfast in the morning Easy to get to places in London Very close to portobello road and Westbourne Grove and Hyde Park Quiet location and rooms Free newspapers Tea and coffee in room Wifi was ok 
195703,The Premier Notting Hill, It s not like the pictures upon arriving there was confusion with payment that wasn t explained very well Then we were sent down the the basement to our room which was cold dark and smelly not what we expected We were shown another room which was the same They wouldn t issue a refund back that night for us to go stay somewhere else The room we ended up in the beds small my feet hung over and I m 5ft 6 the view well there isn t one it s of a wall with kitchen fans outside which stink There was maintenance going on which we were unaware of We stayed in London 3 nights at 3 different hotels and this one was far the worse , The location is good
195704,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms are tiny and not suitable for 2 adults plus luggage The bed was comfortable though Regardless of the facilities the staff is not qualified to handle any problems On the day of our arrival the elevator broke down and was broken for the entire stay We were a family of 5 staying in 3 rooms for 5 days all situated on different floors Second third and the fourth You can imagine the stairs we had to climb During the whole day there were construction work going on in the building so it was best to stay out for the whole day Then the reception was moved into a room on the ground floor because of some construction work that was supposed to start after the weekend but hadn t started when we left All that fuss and confusion for nothing All our communication with the reception team was really awkward and they seemed to be in a hurry to do something else I take my hatt off though for the bell boy who had to carry all our luggage up and down the stairs The only thing we got out of them was we are sorry for the inconvenience We were not compensated in any way at all or were invited to move to a lower floor Not even invited to have breakfast for free or something They didn t seem to care at all They even ordered us a cab that was way more expensive than a regular cab and smaller Just go for a London cab with a meter not the ones they call ,No Positive
195705,The Premier Notting Hill, I was only there for 3 nights found no problems in this lovely hotel at all in that time , The room was beautiful comfortable The staff were very accommodating the location was great 
195706,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, This property is definitely one of the best in the area I would always come back to it every time I m back in London Great rooms and staff You won t regret staying here 
195707,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are incredibly small and I supposedly got an upgrade to a superior room Even though it was claustrophobic The lift was out of order during my entire stay as they were changing the lift so staying on the 4th floor was not exactly pleasant , Location close to Bayswater tube station 
195708,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed room was small could not move in the short cubicle and also could not open the wordrobe door properly so crunm Plus when check in was ask if I wanted breakfast which had to be paid extra and was told that I can t have beacon or ham I ve never heard such rubbish in my life you cater for the clients not for the employee as Ian the one who pay the bill It should not allow to happen you should put these thing in your brochure when you advertise then people can choose I for one would have not choose that hotel Very disappointed , I did not like the hotel at all as it did not look as you advertise
195709,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are very small I couldn t open the wardrobe door past halfway which made it tricky to get stuff in or out , Good location staff were friendly room well appointed and clean but not a lot of space to do much but sleep 
195710,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was situated right by the elevator and as a result heard a lot of people coming in after their respective nights out That being said this didn t keep me up all night , Everything the staff were extremely welcoming and offered to carry our bags upon our arrival and exit The room although small was perfect 
195711,The Premier Notting Hill, the room was very small i am 5 foot 3 and any taller and i would not have fitted in bed only a foot gap between the bed and the wall and a set of stairs to climb up as you open the door door lock was temperamental needs fixing, the room is nicely decorated with all the facilities needed to a high standard amazing how they fitted everything in the space staff friendly and helpful good location near tube bars and restaurants and close to portobello road
195712,The Premier Notting Hill, I was a bit disappointed that they didn t have gym facilities as it was advertised that they did and it impacted my decision in choosing this hotel, The staff were lovely The location was perfect Close to two tube stations and multiple shops
195713,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was very compact but nicely decorated and had everything you would need Initially got sent to a room that was already occupied but we realised before actually meeting the other resident actually was quite funny Staff very apologetic and sorted us another room immediately , Cleanliness and location were great
195714,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing other than the location I feel i was missled by booking com The rooms where like jail cells so small the bed was single bed very short and there were no windows And for this I had to oay 150 a night , Location
195715,The Premier Notting Hill, Aircon was noisy and really cold for October Had to call reception to ask for it to be switched off as didn t seem to be any way to do this on my own in the room No bar or facility for drinks or snacks , Great location
195716,The Premier Notting Hill, The first night when we arrived at the hotel we were given the room 008 The room is in the groundfloo at the back of the building The only window looks at the ventilation shaft 1 m square wide The room does not have proper daily light and the curtains nor the window should not be opened if you do not want to stare at the dark hole of the shaft Next door to the room are lavatories for the staff which were used squiking doors several times during the night The room was tiny I have never been in such an unsuitable space The hotel by renting this room is cheating turistis Such a room should not exist let alone be rented for 130 pound night Disaster I never have been in such a space I can t even called it a room Whan I asked for anothe room the answer was that the hotel was fool and that they will solve the problem in the morning Mercifully next morning we were moved to a room on the first floor with normal daylight and window looking over the park The breakfast room is too small crampled and siuated in the basement The breakfast is poor I would strongly advised anyone not to even start thinking about visiting this hotel ,No Positive
195717,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, My single room was in the basement and a little dark but it was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed for one nights stay whilst on a training course in London A cooked breakfast in the price was very reasonable too The receptionist was very friendly and welcoming as was the porter on the door the friendliness of the staff here is a real plus point for the hotel I felt safe as a lone female traveller 
195718,The Premier Notting Hill, Sadly the initial welcome at reception here was curt and dismissive This is much as the world has come to expect at London hotels along with some of the most exhorbitant prices on the planet but fortunately was compensated for by the other staff who were friendly and helpful in the extreme First impressions do count however On that there were also an unacceptable number of relatively minor but nonethless highly irritating maintenance issues, My room was beautifully quiet over the lovely green square below This would best be described as a boutique hotel given the level of stylish comfort provided Cosy and elegantly designed with every need thoughtfully anticipated
195719,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was tiny couldn t get out of one side of the bed Bed very soft and small TV not working and toilet seat broken Could hear doors banging and shutting on other floors, Location
195720,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was so small my husband could touch the walls on either side of the room with arms outstretched Shower too small no window except for a tiny one that barely opened onto a hole with a big vent No daylight available Asked for another room but were denied Way overpriced for an area that was a fair distance from any attractions , Clean enough
195721,The Premier Notting Hill, The plugs for the sink and tub got stuck and we weren t able to open then by using the dials, Staff were extremely pleasant and lovely The room was gorgeous and clean and comfortable
195722,The Premier Notting Hill, there was a constant beeping outside my door because of the broken elevator i had to walk down 6 flights of stairs 3 times through the night and complain it was impossible to fall asleep the room smelled of urine and the breakfast that i paid 15 pounds for was inedible,No Positive
195723,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was a bit on the small side but suited my needs for 2 nights as I was more interested in the location , Both the hotel and room were clean and looked newly furnished The bed was very comfortable and staff were very friendly and helpful 
195724,The Premier Notting Hill, Our room s AC did not work so a fan was already in the room which unfortunately was still too hot Our only minor complaint , The staff were wonderful Due to us needing to change rooms single room for one day before moving to larger room when my friend arrived and having delicate carnival head gear and accessories we required assistance and the Reception team co ordinated everything smoothly so when I came back to the hotel we were moved in without any issue 
195725,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was discounted to 79 pounds however the room was too small toilet seats coming off and when we arrived at reception they informed us we were at the highest floor and the lift was out of service I d not pay more than 70 pounds for this again , Location
195726,The Premier Notting Hill, Bathroom needs to be refurbished as had chipped bath tub and tap covers were missing The thermometer cutoff guage did not work so do not set it to 38 and step under , Good location close to central line and circle district line stations but nice quiet area Nice little hotel with good room facilities 
195727,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast room was cramped and the items on offer were limited or not available milk Paid for Executive Club room but not sure what was executive about it and where the extra went Also limited staff on reception were on the phone more than they were greeting helping guests The only attentive member of staff was a young guy on the door as I was leaving , Air con in room was good Room was clean 
195728,The Premier Notting Hill, A buzzer kept waking me up every half hour so I didn t sleep well The lift wasn t working so I had to lift my heavy case down three sets of stairs,No Positive

195730,The Premier Notting Hill, I booked an accomodation with breakfast but I was charged breakfast on top of the hotel accomodation The bed is terrible sausage at breakfast not up to standard, I liked the location
195731,The Premier Notting Hill, Room had no air conditioning and window opened to a utility chase room was hot and stuffy TV did not work Staff insisted nothing wrong with air conditioner After a few hours and many inspections and conversations we were switched to a smaller room but much nicer window opened to the square operational air conditioner , The location was a few blocks away from the tube station and bus stop Late night grocery stores pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood Walking distance to Kensington Gardens 
195732,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast was cold and croissants were rock hard I felt I needed to go elsewhere for a better breakfast The rooms are small however comfortable and cozy It would be nice to have the balcony refurbished and accessible to guests Other than that I had a pleasant stay , The staff were very friendly and location was superb as it is a close walking distance from the Bayswater underground tube and other lovely cozy restaurants and souvenir shops Finding an ironing board and iron in the rooms was a pleasant surprise 
195733,The Premier Notting Hill, The willingness to help me get want I wanted out of a wonderful hotel They always had a smile and made me feel one of a kind They always called me by name and made sure I had what ever I need , They place was great they took care of my every need I need a bigger room and they got one for me with a smile I would have to say the pictures are a little misleading But that would mostly have to do on my part I have never been to London so I was thinking I was getting a big room when I was not But the staff help me fix that at a great price and that made me happy 
195734,The Premier Notting Hill, Little bigger rooms, Perfect stay for the money ususally we stay at 5 The rooms were small but clean and very good value for money Perfect for a short stay

195737,The Premier Notting Hill, The fitness suite is not a fitness suite It is a tiny room with two cross trainers in it I booked this hotel specially for the fitness centre and could not use it It should not be advertised as an indoor fitness suite , Staff were very friendly and nice Particularly the girl on reception and the breakfast staff Breakfast was lovely 
195738,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was small There is no restaurant on site so have to go out to eat or bring food into your room They advertise a gym but this consists of 2 bikes in what is little more than a cupboard so not a gym by any tretch of the imagination , The room was clean and the bed comfortable The staff are very helpful
195739,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was not serviced at any point over a three night stay This may have been a case of miscommunication but two full days in a row has to be questionable Servicing of rooms was included in room cost , Location good Area really nice Great pub near hotel with beautiful food
195740,The Premier Notting Hill, Uncomfortable bed and a very small double myself and my 9 year old daughter Extremely small room Very low shower pressure and the water was far too hot too hot to shower my 9 year old daughter Very grumpy over worked reception staff , Location was perfect for us

195743,The Premier Notting Hill, Kitchen where is the break fast little hot to saty and take your breakfast Same breakfast every day if you stay a few days you will fed up from same food Good point its clean food and good service Shower water really very low pressure water take you long to take shower and its small shawer to go in but in the end I managed Find bed bugs on my bed But as soon i till the manager he moved me from the room to another and was very responsible and take quick action Thanks Savio, It s close to all transport and great location
195744,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was too hot aircon not getting cold unable to open window as it is noisy due to vent just outside window room is quite small and small hallway too , Location quiet area shower is great Bed was comfy
195745,The Premier Notting Hill, I got a single room first which was like a box room It was the smallest room I ve ever seen There should be a law about not being able to rent out such small rooms My suitcase took up most the floor space Kept tripping over it Window opened into some pipes I saw some animal walking around in the corner of my eye think it was a mouse but not sure Had to ask to change this room as it was seriously unneceptable Next room same size just looked bigger because of the layout it was a bit better but still tiny Funny smell in both rooms Some staff members grumpy and cold Not uk standard place , Some very lovely and helpful male concierge staff That s as positive as my mom experience was
195746,The Premier Notting Hill, Air conditioning didn t work well in our room despite staff arranging for it to be left on all day Room was also noisy as it was near an outside generator It was not possible to change our room on our arrival day as the hotel was full although staff would have done this for us had they been able to , All staff were extremely helpful and friendly

195750,The Premier Notting Hill, After Nottinghill Carnival the road closures meant I couldn t get a taxi to come to the hotel of course this isn t any fault of the hotel but just to warn you to make plans to work around the road closures if you re there for carnival weekend , The staff were extremely accommodating to us Even though the airconditioning in our room was broken they provided a fan without having to be asked They were very friendly and helpful 
195751,The Premier Notting Hill, Smallest possible room without fresh air through the window an air conditioning which could not manage the enormously hot room so sleeping was very uncomfortable , Within Notting Hill well located
195752,The Premier Notting Hill, Was very hot in room should of asked staff how to adjust air con but that was my own fault and it was the weather, Beds super comfy and plenty of pillows fridge iron ironing board microwave hairdryer toiletries including sanitary bags plenty of sockets very cosy and lovely staff Perfect area 
195753,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was messy the wall 3ws damaged and also everyine I left the room had problems coming back in my card didn t work so I had to get someone to always come with me tp open it manually, The comfort of the beds and the toilet was clean
195754,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was a bit cramped with lots of bulky furnitures , The bed was comfy with lots of pillows There was a mini fridge microwave plates and cutleries in the room which were useful The location was good really close to Bayswater station and lots of restaurants Spacious bathroom 
195755,The Premier Notting Hill, Reception staff not very helpful, The staff at the reception were not particularly friendly which is not particularly nice for someone who has been travelling for 24 hours and exhausted Good location though for any location in central London short walk to both bayswater and Notting Hill gate station 
195756,The Premier Notting Hill, incredible small rooms even for London staff not very friendly or helpful no restaurant bar for lunch dinner room service they only serve breakfast very poor water pressure in the shower not very clean but I ve seen worst Definitely not a 4 star hotel you can get much better value for your money in a lot of 3 star hotels in the city, location is pretty good bathrooms are new
195757,The Premier Notting Hill, The lift is shacking old needs changing Side tables glasses need dusting n cleaning , Breakfast lovely Food fresh Toilet nice clean Rain shower is superb Staff very polite pleasant 
195758,The Premier Notting Hill, I didn t try the breakfast so I can t comment on that Make sure that you ask in advance for the kind of mattress you want soft hard etc everyone has different tastes Make it clear to the staff what you want and they will work with you , The location was great and convenient to Kensington Gardens Portobello Road etc without being in the middle of high traffic and loud noise The Prince of Wales pub down the street was great A short walk to Bayswater Station gets you on the Circle Line The management tried very hard to make sure we were comfortable I complained about the bed as soon as I got there horribly jet lagged and irate they promptly and pleasantly upgraded me Remember you really don t go to London to stay in hotel unless you re an incognito celebrity You go to explore sleep and explore some more For us this was perfectly fine 
195759,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing the service was excellent, The place was very quite and clean The service was really good as well And I loved the fact that there was a free wifi for the guests Watched lot of movies online 
195760,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was advertised with a bath and we actually received a room with a shower that was too small to turn around in I struggled to wash my hair in there and felt extremely chlostraphoebic You also couldn t open the windows You can also hear every noise throughout the hotel so we didn t get a very good sleep My partner is just over 6ft and was hanging out of the bed all night , Staff were very friendly Close to tube and a tesco express McDonald s and burger king as well as a gym and pub Free bottle of water and biscuits included in the room Iron and ironing board also included 
195761,The Premier Notting Hill, Room seemed a lot smaller than advertised but did have all you need Fridge in the room was a waste of space as it just took up room and did not work Shower heads needed cleaning which was off putting and toiletries were of quite a poor standard The room was also very much like being on a ship the building is old and and you have to make allowances for this but the room had a definite slope which was so bad that we rolled off the bed If you have a cheap deal then its worth it but full price I would not pay or reccommend , Location was great easy access to both Notting Hill and to Bays water Tube access was good and the area was lively but not to noisy Room was compact and had a microwave which was a pleasant surprise 
195762,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Nice quiet good quality room it is for sure a small room But I d rather have this 4 star hotel for a great price under 50 quid than a big oversized room which I pay more for
195763,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Ideal sized rooms for couples Bed was very comfy shower was great and bathroom was spacious The overall look and feel of the place was welcoming and homely not to mention the great location it is in and the aesthetics

195766,The Premier Notting Hill, The space for the breakfast is limited approx 10 tables and sometimes the place becomes overcrowded There is no variety and limited items served everyday literally same menu , I must say that all the staff members are extremely humble and helpful They do their best to make the guests happy I was very pleased esp with Mr Milagris Diniz and Albazar as they took my feedback and changed the room upon my request 
195767,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was terrible Small noisy and kette didnt work Bed was like a camp bed I managed into the shower cubicle just and I am not heavy , Staff were nice as was the locale 
195768,The Premier Notting Hill, We were initially given a basement room with no view out the window When we complained as we are both claustrophobic we were immediately given a lovely 3rd floor room with a view Good customer service , Great hotel in a lovely location 
195769,The Premier Notting Hill, The air conditioner was not really working properly for my second night of my stay However I requested a fan and it was sent immediately to the room and the air conditioner was fixed the next day , I booked 4 rooms 2 rooms at a later date for my relatives They were given a much bigger room than mine and my parents and we paid at the same price Once i ve mentioned this to the staff my parents and i were given a much bigger room the next day The staff was very friendly and considerate of the change 
195770,The Premier Notting Hill, The TV didn t work got underground room when requested upper story room and very stuffy hot room and no windows as underground Also bath was broken the plug was stuck in so bath filled up when we showered Very dark also, Very comfortable bed has everything you d need for short stay and good location
195771,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms were small for my taste and the mattress on the bed was terrible but the staff made an effort to make due with what they had they propped it up with towels and bedding I hope they will change it the next time I stay there, The staff were very helpful the location is central and very close to the tube The area was clean and close to lots of shops The staff always brought bottles of water and fruit to our room to make it a much more enjoyable experience it was our 25th wedding Anniversary I would go back and stay again 
195772,The Premier Notting Hill, The breakfast was included in our price but it wasn t great There was a hot option of scrambled eggs which my daughter had and said was ok but the croissants were more like bread than traditional French flaky and orange juice had never seen a fresh orange , The location was convenient for the restaurant we wanted to eat at in the evening We stayed in a club room which was clean Staff were pleasant 
195773,The Premier Notting Hill, Air conditioning didn t work and room was boiling do very poor night s sleep Tiny room even though we were upgraded Wotsits and sweet wrappers on floor , Location was good nice from the outside Staff were generally friendly to us though I m not sure about other guests Free upgrade to club room 
195774,The Premier Notting Hill, Incredibly Small for two people to be sharing a room We asked if we could pay for an upgrade but was told we was not able to Wouldn t recommend for partners sharing ,No Positive
195775,The Premier Notting Hill, The size of the room looks smaller than 16 meter square The hotel seems to be not compatible with the rank of 4 star hotel , First we were given a small double room Then when we asked them to change they had agreed and it was little bit bigger It seems that they have different room sizes for the same type of the room The staff were cooperative enough when we asked them to change the room and they provided a chance to see the available which was a gesture we had appreciated The hotel was very quite and clean and we were able to have a restful night 
195776,The Premier Notting Hill, Watching staff clearing breakfast tables and taking one glass one cup etc at a time into the kitchen Please provide staff with trays so that a table may be cleared in one go ,No Positive
195777,The Premier Notting Hill, The room Club Room was much smaller than described here amenities are old and the overall cleaning is not good The elevator was not working half of the time of my stay At the time of checkout the personnel was trying to convince other clients to leave positive comments here and on TripAdvisor which is probably the only reason why this hotel is featured on Booking com Would not recommend ,No Positive
195778,The Premier Notting Hill, air conditioning inadequate but staff did provide fan on request, Location was great and easy for Tube restaurants shops Staff friendly very helpful Room clean and tidy would stay again 
195779,The Premier Notting Hill, The photos of the rooms are very misleading of their actual size I know it s London and space is limited but the photos didn t show that The check in staff were very unhelpful anf rude with solving a simple check complication , Location was excellent and breakfast was good 
195780,The Premier Notting Hill, The bedroom althought I booked a comfortable one was very small and extremely warm we had to switch on the air conditionate when outside there were 20 degrees , Amazing location in Notting Hill Close to two tube stations silent and sourrounded by trees 
195781,The Premier Notting Hill, They didn t replace my bottled water after the first day My AC wasn t very cold , Location was excellent and room was perfect Staff were so helpful and friendly I understand that this hotel just changed ownership between the time I booked and stayed yet this hotel didn t skip a beat I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone 
195782,The Premier Notting Hill, Was a snug room as a male of 6ft 4 inches I could of done with a bit more space but still very nice room, The staff were very helpful and the full English breakfast was lovely just what I needed from the night before 2 tube stops within easy walking distance
195783,The Premier Notting Hill, Had to turn down first two rooms offered as one in basement with no widow one next floor up next to generator Very small restaurant for breakfast and no bacon for religious reasons Site showed free breakfast but we had to pay for it on arrival , The reception manager was very polite and helpful and all thes staff very friendly 
195784,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was very small request for a room with a desk wasn t taken into account Shower door was broken and not fixed during the time I was there , On the whole it s an ok property in a good location 
195785,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was smaller than we d expected It was still perfectly adequate though just don t expect wonders The floor was a bit creaky and the air conditioner made a weird loud noise every now and then that woke us up a couple of times The complimentary hotel shampoo is terrible bring your own But really it s perfectly alright the staff is nice they will keep your bags for you on the day or arrival and when you leave the bed is soft there is air conditioning even if it s noisy it s clean quiet located very conveniently and Notting Hill is lovely , The staff was pleasant They seemed a bit busy at times but they were still eager to help which was nice The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean Instant coffee and some biscuits were complimentary 
195786,The Premier Notting Hill, Our room was very small and oh so very very hot No natural light or window to open quite claustrophobic just glad we didn t have a heatwave, Loved the location staff very attentive
195787,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms quite hot and air conditioning could do with updating as they tend to blast out really cold air so you switch it off and the room becomes really hot again Difficult to find a happy medium but not unbearable , Nice quiet rooms and comfy beds Good spread of complementary snacks fruit and drinks in room staff quite friendly and helpful 
195788,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was extremely small And after traveling for 12 hours and arriving they told us they didn t have a room for us and relocated us to sister property I paid 300 pounds per night and booked three months earky Not at all acceptable , The breakfast was good 
195789,The Premier Notting Hill, Very small room but adequate for needs as visiting family nearby so only needed to sleep there Receptionist took ages to find booking and didn t seem very friendly, Upto date hotel clean and well kept
195790,The Premier Notting Hill, Tiny room with no window Located next to the boiler system or something similarly noisy Aircon doesn t work Sleepless night Worst of all though this property took a security deposit from my card on arrival and never refunded me Overpriced understaffed dishonest hotel Avoid at all costs ,No Positive
195791,The Premier Notting Hill, The hotel manager was not particularly friendly and initially put me in a room that was like a cupboard with no natural light it was vile The bathroom smelled musty and the mattress was terrible No support in it at all needs replacing , Location and with the ex caption of the manager all other staff were fantastic friendly and helpful 
195792,The Premier Notting Hill, Had to sit and wait over 30 minutes to book in Lady on reception desk was very stressed and quite to rude to the other staff which was unprofessional , Great location comfortable bed and great shower 
195793,The Premier Notting Hill, Aircon temp too high unable to adjust lower so room stiflingly hot View of airduct and brick walls of inner building from window as room was facing to the rear of the hotel Requested front facing room over street but did not get this , Location 
195794,The Premier Notting Hill, No choice of coffee at breakfast only black filtered coffee was available which I didn t like the room was much smaller than anticipated and it didn t include a bath as promised, the staff was helpful the interior modern and elegant a bottle of surprisingly good wine had been included as a welcome gift
195795,The Premier Notting Hill, Understaffed and was kept waiting 40 minutes to check in only to then be told that our room that was booked was not available after waiting for another room to be arranged they gave us the original room we booked Our room wasn t in a great position and had a generator or something along those lines right outside which made a noise during the entire stay , The location is a short distance from bayswater underground and there are plenty of restaurants and shops close by
195796,The Premier Notting Hill, Hotel have very nice room but bathroom need so work Breakfast room very small just few tables On the day was no bacon and no sausage not good Luckily we dad complementary breakfast because I would pay for this selescion on the buffet Waiter very professional , Staff is very nice friendly and professional Doorman I think his name was Abazar very good 
195797,The Premier Notting Hill, The first room didn t have an open window view so we asked to move We were moved to another room which was excellent Only SLIGHT niggle was the tables you sit at at breakfast are really small not much room for many plates The staff make up for this though by taking away dishes when you re done , We were initially booked into another hotel but on arrival were told works were being done so we needed to go to a sister hotel Via taxi which they paid for we arrived at this hotel It s a gorgeous building with very modern features When we arrived to the room we weren t happy there was a window but it was covered with curtain on the outside so we didn t have a view We asked to move and the next room was great a view overlooking the front The room is very clean Towels are changed if you put them on the floor in the bathroom I m not too sure about the bed sheets Tea coffee topped up daily No outside noise The morning staff at breakfast are excellent can t help you enough and very efficient The breakfast itself is amazing lots of choice for me veggie and my Mum who is picky You don t feel rushed even though the staff never stop You can get the 360 bus on the main road which is approx a 15 min walk from the hotel to the bus stop This takes you right into Oxford Road The hotel is approx 35 mins from Euston train station Or you could walk across Kensington Gardens Hyde park instead of the bus it s a long walk but worth it it s lovely 
195798,The Premier Notting Hill, Tiny room looking out onto wall and pipes so very stuffy and air con not working properly so very hot, Walking distance to 2 tube stations and Hyde Park
195799,The Premier Notting Hill, Bathroom up a narrow flight of 8 or 9 stairs 2 air conditioning stacks outside window making it impossible to leave window open as it was noisy even when window was closed Poor number of tv channels Bathroom was tired shower over bath but no shower curtain All this in a club room Check in delayed staff member was abrupt , Nothing
195800,The Premier Notting Hill, Very tight fit small room and small shower But then again everything in Europe is tight and cozy It was not unexpected , Nicely recently decorated clean and very friendly staff 
195801,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was not good very hot fan extraction pipes immediately out side window with a constant noise level in the room of 73db couldn t shut the window because of the heat Don t accept room 003, Tube pubs and local restaurants all very close by
195802,The Premier Notting Hill, The hotel was over booked and had no room for me So when I got to the hotel I was asked to wait for a taxi that would take me to a sister hotel supposedly an upgraded one HOWEVER in that hotel I was located in the basement in a stuffy room closet actually with no window This type of room should not be offered in such a high price I asked the reception to change my room but they claimed to have nothing for the night The next night I was given a room above ground level and it was very nice indeed just wish I had this room from the get go which honestly I believe I should have How can they charge for a room underground with no windows and air circulation the same as they do for their other rooms makes no sense to me the way I see it this hotel is a gamble , The staff id very nice 
195803,The Premier Notting Hill, Room got a bit warm despite the air con would have been great to have a window that opened, Check in and concierge staff fantastic Short walk from Tube station and Hyde Park Room comfortable and well equipped
195804,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed was tiny I m 5 5 and my feet were hanging off the end my husband who is 5 8 was even more uncomfortable than me The shower cubicle was so small thank god we re both slim Honestly anyone who is larger wouldn t fit We were in the basement and couldn t see out at all to see what the weather s like outside to decide what to wear Also our room number started with 8 but no one told us that meant the basement when we checked in so we went up in the lift looking for the room and had to go back to reception for help finding the room The hairdryer was ancient looked like a relic from the 1980 s and you need to keep your finger on the button to use it , The air con worked well and kept the room cool and overall the room was very clean The shower was really hot turning the dial didn t seem to cool it down any but I love a hot shower so that s fine for me The location was great no complaints there The decor is nice but the rooms are tiny bordering on claustrophobic 
195805,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed seamed a little on the small side Feet kept sticking out the bottom , Able to check in early Upgraded to club room Really clean room friendly staff short walk from tube station 
195806,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are definitely not like on the pictures its dirty and it smells pretty bad in there The reception is partly nice but not able to actually fulfill your needs Rooms are super small, Location is amazing and the underground is super close 
195807,The Premier Notting Hill, The pillows were hard They only had curtains for only half of each window which meant it was bright really early in the morning sun came up around 3am at this time of year The lift was a bit slow even though it was just 4 floors , The location was great within bayswater area what we wanted Has two tube stations bayswater and queensway and several bus routes Close to alot of shops and restaurants and hyde park We got the top floor Bell boys were helpful in carrying our luggages from car to lobby Toilet was clean plenty of hot and cold water for several showers throughout the day 
195808,The Premier Notting Hill, Very noisy basement room with window next to the hotel kitchen back door with people talking into the early hours outside the window and doors banging meant I had a very disturbed night s sleep , Room was clean
195809,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed springs were broken at one end so we had to move the mattress around Also there was no cold water sometimes in the taps so had brush our teeth with hot water and request bottles of water The curtains were difficult to close too Given the number of issues that we had with the room I was disappointed with the staffs response and were made to feel like we were pains , Great location and good room size 
195810,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was more likely a closet there was no space between the bed and the wall and my husband had to crawl over my legs in order to get off it This room was announced as Double Delux It used to be the sevants quarters obviously The room on the picture in booking com was so masterfully taken that it was impossible to understand the miserable reality but for a disabled person like myself it was very unreasonable , Very frindly and helpful staff excellent location in a beautiful terrace quiet garden right in front of the hotel 
195811,The Premier Notting Hill, This hotel was probaly the worst I ve ever been in The Staff were horrible except porter the room wasn t to high standards and we were lied to We ordered a deluxe twin room and they first placed us into a standard room We then complained about this first saying they didn t have another room then swapping us with another person which is so dishonest We think that this is what they did to our first room as we were given smoking rooms when we ordered non smoking Swapping people around is so dishonest Aswell as upgrading people that payed less then degrading those who payed for the deluxe room I barely slepped at all not even sleeping the first night due to the noise of people in the corridor and the lift The twin beds may as well have been double beds as they are not separated they just put on two twin beds on a double Base The cleanliness was terrible and they obviously do not dust at all The shower was extremely dirty Aswell Made our stay at London a nightmare , The porter was one of the nicest people having a convostaion with us making sure we were okay with our bags etc T
195812,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was very warm we had to sleep with the AC on which made a lot of noise We also heard a lot of noise from the hallway in the morning , The location is great 
195813,The Premier Notting Hill, Extremely disappointed with my stay Firstly I was rung midmorning of my arrival date to be told I was being relocated to another property then after an hour of phone calls en route whilst on the train to London found I could in fact stay at the hotel despite the maintenance issues that were occurring having had to press for this information firmly and repeatedly I also had to ask for an address and name of the hotel as I could not find it on google worrying to say the least and a little stressful Booking com were not very helpful either I d booked this hotel months ago and of course it would be impossible in London to find an alternative accommodation in the vicinity I required at just under 80 for the night Perviously they have been great On arrival I was put in a room which could have been considered a closet with a window onto an industrial vent The heat was unbearable and after calling down to reception and growing impatient hailing some porters I saw in the hallway still running late to get to the business event purpose of my trip I was moved to another room and due to time restrains had to just agree to it The furniture was in a deplorable state broken and chipped the shower was dirty with orange scum on the grout and limescale on the head the mirror was cracked down the middle but at least this room had a window albeit onto the back of other properties and having to open and close doors of he wardrobe bathroom to navigate to it Later I asked to book a taxi and only on almost arriving at my destination the firm they d used not knowing how to get there I was on the gps on my phone was charged a fare that was 6 more than the going rate for a hackney cab something I thought I was ordering instead of a private firm Apparently this rate had been agreed prior to my departure why they didn t tell me this I have no idea , Staff were as helpful as they could be those I met face to face were very polite accommodating and tried to make the best of all the issues I had during my stay 
195814,The Premier Notting Hill, The room so small Low ceiling no room for anything The room was so hot and the air conditioner would only go as low as 19 degs and when I switched it on it smelt of damp air and made alot of noise The bathroom just was not clean enough There was stains on the T roll and the shower was stained The light switch for te bathroom was covered in finger marks It was quite horrible No minibar for water or other drinks The lift was so slow It was just unpleasant to stay in and I woudl not stay there again I don t know why it has a 4 star rating It should be 3 star as it really as nothing but it s location to give it any kind of attraction for staying there, The location
195815,The Premier Notting Hill, The room in the basement very noisy Breakfast the bacon wasn t very tasty Some of the staff didn t speak English too well Do not use the taxi service offered by the hotel the driver is a madman , The location 5 mins from the tube Staff overall was very helpful and friendly
195816,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms are tiny the food is inedible and the equipment airco furniture etc has seen much better days All in all for a 4 star establishment you would maybe have expected something better , The hotel was relatively well situated and the staff was very helpful and friendly
195817,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was definitely only a single room because you would not have been able to stick another person in there and I think it could have been cleaner when I got there , The bed was comfy and the staff very helpful the location is absolutely excellent 
195818,The Premier Notting Hill, I waited for almost an hour at checkin at midnight as a group booking ahead of me couldn t be accommodated It was upsetting for the group who were taken to an alternative hotel but fortunately only tiring for me The air con in the room was insufficient to keep the room cool and yet it was a tiny room The service throughout the hotel was a little disinterested and slow , The breakfast food was all nicely prepared there wasn t a big selection but what was their was enjoyable 
195819,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was nice but VERY small double bed only accessible from one side room too small for two people to change clothes in But this is typical of London hotels Could have been closer to tube stations as well , Decent hotel in Notting Hill area good staff quiet reliable wifi at least in our 2nd floor room 
195820,The Premier Notting Hill, No hook to hang your jackets Everytime you took the elevator to the 4th floor it would shake vibrate just before stopping , Breakfast was good It is quiet and near Kensington park and pubs 
195821,The Premier Notting Hill, Agressive and rude staff members at the front desk One central ac machine powers the whole building means an individual ac unit in the room is extremely weak when everyone in the building turns on their room ac Our room s ac was not cool at all Room was tiny Does not match other 4 star hotels in London , The location of the hotel was good Its near Hyde Park 
195822,The Premier Notting Hill, Receptionist told us that the boiler was broken and tried to move us to another hotel 10 mins away When we refused they put us in a room off reception next to a toilet People were in and out of the toilet all night and kept us awake We had requested a high room but were given a ground floor room Miraculously the boiler was fixed by the time we used the shower Receptionist was unfriendly and lacked basic customer service skills , Room was clean and location was good 
195823,The Premier Notting Hill, The room 208 is so small that you can not get out of double bed on both sides but just from one and you could just open one door of the double doors cabinet , The hotel is located in a very quite and nice area
195824,The Premier Notting Hill, Poor or no ventilation Window into day light arc filld with vent duct and noise from air cond unit They should not be allowed to sell rooms like number 006 , That they after 2 nights moved us to a decent room with air so that we could sleep
195825,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms were lovely but apparently there were a pair of jogging bottoms underneath the sheets in my colleagues room They didn t complain or anything at the time so it couldn t have been that bad and presumed it was an honest mistake The rooms were generally very clean and tidy , The hotel is lovely not your standard Premier Inn The staff were very welcoming and helpful and we even got a free upgrade on arrival 
195826,The Premier Notting Hill, The manager was slightly overbearing seemed to airways be telling her very helpful staff how to do their jobs each time we were at the reception desk micro management syndrome ,No Positive
195827,The Premier Notting Hill, It s not so much of a dislike but one thing I would point out is that the air conditioning seemed to lack power and the instant cold zap expected from air con but we were lucky to have glorious weather which meant the room was very hot anyway so we kept the air con on all the time with a nectar card and it did help to keep it cooler and more comfortable for when we were in the room , The hotel reception was welcoming and we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of water All of the staff were very helpful and friendly and they even printed out some underground routes for our stay The room was cosy and clean with all the facilities expected and the towels were nice and fluffy The shower was lovely and hot every time we used it and toiletries were also provided The pictures on the website are a good representation of the room we stayed in The hotel was in a good location and we felt safe walking to and from the Bayswater station even around midnight which only took around 5 7 minutes Thank you to the hotel staff We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would most definitely return 
195828,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing to dislike wish it s still allowed to smoke indoors but i understand that s the law of the land , Excellent management clean rooms 24 access Breakfast of your choice safe secure very quite the list is long but let me add high speed WIFI 
195829,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms a bit small but it s London so would expect this to be fair Isn t really an issue though as the space was utilised well and had all the facilities required, Comfy bed Great bathroom Good breakfast and great location
195830,The Premier Notting Hill, Room very small Shower even smaller, Great breakfast nice variety Walking distance from Bayswater and Nottinghill stations Walking distance from Kensington gardens
195831,The Premier Notting Hill, Tiniest hotel room ever I had to climb over my husband to get into the bed which was pushed up against the French windows and the bed was only about 8 inches short of the width of the room Tiny shower if you re larger than average you won t get in , Friendly staff 
195832,The Premier Notting Hill, Very small shower and restroom facilities The room I had was not meant for someone over 5 11 and they should advertise that , Nicely remodeled technology good in the room Nice location
195833,The Premier Notting Hill, Staff were pretty unfriendly except cleaners the breakfast was pretty bad and bathroom was small considering we were in a club room, Extremely clean really comfortable bed and the decor was very modern
195834,The Premier Notting Hill, They sent us to a room in the basement with only a very small window that we couldn t open Our phone had no signal in the room Cleaning was poor, The breakfast was good and the staff was pleasant
195835,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The hotel manager quickly sought to upgrade us to a larger room having noticed the amount of luggage we were travelling with The service was above expectations with all staff eager to ensure our stay was enjoyable 
195836,The Premier Notting Hill, Had to wait some time to check in horrid smell in reception and corridor Shower much too small and nowhere to sit in room and bed against wall so had to climb over my wife to get out for something described as a delux room disappointing Also loud Ac unit outside room,No Positive
195837,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing, Everything Room was gorgeous all facilities were clean and modern fantastic hot shower and water pressure nice and strong Upon arriving we were hot and tired and the doorman offered gave us their bottled water at no charge We had The Clubroom which was spacious with gorgeous views of the park over the road Air con as well We loved it 
195838,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing I didn t like at all, Loved this hotel very welcoming stunning area very friendly and polite staff and will most definitely be staying again 
195839,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are miniscule The room I was offered was 1m50 by 2m without a window stuffy and claustrofobic When I asked for a better room I got a one with a window yet with a smelly bathroom poor reception TV and it was 2 by 2m with the bed in there there was approx 70cm by 70 cm to manoevre aside from the ally next to the 1m by 1 5m bathroom , Location is good staff is good and friendly 
195840,The Premier Notting Hill, The first room I had was tiny It was so hot I felt I couldn t breath Air conditioning noisy You couldn t open curtains I assume because window opened onto two huge pipes I asked to move rooms Was moved to a double room which was equally tiny but had a view The pictures of the rooms on the website do not reflect the actual rooms A very disappointing and expensive stay for the room , Staff extremely friendly Very clean 
195841,The Premier Notting Hill, Small room soft bed, Very helpfull personal who took very good care of us The situation was for us perfect We will recommand the hotel and come back next time ib London
195842,The Premier Notting Hill, My room was very small in the ground floor with small window to the air shaft but quite convenient for short stay , Excellent location close to tube and Hyde Park Kensington Gardens Portobello Road bus connection to the centre Very helpfull staff nice breakfast clean calm 
195843,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Really nice area close to the central line Clean and well appointed rooms staff was very friendly and helpful close by shopping for all your needs 
195844,The Premier Notting Hill, Shampoo and shower gel is not supply regularly during room cleaning The design of single room is too small and narrow almost no space for walking in , Breakfast good value for money
195845,The Premier Notting Hill, Arrived only to find they said they could not accomodate us as the hotel has water problems They offered us a hotel in Paddington so was most annoyed as I booked Notting Hill and not Paddington Never will stay here again , Nothing
195846,The Premier Notting Hill, Because of room size and lack of view the price of the room bit to high , Comfortable and clean price on the room maybe a little too high due to size But modern and clean 
195847,The Premier Notting Hill, Although i booked two months in advance i was moved from this hotel to two other hotels on the same day with a couple of hours prior notice The hotels are kind of similar to each other however when i choose a hotel online i expect to spend the night in it and not be bothered with moving from one hotel to the other because the booking system they have is incompetent Although there is an elevator there are some rooms with an extra set of steps , Got compensated with free breakfast and it was great location of the hotels in the queensway area is good Very clean Friendly staff Room size is what you expect for the price you pay Nicely decorated rooms and toilets 
195848,The Premier Notting Hill, I was asked to move to another hotel 4 hrs before my arrival because the boiler was out of action when I arrived non of the staff seem to know anything about it which I found a little suspicious The Deluxe twin was not as pictured online and the room was very very snug The view was looking out on to ductwork of an extract unit that was constantly running , The staff were friendly 
195849,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was slightly on the smaller size and the rate could ve been about 15 per night cheaper , The room was neat and tidy Washroom was nice and beat Wifi was available Location of hotel was very central and good Near the Queensway tube station and Hyde park entrance The staff was very cordial and helpful I remember Aparna and Niyati the 2 ladies were very sweet and helpful Even the gentleman Savio was very courteous I m thoroughly impressed by their cordial attitude 
195850,The Premier Notting Hill, Toilet seat not even attached to the toilet Which should have been spotted when the room was cleaned The TV was very old and the picture quality was appalling like watching one from the 1970 s The shower tray was quite grubby and the shower had no pressure These are all pretty basic things that you would expect I was very disappointed as I wanted my son to stay in a nice hotel with me , The bed was really comfortable and the staff were wonderful 
195851,The Premier Notting Hill, Small stuffed room Rude annoying unprofessional staff especially the lady in charge She was too loud complaining bullying her staff , Location
195852,The Premier Notting Hill, Extra small room not enough space for a baby cot suitcases and the stroller The ac kept dropping the temperature at night Plus they charged us double Very bad , Location and helpful luggage man 
195853,The Premier Notting Hill, Found used products shampoo and shower gel above the shower frame which clearly hadn t been taken by housekeeping when cleaning the room and tv was broken from the side switches and the remote had to be used directly infront of the tv Room smelt like an ashtray, Location
195854,The Premier Notting Hill, Would have been good to have snacks available room service in the evening although this isn t essential as there s plenty of places in the locality , Friendly staff Excellent location near Hyde Park
195855,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast too expensive , The room was tiny yet very nice adequate Appreciated the fridge microwave kettle dishes Thought it was a great price for the location 
195856,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was absolutely tiny I asked for my room to be changed 3 times as each time they kept putting me in a room with a noisey ventilation shaft the second room had the shaft and a smell of sewage I had seen other reviews online but assumed they d had bad luck with the room no apparently a good proportion of the rooms face the ventilation shaft and pretty much all rooms are tiny By the third room I had given up the view was okay except for the sanitary product sitting on the window sill outside The room was so small though that I couldn t open the wardrobe door for the bed The room was actually the length of the bed and so you could only get in one side This is definitely not a 4 star hotel trust me the reviews are spot on the photographs on the hotel site are not , The location
195857,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The breakfast was very nice even though I felt it was a little expensive The staff were organised and my room was comfortable and well made It was also in a good location near a couple of stations and in a nice area 
195858,The Premier Notting Hill, Same breakfast every morning There could have been changed in variety Especially when you are staying longer time you would appreciate to have variation on the buffet , Quiet location
195859,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Arrived much too early for 2 p m check in but was given a room after a few minutes wait at 12 30 Excellent In the meantime I received free water and tea by very friendly staff Delightful 
195860,The Premier Notting Hill, We got bumped from this hotel to the Hyde Park Grand in Paddington on what I am sure was the pretext of a boiler problem We were assure it was a better hotel and it would be an upgrade We were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience We had to check in at the Notting Hill hotel paid and were sent by taxi to the Hyde Park Grand We were given a basement room that was so small that we could not both be vertical at the same time One had to go in the bathroom The room was tired and it was not a good experience We did not risk the free breakfast ,No Positive

195873,The Premier Notting Hill, The smallest room I have ever stayed in in 40 years of travelling To get in the room you had to go up 3 vert steep stairs lucky I was running the marathon the next day Bed was like a block of wobbly foam I have a photo of the room if you like , Location was good Amenities round about pubs restaurants excellent 
195874,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was too small However well designed , The room was very clean the staff were helpful and friendly The hotel is close to a number of nice restaurants and only 15 min away from major locations like city centre Kensington palace Nottinghill etc Very close to metro

195876,The Premier Notting Hill, For the price you really can t complain about much The only things I noticed were that the air conditioning wasn t great the doors weren t very noise proof and there was no shower curtain over the bath , The price of this hotel was incredibly for the quality of the accomodation My room was upgraded which was wonderful and had a fridge and microwave which made my stay even better The location of the hotel is slightly away from the tourist hotspots which was fine for me and the staff were helpful and friendly The fitness room was very small and basic 2 home style cross trainers but The fact that there was a fitness room at all is excellent for this price 
195877,The Premier Notting Hill, When I woke up I was covers in red spots Three days when since I check out and I m still struggling with antistaminucs Little animals are the real owners of the little room, The staff really friendly
195878,The Premier Notting Hill, Tiny room Smelt damp had to be moved to new room No help with bags smallest breakfast room in the world Laundry staff at 5am extremely loud Noisy room Loud banging doors Poor lighting in rooms Iron burnt hole in shirt Awful , Reception staff were nice and friendly Food was good Location great 
195879,The Premier Notting Hill, I don t believe the room was in par with the price the room it s self was OK however the bed was too small my feet hung over the edge and I m only 5ft5 n my partner is over 6ft Our room was situated on the ground floor next to the public toilets which kept us up most of the night with people going to the toilets and the cleaners filling up there buckets in the morning There was also no view and we couldn t open the window as it looked out onto the vents for the kitchen, The area
195880,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, The hotel is perfectly located literally 1 minute walk from the tube station only a couple of stations away from Oxford street Lots of nice restaurants nearby The staff are very polite and pleasant and the rooms are clean and comfortable Breakfast was delicious 
195881,The Premier Notting Hill, very small room and a room with no view and compared with other hotels I ve stayed in around the world not very good value for money, very comfy bed close to tube stations and restaurants
195882,The Premier Notting Hill, the rooms are very SMALL and as it s old the floors aren t level in the room The bed and desk were therefore sloped TV channels nothing special Someone was smoking in room next door yet no fire alarm sounded Smelled sick , outside look of building comfy and welcoming entrance and staff
195883,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, I ve been to London many times and during my last stay I ve chosen this place I absolutely loved it The location is quiet the room was clean the staff was friendly The hotel is located near Hyde park and 7 minutes from the nearest Underground station 
195884,The Premier Notting Hill, the seat of the WC was broken Rooms could have been bigger too small , staff was friendly location is excellent wifi speed was good which is extremely imp for ppl travelling for business purposes 
195885,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was rather small My other half being 6 3 couldnt lay straight as his feet touched the wall , Alexandra was fantastic and couldnt be more helpful 
195886,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was rather compact The room was quite noisey as buy the air conditioning No biscuits , Friendly staff Opened the door on entry Good location Smelt nice 
195887,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms where very small Everytime I entered the reception area all I could here was the hotel receptionist manager speaking loudly at other staff and dealing with complaints , The location was perfect only 5 minute walk to Central line tube station 
195888,The Premier Notting Hill, They ask you to pay immediately I personally don t like this cause I wanna see the room first and then pay if everything is ok The room is really small nothing to do with the pictures showed on booking I told at the reception and the answer was it s booking fault cause to sell more they put these pics The furnitures are like in the pictures but the size is totally different For 1 person and 1 night it should be ok but personally if I were with someone else I would have complained I said that also at the reception cause it can t be considered for 2 a bed stuck under the window and between the walls that oblige 1 of the 2 sleeping in to step over the other one to go out of the bed This is more a nice single room The floor in the bathroom was broken and for a 4 star hotel this is not a little thing as also the toilet had the sit broken The window was really old and quite creepy and I couldn t open it for more than 4 5 cm cause then it s blocked In the bathroom no windows So the standard is really more of a vintage 3 star hotel clean and nicely furnished but I wouldn t consider this as a 4 stars hotel In London they should start to understand that in 2016 the standards in all Europe are really different and I have personally been in some 3 stars hotels or budget hotels that are nicer than this one new more space more facilities for the same price or even less But unfortunately London is still the most expensive city with mediocre standards , I booked a deluxe double room indicated for 2 people even if I was alone Number 408 The meeting at the reception was really nice The receptionist are friendly and kind The bed was comfortable The position is good you still have to walk 8 minutes to get to the central line that bring you to the city center but the surround is calm a nice park in the front of the hotel 
195889,The Premier Notting Hill, Had to pay our stay on first day in advance no hair dryer available in bath Do not I repeat DO NOT book breakfast at the hotel GBP 12 15 there are so many great cafes in Portobello Road just 5 10 minutes walk from the hotel where you get breakfast starting at GBP 6, Perfect location quiet room good value for the money
195890,The Premier Notting Hill, The should really be sued for having 4 stars Typical Shaftesbury budgety chain cheap and small Run down extremely small rooms Cold rooms that cant keep heating due to the AC There is only a very old AC not a healthy way of heating up in both rooms i was which is controlled by them to change for the warmness so you have to call them up every time Maids do not do a good job of cleaning and ignore change the sheets notes and will not change them It is unacceptable to have to see the salt water stains in the shower have a 3 year build up They also make noises early in the mornings chatting and gossiping Even the Indian porter is noisey Very hard bed and pillows No fridge which is unacceptable for this day and age Dirty old furniture They have a 1x1 fitness room with ONLY one elliptical machine Unbelievable that this hotel exists Even the elevator is very slow and takes ages Not all rooms are accecible by elevator I cant find anything positive apart from the location An absolute rip off The hotel and hospitality association should go and inspect room 114 and the fitness room It seems like this hotel is is run and managed by very stingy people who wont spend a penny on it You can tell that from the white goods quality and the toilet paper It needs a total revamp and 2 3 million thrown in it I wasnt in basement rooms but i can imagine what their basement floor would be like This is a barely 2 stars hotel with some club rooms , NOTHING
195891,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms could have been bigger It was a bit difficult walking around and moving luggage with two people in the room But they were lovely rooms overall ,No Positive
195892,The Premier Notting Hill, Asked for no room service one day and someone had come in the room anyway Bed on the floor Hard to move in the shower , Staff very friendly and extremely helpful 
195893,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms absolutely tiny Bathroom small with low water pressure and no option for cold water on occasion Beware of basement rooms with no window Allocated on arrival but did change to room with a view over square when I requested it at reception Paid on my debit card when I checked in but hotel still put hold on same amount for another week on my account , Location excellent near Hyde Park Bayswater and Queensway Tube Station 
195894,The Premier Notting Hill, would have liked to know the room was THAT small i could barley fit in the bathroom i still would have stayed great value for money but i would have paid slightly extra for were i fit comfortably , Lovely staff very clean fast wifi
195895,The Premier Notting Hill, I only stayed for one night and spent very little time in my Club room thankfully as it was tiny and the air con was rubbish It had the worlds smallest double bed Even my wife s feet hung over the end of the bed and she s 5 3 It s also looking a little shabby round the edges and lacks the spark you expect in a four star hotel , Good location for my trip 
195896,The Premier Notting Hill, I was put in a room with no window underground could not sleep all night We had paid for a club room this was not a club room Unsatisfied with the response from duty manager Don t think I would use the Shaftsbury group again should have been refunded at least half of the money back ,No Positive
195897,The Premier Notting Hill, Smallest room I have ever stayed in To be fair the room was well equipped and very clean but it was the size of a walk in closet in the USA Since I spent little time there it was no problem though, Very helpful and friendly staff worked hard to make sure I was taken care of good advice on getting around London 
195898,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Excellent service and price Alexandra at the front desk was very welcoming I had previously spent the night in another hotel at double the price but at much less quality My economy room was small but perfectly laid out and comfortable 
195899,The Premier Notting Hill, I was dissappointed with the size of the room shower and the bathroom The pictures shown on booking com are deceiving I wouldn t call it value for money , The location was very good close to public transport underground etc Bayswater was a lovely area 
195900,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was so tiny it was hard for two people to be comfortable There was no way to move around the bed so one had to crawl over the other to get in or out , Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful 
195901,The Premier Notting Hill, The duvet could have been a little bigger as it did not overhang both sides of the bed and really only sat on top of the mattress , The people were all so nice and friendly 
195902,The Premier Notting Hill, Staff were extremely rude when we had a problem that needed sorting There was no manager on duty to help resolve the issue and we ended up having to stay at the hotel in a room that was unfit for us to Receptionist couldn t do a thing or so she said and didn t even try to help us , Location of hotel was good and cleanliness was good 
195903,The Premier Notting Hill, Nothing comes to mind, Staff were very friendly helpful especially Zara Location was ideal a short walk to the high street and tube Only 5 minutes from Oxford street by tube Room was comfortable good heating quiet comfy beds free wifi and a microwave in the room Good value for money 
195904,The Premier Notting Hill, We weren t able to set the heating in the room but I m not sure if it was just because we didn t know how to do or what , The staff is very friendly and make their best to make your stay as comfy as possible 
195905,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Really good and stylish hotel located very central Bayswater underground is only 5 minutes away so very good transport links Breakfast is really good and fresh and the service in general is fantastic especially Alexandra at the reception who upgraded us for free and offered us a bottle of wine and fruits basket as it was my birthday Highly recommended and we will be back very soon 
195906,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, It was a breeze from Moment I arrived Nothing was a problem My little boy stayed with me one night and Niyati and all the girls at Reception were so accommodating to him The guys upgraded me for remainder of my stay to a club room which I especially liked Wifi in rooms Brilliant location 
195907,The Premier Notting Hill, The electricity in my room didnt come on till i banged the card holder a few times I stayed there for 3 days they didn t fix it though they knew Housekeeping was poor My half drunk coffee was left in the room for 2 days Water bottles not replenished They have a club room which i booked but no club facilities In any other city in the world a hotel and room like this would have cost half , Friendly staff Decent breakfast 
195908,The Premier Notting Hill, Could go on for a long time not helpful, I had to be moved Hotels as The boiler had gone so I was moved to Shaftesbury Paddington hotel which was not as nice and could even have a shower as it was broke all night and day Staff were not sure what I was talking about when talking to them and they only fixed the shower when I was leaving Spoilt my daughters birthday
195909,The Premier Notting Hill, I didn t like the views of either of the two rooms , The fact they had to change us from the original hotel that we booked to another one and told us that the breakfast will be free of charge but we had already paid for it so they put us in a Club Room that was a lot better than the first room assigned to us 
195910,The Premier Notting Hill, The mattress seemed to sink into the middle of the bed There had been some work done to the water systems which meant running the taps shower to get the discoloured water through , The staff were very friendly and clearly driven by customer service The feeling and architecture of the building room was very pleasant 
195911,The Premier Notting Hill, Bedroom and dining area did feel a little cramped I m above average at 6 1 but my feet stuck out the end of my bed , Staff and service were friendly and flexible The hotel is nicely decorated with everything you require 
195912,The Premier Notting Hill, Porter was pleasant and helpful but the receptionist had an attitude and she was quite rude when I complained about the heating not working and wanting to change rooms Furniture in room was dusty table inside wardrobe etc Shower looks like that of a 3 star establishment I ve stayed in much better quality 4 star hotels , Good location
195913,The Premier Notting Hill, Do not accept a room in the basement Far below any standard Had a single room 4 squere meters window facing a very loud industry airconditioner working 1 meter from my head slept 3 hours that night my most horrible hotel experience ever On the other hand receptionist was very helpful next day I got a room on the 3rd floor that one was perfect , Personnel extremely helpful and nice Alexandra peers Location is good 
195914,The Premier Notting Hill, The only negative I can say about my stay at this hotel was I had a ground floor room which basically had no exterior view it looked onto a generator of some kind Also the room was on the small side so if you like a bigger room this hotel might not be best for you To be fair I only wanted the room to put my head after a work night out in London so I didn t mind at all Plus I d rather have a small 4 quality room than a massive lower quality room The only qualm I do have is the temperature of the room I couldn t quite work out how to use the air con so I was a tad chilly in the night but felt warm by the morning , I liked this hotel because it felt like all the quality of a chain hotel but with an exclusive feel The staff at the front desk were very cheery and the cleanliness of the room was perfect The double bed was also a good size along with the TV The location is also in a nice quiet square in a nice area of London not too far to commute to the city centre where my work do was 
195915,The Premier Notting Hill, This hotel took a sum of 81 60 from my bank account the night before I was due to stay with them I phoned the morning of my flight to query same and was told there was a hold put on this amount and once I paid on check in this money would be released I was then advised that there were maintenance issues with our room and so we would have to move to the London Premier Kensington Hotel Upon checking in I went to pay the bill in total with a different card only to be told I couldn t A manager eventually came to our assistance and took the total amount from the second card and told me they would ring the bank to release the hold on the 81 on the original account It is four days later and I am yet to receive this money back into my account despite having paid the bill in full on the second card The girl on the front desk called us a complimentary taxi and asked him to bring us to the Park Hotel which he duly did We were checked in there by a staff member and sent to a room in a different building across the road from the hotel This building did not have any access to wifi which was one of the reasons that we booked the Notting Hill Hotel This was very inconvenient for my travel partner and I The water in the shower was cold and when I went to bring this to the attention of a staff member at the Park Hotel I was told we had been checked into the wrong hotel but why was this not communicated to me when I was being checked in there This whole hotel group appears to be in chaos and I would most certainly not recommend any of the hotels which I had dealings with nor would I stay here again Have a look at the Terrible ratings on TripAdvisor and you will see that I am not the first one to have had this experience , I have nothing good to say about this property Take heed 
195916,The Premier Notting Hill, I arrived in the afternoon and the reception area was full of people Reception was a bit overwhelmed and told me it would take a while until it would be my turn to checkin so I stayed a little bit but then offered to leave my things there with them and go to the city to tour and have dinner and come back a while later which they seemed very happy about Coming back around 11pm I was told they gave my room away to someone else so I had to be brought by taxi to another hotel where the staff was friendlier and could give me a room The man dealing with me at night was unbelievably unfriendly und unhelpful and didn t listen to a word I was saying 60 of my nights per month are in hotels around the world but in 9 years this is the first time this has happened to me I was very unhappy about it ,No Positive
195917,The Premier Notting Hill, Do not book this hotel When I arrived at the hotel they told me there were no rooms left and that I would have to stay at another hotel they had arranged I was then told the other hotel was in Euston I explained that we needed to be in Notting Hill as we had planned to meet friends there for the evening and that was the reason for our stay They said if I did not accept the other hotel I was not entitled to a refund After much fuss was made amazingly they manage to find us a room in our original hotel The only problem was that they had not cleaned it and the previous guests dirty socks were laid out next to the bed Still we were refused a refund so we could go to another hotel We did not even sleep in the bed because we thought looking at the sheets they had not been changed although we could not prove this The next morning after 2 hours of arguing our case I got a 25 refund only The booking com representative who called the hotel manager on our behalf said she had never dealt with such poor customer service and was shocked that the manager had no interest in customer satisfaction whatsoever Whist in reception they were redirecting other guests to another hotel so there is no point reading the reviews for this one Once you ve paid your money you re at their mercy I never write reviews on trip advisor etc but this time I feel compelled to make sure no one else books this hotel without knowing what sort of stay could await them Another point breakfast is ridiculously over priced and cold there is nowhere near enough seats for guests as its a tiny basement room , Location 
195918,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, the hotel and staff were great how ever I spend a lot of time in London and everytime I stay in the area but I wouldn t stay here again due to a problem with the noise in our room and it was not dealt with correctly by management lady who kind of said we were lying so know I will be submitting my video to solicitor to get our full refund back
195919,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are not as seen on the website I had to change my room middle of the night The receptionist was very helpful The second room wasn t any better , Staff were friendly
195920,The Premier Notting Hill, I ve never been given such a tiny room you couldn t walk between the bed and the wall without turning sideways There was no space to even put a suitcase flat on the floor The hotel was noisy you could hear machine noises and all the sounds of people coming and going some of the fittings were dirty mould and all of it was in need of serious upgrade This should not be 4 and should not have a high rating on Booking com it is very hard not to be sceptical of the 8 reviews of this hotel , Very pleasant staff That s about it 
195921,The Premier Notting Hill, Bed not very comfy and room very small BUT price was excellent so in comparison to what you usually get for this price in London it was still very good , Lovely area to stay and spend time in Some amazing restaurants literally 30 seconds walk away Hotel was great value for money and very clean 
195922,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was quite small and outdated and had a view of a brick wall , Staff were amazing and so helpful Good choice of options for breakfast and food was hot and tasty The room had great facilities like a fridge tea and bascuits and big tv and also free parking is a bonus 
195923,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was outdated bed was uncomfortable the bathroom would ve been nice and comfortable if it didn t have flies in it Have to ask to get room heated during winter , Location multiple subway lines within walking distance
195924,The Premier Notting Hill, Reception manager was rude to receptionist in front of my daughter and I Wasn t expecting to have a room without a window Felt claustrophobic , Location
195925,The Premier Notting Hill, We were given an extremely small room first of all so I requested a bigger one This was done However the mattress over hung the base of the double bed by at least 10cm, Breakfast was good
195926,The Premier Notting Hill, No dislikes, The staff were all very friendly and helpful and were really lovely with my 4 year old son Alexandra especially stood out as always being on hand and brightening up your day with a smile The room was also very nice and comfortable and breakfast was very yummy
195927,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms are really small and cramped Club rooms are small so no extra space for the extra money you spend There is no club lounge so you pay extra to have soft drinks whilst sat in the reception The Windows don t open There is a sign that a us of you try to open them they will not return to being in a closed position You do not get the room you request The air conditioning only blows out cold air the heating element doesn t work so your room gets freezing cold You are asked to pay a pre authorisation amount to which on arrival you are told you will receive it straight back this is rubbish They have reserved two separate amounts of my money one of which they didn t inform me of to which haven t been refunded back to me causing my bank to be overdrawn Not onlyhos but they have charged me again for my stay so theoretically I have paid twice Now I am complaining they are trying to say that it takes 3 5 working days to get my money released back to me even though they said it would be straight away Absolutely terrible experience and can guarantee I will never stay in this hotel or its sister hotels if I return to London , Nothing
195928,The Premier Notting Hill, Generator hum over night kept waking us up Staff where friendly But I wasn t happy at the desk when I first arrived Lady that served me didn t concentrate on serving me and lacked eye contact , We liked the location and the property Price good Very clean 
195929,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Absolutely great and the receptionist alexandra A lovely person aslo come whit some tips abouth some good restaurants and info abouth the area I aill definitely be back again Thanks Mihai
195930,The Premier Notting Hill, Quieter room fresh water bottles not replaced when room cleaned Cold running water from bathroom was warm for at least 5 minutes I believe staff were using toilet which was unfortunately next to our room , We liked the location pubs and restaurants close 
195931,The Premier Notting Hill, Breakfast in the morning was a bit unorganised not enough cutlery or glasses not enough food or tables available quite disappointing , Staff service was ok
195932,The Premier Notting Hill, Room was tiny I m 6ft 5in and the small double bed was the width of the room and my feet touched the wall at one side while my head was on the pillow at the other side There wasn t enough room to lie down on the floor next to the bed The furniture was old and worn drawer on table wouldn t close The shower room was also very very small and the shower tiles grouting were mouldy in places needing replaced Duvet could have done with being a King size as the double wasn t enough for the two of us to remain covered all night , Reasonable location for Circle District Line and Whiteleys Mall Cinema near by 
195933,The Premier Notting Hill, The lighting in the room wasnt great so it was dark in certain parts and hard to see Outside my window was what I assume was an air conditioning box or fan of some kind which was constantly on and made the loudest noise this kept me up all night, The staff were extremely helpful and lovely The room itself was clean and had everything I needed Would stay here again
195934,The Premier Notting Hill, I didn t like the double room it was too small for me being 6 foot 3 and 120 kilos I couldn t fit into the shower it was too small but they upgraded me to a bigger and better room for the second day thank you, I like the location I liked the hotel it s staff was good and helpful I got upgraded to a club room for the second day which was a lot better than the double room I will stay again but in the club room thank you Good overall stay in hotel
195935,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Clean close to metro safe area Staff very friendly and made sure we felt taken care of They moved us to a new room based on our request Would recommend to anyone looking for a great hotel for great value 
195936,The Premier Notting Hill, The bed and pillows were uncomfortable resulting in a poor night s sleep Hairs were found in the bed and the shower upon arrival Older children s room was in the basement which was very noisy due to the breakfast room being nearby and lift next door , Staff were very welcoming Rooms were attractive Management were quick to apologise for the problems we had and will speak to the staff regarding the problems 
195937,The Premier Notting Hill, Had a club room upgraded but the room wasnt big enough with a small double bed just a basic bathroom with a shower over the bath , It was very quiet 10 mins from Notting Hill tube station
195938,The Premier Notting Hill, Restaurant food wasn t available , Staff were very helpful and accommodating great quiet location restaurants near by and definitely will be returning 
195939,The Premier Notting Hill, Over a family emergency we had to check out after our 1st night we were staying for 2 nights however we were not giving any refund for missing 2nd night In any other situation I d let it slip but you would imagine over a family emergency to leave so soon they would have some sympathy, Location to tube
195940,The Premier Notting Hill, The size of the rooms is really small Reception staff need to smile more and be more polite, The groom evening shift we met upon arrival was extremely helpful and assisted on the room inconvenience Very professional and helpful 
195941,The Premier Notting Hill, All the things were good from the start to the end but I didnt like that the hotel took a deposit at the 19th without writing in the description in the website that they take the only thing written there that when you dont show up for the first night whitch was 21st not 19th the amount of the night will be withdrowl I didnt like it becouse the amount was in my account was neededd and it took a week to get back and I was not prepared So the hotel have to write about that in booking com Also the elevator could use some update Its really slow,No Positive
195942,The Premier Notting Hill, We had a club room which was really small so can t imagine how small the standard rooms are Payed 190 for 2 nights and then the price dropped to 150 the week after so wasn t too happy about that, The bed was really comfy with a good amount of pillows cushions The TV was also very large and the hotel room had everything you needed with a nice view over looking the gardens The staff were also friendly 
195943,The Premier Notting Hill, The rooms are very small The bed is not comfortable at all the matrice is too soft and it is a very small bed I would expect from a 4 stars hotel to have at least a bed that is a regular double size bed All in all it is not good value for money as it is quite expensive and the only things that are good about it are the location and the truly helpful staff Other than that i would rate it as a less than 3 stars hotel, very helpful and kind staff location is very good in a nice neighbourhood close to underground stations
195944,The Premier Notting Hill, Bed mattress needs an upgrade possibly the slowest elevator in London no really , Very good location close to cafes bars restaurants etc and transport links quiet neighbourhood
195945,The Premier Notting Hill, Booked a deluxe double but found the room very small and compacted It s a shame that the rooms are so small , Staff very friendly Location Was good Rooms and hotel very clean
195946,The Premier Notting Hill, The room although well appointed was compact Breakfast was good , Location was excellent for travelling into the West End etc with underground stations within a short walk away Room was well appointed for a London Hotel Great on street parking that did not break the bank I know how expensive it is to park in other area of London 
195947,The Premier Notting Hill, Quite a complicated check in felt sorry for the new member of staff as she was being given a hard time by the manager , Staff very friendly room very comfortable location was great and we would come back 
195948,The Premier Notting Hill, The power went 2 hours before we were due to leave There was damp on the walls and there seemed to be a generator or something that kept turning on and off through the night Couldn t get the tv to work either , Nice shower
195949,The Premier Notting Hill, I had to wait 10min when I arrived because both of the receptioninsts were serving another customer I think one receptionist for each guest would be better The last night there was a problem with the water in bathroom It was very hot and had to wait 5 minutes for the water to get colder in order to wash my hands Also the heater needed some time to work everytime I was back in the room , The hotel is in a good neighbourhood Near bayswater station and queensway station serving a good transport to the main tourists attractions I felt safe walking during the night 
195950,The Premier Notting Hill, Size of the room continiuos noise for 24 hours treatment of the general manager when you complain, Kindness of most of staff and cleanness of the hotel
195951,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was in the basement with no window and a surface under 4sq meters there was a permanent noise coming from the air conditioning that never stopped The staff was barely speaking English and incapable of solving the issue, Except a great location nothing 
195952,The Premier Notting Hill, The room we stayed in 008 was very noisy and impossible to sleep in for two reasons Window was facing on engins plumbings anyway some kind of huge and embarrassingly rumourous tubes the room is very dark no natural light and from that window you can t see anything at all only those tubes Moreover next to our room there was a shared toilet which was in constant use and walls are extremely thin and let you hear absolutely everything In the morning the cleaners were also very noisy and not paying any attention to make their job quieter for people who are still trying to sleep Another big problem not secondary was that the room was HOT This is shocking for me as I am always cold I have never found myself saying a place was hot in my whole life For the reason I stated above was not possible to open the window and the nights were a real nightmare We didn t try the breakfast so we can t help you with it , Staff is polite and smiley location in good being only few minutes walking from tube stations such as Notting Hill Gate Bayswater and Queensway Hyde Park is also very close About the room the only positive thing was a comfortable and good size shower 
195953,The Premier Notting Hill, we have been very disappointed as we faced a situation that we considered very cheap we have been informed at our arrival that we will be upgraded to a better room than the one we had during our previous visit the next day we complained on the fact that we have been downgraded as the room was for disabled and not practical at all for us also we had no microwave nor fridge like in the room we had previously to apologize the receptionist offered us a breakfast as a complementary for the next day we really appreciated the effort even if we do not eat in the morning we accepted as she was nice to offer the next day 08th November we informed the lady she looked like the supervisor or the head at reception about the offer we had to compensate us then we went for the breakfast the breakfast was already very simple and poor but the chock was that in the restaurant the waitress informed us that she has been requested to allow us only cold food and not hot food I liked the hotel but for this cheap reaction I will never go back this lady has given a very poor and bad image to this hotel PS we don t even eat hot food and usually only take a coffee and croissant so very cheap from a senior in the hotel ,No Positive
195954,The Premier Notting Hill, Rooms extremely tight barely sufficient room to place baggage Room114 originally allocated not suitable for two people also internal room adjoining noisy service duct Overall not 4 star rating poor value for price , Very good location rooms very clean 
195955,The Premier Notting Hill, Clump of hair behind my pillow on the headboard , We stayed in the Club room which was very spacious would not have liked to see how small a normal room was though Staff were very welcoming took our luggage for us and were very helpful in keeping our luggage after we had checked out also offered tourist advice on the area Complimentary wine fruit and drinks were also a delight Housekeeping good 
195956,The Premier Notting Hill, Did not like the fact that most of the staff does not speak very good english The first night we were given a tiny little room on the ground floor looking nowhere I found this unacceptable as this booking was made at least 2 months ago hence there should be no problem of availability for us , I liked the location very convenient central Nice decoration cosy 
195957,The Premier Notting Hill, Late night traffic, Modern hotel in a nice Victorian London Square near Hyde Park Staff were friendly and we got upgraded to a Club room for no extra cost good value 
195958,The Premier Notting Hill, We were told on arrival that we would have to go to another hotel as the boiler had broken down We were not amused as we had 2 small children with us We should have been contacted by reservations We made a fuss and were given a room which was ok When we came back in the evening there was a noise which when we asked staff to have a look at told us it was ventilation We would not have been able to sleep so they moved us to the hotel that we were asked to go to in the daytime , Nothing really positive to say
195959,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was small dark and smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke The shower was dirty and the fridge didn t work We asked for another room but the only alternative was not much better and faced backwards Would not recommend staying here , Location was good
195960,The Premier Notting Hill, We got a Club Level room which had a full bed in it While there was a built in closet desk area etc there was just no space to store luggage you couldn t walk around the parameter of the bed so both our suitcases were on the only opening of the floor Hard to navigate with two tall people Also unsure why there was no conditioner Our Paris hotel was the same don t know if it is a European Hotel thing so if you are used to using conditioner bring some with you , Location was amazing Noting Hill Portobello Street is a MUST This staff was helpful and very accommodating Our room was ready by check in time but others were not but they made sure everyone was comfortable at check in
195961,The Premier Notting Hill, On arrival staff asked how I booked the room and seemed disappointed by me using booking com Suggested that I use their site instead and rather insisted on that to an annoying extent Also I felt uncomfortable as I had to give 10 pounds in advance so in case I did any phone calls using the room line the cost would be covered by that amount I really don t understand why I had to do that since I wasn t planning to do any extra costs and if so I could easily pay for that on departure On the top of that the room was ridiculously small so the photos of it are definitely misleading Not to mention that it was on the first floor with a view of the inner walls although I chose a room in the upper floors when I booked There are also other funny stuff going on like for example the toilet seat wasn t even customised on the toilet I would definitely not go back or recommend anyone staying there , Rather fair location
195962,The Premier Notting Hill, I had a club room with my grown doughter We got a double bed that was less than a queen size 120 cm there were no mattress on top off the spring mattress so we woke up several times during the night because we were so uncomfortable The pillows were some strange material One high pillow that made you almost sit up And one worne out flat pillow No down We got a new room the day after with twin beds Same bad mattress The rooms was so small we cod only have one suitcase opens And this was a club room I wonder what the other room is like It took so much energy from us not being able to sleep at night that we lost a lot of time in London The managers both that we saw women were very rude to the staff This is something guest notice The breakfast was not good Instead of real eggs in the scrambled eggs it was made of powder Very small space I am so disappointed spending hundreds of pounds at this hotel Catarina, Situated close to communication and Hyde Park 
195963,The Premier Notting Hill, In the first day I was in one room which window had view to Plumbing The room was very Stuffy and There was incredible noise I couldn t sleep They know that this room is not possible to sleep but they use ,No Positive

195965,The Premier Notting Hill, Room on my first night was not what I paid for too small Had to request a change to a bigger room No bar fridge Room had view of back of another building, Location Staff friendly and helpful Facilities clean
195966,The Premier Notting Hill, A too narrow bed to be in a double room It was only 120 cm Smell of mold in the reception area however not in the room Something wrong with the electricity had to bang the wall next to the card Switch to get it working and all ceiling spotlights died the last evening ,No Positive
195967,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was described as a delux double and it was a box room The bed touched the wall on 3 sides and the shower was so small we couldn t get in it I caught a chill because my back was against the window all night, They allowed us to drop off our bags early
195968,The Premier Notting Hill, The other room was very small and dim The hotel was a bit far from the station , The staff were very helpful and one of the room given to us was relatively spacious and got sunlight 
195969,The Premier Notting Hill, The room was too small one channel to watch tv I pay a lot of money for small box room I was feeling depressed to be in the room, hotel was very clean personal was very humble 
195970,The Premier Notting Hill, The Deluxe Single Room that I had was on the basement floor therefore had no view out of the window was extremely cramped and quite hot and noisy , Close to Bayswater Underground Station therefore convenient to get to London Sightseeing Sites Friendly staff 
195971,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Staff were friendly and the place was clean and tidy and nicely fitted out for the price When we complained about uncomfortable beds the staff handled it perfectly and were very polite and moved us to a new room the same day 
195972,The Premier Notting Hill, Expensive the curtains would not cover the opening with the room at pavement level I found an old sock behind the curtain The TV wires were hanging down from the wall mounted TV which I had to re connect due to the TV not working Burnt iron provided , Location
195973,The Premier Notting Hill, Not really, Staff made all efforts to let us enjoy It looks simple hotel but the room was equipped with all what is needed to make our short stay a paradise after the long walks in London busy streets 
195974,The Premier Notting Hill, Single rooms are extremely small even claustrofobic small I felt like a trunip under the ground 1st night I was given a room with no exterior light and a window with view to a 4 square meter interior hall with 3 huge vertical pipelines The room had no space to put the suitcase other than in front of the cloths cabinet doors preventing the occupant access to the clothes After complaining to the reception staff I was given another room for the 2nd and 3rd nights The 2nd room had outside light was slightly bigger but still a room not fit for a 4 hotel Breakfast was lousy , Reception staff was very nice and helpful Room and bathroom were clean Price very reasonable for London
195975,The Premier Notting Hill, I wouldnt say it was worth the 300ish that it was supposed to cost we got it at a discount rate I feel like there are bigger rooms available in london for a similar price , We Paid around 165 for 2 nights here The staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful the location was great very close to a few tube stops the bathroom was a good size and the bed was comfy Yes the room was small we chose the basic room rm410 it did require a little organisation of luggage and manoeuvring but we expected this after reading other reviews and didn t really find it to be a problem We only needed it as a base and somewhere to sleep as we were out most of the day So I would 100 recommend this hotel to those with a similar situation If you are going to be spending more time in the room however it might be worth spending a bit extra and finding a bigger hotel We will definitely use this hotel again when in London 
195976,The Premier Notting Hill, Really hot noisy Previous occupants belongings left in the room when we checked in , Friendly helpful staff Really small room very hot would not stay again 
195977,The Premier Notting Hill, Bed is small and not clean photo in booking are very different from actual room in total room was very small even you can t move with free space and you need to toich every thing in your way to bath or door Quality of food was fair with the price i give I didnt like that they was laying about room also the left was not working for 2 days and i was staying in 3rd flower,No Positive
195978,The Premier Notting Hill, breakfast was cold not worth 12 50 each room small and that was upgraded to club small shower too warm in room, very quite no noise fridge was good
195979,The Premier Notting Hill, There was only 1 thing that i was not completely satisfied with that was the 1 bed in our room It felt as if it was broken underneath because we were rolling into the middle into a dip , The staff were very polite helpful the breakfast fast very enjoyable the room itself was decorated tastefully resonably comfortable 
195980,The Premier Notting Hill, The pre authorisation of payment card for another nights stay even though you ve paid the bill in advance Rooms a tad on the small size would compare it to nyc room sizes , Friendly staff well furnished rooms 
195981,The Premier Notting Hill,No Negative, Lady who checked me in was great donk know her name coz she was trainee and chan checked me in before the time and it was great impression and Leslie evening receptionist was helpful and Alex night porter or waiter was such a helpful and benna on checking out she was lovely Thanks again for making my stay so comfortable and special
195982,The Premier Notting Hill, Dirty room not cleaned properly dirty cups glasses left bottled water not replenished beds poorly made bathroom dirty, Location resonable price
195983,The Premier Notting Hill, We were in room 114 which is nothing like it shows in the display picture Whilst I understand these things are bound to be varied the bedding decorations were nothing alike The room was small which was fine for the two of us but the window was tucked right round a corner which was opposite a wall so there was no natural light in the room whatsoever The window that they did have back out into a tiny space full of water pipes and wires with an engine of somesort that gave off an annoying buzzing noise The bathroom door was partically see through so you can see your partner sat on the toilet which we didn t really care around but it s just a bit odd On arrival the Manager was incredibly rude when I mentioned it would of been cheaper to book on the day rather than in advance She went on to say Well obviously here in London which is one of the most popular and beautiful cities in the world the prices can differ everyday We re from the Midlands not the other side of the world We know how these things and work in the industry so didn t appreciate being patronised Also it s great to have workers that speak different languages but when they can t even understand English speaking customers it isn t not brilliant , The bed and pillows were so comfy and modern bathroom The shower was powerful and gave the option of either waterfall or regular 
195984,The Premier Notting Hill, Room 807 so noisy due to central air conditioning unit placed next to the window Room 309 and 409 were single rooms but trikly sold as double The beds were small short narrow and old totally uncomfortable You could not walk around the bed and to go to the toilet we had to jump one over the other literally On the 3rd day and after the 3rd room change we were told that if we wanted a larger room they could not grant a quiete room unless we paid for an upgrade about 25 30 pounds per day My husband was disgusted and totally disappointed The following day we were proposed by the kindest of the staff members to be upgraded for free but we did not trust the managers and were afraid they would trick us again so we did not move again , Three people in the staff Leslie George and Brenna whom I thank for their human touch and professional behaviour of a very high standard 
195985,The Premier Notting Hill, For older person the room might be a bit to small but for me it was ok for older people they should ask for a room at ground floor , the staff was very friendly I could keep my luggage in the hotel after check out and this was for free WLAN was fast the location was good nice area some pubs and shops around Underground the Bayswater was 10 minutes away I could also check in early before 14 00
195986,The Premier Notting Hill, As so often in London one books a cheap room still pays a lot of money and gets a tiny room without window in the cellar On the good side the room was larger compared to what I have seen in other cases and was clean and quiet nice except for the window missing , The hotel is close to the railway station Paddington 15 min walking and to Kensngton gardens It is in a quiet region My room was in the cellar yet was still very nice The staf was very helpfull with adapters for electricity 
195987,The Premier Notting Hill, The receptionist was a trainee at check in She took some time but friendly and approachable My complaint is not about her It s about her manager She made me feel uncomfortable at how she spoke to the trainee Was very unwelcoming and made me feel embarrassed She behaved the same with all her staff Staff all seemed on edge Lift was out of order throughout our stay Our club room was very very small It was also on the basement floor It was noisy as picked up all outdoor sounds and shuffling of caretakers around the property Breakfast was again in the basement Very dark and small The gym was locked so couldn t access it Was also in what looked like a bed room on the 2nd floor which cannot have been that big , Upgraded to the club room Very comfy bed Just expected room to be bigger and bed to be My dad is 6 1 and he was too long for it There was a Helpful concierge Real good location close to Hyde park Ken gardens and the choice of restaurants was great nearby
