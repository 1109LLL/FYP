244063,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was too small No fridge in room Little space in closet provided , Friendly staff Some things I forgot in room were found and posted to me in Germany Mostly efficient helpful and polite 
244064,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We arrive around 4 pm the room not ready and they gave us room not in condition and not the same what we book Next day they shift us to other room but also the Ac not working and they brought to us split AC unit with wire aroun the room not safe Other room bad AC water coming from the roof no one care Cleaning room just when you ask And no one follows the signs to clean the room, Nothing
244065,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Its generally a good hotel but I think could be better I just have some feedback and suggestions would be nice to have water bottles provided with tea and coffee facilities cleaning staff do not always replace tea bags and toiletories some international TV satellite channels would be nice and specifically for kids like cartoon network hotel blocked 1 night pay 2 days before arrival and I have free cancellation up to 24 hours before arrival and payment details were pay on arrival I did not like that , great location staff helpful and friendly handy phone with free calls and internet was great AC in room 
244066,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Receptionist during check in out a little hard work in communication , The room bathroom breakfast overall experience Was a little worried booking this place but mention could we have a shower room and it was our anniversary to them via email when back from theatre opened the door to find bed all made up prosecco in ice bucket chocolates a wonderful surprise 108 a night next to hyde park great value and will use again 
244067,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room the size of a shoebox Literally felt like i was sleeping in my suitcase As a result of this and noisy neighbours zero sleep over three nights , Location breakfast cleanliness courteous staff
244068,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, upon arrival we were given an option of a basement room or a tiny room on the 2nd floor as the receptionist had no availability felt like because we booked through booking com they didn t care the bed was tiny not a double bed in between a single and double my boyfriend is 6ft 4 and of a stocky build so we struggled to sleep ,No Positive
244069,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Building a bit too rambly At the same time this is part of the appeal of the place, Ongoing attention to breakfast buffet by staff They were available to see that guest expectations were met Service and efficiency of all stsff excellent Proximity to Kensington Gardens
244070,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were savvy we encountered some issues with the terminal they were using to charge my card and had to endure some delays While it was a tad frustrating I was pleased to be informed that they had upgraded me following the issue with the terminal Access to Paddington station was exceptionally easy a short walk away on flat ground which was great as well 
244071,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Conveniently located near Paddington Station with easy access to Heathrow Express and Underground Near Oxford Street shopping and easily accessible to Hyde Park 
244072,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Size of rooms probably because it is in central london, The manger was very much helping and he took good care of us The bathrooms need small repairs there was water getting clogged and was not repaired for is inspite complaining But that was due to weather issues Ther overall services are good enough 
244073,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rooms are quite small and with a baby cot it becomes hard to move around compare the room bathroom is big I would rather room to be bigger and a small shower The staff didnt seem to know much about whats going on One night in middle of night the fire alarm went on our baby woke up and she was very scared and crying They made no explanation until I called up and asked and they just said sorry something has gone wrong in the kitchen it was a false alarm Around the hotel is very loud There is a pub opposite the hotel and the noise comes from Street is quite loud It can wake you up and I am usually not bothered about noise When we entered into room there was a portable air condition working on apart from the one installed on the Wall The pipe was going through the window and you need to take the pipe in to be able to close the window We asked this to be removed and asked why they put this into the room They said in hot weathers when everyone is using the air condition air condition is not working well But that makes no sense as the portable one was working only when the window was open Also as the room is already small that was taking a space There were no fridge in the room This are the ones it comes into my mind however It was clean and safe enough to stay with a child I would not stay again though , It was clean and safe enough to stay with a child I would not stay again though 
244074,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Small bathroom toilet corner is so small that you have to sit to the side Dont use shower gel and shampoo that is in the bathroom its weird oily and I could not clean myself with water properly Or the water is bad , All was ok except the small bathroom
244075,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, My room was a basement internal room with no external window The one window looked out on another room so the curtain had to remain draw and there was very poor air circulation ,No Positive
244076,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, No window in the room I guess it is possible to get a window if you specify in advance Room was very very small so I can imagine it would be an issue for longer stays or if you have too much luggage The hotel is 4 stars but it felt far from that no clue how this rating applies to hotels in London , Staff was very friendly and helpful The bathroom shower was clean and comfortable to use had a normal tap which is good as UK tends to have weird shower facilities I had a nice and relaxing sleep overall that is what I was there for Location is comfortable not too far from Paddington station access to the airport and Hyde park I took a short walk there WiFi connection was reliable
244077,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, It s really hard to think of something I didn t like My only problem was with the AC It didn t have a sleep mode so it was a bit noisy at night But all in all I was lucky the room was air conditioned , I always book hotels around Paddington because it s easily reachable from the airport and you have plenty of options when it comes to the Tube Hyde park is a walking distance alway so is Marble Arch and Oxford Street Hotel staff was very polite and helpful We stayed in a twin room deluxe it was spacious with a fridge a microwave and coffee tea making facilities Bathroom was large as well There was an AC in the room which came in handy as it was one of the hottest weeks in London Room was very clean and towels were changed daily The cleaning lady always made sure we had plenty of coffee and toiletries 
244078,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Unfortunately after returning to room at 11 30 and going to bed the power supply to the room went off whilst reading Rang reception who said said they knew about it and would be fixed by 8 a m Although offered to move rooms after midnight it was not practical However it was a hot night and then realised the air conditional wouldn t work without power Hence very little sleep Having no light was difficult for the bathroom When checking out expected a partial refund but only a half hearted apology was given Will not use again , Location
244079,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room we had was so small more like a room for one person This was the one thing that let it down you couldn t even fully open the bathroom door as the bed was in the way Very poor , There was a good deal on the breakfast so we took it Glad we did as it was very good value well cooked and very helpful staff 
244080,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We arrived at 2pm but couldn t use our room until 4 30 but we didn t mind as we had a drink in pub and had a walk around room compact but stylish and spotless, Hotel in ideal location just a few minutes walk from Paddington station and Hyde Park where we went to see a concert pub opposite was nice and plenty of places to eat staff very polite and friendly would stay there again
244081,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, For a deluxe room it was tiny as was the bed It was also on the ground floor and we had requested an upper floor on the booking details On arrival they attempted to charge for the room And the room was only ready exactly at 2pm, There was a microwave in the room The free smart phone available for the duration of the stay was fantastic 
244082,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was small and claustrophobic Couldn t use the wardrobe space as the door wouldn t open wide enough against the side tables the bathroom whilst decorated lovely was small and shower most definetly not suitable for anyone large Our window looked out on to other neighbouring properties and they were close , Whilst booking com messed up our reservation despite having everything on my phone confirming it the staff were fantastic in getting it all sorted and ringing around The location of property was ideal and lovely pub across the road Room was modern and clean towels changed daily Air con in room 
244083,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I thought 4 stars was very generous I couldn t move in my room It was in a basement I heard everything through the walls The linens on the bed were awful I was extremely uncomfortable Very over priced for what I got I felt I was in a hostel , Location
244084,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, the room was small so any more than 2 nights stay and i would have got a bigger room, the location was great for what i needed just a short walk to paddington and also to hyde park
244085,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Bed was small An very crammed room , The bed was a small double with dirty hand print on head board with smeared streaky cupboards very crammed room An was not big enough for longer then a 1 night stay or large person 
244086,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Was told we had been upgraded to a bigger room but the room received was very compact Still adequate for what we needed but would have liked a bit more space especially in the bathroom ,No Positive
244087,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We got moved to another hotel and one we book had maintenance issues We then got given a tiny room and not a deluxe room as we had ordered and paid for Room view was off a wall covered in bird poo Reception staff were moody ,No Positive
244088,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Hi rooms are too small even a double deluxe room is not too spacious Need to work on the room setting so that one can atleast move in the room , Hi the hotel is clean and the location is too good if you are a tourist in london and wants to visit prominent places 
244089,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, There wasn t enough room to open the bathroom door and it banged against the bedside cupboard all the time there were many marks and dents on the door and this made the glass top slide towards the bed We booked two double rooms but there was one extra bed in one room and two extra beds in the other so not really what we booked If you wanted a family room then they would be good value but were of no value to us They were supposed to be upgrades but didn t have that feel One room was in the basement with frosted windows and the corridor smelt musty like there may have been a flood in the past The rooms were a little tired looking , It was adequate and relatively inexpensive The television was big It was clean 
244090,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Well may be bcos the weather it was a bit hot but it is very good in all aspects, The staff are polite and helpful and the hotel is quite and peacefull
244091,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The shower room we had was slightly small and I felt the restriction as I m quite tall The shower screen had watermarks which could easily be removed by a microfibre cloth but I know I m being picky here The air con was leaking so there was a wet patch on the carpet , Very luxurious opulent the bed was extremely comfortable Wasn t expecting a microwave or fridge in the room which was a wonderful surprise The tv was brilliant quality The cleaning staff were excellent with their determination to provide fresh towels and toiletries Attention to detail anything you could want all at this beautiful place Location is brilliant for food transport the whole lot On one side Edgeware Road the very cultural and comfortable Arab town which has endless food and shisha On the other side the normal modern facilitiltes you require on a daily basis Perfect Would be more than happy to go back 
244092,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, THE EARLY MORNING NOISE, Im on holiday and lve been woken at the crack of dawn by the noise of the kitchen When l booked there was no mention of the room being by the kitchen or an inferior room l hold You ie booking com responsible l want a 30 refund 
244093,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The staff were very rude and did not want to take responsibility for a mistake on their part when I wanted to extend a booking The counter staff claimed that I did not inform him them and sign any papers even though they specifically told me to leave everything in his hands when I asked for an extension We had to pay 200 pounds for a small double room in the end because of his mistake Service is so bad that the cost seems too high Another thing is when I informed them my bedsheets had blood stain they said it s because they only change the sheets every alternate day Which means we have been sharing the sheets with the previous guests Unacceptable ,No Positive
244094,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I stayed in two rooms one of which was in the basement But it was almost as expensive as the one on the top floor with a street view The basement room was also much smaller Still it had a window with a view of a very cozy lobby so you don t feel like you re underground , There are a lot of other hotels in that area which makes for a safe and quiet neighborhood but not too quiet which for me was a plus The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful The rooms are nicely decorated the beds are very comfy and there s air conditioning in every room The facilities are in excellent working condition and very modern looking which made me feel like I was staying in a very fancy hotel which in so many ways that really count it was 
244095,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, it would have been nice if we could have even sat on the toilet let alone swing a cat in bathroom very small bedrooms we had mice running around and when we complained and asked for refund we were given our 4o deposit back and the first mornings breakfast free no sign of manager Which we all agreed was diabolical after spending close to 1 000 on this very poor hotel so we shall be in touch with the authorities who handle these situations staff very polite and helpful ,No Positive
244096,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was comfortable but small for the price we were paying , Staff service was excellent we were moved rooms when we were unhappy and the hotel staff were very accommodating 
244097,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Safe box in a room isn t work at first but their crew fixed the problem Room size is too small for couples but ok for me coz I travelled alone Shower space ahhh this the most I hate about this place Felt such a goldfish in a small aquarium Room isn t a soundproof one you could hear everything from outside your room , Location helpful crew Room interior pretty cool for me 
244098,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I can t really say there was anything I disliked but perhaps we could say the cooked breakfast could have been warmer , When we arrived the staff made us very welcome and guided us through the information we needed to know for our short stay We got a Club room at an excellent price and indeed the room was to a very high standard of cleanliness and the room facilities were just as we had hoped 
244099,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The room has a mobile device that you can take along with you while exploring the city with google maps messenger uber and all the necessary apps along with a web browser AMAZING perk when you dont want to pay for roaming or data Also they got a room ready for me at 11 30 am for no extra charge 
244100,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room too hot even with A C Very small room, Nice decoration good value for money big flat TV Booking gave us free visit to 44 LONDON attractions
244101,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room could have been bigger given that it was a club room was more the size of a double in my opinion , Great location just round the corner from Paddington tube Close to Oxford Circus 10 minute walk Staff very nice and lovely room
244102,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Close to Hyde Park tube train station pubs and restaurants Comfortably clean Breakfast was good Staff was friendly WIFI worked in bedrooms Baggage starage BIG plus 
244103,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms were very small not much room to walk around at all and expensive the shower was grubby and there was no milk left on the tea tray , The location was ideal for the area that we needed to be in for interviews 
244104,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I was alone and I found the room and bathroom too small Accommodation in London is way too expensive for what you get , The staff were wonderful It was only a few minutes walk from Paddington Station They also provide a mobile phone called Handy which I could use for the entire stay which was a great help checking train and bus times and seeing where I was on the maps app Handy was very handy You can make free local calls with Handy And international calls to a few countries Not Australia unfortunately 
244105,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, There wasn t enough plugs available in the room and I m not 100 on if this place made it known that most of the rooms are in the basement below ground It seemed to me they all had a view and was something I requested when I arrived but it was not met at all I was on B2 in the dungeon basically not appealing for a hotel at all , The Handy phone provided was a great resource when tackling the city of London
244106,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, First of all the person in the reception wanted me to pay more than I have booked However the reservation information on my paper let me to pay the booked price Afterwards we got the room which was on the 1st floor and in the end of the hotel with several stairs We was with a buggy and it was very difficult to reach our room Nevertheless the room was very tiny and a bad was also very small perhaps only 1 3m , Clean rooms nice interior good location 
244107,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room ceiling was very low and you could hear the sound of people walking in the corridors or rooms above you , The bed was comfy and location was great
244108,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I took 3 attempts to get a room There was no double glazing even though it was on Sussex gardens which is a very busy road used 24 hours a day, Not a 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination
244109,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, didn t like the fact I booked and paid for a deluxe double bedroom and got the smallest room that didn t even have a window The bathroom was so small you could barely shut the door if inside and a shower I could just about squeeze into and I m not a big person ,No Positive
244110,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The people above our room were a little noisy at one point but that is not the hotels fault , The staff were very friendly The room was clean and very comfortable The breakfast was delicious The location was also great as not too far away from central London but away from the hussel and bussel We were able to have our room early and had an upgraded room which was lovely 
244111,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Maybe not that clear that breakfast was not included but I was in a hurry when I booked it the day before traveling In the end it didn t really matter as I had to leave relatively early so would not have had time to enjoy it anyway , Air conditioner well because otherwise it would have unbearable with an inside room
244112,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The room was very small but clean and neat with everything I needed I had been stranded while transiting through Heathrow Airport because of the British Airways computer meltdown so on short noitice I need something close to Paddington station and other points of interest This hotel is on a quiet residential street within walking distance of the station and Hyde Park Because of overflow I was actually shifted to the Park Grand London Paddington so this review applies the that location 
244113,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, this is the most expensive room we have ever booked it was a special treat as my husband has been working in england for 3 months and i live in Fuerteventura so we met up in london and we were very disappointed as the room was so small no room to move once our bags were in the room nothing like the photos extremely loud you can hear everything from the other rooms people coming and going all night long the staff should spend the night in the room to realise how loud it is in there nothing special at all in the rooms not even many toiletries a lot of money wasted as we were so looking forward to these few days together before he went off to his next job ,No Positive
244114,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, the room rates are way too high a total rip off room furniture is old and completely worn out rooms are absolutely tiny even for the low standard of london hotels the worst hotel I have had the misfortune to stay at rooms tend to overheat in summer windows are single glasing and the air con doesn t work , free wifi 
244115,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, It got a bit noisy at night time but that was understandable considering it was next to a main road etc , It was immaculate comfortable and the staff were more than helpful It was definitely good value for the money we paid It was also quite central to most of the attractions 
244116,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, There s a little mouse in the room The corridor is very narrow Lift is old and slow there is only 1 lift The room next to me close the door loudly The noise comes in my room very easy My room is 318 on the 3 rd floor If I don t want to use lift I have to use a very narrow stairs I saw the other customer talk to the manager of the hotel that there is someone go into her room Very creepy but I don t know it s true or not but I think it s possible because the only security is the keycard that can enter to your room , There are 3 sets of utensils in the room everyday 
244117,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We paid for a superior room got a standard So difficult to communicate for any kind of refund The room was cramped below street level and the window opened on to a very noisy generator of some sort which seemingly had important generating business well into the early hours The only reason this didn t get zero rating from us was a very friendly welcome on arrival and the hotel s great location ,No Positive
244118,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, All fine thanks, The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station so very convenient for travel into London from Heathrow direct rail link that takes 15 20 minutes and access to London Underground and buses The local area is nice with plenty of restaurants
244119,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was very small and would have been better suited to a single Ensuite was a bit like a telephone box No chairs , Hot water Comfy bed Good breakfast 
244120,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The creepy flour boards The room was in the basement and we were not told The staff were making so much noise outside our window in the morning We were woken through out the night,No Positive
244121,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, many room windows including mine are facing to the inside of the building with barely no sunlight and no fresh air personnel was friendly but somehow immature didn t feel like a 4 star at all , clean bathroom and room facilities but unfortunately very old great location if you re travelling via heathrow and paddington station it s just a short walk I would come back just because of the location 
244122,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I was on the ground floor , On arrival at this property I was told due to refurbishment I would be staying at one of their other hotels Park Grand It was a nice room but I thought it was quite small I did get a complementary breakfast which was nice 
244123,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room 308 too small for two single beds which were practically one double bed No space for sitting Too cramped Could not fully open one side of the wardrobe as it would hit the bedside table Hardly any space for two suitcases Ironing board and iron stored in wardrobe so not sure where we are supposed to hang clothes It is not accurate nor fair to charge a double room price for it , Location and friendly staff Close to Paddington and Edgeware road stations Close to buses Lots of cafes and eateries nearby Nice reception staff Very helpful 
244124,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, My room was undergoing works when we arrived so had to more to a sister hotel We were put in a tiny room with no windows so asked to more and moved to a slightly bigger room not much but at least it had a window , Awful stay
244125,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, This was the second time I had booked this hotel and for the second time they had overbooked and tried to move me to their sister hotel the other side of Paddington When I complained that I wasn t happy a room was available within minutes Room not turned down on one day of stay Again only when we asked for a top up of milk and coffee did a cleaner knock the door by which point it was too late as we were getting ready for our night out Won t be booking again as concerned they may try and move again ,No Positive
244126,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was a tiny box inside hotel such that view from the very small window was of an internal ventilation shaft As I was on business I only spent 8 hours in the room to sleep but even then I couldn t open my luggage case and walk around Very disappointed considering the price of the room but I m sure I ll be told that this is the standard in London Having said tha the room was spotless and very comfortable , Staff very friendly breakfast was very tasty and location very convenient 
244127,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Lift is available however its difficult to carry our big luggage to our room as the corridor is narrow need to go through steps , Easy access to public transportation eg 7 min walks to Paddington Station Heathrow Express between London Paddington station in 15 mins 7 Mins to Hop On Hop Off Bus eg Big Bus Golden Tours Lots of food outlet nearby especially Halal Food Nice clean Hotel neighbourhood
244128,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, At first we had a small room which was smoking hot couldn t open the window because it looked out on the corridor But wonderful Camelia from the reception had promised us a better room the next day so much better Bath nice temperature outside window aaaah thanks Camelia 
244129,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I think the only thing missing is a self service water facility rather than asking reception all the time, The bedroom was comfy the breakfast I have no complaints about nor the staff as they are always amazing
244130,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We would have preferred a more relaxed schedule for the room to be made up on the Sunday , Family members had strongly recommended this hotel based on their experiences and we were highly satisfied Very friendly courteous staff very pleasing comfortable room with excellent bathroom shower Staff have also been very helpful with some items we inadvertently left there when we checked out Well located close to Paddington Station and numerous bus routes 
244131,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, My only observation is that the rooms are so tiny and the bathroom was super small i can barely take shower in it other than that all is good The staff Alexandra she is so lovely and helpful as the others ,No Positive
244132,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, No shelf at the sink but I did my makeup at the desk instead no deal breaker , Friendly staff room was spotless and comfy although a little airless The situation of the hotel proximity to tube station excellent Quiet Great breakfast Lovely lovely place
244133,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was smaller than expected actually We didn t have enough space to pack our luggages, Cosy room with nice bed and very nice staff who allowed us to check in earlier than the official timing Quite a number of restaurants nearby walking distance to Tesco and about 10 mins walk from Paddington Station 
244134,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The sash windows were dodgy with one of them you could open to 15cm at base all the time then it was nailed in place tp prevent going any higher There was a small balcony outside the window so didn t feel too secure for Central London, Upgraded to a triple room at front of hotel
244135,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was grubby and tiny very different to the pictures Hotel took a security payment of 134 which they never gave back despite me calling and them promising they would Ended up costing almost double the price , The staff were lovely and the breakfast was nice
244136,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Think the breakfast could have been added to the price Other than that everything was perfect , The staff were very friendly and the bed was very comfortable Breakfast lovely 
244137,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms are tiny Work on the hotel meant that me and a friend had to get 2 separate rooms Fire alarm going off during the night for an hour Cleaning staff came into room when the do not disturb sign was hanging while we were out Dirty towels were taken but none were replaced had to ask reception for them we also had no water for our first night stay , Comfy beds
244138,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, 1 more hangers in the wardrobe 2 informed staff that heater seemed not working they did not notify us when it was fixed, 1 Apples coffee biscuits and chocolates were available daily at front desk 2 printer and computer readily available at lobby for use
244139,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room and the en suite shower room were incredibly small even for a London hotel For a single occupant it would have been acceptable but for two people sharing for three nights as we did it meant careful manoeuvring around the room Sitting on the toilet meant swinging your right leg over the pan then parking yourself on the porcelain throne as there was so little space to position yourself in the conventional manner , Bed and pillows were comfortable The shower was hot and powerful 
244140,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room size Some noises some days Old furnitures Little bit more expensive than expected , Hotel location near paddington train station You can arrive walking directly from station Many places for lunch dinner breakfast at nearest streets in reasonable prices London 
244141,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, relation to clients expensive breakfast, location close to metro nice area around good and clean furniture inside room flowers at reception
244142,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, They accepted only credit card no debit card like Maestro all over the world this is not a problem but there they sent us to the ATM Company policy as we learned ,No Positive
244143,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Bathroom was slightly small but didn t bother us too much , Lovely room beds and pillows were very comfy Television was huge It had a fridge played cutlery etc Breakfast was very nice Staff were very helpful and always friendly 
244144,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, A bit cold in the room but as I did t stay much in the room I didn t care maybe it was possible to ask to change room with the working AC for the hot air, Very comfy beds and pillows very clean good wi fi connection
244145,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, I booked into this hotel but when we arrived we were told that they had something gone wrong in some of the rooms so they said they had booked us into their sister hotel just down the road the Shaftesbury premier which was closer to Paddington station they gave us a free taxi to other hotel and also gave us complimentary breakfast as a gesture for the inconvenience The sister hotel was lovely although not as nice looking on the outside the inside was lovely The staff are friendly and the hotel room was lovely had everything you would need and very clean and comfortable I would highly recommend this hotel to stay in 
244146,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Miss Francesca at the welcome desk and Miss Vessa I m sorry if spelled wrong at the breakfast area give the place kind of a home atmosphere and joyous spirit Thank you for that ladies 
244147,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, the curtain could have been a bit wider so that the daylight would have kept out in the morning that is all , the room although small was very comfy and clean and was kept clean very well during our stay we enjoyed our stay the bathroom was very nice and also very clean we appreciated the cleanliness the bed was also of good quality 
244148,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, 1 Room was extremely small and situated on 1 level therefore almost no direct light 2 Electric smell refresher was plugged and it was too much there was not fresh air in the room when we arrived and it took us some time to get normal smell in the room 3 Sound isolation is very bad I woke up in the morning because of people talking not shouting in the next rooms and I could some hoovering on the floor above , Location and staff helpfulness
244149,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, We booked room in this hotel but we were sent to another Shaftesbury hotel called Park Grand London Hyde Park and got breakfast for free Great location super friendly staff good breakfast Service was excellent

244182,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We had a basement room so there wasn t a window to the outside just one to a corridor Prices were high as it was New Year s Eve but overly priced Small room with ensuite with a glass door to the tiny bathroom meant there was no privacy , Closely located to Paddington Efficient check in and could leave bags with reception whilst we went exploring the following day 
244183,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The double deluxe room was very cramped and not much space to move around in We took the elevator to the first floor were our room initially was and had to drag our luggages through the corridors and endless staircases to get to our room Staff could have informed us there was an easier way to our room instead of using the elevators which made it more difficult Bedroom was quite dusty and not vacuumed Housekeeping didn t bother changing the bedsheets so we had to request them to do it , Friendly staff Hotel was close to City

244188,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Small room BUT this is standard for London I am not overweight but it was NOT easy to get in and out of the tiny shower Bed mattress too soft for me Free mobile phone in room but it kept lighting up and I put it under the bedside table Lighting kept dimming Spotlights over bed Breakfast pricey went elsewhere Was in basement room narrow corridors make it difficult with luggage Worst thing is walls are like cardboard you can hear everything Would not stay again at this price Did not think it was 4 star standard Shower needed cleaning around door seal otherwise clean I would personally rather have free breakfast than use of mobile phone TV , Professional staff convenient location if you plan to use the tube circle line Shops cafes etc nearby 
244189,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Although the hotel has a lift room access still required the us of some stairs OK for everyday use but difficult when checking in out with heavy luggage hotel porter service was available, Nice and very clean hotel room had a fridge and microwave which we didn t expect but we did use everyday

244199,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Mind you they keep a deposit for the time you stay with them separate from the payment guarantee they book to your card I didn t see it when I booked and it took me by surprise At checkout I did get it back without major hassle , The location is superb in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood from where you can easily depart in all directions to major landmarks or just stroll around If you take a careful look at the pictures shown and make out which one corresponds to the room you are booking you will not be surprised by what you get Single rooms might be relatively small but they are rather well equipped Mine even had a small radiator which turned out to be very practical and easy to use The one thing I found novel was the smartphone they offered with the room with free calls and data I didn t need it but for international travellers that should be a lifesaver Front desk staff Camelia and Alexandra were the ones I spoke with were kind and always ready to answer my questions If possible I will book at Shaftesbury for my next visit to London 
244200,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was small but that is to be expected in London The photos make it look bigger than it actually is The bed and pillows are also incredibly uncomfortable and we are normally not picky at all , The location is perfect and the room was very clean It is very close to the tube train station as well which is great Our room faced a back street so it was very quiet The staff were also very friendly We didn t have the breakfast but there are so many cafes in the surrounding area so it wasn t necessary

244211,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, No mini bar in the room , One of the most important criteria for me to choose a hotel for business trips is to have access to iron in the room There is iron in every room in the hotel The hotel has a very convenient location near the Hyde Park and the Paddington Station with the Heathrow Express to the airport Very nice comfortable and clean rooms the managers are ready to assist 
244212,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Finding a table at breakfast requires a bit of patience , Short stay I appreciated the mobile phone provided in the Double Club Room and the elevator availability since I had luggage Facilities just as described I enjoyed natural light because of the window view to main street still quiet for a good sleep at night The staff is friendly and prone to help

244241,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, the Hotel managers should inform me prior to my arrival that they don t have a room facing the street as I requested on my booking or just inform me there is no rooms at all its just frustrating to reach your distention after a long travel then you need to move again , on my arrival to the Hotel after an exhausting overseas travel the staff requests me and my daughter to switch the hotel to another hotel as they didn t have a room for us while the booking was already confirmed earlier and the money was transferred from my bank account to the Hotel

244246,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I asked for a room with a bathtub but that was not possible And I asked the Hotel to arrange a taxi 1 night The taxi was 8 more expensive than a normal taxi and when we arrived the did not accept creditcard Wich costed 5 extra Not a really good service and I think the Hotel should have told us they only accepted cash , Nice staff and good location

244249,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Its an average hotel Did not feel like a 4 star hotel at all They forgot to clean the room and had several excusses we complained the next day again and at that point it was professionally solved Rooms are quite small , Breakfast and room facilities were good 
244250,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms could be a bit larger but I guess it s the norm for this price range , Location is great was able to tour most of London by foot Staff was very helpful in upgrading the room as I was first put the basement floor without a chair for the desk needed to do some work on the computer 
244251,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room too cramped especially as we were told it was a Superior Double room Hardly room enough to swing a cat The bed was rather small and the mattress not hard enough , Breakfast was excellent Croissants lovely and flaky Choice of breakfast items was very good Service was also very good Porter service was also good 
244252,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Staff are hard to understand was given a disabled room were the shower was just on the wall which left the water all over the toilet floor without a divider paying over 300 pounds it was not worth the money plus paying 60 pounds for parking, Location was good
244253,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Water when showering was not hot only warm , Very clean room and ensuite Comfortable bed and bedding Modern bathroom All staff were very friendly and helpful 
244254,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Breakfast was a bit expensive Apart from that all was great , I got a great last minute price just over 70 pounds for double room when I arrived I was upgraded to a double Club room which was spacious and had 2 balconies overlooking the front street I also asked for a free late check out genius perk and was able to stay until 1pm Lovely comfy bed very clean and attractive room with built in Microwave fridge ironing board iron good quality hairdryer plenty of plug sockets including one for 2 pin devices Good bathroom although shower controls a bit confusing and nearly burnt myself the water was so hot Complementary mobile which you can use for the duration and take out to make landline calls I did not use this but it is a good idea for visitors to UK Good internet connection no buffering when watching NOW TV I paid around 9 pounds for a full breakfast on arrival offered for around 15 pounds when booking online which was OK I am vegan and would have liked soya milk which was not offered and a better choice of fruit etc I thought it was a bit expensive and would definitely not want to pay the full 16 pound price for it Staff were all lovely very helpful Hotel kept my luggage all day after I checked out It is only a 5 minute walk to Paddington station and I walked to Oxford street in about 20 minutes I stay near Paddington as get train to and from this station I would definitely stay in this hotel again although I prefer to be nearer Oxford street area this was a really comfortable hotel best one I have stayed at for this price and also in comparison to some I have paid considerably more for 
244255,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The bedroom and toilet were both very cramped The awkward positioning of the wardrobe clothes rail made it difficult to hang up our clothes properly However the worst thing was the ventilation system Everytime we switched on the bathroom light the bathroom fan emitted a strong smell of cooked food which was really unpleasant Someone needs to take a look at the electrics , Convenient location close to train station and Hyde Park Pleasant staff 
244256,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rude staff member when I was checking in at 22 00 the dirty cups in my room with used tea bags coffee and milk laying there no replacements, The bed was comfortable
244257,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Firstly I didn t like finding a mouse living in my room and when I complained about this were told there was other room available until I told them that was unacceptable We were moved rooms but obviously didn t feel comfortable anymore Day of check out we noticed that we had been double charged for the room which we complained about yet again we were told we were wrong until we persisted into them looking further when they discovered they were in the wrong No apologie Would never stay here again , I didn t like anything about this hotel 
244258,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I booked a twin Deluxe room and when I arrived for the check in the receptionist has told me that they don t have any available room and they were sorry so they offered me another room in a different location I re checked booking com and found 4 available rooms so I insisted on staying in the same Hotel Later on they found me a twin room in the Basement that is not as big and spacious as shown in pictures I complained over what happened to Booking com and I explained how I ended up in a very small Basement room But the Hotel told Booking that all their rooms are Deluxe with the same standard Anyway they changed my room after two nights to a Higher floor room as small as the Basement one Try contacting the hotel before you arrive to avoid being sent to a different location , Location Cleanliness
244259,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Very very noisy it s like sleeping in the corridor Extremely small room Tiny toilet Transparent toilet door Too expensive absolutely not worth it , close to Hyde park and Edgware road
244260,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was very small air quality was bad and the bathroom air suction was poorly work Online pictures were misleading , Free and fast WiFi and good location
244261,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms in the cellar noise drunken guests shouting by the entrance of the hotel Access very difficult for older people or guest with walking difficulties, Nothing
244262,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Initially I was offered a room without a window which was not mentioned when I booked the room I was then given a room with a window but the mattress was so saggy that I kept rolling out The pillows were also very uncomfortable ,No Positive
244263,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, This was our worst nightmare We have never booked a place like this Absolutely disgusting Curtains hanging outside falling down windows Windows were filthy The place was stinking Nothing like the photograph on line No way could I take a family to stay there I am complaining and looking for full refund , Nothing
244264,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel fulfilled my request for a cot and allowed us to check in early We were also given a Club Room for no extra cost The hotel was in great location just a short walk from Hyde Park Marble Arch and Oxford street 
244265,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The staff where very in helpful They put us in a horrible room the first night without air conditioning and next to a generator They refused to move us and put a portable fan in the room It was a horrible stay,No Positive
244266,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms are small, The double room was very small but all london hotels are same But in the last 4 nights they upgrade me to club room which was fantastic
244267,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room quite small , Comfortable clean room Location was great near tube station eating places supermarkets Tesco M S closeby Good customer service from the reception 
244268,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The financial policies of the hotel require review and while the staff are pleasant they are largely undertrained I paid on arrival for a 7 day stay but found a day later that a second charge for a large sum I did not recognise was pending on my card in addition to the sum already fully paid for my accomodation Staff initially tried to tell me that this was standard however the second charge was inexplicable Rectifying the matter required my persisting in three conversations with ineffectual staff who gave me the impression that they did not know what they were doing and did not pass on messages to management requiring me to explain my concerns again and again Frankly being told I don t know is not a suitable answer to a query regarding why over 500 has been added to your credit card bill The extra charge was eventually removed three days after I had left the hotel with my funds tied up until it was rectified Not impressed When I returned a week later for a single night booking prior to departure from the UK on a long haul flight I noted that the room fee was preauthorised on my card 24 hours before my stay which is not a problem Yet when I arrived tired and ready for my room at 7 00pm no room was available which is a problem and quite unacceptable without prior notification After I refused a transfer to another property I needed the proximity to Paddington and the Heathrow Express another room was found and the matter eventually rectified to my satisfaction again management had to be called to sort it out with reception polite but essentially useless Had I not refused to move elsewhere I have no doubt I would have been palmed off and had a difficult morning the following day I travel a great deal for business used to work in a world class hospitality facility myself don t expect the world and don t complain lightly , This hotel is in a great location very clean and convenient to transport 
244269,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms were very small, The hotel staff were excellent very friendly and helpful Excellent location between newly regenerated Paddington and Hyde Park The hotel rooms seemed recently refurbished to a high level
244270,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I forgot a bottle of perfume and when I phoned to report it I was told that I must have taken it as it wasn t there when clearly it had been taken by the house staff I was told by reception to believe what I liked Very disappointed ,No Positive
244271,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Everything , Nothing much The room was in the basement and had a double and two single beds in it It was also in the basement very depressing 
244272,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, They didn t have the deluxe twin room we re reserved so we ended up in a tiny standard double with no bath room 008 Parking was an extra 20 per night i guess good value for location breakfast was expensive i think for a continental 15 per person The toiletries in the room very basic branded Shaftesbury i would expect better quality from a 4 star boutique hotel Also rushing with the little one on checkout we left some items of clothing behind in the wardrobe which were not found a few days later when we rang but i guess these things happen , Good location very comfortable beds staff very friendly and welcoming and cleanliness also a plus 
244273,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rooms are small but that s true anywhere in London short of luxury accommodation and pricing The electric outlet to charge my phone didn t work The staff was attentive and fixed a temporary solution , Location is convenient to Paddington and Heathrow trains It is a quiet tree lined address with no traffic noise This was my third stay there 
244274,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Cleanliness of room courteous staff comfortable bed and quiet room We brought the wrong converter from home and the hotel staff found one for us to use no problem Breakfast was perfect with many options from eggs yogurt fruit and breads We had a variety of breakfast foods to choose from Good location to walk or take the tube around London I would stay at this hotel again 
244275,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was like a cupboard It was not the room I booked I booked a twin room They overbooked and we got 2 single rooms The was not room to put the suitcase on the floor The shower would not have accommodated a large person We were told that there was a good view by the receptionist it was a building site Breakfast was a joke full English No tomatoes no sausages no bacon St least when I complained they knocked it off the bill They double booked on a large scale everybody in reception was complaining, The staff The bed was very comfortable and the duvet was good quality
244276,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The first room we were given no 120 was far too small for a couple and we were travelling lightly the small double bed was tight against the window and the room generally was cramped It would be o k for a single traveller but definitely not a couple , The staff were very helpful and friendly the location excellent close to Kensington gardens Hyde park and Bayswater tube station When we had an issue with the bedroom it was dealt with promptly and the second room was fine 
244277,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The prostitutes outside the hotel shouting to each other until 4am wasn t really helpful Room was very very small for the money about twice the size of the double bed and that was after an upgrade from a tinier box room , Breakfast buffet was very good for a hotel of this size 
244278,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I booked a club room which should be bigger than a regular room and even that was small and makes you suffacate and even that it was small the air conditioning was terrible in the room that they gave me at first the hotel said this is the best it can get staff were helpful to show me other rooms but all the same all the rooms were hot A C barely functional no air flow and not cold enough couldnt sleep for 2 nights hotel has a serios A C problem that they should fix I definitely dont recommend this hotel specially in summer ,No Positive
244279,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, At 2m tall the bed was a bit short but having a double to myself meant there was no problem Thought staff cleanliness and standard of room excellent Loved the Monsoon shower 
244280,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was SO tiny and this was after being upgraded on arrival to a club room which apparently was bigger I dread to think how small the double room would have been which we booked but presumably a LOT smaller than the photos indicate Also the room felt a hundred degrees when we arrived would have been nice if the aircon was left on for us to turn off ourselves Also the TV was by FAR the worst I ve ever encountered in any hotel It only had about 5 or 6 viewable channels and none of the remote s buttons worked Plus the clock on the side of the TV was about 5 hours ahead of time This all would have really annoyed us if we were staying for more than 1 night , Good overhead shower with good pressure Bed comfortable enough and room clean 
244281,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Nothing everything was fine, I had been sharing for the past 3 weeks so even though the room was compact it was perfect for what I needed Great location close to the tube and I walked to Oxford St
244282,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms slightly dated but otherwise a very comfortable stay , When I was told my room had been unavailable due to unavoidable maintenance staff were extremely accommodating seeing to my every need I can t praise the staff and management team enough Breakfast was good location excellent

244289,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, A c in some rooms , I visited too many countries and stayed in many hotels I haven t seen reception staff like what you have in your hotel especially angelo franshisca and kamilia They were the main reason to comeback again the name may not written like what I wrote but i think you will know them I really wants to thank them again They were smailing and cooperative 
244290,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The location was amazing Close to the train station and the park The staff always greeted us when we came into the hotel and were helpful and friendly 
244291,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rooms were really stuffy at night and the window doesn t open that far To keep the room cool you would need to turn on the AC all night , The location was great Beds were very comfortable and relatively quite at night 
244292,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, creaking floor noise from room above me noisy active children who never seemed to sleep Woke me up at 03 00 on second night and was so bad on 3rd last night staff changed my room at 12pm and were very apologetic, helpful reception staff

244295,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Air conditioning and freezer not working which took long to fix them Just in the arriving they told us that had problems in our room so they offered to change us to other hotel giving us the breakfast As the location seems not be so good I asked again to stay and after a few minutes it was posible to stay Seemed that they work with overbooking As we complained about this at the check out we received a discount , Excellent location good neighbourhood near Paddington station Very clean

244299,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We were a bit disappointed with the size of our quadruple flat Although the pictures on the internet depicted a large room the rooms were anything but large for a family of four The space was rather cramped and we would have liked to have more space , The location was fantastic and the staff efficient particularly the restaurant staffers and supervisor 
244300,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Breakfast could be included in the room rate but they were offering a discounted breakfast rate and there was a nice selection , Lovely staff and a very clean and efficient hotel Room is slightly small but comfortable and well appointed Everyone at the hotel is very pleasant and helpful I will stay again 
244301,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Unprofessional and poor Service they told us that there is maintenance so we went to their Other Hotel in paddington and were told for sure the next day we will be back to Hotel we bocked The Next day were told that it will take One more day to get to Hotel we bocked Also they give us small room and small beds which was different than the One we booked It is like they decide which Hotel and also the Room you stay in and expect You to pay It does not deserve more than 3 Stars , Nothing I do not recommend this Hotel 
244302,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The air conditioner doesn t not work in the hotel at all We have changed 3 rooms in 3 nights as they promised that it will work in the other room But no change at all Had 3 most horrible nights as it was to hot no fresh air and from the toilet there was a smell of cigarets which made the whole experience even worse ,No Positive

244304,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Main issue was that room key needs reprogramming frequently i e go out and come back it doesn t work , Francesca was an exceptional receptionist 
244305,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The bedroom was very small actually a box The air conditioning was either freezing or the room was too warm The window either shut or had to be left wide open This made the room noisy from the traffic outside The TV did not work all of the time The wires box were loose When a gentleman came to have a look he said you just wiggle the wires and it ll be fine , The location and area Plenty of restaurants within close walking distance 
244306,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Your room was a bit small , Your friendly and accommodating staff The handy traveller cell phone was also a unique offer I have not yet experienced in other hotels around the globe 
244307,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room is neat bed comfortable amenities good but the Deluxe double room is too compact making movements between couples difficult , The food and the entire staff were excellent 
244308,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, dingy room in basement offered first with an internal window looking onto a seating area on same level and very noisy air con Complained and got a more satisfactory room , Good location not far from tube stop
244309,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rude staff to be frank very incompetant Room was tiny tryed to relocate us to a hotel that was 70 cheaper and still charge us the same price of their hotel and made false excuses of maintainance works which suddenly stopped and our room was available again when i threatned to leave , The location of the hotel was good and good decor 
244310,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The AC And the lack of rooms rooms are too small and the halls are small so u could hear everyone who walks , The person who worked called angelo 
244311,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room not well lit No remote for a c TV control not user friendly, Great location with plenty of shops and restaurants fast food outlets nearby including 24hrs Tesco Express near to St Mary s Hospital Getting on by bus from St Mary s Hospital is 3 minutes walking distance Paddington Edgware Station is 5 8 min Mood of our holiday was enhanced by the excellent service provided by the reception staff who were helpful in many ways Always ready to help with a smile on their face Would highly recommend this hotel 
244312,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rooms were minute and a little shabby There is no bar or restaurant on the premises which you would expect in a hotel , Nothing was too much trouble for the staff they were wonderful The aircon in my room was broken and they moved me to a bigger room the next day with a hand written message and bowl of fruit

244317,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, However the roomwas very small and we re not large people Good job we didn t want to swing a cat , The location was close to Paddington station therefore easily accessible There were lots of places to eat and drink locally Within walking distance of Hyde Park The room was beautifully appointed The cost was also decent for where we were

244319,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The wait for our room to be ready We arrived at 2 00 expected to go to our room to freshen up but had to wait nearly an hour for the room to be ready If this is a problem for the cleaning staff then check out needs to be earlier to cope with the demand , The location to Hyde Park and Paddington were great and what we needed

244348,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, 19 C was the coolest temperature we could achieve in the room A little too warm for us Bathroom was extremely small A person larger in weight and height would have great difficulty and possibly not be able to use at all The room itself was very small but as we were only sleeping there was not an issue , We could walk everywhere from the hotel

244363,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Room was a bit cramped but since I was only staying for one night it was acceptable good location for my business on the day price was a bit on the high side I thought for what I got Breakfast at 15 was a joke but thankfully I managed to get it for 9 odd I would stay again but wouldn t be my first choice 
244364,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Not very clean I had a lot of dust in my room , Location is good about ten minutes to marble arch by foot 5 minutes to Paddington station as well as to Hyde park

244366,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The italian receptionist was well intentioned and kind The issue was that she misinformed me regarding the Express train There was no train Please review your sources , Room
244367,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, They were not clear about payment methods Even though in Booking it was said that they accept Maestro Visa card they said they didn t accept it and I have to be paid by a colleague , The room was very nice and confortable 
244368,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was tiny We paid a lot of money and felt we should have booked a Premier Inn or Travelodge as this was not as good for the money we paid , Location good 
244369,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms are small but in triple beds room was much better , Staff treatment was very nice specially John was always helping residence and I give him military salute 
244370,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was much smaller than described on the website The hallways are also fairly narrow It was difficult to ventitale the room Breakfast is overpriced and for some reason they want you to pay a ten pound deposit when you check in , The staff was very helpful in changing my room after I had indicated that the original room smelt like sigarette smoke 
244371,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Bathroom a little small and pillows a bit hard , Lovely and clean pretty good situation just a short walk from the tube station and once you are off the main road the area is leafy and ok Staff very good and we were upgraded as it was my husbands birthday which was a treat Breakfast was good too and plenty of it 
244372,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, My room smelled as if someone had been smoking in it The room was also very small and there was little space to move around the bed , The staff were helpful and the location was good 
244373,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I couldn t close the window and it was very loud as I was on the ground floor Lots of moment and loud voices Not ideal with a late night and early start, Easy and late check in
244374,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We booked because of the 2pm check in as we had to get ready for an award ceremony that started at 4pm But the precious guests had apparently failed to leave on time meaning we were unable to check in until 3pm , Friendly and helpful staff Lovely clean room 
244375,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The rooms are smaller than average but well appointed and comfortable, Our other accommodations fell through and we booked the Shaftesbury last minute The 2 ladies who greeted us at 9 am got us into a room early and offered us tea and snacks while we waited for a room to be ready The first room was quite small and they agreed to change it for us When we returned in the evening our luggage was in the new room Our stay was pleasant and comfortable The Staff was the best part of our visit 
244376,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room was very hot at night I didn t leave air con on as I don t like noise but I wished I had put it on before going out had to leave window open all night which made it a bit noisy , Staff couldn t have been more helpful just little things like offering you a drink while you were waiting I heard them say they would run out and get a toothbrush for someone The room was perfect just as it looked Little touches in bathroom Big tv Very close to tube but fairly quiet as set back from road A good base for tourists
244377,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The first room was ridiculous explained that had payed for different and moved us into a different room breakfast is Way go expensive to be honest couldn t wait go get back home, We didn t get what we payed for but moved us into a different room although it wasn t what was pictured on the website it was more comfortable
244378,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The area is basically Little Lebanon Without kids I think we would have enjoyed going to the local restaurants However EVERYONE smokes in London and in the shops around the hotel everyone is smoking hookah Not the best environment for babies , The staff was so amazing We were booked for 2 twins so we could sleep 1 adult with 1 child on each bed The manager upgraded us to a better room on the 3rd floor which had a nice window with a view of the street I believe the floor we were originally booked on was a smoking floor so be sure to check So we slept 2 adults and 2 little ones on a king To be fair we are very low maintenance Also the staff called around and booked all our tours for us Although it might have been cheaper to buy online by a few pounds Another great thing there is a little grocery store about 5 7 minutes walking distance 
244379,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, It was definitely cramped for two people For us this was fine we were only in the room for sleeping For others it may be too tight , Great location quiet street very close to Hyde park and a short walk to Notting hill 
244380,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Rooms quite small but to be expected in London , Location was great very nr to Paddington St could get to everywhere very quickly and only a short walk to Oxford Street 
244381,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, When we arrived to the hotel they told us there is no room for us and moved us the similar hotel The room was very tiny There was a place for the bed only Don t worth the money, The location 10 min walk from the subway station The staff was kind
244382,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Fresh fruit salad at breakfast would have been an improvement on tinned peaches and fruit cocktail , The staff were particularly keen to please and the decor and cleanliness were exemplary 
244383,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, 3 main points 1 On the arrival the hotel staff told that the hotel is fully booked and they will find me a room in other hotel but after I refused they give me a room I think i read also this comment in the review 2 On the second night I found mouse in the room the hotel apologiesd for that and they gave me another room It seems to me that it wasn t time it happened 3 The room is very small it was difficult to move between bed and bags , Location Clean and helpful staff 
244384,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Only downside was that the window in our room faced into a covered area of the building rather than outside , Friendly staff excellent breakfast Public areas and our room very clean warm and comfortable Would return to this hotel and recommend 
244385,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Basement bedrooms and bathrooms far too small no natural daylight in the rooms OK for one person but not two Tendency to overbook and send guests to their sister hotel which happened to our friends , The cleanliness throughout the hotel

244389,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room had a fake window It was facing the inner corridor of the building therefore no air was coming in The air conditioner had no settings only on off so the temperature was either freezing cold or hot in the room Sometimes the ventilation system blew tobacco smoke into the bathroom non smoking room , The hotel is located in a very nice area of the city and it s only a few minutes walk from the tube Bed was comfortable 
244390,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Got allocated a disabled room Wasn t a huge problem but shaving showering were a little tricky , Great location Nice modern hotel with great boutique feel Really good breakfast 
244391,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Tiny room not worth the money and not a 4 standard room Couldn t hang clothes in the wardrobe because the ironing board was inside and blocking the rail Room too small to put the ironing board if I took it out Room was in the Basement very noisy Window looked out onto the corridor meaning the curtains had to be kept drawn at all times Dark room lights need to be on at all times Very disappointing overall , Excellent location Clean overall
244392,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, The customer service representative Angelo was extremely helpful and even remembered us from an earlier stay at the hotel Would highly recommend this hotel for good service 
244393,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The space of the room is very very small for three although it was a triple room Not worth the money, I booked a triple room but the room was very small to the extent that we can hardly move In addition the bathroom was even smaller compared to other bathrooms I could hardly move in the bathroom The room was not comfortable at all and the staff was not professional in dealing with my comments 
244394,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We had to ask twice for the fridge to be fixed and I had to sort the TV myself The bathroom had seen better days and wasn t very clean There was no radiator in it so the towels didn t dry out Overall fine for a couple days and our trip to the Albert Hall but verging on overpriced, A nice looking hotel close to Edgware Rd and Hyde Park Room was in basement nice and roomy Beds comfy and fresh fruit and flowers in the room a nice touch 
244395,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Not much to say really on my arrival the receptionness was on the phone and took 5 minutes to ecnolega me not good then was do the accounts for the day and had problems finding my booking this added time and I was tiered
244396,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Staff dont have respect for your privacy they came into my room for service while we were out in spite of the Do not disturb sign on the door TV was not working and after several calls took them 2 days to fix it then it broke again , Fair price
244397,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room in basement cold air con not Great radiator would be better and tv location in room was at awkward angle to the bed light in bathroom way too bright by sinks, Staff are very helpful and always try to assist me over and beyond they are an asset to the hotel love the size of tv and that rooms some of them have a bath option love the fact you have a microwave and small fridge also very good
244398,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, They lie to me In the booking de the picture of the Deluxe double room shows the room is large so I booked the Deluxe double room however when I arrived there they gived us a room much smaller Then I asked them why they just answered that the picture is wrong it is actually the club double room they also said that there have been many customers argued that and they refused to change our room They know the picture is wrong and lie people to book the much smaller Deluxe double room , the room is clean and the location is also near the underground station 
244399,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Room double for which I paid extra was very small with no room for a chair Bed was not paticularly comfortable , Good bathroom although small with nice shower 
244400,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Nothing really everything was catered for for us , Loved the whole experience to be honest you catered for all needs the room was impecable on arrival and the staff were all friendly and helpful Would definitely visit again 
244401,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Receptionist serving lies on arrival Room with 20 cms between toilet and wall meeting knees not possible to sit Hard beds Too high price compared to others available , Short walk to Hyde Park and wonderful breakfast at Le Pain Q on the way 
244402,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, This hotel uses very strong air freshener products in the rooms I immediately got light headed when I walked into my room People that are sensitive to high levels of perfume will have an issue at this hotel , Staff location
244403,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The bed and pillows were so hard I had a sniff neck after 1 night and we had to ask for soft pillows because of this The bed was so hard that after a few nights of sleeping in them we have back ache for several days after with my partner having severe back pain The shower cubicle was very small and only a slim person could comfortably stand in and it also leaked on to the floor despite the doors being closed so the floor because very wet The bed was a standard double despite our room being upgraded from a standard double to a club suite FURTHER MORE we were woken up every morning at 6 30 onwards and could not get to sleep earlier that midnight due to constant noise of trampling and doors slamming above and around us so much that our room rattled When I advised the staff upon checkout of our experience they didn t offer a refund and have lacked compassion and professionalism by consistently not calling me back or calling to discuss the matter further when an specific time and day had been agreed for them to call me I am still waiting for a call I will not choose to book this hotel or other hotels by the same company again as they have been less than helpful and very reluctant to make contact with me now they have been paid my money in advance Absolutely disgusted , The service on check in was great with complimentary fruit and drink in the room 
244404,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff are lovely always so helpful they go out of their way to accommodate what you want I love staying here ask for room with bath if u prefer those like me

244406,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, No view from the room We didn t have breakfast as had other things planned , Location was perfect for us and facilities were OK for our needs for a one night stay We were upgraded to a club room which was a surprise as it was out Silver Wedding Anniversary Great pub opposite The Monkey Puzzle 
244407,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, As above, We asked for the top floor but was placed in ground floor with no window Very small room not enough space Very poor service Poor customer service at reception desk 
244408,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, We stayed in a club room the location was fantastic just 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station The staff were amazing extremely friendly and helpful We arrived at around 10 am and though the check in time was 14 hrs we were able to check in within 30 minutes of arriving at the hotel 
244409,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, To small to move the tv didn t work well I wasn t at my best so my be that has some thing to do with it , The stuff were very helpfull and friendly
244410,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Nothing, Perfect location near Paddington station By London standards a fair sized room and bathroom I had a double room which was clean and pretty well furnished 
244411,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, We had a triple room but there was only 2 of us in the end This was fortunate as it was pretty tiny In the bathroom the toilet is far too close to the wall , I liked the location It s right between 2 stations Paddington and Lancaster Gate The decor in the lobby and elsewhere was of a good standard The staff were friendly and answered questions and were generally responsive The breakfast was great The beds were very comfortable and clean and the shower in the bathroom was fabulous 
244412,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Interesting people outside when I was walking back late from an evening with friends I must confess I d forgotten about this but it s not a reflection on the Hotel just the area and something to be aware of , Great location on my walk into the West End from Paddington Station Not right on top of the Tourists in Paddington or Marble Arch but close enough to escape quickly Great service and good value for money Stayed here many times and will probably be back next time I have to stay in the West End 
244413,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, I have stayed twice at this hotel first room we had we didn t hear no noice and it was silent But this time around where the room was positioned it was just constant noice and door slamming If we stay again I will not be staying in that room as the noice level is just to high for me They also only have a small option of food and drinks to order to your room this is such a shame and drives people to go out of the hotel just for snacks pain in ass , The staff were so friendly and helpful The room was just lovely and had everything you need and more The fact we could park outside the hotel was the icing on the cake
244414,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Can not think of anything, The staff we re so helpful and the breakfast was excellent and being a foodie all the elements were done spot on and the coffee was awesome i was visiting my brother in intensive care at Chelsea Westminster and though I was distressed my stay helped massively Thank you I will stay recommend your hotel Even the taxi was luxury 
244415,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The staff attempted to transfer me to a sister hotel in Paddington on arrival but I explained I had booked this hotel for the location as it was walking distance to where I needed to be the next morning They immediately changed their request and I was allowed to stay at the hotel selected Since it didn t appear to be anywhere near full I have no idea why they made the request Continental breakfast for 15 seemed a bit expensive so didn t have it , Room was clean quiet and comfortable although it might have been a bit snug with 2 adults in it Air conditioning worked so was able to cool it down while out in the evening Staff were very helpful and friendly I was escorted to the room since it was down a couple of small corridors and the member of staff then adjusted the air conditioning and lighting as requested 
244416,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Bed was far too soft we both woke with aching backs hips after a poor nights sleep Bed was too small but we are both taller than average So probably not a complaint for another guest , Staff were incredibly friendly helpful room was a good size as was bathroom fantastic power in the shower Location and value for money were brilliant 
244417,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, They first provided me a room with no outside windows After requesting for a room with windows for some fresh air they moved me to a different room for the next two nights , Breakfast was okay and the staff was very friendly Very clean room and it s nice that they have fresh flowers in the public area s Good location nearby shops restaurants and metro train stations

244424,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, as a genius member i was expecting an option for a 2 hr late check out but the hotel said they have not agreed this with booking com and will investigate they did however give me a 1 hr extension as per their normal policy, the location is great and the room is fit for a short stay
244425,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, Some things needed to be updated such as walls needing a new bit of paint but it didn t effect us, The breakfast that is extra was very tasty The single rooms are tiny and we got an upgrade due to issues with our room we had booked a standard double and was given a club room the room was a nice size for sure but make me wonder how big was the standard room
244426,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, There was rubbish left in the bin in the bathroom and we found hairs in the bed but we weren t in the bed Not happy , The staff were very good and moved us straight away after I had told them about the hairs in the bed p s Not belonging to us

244428,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The room was tiny but cosy Downside to the whole trip is that I was charged one night prior to staying at the hotel without my consent or knowledge I am still awaiting for this amount and also the deposit I gave when I arrived of 40 , The staff where very helpful and polite The hotel is in a nice area reachable to many main locations

244436,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, When I arrived the window was open despite it being a ground floor room and one of the coldest days of the year It took ages to get the room to a decent temperature The room itself was so small that the bathroom door wouldn t open properly because of the bed being in the way Due to a family emergency concerning my elderly parents I was forced to leave at 6pm so was unable to stay the night I explained the situation to the receptionist and asked that the 10 card authorisation to be held against any extras she was flustered and told me that she was unable to check me out at short notice as she was a trainee and so despite my obvious distress I was forced to wait for the other receptionist to become available When he finally was I explained the situation again and he told me quite flatly that he was unable to refund me my room charge which I hadn t even asked for and hadn t expected Not impressed , Location 
244437,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and Angelo was a great help and very attentive They delivered flowers to the room which was a very nice gesture as it was a stressful time for me flat searching

244442,Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, The double bed wasn t a proper double bed The room size wasn t quite as spacious as the pictures make it appear in pictures there was space between bottom of bed and wall in reality there was very little We d upgraded for a slightly bigger room , The staff were very helpful A good selection for breakfast
