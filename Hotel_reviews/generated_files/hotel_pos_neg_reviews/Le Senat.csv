22035,Le Senat,No Negative, Friendly staff Very clean rooms Tasty breakfast Excellent location Close to several different Metro line stations Train from CDG goes straight to Luxembourg station then 10 min walk to hotel Just one block from Luxembourg Palace 
22036,Le Senat, Elevator too small, Perfect location nearby Jardin Du Luxembourg and metro RER stations Front desk staff friendly and efficient Spotless room and good quality amenities
22037,Le Senat, No kettle in the room if you want to make tea you need to use the only one in the lobby , Very good location nice staff comfortable chamber Highly recommend
22038,Le Senat, hotel blocked a total amont from my card immidiately after booking despite claiming free cancellation room was noisy at night, location close to RER and Luxemburg garden front desk Sanan was very friendly and helpful
22039,Le Senat, There were no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms and no evening dining , We had a superb sleep in very comfy beds particularly the pillows Staff very helpful and gave us transport advice Central location with lots of attractions in walking distance and St Michaels metro near by to get to the eiffel tower 
22040,Le Senat,No Negative, The welcome we received at the hotel was warm and genuine and overall the staff were extremely helpful We were surprised and delighted to be upgraded to a small suite on arrival The hotel is in a quiet street in a popular area a stone s throw from the Jardins de Luxembourg Odeon metro station Luxembourg RER for the train to from the airport There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area and the one that we tried on the recommendation of the hotel was very good Ideal location for a leisure trip to Paris and I d certainly use the hotel again 
22041,Le Senat, nothing, The location of this hotel is wonderful right by the Jardin de Luxumbourg Our rooms were right at the top on the sixth floor which meant magical views over the rooftops of Paris like being in the Aristocats said our daughter We loved the rooms especially as we had a suite for my three teenage children my son had a sofa bed in a room with folded doors so not at all cramped and he could shut out his sisters We loved it and one of the loveliest hotels I have stayed in The coffees in the rooms were delicious 
22042,Le Senat, the location, Overrated hotel apart of the location the design is horrible the circulation space terrible the staff indifferent It is not worth 4 stars 
22043,Le Senat,No Negative, Very good hotel in the heart of St Germain area Rooms are small but thats normal in Paris but the room had all facilities including a decent hairdryer and lovely soft towels I asked for a quiet room and was given one at the rear of hotel so quiet you could hear a pin drop
22044,Le Senat, It s disappointing not to have tea and coffee facilities in all the rooms but there is a little fridge with products to buy , My second visit and this is a well located friendly hotel Rooms are clean and fresh honesty bar is a good touch 
22045,Le Senat, The TV was a bit small , Very nice breakfast We got small chocolates in the room on our arrival very sweet It was our second time in this hotel and the room was bigger and nicer than the first time 
22046,Le Senat, The staff was rude the one man in particular at the reception unhelpful when requested to check why the light in the bathroom could not be switched off without taking out the main switch card , Beds comfortable and nice toiletteries in the bathroom
22047,Le Senat, See above, The room was minute and the only way to switch off the light in the bathroom was to take out the central switch card This meant that during the night I almost fell twice and hurt myself Although I asked for a hot cup of water in room service I was told I need to take it up from a kettle available to guests I have some dry cleaning the night I arrived for next day afternoon delivery and I had to keep checking until 8 30pm at least The night reception person at arrival was not very friendly and quite rude 
22048,Le Senat, A less noisy aircondition Free coffee in lobby or macine in room would be expected for the prive of this hotel, Professional and very friendly and helpful staff Acomodating to any issues Great location Comfy rooms with good beds and great linnes 
22049,Le Senat, I didn t like that there was no complimentary continental breakfast I ve stayed in worse hotels where they did offer that But that is OK, The bed was comfy the room was warm Bathroom was new and beautiful and clean and the location was excellent
22050,Le Senat, Shocking rooms next to noisy lifts and plumbing that makes racket all night 18 for coffee at breakfast apart from the entrance all the looked like the back of house at a normal hotel truly shocking , Good location
22051,Le Senat, The water wouldn t stay at a consistent temperature it kept going cold and then boiling hot also the wifi didn t work in the bedrooms , Location was pretty good
22052,Le Senat, It was a fire trap Never return The elevator and hallways and room size were a disgrace They were so small and narrow Two people could not walk in the hallway together The pictures on the website were so deceiving Breakfast not appealing was in a windowless basement , Did not like a thing about this hotel Regretted that we paid in full or we would have changed hotels Nicer ones are in the area Very surprised this was an option on your website 
22053,Le Senat, The internet wasn t working in the rooms They claimed they were switching companies They gave us after day 2 a box for the room to help out It was OK not great but much better than having to go into the lobby for wifi One front desk person was very unpleasant and should not be in the hospitality business The cleaning staff does a very mediocre job There was a small glass shelf in the bathroom with our items on it It was never cleaned or organized throughout our stay the cleaning staff takes up the entire hallway with their things each day forcing one to maneuvre around it in the narrow hallways Toilet is separate from the sink and tub which is somewhat odd and uncomfortable , The location was very nice 
22054,Le Senat, big issue is the WIFI connection on previous comments dating form over three months ago previous customers complained about the lack of wifi in the rooms and the GM of the hotel relied to this comments that this issue would be resolved in a matte row two weeks as they were changing the network provider However three moths afterwards the problem still hasn t been resolved and we were given the same answer it would be resolved within two weeks major disappointment,No Positive
22055,Le Senat, As with all Paris rooms the bedrooms are extremely small and it s not going to please those used to lots of space in hotel chains They could as all hotels provide more toiletries, The location is just perfect I ve stayed here 4 times now Quiet next to the Luxembourg Gardens and with the profusion of shopping opportunities on Boulevard St Germain and restaurants near the Sorbonne I love it The hotel has now got an honesty bar and sitting area in the ground floor lobby
22056,Le Senat, small dreary rooms staff or management attitude to dealing with client complaints no extras no offer of upgrade when complained about room even though there were rooms available and indeed they wanted to charge more superior rooms are 3 star at best , very little bed was ok and the bar area is nice
22057,Le Senat, Room smelled of stale smoke Only one elevator which was used by cleaning staff all morning and therefore unusable for guests , Location is excellent close to Luxembourg Gardens RER train for airport Metro and short walking distance to Notre Dame Also close to St Germain area for restaurants and bars 
22058,Le Senat, Would like to have a small jug in the room so we could make a quick cup of tea before bed , Friendly staff who could speak English no problems Nice room Good location easy walk to local Metro stations cafes Luxembourg Gardens 
22059,Le Senat, We didn t like the breakfast and their was no WiFi in the rooms, The staff was wonderful and welcoming the area is lovely right in the middle of everything and doing early morning yoga at the Luxembourg gardens was heaven
22060,Le Senat, Wifi not working on kids room 102 Very frustrating One night they were out of dessert ordered on room service which was disappointing , Balcony room was a dream come true Bed very comfortable Housekeeping was discreet and thorough Breakfast was very good 
22061,Le Senat, Be sure to check wi fi connection quality in your room if you need it in Paris of course , Location is perfect and rooms are super cozy The stuff provided all the help needed Highly recommended 
22062,Le Senat, The breakfast area is small very dark and crowded Access is via a small lift Lack of clean crockery and cutlery Limited choice of food Not suitable for young children Best avoided Toilet drains in room were very smelly , Location was very good 10 minute walk to Metro Bedroom was clean and comfortable Large windows in room allowed you to sample sites and smells of Paris 
22063,Le Senat, Very small hotel The toilet was in a separate closet from the sink and tub Not convenient And the toilet room was way too SMALL , Good location Accommodating staff 
22064,Le Senat, Lots if little things like aircon not working no toilet brushes very limited breakfast bar in a tiny sub basement worn out mattresses and generally some things just needed a little work to fix them up , Great location in a back street with a short walk to shops and restaurants It has potential to be really good Staff were excellent Nice honesty bar and refreshments in a comfortable lounge area 
22065,Le Senat, Nothing to report , The staff was very nice We asked if we could have almond milk for breakfast as one of us is lactose intolerant and they fulfilled our request no so common in Paris hotels from our experience The breakfast was good Nice surprise we got little macaroons in the bedroom with a nice note 
22066,Le Senat, The only downside was the breakfast which was small and served in a dull and dark basement We recommend breakfast in town or one of the beautiful parks instead All in all great hotel though , Excellent staff very service minded Helped us with reservations and advice in very good English 
22067,Le Senat, Breakfast too expensive and area cramped, Staff very friendly Hotel contacted us prior to stay and gave us restaurant recommendations and instructions of how to get to hotel Also provided rain macs when it was pouring Free of charge 
22068,Le Senat, Actually I didn t find anything not to like , Staff was very helpful and friendly The room comfortable and stylish The location of the property extremely convenient 
22069,Le Senat, staff could perhaps be more helpful with restaurant tips each member of staff just regurgitated the same two places although you don t really struggle in Paris ,No Positive
22070,Le Senat, The hotel requires some renovation Dirty walls in the room a lot of dirt on the tiles in the bathroom Poor choice of food at breakfast , Nice bed good location Quiet no noise outside the window 
22071,Le Senat,No Negative, I love it all Second time on Le Senat and tried and was booked last year Love the location love the staff love the help yourself Nespresso in the morning and wine at night Room is comfortable and quiet Always my first choice in Paris 
22072,Le Senat, Sound insulation is not great But this issue is a problem for many hotels in Paris , Excellent location close to everything Saint Germain can offer Friendly staff Nice decor Good value for money 
22073,Le Senat, Nothing, Since the beginning the staff was extremely helpful even via email before our arrival Staff was also looking after us during our stay and allowed us to keep our luggage during the last day of our stay as we were taking a late flight The room was stunning duplex with a living room in first floor and bedroom and balcony on top floor The views were out of this world Clean and tidy with great WIFI connection and L Occitane toiletries Just few minutes from Luxembourg Gardens and the Latin Quarter Our first choice for next time in Paris
22074,Le Senat, We did not find anything to our dissatisfaction , We enjoyed the location of the hotel to the areas of Paris we wanted to see It was very convenient Very comfortable Hotel
22075,Le Senat, The rooms are very small , Loved the location the staff was fantastic as well They gave us a room with a balcony with great views Definitely worth the stay and the value thanks to the friendliness and attentive staff 
22076,Le Senat, The room is a bit small and expensive but I guess it is Paris The terrace was in an air well thus there was no light at all I would have saved the money, The location by the Luexumbourg Gardens is fantastic The concierges were all amazingly helpful and knowledgeable
22077,Le Senat, Misleading advertising no restaurant in the hotel Air conditioning not being fixed on time had to change the room from a superior one to a mediocre one at best Short staffed tiny lobby small elevators, Friendly accommodating staff
22078,Le Senat, No tea coffee facility in room That s all really Thought breakfast a tad expensive , Location was great just around corner from some great bars and restaurants Plenty of shops to browse in Overall very nice hotel 
22079,Le Senat, We arrived earlier than most guests but they gave us one of the smallest rooms even though I had requested ahead of time in an e mail one of the larger rooms with a balcony even if I had to pay extra The room had no chairs and no drawers , They had a petite dejeuner for only 7 euro The lobby is very nice with an honor bar They had heated towel racks in the bathroom which allowed us to wash dry underware over night Staff was very responsive and helpful Room was air conditioned 
22080,Le Senat, The room was rather small the breakfast was scanty and not worth 17 euro , The location is great our favourite neighbourhood in Paris so far the bed was very comfortable the stuff was friendly and extremely helpful 
22081,Le Senat, Most of the staff are friendly and willing to help However the night shift manager is not very welcoming and accommodating , The locarion is definitely one of the best in Paris Rooms are modern and clean Showers are great 
22082,Le Senat, The hotel is very expensive for the service delivered Rooms are very small and the breakfast is really poor quality Staff are not very friendly either , The hotel is located near Le Jardin Luxembourg and Le Senat and Parisian landmarks are easily accessible
