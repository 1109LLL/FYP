352107,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, Wi Fi is so slow it s not usable Couldn t load a single website or app dated look , quite very well positioned spacious room well equipped room 
352108,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, 1 the bed was made of two matresses not just one which made it uncomfortable even if each one was comfortable 2 even though there was no specification when booking our room was kind of an attic one which created a claustrophobic feeling and the price was not lower than a regular room 3 the parking they provided was very far and expensive, the location was great and the overall impression was positive
352109,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, No parking available you can reserve it through the hotel though but it costs 18 day There was a little sharp step in the entrance to the bathroom it was pretty painful when you forgot that it s there we both hurt ourselves a few times on it The breakfast was outrageously expensive 18 day per person You can get much cheaper breakfast in the restaurants around the hotel but it would have been more convenient for us to eat at the hotel but NOT for that price , Love that the hotel was decorated in theater style even had a play schedule displayed Also love that it was not a new modern building but the original old one with tall ceilings Close to the Rathaus where you could hop on the subway and explore the city The room was pretty big with a huge mirror across the whole wall there was a two burner stove and a sink which was awesome since it was hot and we constantly needed to refill our dog s water bowl lol The room was pretty clean with thick curtains that wouldn t let the light in in the morning There is a fan right above the bed which came in handy in this heat All the staff were nice helpful and polite There is a grocery store right across the hotel and plenty of restaurants everywhere Very happy that we could travel with our dog 3 
352110,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien,No Negative, Very good hotel in the top center of Vienna only 200m to Rathaus and Parliament The staff was very polite the suite was very comfortable and very clean The breakfast was very good everything was delicious and fresh We taste for the first time traditional cheeses I strongly recommend this hotel

352113,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, It would be lovely to have a kettle with 2 cups and complimentary tea and coffee , Excellent location Friendly very helpful staff our room was huuuuuge Lots of local restaurants around a lovely tradicional Austrian restaurant just down in the corner 
352114,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, There is not air conditioner and the main street can be a bit noisy if you open a window we stayed in the winter so the windows were closed and the heat was on , Wonderful hotel We stayed in a mini apartment two rooms it was spacious and had a big bathroom The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable The staff was pleasant and helpful Very nice breakfast The location is very good near restaurants supermarket and the train station is not far 
352115,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, The breakfast was a little monotonous in variety one bug a boo the hot bacon and egg kept in same container with same spoons used to help yourselves result bacon contaminated with disgusting egg , Very good atmosphere and slightly old fashioned large room with extra private lounge included We ve stayed here twice before and will do so again if we re visit Vienna
352116,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien,No Negative, The hotel is amazing It is really near to the city center less than 10 minutes from Rathaus It is perfectly clean and tidy The staff was very friendly The rooms are big and the room was cleaned every day There are some restaurants near the hotel 
352117,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, booked a taxi transfer service via hotel reception from airport to the hotel but the taxi driver didnot show up , very comfort room with great bedding the location is quite in the middle but 5 mins walk from subway station
352118,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, No tea or coffee making facilities and no toiletries But we knew that before we booked however missed these facilities , Convenient location clear and roomy Comfortable beds I know the beds received some criticism but although they were Soft mattresses they were comfortable Same with the wifi initially I could not connect and I went and asked the lovely young man at reception and he connected it for me and I did not have trouble for the rest of our stay 
352119,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, Aweful bed and sofa mattresses probably haven t been changed since hotel was opened I had back pain the following morning There is sort of kitchen in the room but absolutely no utensils even no glasses for water All in all hotel need renovation it had its time , Friendly and helpful staff 
352120,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, 1 Room smelt of cigarettes 2 Seperate mattresses Queen sized bed is the perfect size but would prefer not falling in the middle 3 Seperate Blankets, 1 Friendly Staff 2 Trust 3 Parking 4 Basic Hotel not fancy snobby 
352121,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, The kitchenette in our 2 level suite was small and difficult to prepare meal for 4 people However I think there may be different rooms with a different layout , Great breakfast Lovely staff Short walk from parliament and ringstrasse 
352122,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, This a hotel 3 stars never 4 The photos show a bedroom totally different The wifi is not good and the beds are uncomfortable Sofa bed is unusable We had to ask for a real bed to replace it All the decorations seem old We are totally disappointed about this hotel , Location is good
352123,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, The hotel felt as if it had known better times but for 70 a night the value was quite good Distinct lack of oomph in the tiny pillows Breakfast option way too expensive to consider Not a problem of course as this is Vienna plenty of bakeries coffee shops and stores nearby I was unpleasantly surprised at check out time when the receptionist asked me how I wanted to pay despite having paid up front with my credit card when I booked this room via booking com At that time a charge reservation was duly made by the hotel but apparently they let that reservation lapse by the time we arrived ostensibly because they felt the need to verify that I actually owned the credit card I paid with Luckily I did carry my credit card with me but as I am not in the habit of doing so to minimise risk I use the card exclusively for foreign online internet payments this felt like a shady thing to ask for a reputable hotel The receptionist wanted to use a terminal to validate the payment at first but as I do not normally use this card physically I use Maestro bank cards in the EU the terminal could not be used because it asked for a PIN number which I don t even know or care to know She resigned to accepting the credit card as is in the end but this episode left a sour note at the end of an otherwise excellent stay Cordial if you respond to this review please don t include the boilerplate thank you text you use in every other reply rather directly address the issue at hand , The bed in general especially the mattress exceeded the comfort usually found in hotels by far Great location in residential neighbourhood near U bahn Spacious room with shag carpetting 
352124,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, Charging of Euro 30 per day for an upgrade as we needed an extra bed for my son of 8 which was clearly mentioned at the time of booking, Kitchenette was an add on

352130,Cordial Theaterhotel Wien, I would add a small bottle of wine to the fridge The room has a small kitchenette and cutlery would be great Breakfast could be cheaper but otherwise all good , My parents and I stayed in this hotel many years ago and liked it very much This time was no exception It s a 5 minute walk to Rathaus and 10 to the university and city centre Perfect for concert goers as Vienna concert hall is only a few subway stops away Staff are very helpful and lovely The hotel is nice and clean and each room is named after actors and directors who had links to the theater and the hotel in the past
