340753,Ambassade Hotel, Not all rooms face canal But that really is ok , Gracious staff great accommodations warm welcoming library with bar coffee available Located in quiet area close to markets cafe 
340754,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a historic building on one of the main canals in Amsterdam within walking distance of most tourist attraction Our room deluxe with canal view was beautiful large clasically decorated The bed was huge and extremely comfortable Breakfast was nice fresh fruit juices cold cuts pastry and warm dishes upon request They also have a nice cosy bar with lots of books where you can have a drink or play backgammon Staff was very attentive and helpful 
340755,Ambassade Hotel, Our room faced the canal On the first night we were badly disturbed by a loud party that went on past midnight across the canal The sound carried clearly into our room preventing us from falling asleep For the future I would avoid personally avoid Canal facing rooms as they are vulnerable to the outside disturbances , Charming hotel in a very good location for walking around to all the main sights The breakfast selection and presentation was very good We didn t have enough time to enjoy the hotel facilities as our stay was too short The staff was extremely hospitable friendly and helpful 
340756,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Incredible location on the nicest canal in Amsterdam Beautiful spacious unit Just one important thing to know the rooms are in 3 story old homes so be sure you check with the property if you have any physical limitations that would make it difficult to climb few or many steps Breakfast is not included in the room rate but very good value lots of healthy choices fresh breads and omelets to order 
340757,Ambassade Hotel, My room did not have a good view of the street or a canal Rather it looks out to a side wall of another building or into the bk of another building Plenty of sunlight , I like the room decoration and ambiance The room is adequate size for 2 adults and kid 
340758,Ambassade Hotel, I didn t mind the small spiral staircase but it was not suitable for elderly or disabled, Excellent friendly service and beautiful authenticity to the hotel
340759,Ambassade Hotel, the double room just had a extra bed in it as there were 3 of us Could have had a larger room , We had a fabulous stay at the ambassador hotel the staff couldn t have been more friendlier or helpful lovely stay there we had a lovely breakfast on our last morning and again very helpful and friendly ambiance would recommend to our friends and family
340760,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The rooms were beautifully appointed and clean and the flowers that were provided stayed fresh the entire week we were there The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed each meal We enjoyed having a drink or cappuccino in the Library every evening and talking to each of the bartenders each one was so personable and attentive My friend had misplaced her sweater and by chance asked if anyone had turned it in to the front desk and the next morning the sweater was returned to her She thought she d lost it in on a visit to Den Haag I would highly recommend the Ambassaade for a carefree destination in Amsterdam 
340761,Ambassade Hotel, I had a pair of headphones lost in my room and the hotel made an effort to search but did not seem to resolve it The headphones were expensive , How clean the property was and how nice the staff is 
340762,Ambassade Hotel, They put a twin into a room to accommodate our 3rd person This made the room too small for all the furniture in it But it was fine You can walk anywhere in Amsterdam from here easily , Clean and wel appointed Beds were very comfy
340763,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing This hotel was outstanding , The Ambassade is a wonderful boutique hotel in a fabulous central location It is situated on a quiet attractive street within walking distance of Dam Square the main shopping streets excellent restaurants and the major museums The service was outstanding nothing being too much trouble Martyn s assistance well informed suggestions and advice on restaurants was excellent Our attractive room was very spacious with two large windows overlooking the pretty canal with its leafy trees and little boats Light and bright the room was extremely comfortable with lounge chairs coffee table desk luxurious king size bed and separate dressing room The large modern bathroom had plenty of storage a separate bath and an enormous rain shower Bulgari ammenities were replaced daily and the towels were large and fluffy Complimentary bottled water was appreciated The bar exudes a warm inviting ambience and is situated in a library boasting over 4 000 books signed by the author all of whom have been guests in the hotel We enjoyed a wonderful evening repast in the bistro one of the best meals of our trip with an outstanding balance of flavours with textures Wifi is fast and reliable Breakfast at an extra charge was excellent We would certainly stay in this hotel on a return trip to Amsterdam 
340764,Ambassade Hotel, There was nothing I did not like it was just expensive for what we got I accept it was a very central hotel in a capital city but sorry I just expected a little more Everything worked it was clean the staff were great really nothing could really be faulted it was just a lot of cash , Location Location Location

340772,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, I must say I ve stayed in several hotels of different styles and stars around the world and this is one of the best hoteles I ve ever stayed at not only the rooms must say that one thing I always notice is the quality of the bathroom towels nothing worst than getting dry with a rough towel in this case they felt like cotton location grab breakfast at Spingel 404 if you can great breakfast but above all THE SERVICE is absolutely fantastic they go far and beyond any request from early checkin late checkout 2am room service bike rentals etc Oh plus they left us a box of chocolates in the room and they were outstanding Absolutely recommended 
340773,Ambassade Hotel, I honestly can t think of anything bad to say about the Ambassade , The staff were extremely attentive the room was very comfortable and oh the bathroom

340775,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The room was really spacious It was separated into two levels bedroom living area and desk bathroom area which gave it more of a homey feel WiFi worked really well It was also easy to find a restaurant that wasn t too touristy or expensive and a lot of cafes nearby that were also delicious 
340776,Ambassade Hotel, That we had to leave , The Ambassade is on a quiet street that s not busy along a canal The location is great and in a safe area that has very nice shopping The bar lounge is a pleasant place to relax and grab a drink The staff is exceptional and the float spa was a nice surprise 
340777,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing all good, Situated alongside a canal of which our deluxe double room overlooked The room and bathroom was very well appointed and the huge bed was very comfortable The hotel has an interesting collection of modern paintings and sculptures throughout and a fascinating library lounge bar Excellent breakfast choice and evening dinner menu Fantastic staff eager to help in every way to enhance the overall experience of staying there Made brilliant suggestions for local restaurants if wanting to eat out and made reservations booked tickets for canal boat trips excursions and places of interest It is an easy walk to the city centre Good value for money Would most definitely stay there again

340781,Ambassade Hotel, A welcome pack containing milk sugar bread coffee etc Although fruit and bottled water are provided , Big Spacious rooms Very comfortable beds Gorgeuous breakfast in the Brasserie A very pleasant setting Top quality throughout 
340782,Ambassade Hotel, When we checked in the hotel staff invited us to breakfast My presumption totally my fault is that the breakfast was included with the hotel bill Not We were charged 19 50 Euro per person for the breakfast That in my opinion is pricey for some yogurt fruit and a cup of coffee There are MANY wonderful cafes close to the hotel The value in those would have been far better , The beds are VERY comfortable and the cover is a down comforter Very cozy The cleaning staff takes excellent care of the hotel and the rooms It would help if the hotel staff explained or provided instructions on how to use the shower It is different from the ones used in America which is great but I had trouble figuring it out The location is perfect close enough to walk to many of the sites in the area Anne Frank House Rijksmuseum NEMO Museum Amsterdam Centraal Van Gogh Museum and many many wonderful cafes 
340783,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, OMG we love this hotel I think it s the 2nd best hotel we ve stayed during our 3 weeks around Europe This is a 4 stars hotel BUT deserve the 5 stars rating The room we ve got was amazingly unique an attic room top floor so unusual so cozy with a view of the canal itself I traveled w my Mom sister and she has her own small room separate from our bed area The reception staff will help you to find a perfect tour packages for you And they are very helpful friendly too Outside the hotel is a beautiful street a typical street in Amsterdam Very safe and it s not at a crowded dodgy area Lots of quaint small restaurants shops Tips use Uber if you need to go anywhere if you don t want to walk LOVE THIS HOTEL Will definitely come back if we go to Amsterdam again

340785,Ambassade Hotel, No complaints just , This is a beautiful boutique hotel situated within walking distance to everything but not in a particularly noisy busy area The staff is phenomenal very kind patient and helpful The two gentlemen at the front desk assisted us in parking our car and bringing our bags to the room The bar library area is so cozy and the bartender was extremely friendly Our room was beautifully decorated with opulent fabrics and we loved the high ceilings and chandelier The bathroom modern and clean with heated floors We ate one of our dinners at the restaurant and the food was excellent Overall though the hotel was a bit of a splurge for us you certainly get what you pay for and we had no complaints Thank you Vout William Mark and the rest of the staff for your hospitality and great customer service 
340786,Ambassade Hotel, When I booked this hotel they were very quick to take my money and whoever I spoke to had told me the price I was paying for 3 nights included breakfast When we arrived they told me I had payed only for the stay I think that was not fair , We loved the room the staff were great 
340787,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was amazing as we visited while it was still chilly outside The best thing really is location quiet but still central Perfect for our weekend away to Amsterdam

340792,Ambassade Hotel, Our room was on the first floor facing the canal which would have been nice if street noise was not an issue , Room was nice and spacious and the staff was very accommodating Location was very central and walking distance to almost everything in Amsterdam 
340793,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Food was very fresh and quantity products Room nicely decorated Bed linen and towels also of high quality What I liked most was the attention to details 
340794,Ambassade Hotel, Unfortunately the windows are not double glazed apparently they can t be as it s a historic building So if you re unlucky and get a 1st floor room you d be woken up by the street noise outside your window So bring ear plugs , Everything the building the decor rooms the view are all beautiful The restaurant is gorgeous and food good But most impressive is how well the place is managed I was particularly impressed at how responsive the staff was to any queries even before I confirmed my reservation Bravo

340798,Ambassade Hotel, the room was too hot the first day but we fixed it and I also didn t like that for the price of the hotel it should have a little gym, the view of the canal the hotel the room was nice and location and I also forgot a picture in the hotel and they were really kind to send it to my country without any charges Service is really good 
340799,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Staff were excellent friendly and very helpful with any requests Upgraded free of charge to an apartment Perfect location as well would certainly go back again 
340800,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Superb bed Hard to get out of The library bar is a great retreat with the first editions signed by their author s being a great talking point This is a superb location on the edge of the quiet nine streets area which is great for boutique shopping but within easy walking distance to both the museum quarter and the city centre

340803,Ambassade Hotel, Drainage from the shower it leaked behind the toilet area, the hotel was very comfortable and in an excellent position for walking about or using public transport
340804,Ambassade Hotel, However for the price it might useful to know that the hotel does not have a gym or a swimming pool and the highly rated next door Koan floatarium also requires advance booking and you do get a discount if you come from the Ambassade hotel , The room was luxurious and had a beautiful view over the canal It was the ideal romantic venue the service and staff were impeccably professional The hotel restaurant is one of the best in Amsterdam It requires advance booking as it is very much in demand and the food and service were absolutely delightful and oh the bar serves amazing cocktails

340807,Ambassade Hotel, There wasn t much to dislike about the property If I had to nitpick the room could have been slightly larger but then again you can reserve a bigger room at the hotel , The location of the hotel was great as it was easy to walk to many of the different sights and neighborhoods across Amsterdam The area was architecturally beautiful and quiet I did like the canal view that we had The rainfall shower head heated floors and towel rack were pleasant treats The staff was very helpful and friendly I had a couple cappuccinos from the bar in library which was really unique and a great place to relax or mingle

340811,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, One big bed instead of two put together One large cover instead of two smaller ones Heated bathroom floor and great ventilation in the room Friendly helpful staff and a prime location Our favorite hotel in Amsterdam we have stayed three times in the past year 
340812,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, An extraordinarily characterful and unique hotel embedded in historic Amsterdam ten canal houses connected together and highly luxurious with very attentive charming and genuinely concerned staff quite different to a posh chain hotel and one didn t need to keep signing off orders all the time in case one tried to run off without paying 
340813,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel Furnishings were lovely and place looked immaculate Our room was very compact Not much space and tiny staircase But that was our experience generally in Amsterdam Europe so we weren t bothered 
340814,Ambassade Hotel, There are no downsides to this property , Our room was a fabulous 2 storey suite overlooking a beautiful canal Bed is extremely comfortable and shower is fabulous Staff go out of their way to be helpful Breakfast buffet is delicious 
340815,Ambassade Hotel, If you stay in a room overlooking the hotel bring earplugs as there can be noise from the street , The staff was so nice We had a problem with the heater and the maintenance person came at 11PM and was so gracious They were able to fix it right away The staff was so helpful and always did everything with a smile Highly recommend this hotel Loved the location on the canal and in walking distance to everything 
340816,Ambassade Hotel, The mattress on the bed was a little lumpy but as the bed was really big it didn t really matter for me , This is an excellent hotel in just about every way Service is great and the hotel is really stylish The room was a good size and the bathroom excellent There is a really nice small bar and lovely lounge with books 
340817,Ambassade Hotel, Honestly nothing , Very happy I chose hotel ambassade for my trip to Amsterdam Very friendly welcome My room was below street level and it was perfect Plenty of room Massive bed which was very comfy nice modern feel to the bathroom which again was a good size Room was cleaned spotlessly everyday Two free bottles of water which was replaced each day Overall excellent hotel And I will definitely return when I m back in Amsterdam

340820,Ambassade Hotel, The heating system was a little noisy at night and there was no tea towel to dry the odd plate or cup But who cares the place is wonderful , We had the apartment Spacious stylish well located with a quiet bedroom to the rear Great to be able to come and go quietly and to shop for food and eat privately And what a fabulous shower 
340821,Ambassade Hotel, The windows are not all all soundproof, The staff were extremely accommodating and pleasant We were conveniently located within easy walking distance of all attractions
340822,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing I did not like Potential guests should be aware of small hallways and multiple steps in case special access is a concern , Loved the location easy to get to everything Loved the ambience loved the decor and art 
340823,Ambassade Hotel, I didn t like the carpet floors in the holes on the second floor Other than that we were fine with the furnishings We already knew this wasn t a minimalist on modern hotel and that s fine , The hotel was located on a beautiful canal It was a classic with a real tradition and beautiful lobby with books signed by authors If you re looking for a swanky hipster place this is not it But if you want to very special hotel with soul and a beautiful setting choose hotel Ambassade Also I have to say the staff was very professional I had read some reviews before coming and was half expecting not to like the place Quite the contrary We loved it 
340824,Ambassade Hotel, A couple of staff were new and don t know where our room was but nevertheless they were friendly so no problem , We really loved the friendly service and gin and tonics in the bar We ate at the restaurant one night and it was very special Our room had a balcony overlooking the canal truly beautiful 
340825,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, I loved this hotel The staff were helpful and kind The rooms were beautiful and clean and cozy The location is terrific you can walk everywhere but it is quiet and tranquil Also right around the corner are great places to eat I thought that this was the best possible value for my money that I could have had It is one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I have ever had 
340826,Ambassade Hotel, it s a little expensive when you compare with the same standard it s amsterdam city center , location staff and the rooms are really beautiful and confortable
340827,Ambassade Hotel, Nil , Nice and comfy room Canal view is worth the money Nice bedding and spacious Great and helpful staff Very pretty library Lone traveller felt safe and welcomed Perfect location easy access to major tourist spots and dinner places Quiet with elevator 
340828,Ambassade Hotel, I suppose it would be nice to have a library with books one can read in addition to the wonderful and huge library of signed books by authors who have stayed here The are under glass and although of course one can ask to see them they re not really for reading and spilling drinks on let alone taking up to one s room But maybe everyone has kindles nowadays and people don t have any paperbacks to leave to contribute to a hotel library , Beautiful rooms comfortable beds and most of all adjustable heating In the form of a normal radiator that can be turned up or down instead of the usual thermostat that never works Superb breakfasts with proper buttery croissants fresh orange juice and real coffee The hotel has not been at all spoilt or lost any of its charm or cosiness by its extensive renovation just made even more comfortable The bar is a welcome addition As is the underfloor heating in the bathrooms The staff are lovely kind and helpful as always and the guest umbrellas are still there I would never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam 
340829,Ambassade Hotel, Hotel is situated in several canal houses some accessible via street and steps it may be less comfortable in rain and with heavy suitcase we did not mind other guests can , Cosy and comfortable in the heart of the city Although in the centre it is very quiet Bed and pillows guarantee relaxing sleep The most pleasant and helpful staff Delicious breakfast suitable for a diet see nuts and seeds counter photo We loved the reading corners 
340830,Ambassade Hotel, room towards the canal was noisy as the windows are only single glazed and you can hear people out on the road talking and shouting at night, Very friendly staff great location lovely library bar all understated rather than grand 
340831,Ambassade Hotel, I cant think of a single thing apart from if pushed when we stayed at 4 hotel on Lanzarote we were offered a glass of fizzy wine upon arrival , The staff were very welcoming and helpful The Hotel and our room was decorated and furnished to a high standard The extra attention to detail was lovely including the toiletries and things available in the room The Library bar is gorgeous and well stocked A wonderful place to stay

340833,Ambassade Hotel, The choice of hot food on the breakfast menu was a little limited , The staff were very friendly and welcoming We found them extremely helpful too for example in providing us with electrical adapters we d forgotten to pack and also in booking tables at restaurants 
340834,Ambassade Hotel, There weren t facilities for making hot drinks in the room but Reception quickly sent up a kettle etc when we requested it , The room was beautiful and had a view over the canal The staff were really friendly Perfect location for exploring Amsterdam 
340835,Ambassade Hotel, Absolutely nothing , Everything was amazing The staff and service was impeccable The location was perfect and the facilities were clean and updated We couldn t ask for a better place to stay 
340836,Ambassade Hotel, The only drawback was the maid service that was somewhat lacking For a nice hotel the maids were casual in their maintenance and it showed However the front desk staff was so wonderful that we didn t complain about the lackadaisical approach of the maidens , Staff could not have been more helpful Lovely people and so Weil long to help us navigate Amsterdam The location was superb and the hotel was lovely given that it is constructed out of ten old canal houses We were quite happy and would stay there again without a doubt 
340837,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing much Just a bit of stairs to go up and down if you have heavy suite case watch out , Location was the best Trustable staff and they trust you too 
340838,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Loved this hotel in a quiet neighborhood overlooking a canal Walking distance to everything Wonderful helpful staff Beautiful large room with huge bathroom and great amenities Our room overlooked the canal Beautiful

340840,Ambassade Hotel, if I were physically compromised the rabbit warren aspect of the hallways and stairs might be a challenge , The staff is very well trained and this ideal location is very quiet I enjoy the art and book collections This restaurant s renovated space and new menus have been well received Still my favorite hotel in Amsterdam 
340841,Ambassade Hotel, The breakfast could be in the price of the room that wasn t cheap , Really great receptionists Good matress old style room Good location on the one of the nicest ring canals everything very clean
340842,Ambassade Hotel, nothingone, charmong hotel in central location staff very friendly and helpful Room turned out to be a suite with sitting room and loft with large bedroom and bath over looking canal absolutely perfect

340844,Ambassade Hotel, The room could ve been a bit bigger but all the rooms are individual with character so that s understandable, Comfy bed great view from room and an even better location
340845,Ambassade Hotel, Our suite was 2 stories and the circular stairs were narrow a little challenging to navigate but we managed It was truly a wonderful hotel , Staff were extremely attentive provided wonderful service and were very friendly Excellent selection and quality of food offered with the breakfast buffet Great experience 
340846,Ambassade Hotel, toiletteries lack of a sample of tooth paste and of products impossible to carry on board an airplane Bed a little too soft for my taste Like the Library remodeling but feel the breakfast room has lost in character , Location location location Warmth and efficiency of staff Size of room and view Availability of two computers on the ground floor 
340847,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing all good , Perfect location for all the sights Very friendly helpful staff All requests met with a smile We stayed in the main property with a view of the canal There was some road noise but otherwise a quiet location Some of the rooms are accessed from the road but not a problem Lovely bar area 
340848,Ambassade Hotel, when I asked if the staff could order me a taxi for my early morning journey to the airport I was told that it could be done on the morning you advertise that there is a 40 euro service but the taxi charged us more ,No Positive
340849,Ambassade Hotel, Although the food was brilliant I did miss a full English breakfast at the start of the day , The staff were the most professional and friendly I have ever met In the restaurant they were welcoming without being over intrusive and nothing was too much trouble In reception they shared a wealth of relevant local information which helped us enormously 
340850,Ambassade Hotel, Breakfast should be included in the not inexpensive room charge, A perfect place for experiencing Canal life in A dam The art collection alone is worth the visit 
340851,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The location of this hotel is perfect you can walk everywhere easily and is in a nice laid back neighbourhood The brasserie is well worth a visit the food is amazing and if you are lucky you can get a table looking out over the canal the brasserie staff were wonderful We also hit the bar where the barman makes cocktails to perfection 
340852,Ambassade Hotel, Breakfast buffet service very friendly and helpful but the price is way too high for the quality and content of the buffet Other reviews had similar comments we hoped they were just very picky customers sadly we agree , Had read that reception not very friendly however we found everyone there very helpful and friendly no matter what time For example we arrived after midnight due to a delayed flight and it was no problem We had a fabulous room bed extremely comfortable room was quiet as requested and staff always discreet ie no room cleaners banging along the hallways or in neighboring rooms I had noted that it was my husband s birthday when booking the room and we were greeted with lovely fresh flowers and chocolates in the room Loved ending the evening in the library bar the bartender was willing to make us something even if we were there almost at closing The art everywhere in the hotel is just fabulous Location unbeatable 
340853,Ambassade Hotel, Very few negatives Beds very spongy for me and you need to accept it s small and quirky tight staircases etc as it an old converted river house , Great location lovely helpful staff 
340854,Ambassade Hotel, Not much, Customer service excellent Elegant styling and street side location of the bar and sitting area all added the vibrancy of the location Bedroom windows opened above the canal Immediate access to central Amsterdam activities Take care the stairs to some rooms are very steep 
340855,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The Ambassade Hotel is located in one of the loveliest parts of the city the 17th century canal ring It s central to all the sights The lobby is welcoming rooms are rxquisite and staff extremely helpful 
340856,Ambassade Hotel, Breakfast was a little limited we had assumed it was a hot buffett but it was cold with eggs bacon sausage in order , Overall a great stay helpful staff and nice room which was basically a private apartment very quirky Hotel was very centrally located in the 9 streets district 
340857,Ambassade Hotel, This is a very nice hotel with that dinning at the restaurant was a bit over the top for our casual taste So as you can see there s not much to dislike , Our room was a few doors down from the main hotel which turned out to be great It was away from all the coming and goings A short walk to some great cheese shops bars and cafes The Anne Frank house is less then 5 minutes walk By AF tickets in advance or stand in line We managed to get in just before closing after a 15 minute wait Perfect location as no one in their right mind would ever think about driving a car in the old part of Amsterdam You walk take the tram or learn how to ride a bike Amsterdam style 
340858,Ambassade Hotel, A C could have been better but to be fair there was a heat wave, Great mix of old and new Guild houses on the canal opulence Cobra movement and other post WWII art throughout the premises a nice addition 
340859,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing really , The location in the centre of Amsterdam made it ideal for a leisurely walk along the canals in search of a good restaurant for a quiet dinner 
340860,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, At the beginning there were a problem to check in earlier but its ok we decided to walk around center of Amsterdam And at 13 30 our room were ready Location is very good We always stay at this hotel and we are always happy to stay there Stuff is very good help all the time Tesla taxi for 44 to airport is better than to come from airport

340863,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing , It was a beautiful boutique hotel right on the canal Our window overlooked the canal and we were able to sit in our room and enjoy the activity on the water 
340864,Ambassade Hotel, The staff were very friendly and tried hard to be helpful but it turned out some of their advice was a little inaccurate , The hotel is in a lovely spot on one of the prettiest canals It has a very welcoming bar area 
340865,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent and quiet The room was good sized for Europe The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was great Lastly the personal service was the best Highly recommended 
340866,Ambassade Hotel, Our Dinner in the Brasserie Ambassade did not live up to expectations Food ok but not exceptional and not good value for money, The staff were excellent Very friendly and helpful in all areas
340867,Ambassade Hotel, No irons and ironing boards available Prepare to look wrinkled , Sumptuous bed full length soaking tub Charming neighborhood in walking distance to popular sites 
340868,Ambassade Hotel, First night room on the fourth floor had winding stairs , There was personal touch in all the staff s work The front desk staff was very helpful Breakfast was excellent 
340869,Ambassade Hotel, Nithing, The room was very comfortable with a good view of canal Staff were very helpful We booked a meal in the restaurant due to our incorrectly turning our watches back instead of forward we were very late but they still fit us in 
340870,Ambassade Hotel, We stayed in one of the former row houses The first floor had a sitting area and the bathroom which was modern The second floor was a large bedroom area The problem was the stairs to the bedroom were small spiral stairs The bellman had to take our luggage up the stairs There was no way that I could If you have physical limitations make sure your room is the main hotel which has a lift , The location was very convenient for site seeing 
340871,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Great room very friendly staff and it is located directl in the Center of Amsterdam Perfect stay even if it is not cheap we have enjoyed the stay very much 
340872,Ambassade Hotel, The selection of granolas cereals and nuts at breakfast was very good however we would have appreciated a little more fresh fruit , The rooms were very nice and in a very good condition The selection of granolas cereals and nuts at breakfast was very good however we would have appreciated a little more fresh fruit The staff was remarkably helpful and nice always in a good mood and eager to assist us We travelled with both young and older children and in comparison to other places we ve been to Ambassade really is a place of its own 
340873,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing really Except there could have been towelling robes provided , The view of the best canal in Amsterdam from my bedroom window The unique nature of the hotel housed in 8 tall and narrow Dutch style properties 
340874,Ambassade Hotel, First promised check in at noon but didn t get in until after 3 p m Would have planned day differently had we known , Perfect location Suite worth the extra money Staff friendly and innovative with help organizing our stay everything from a purse museum to disc golf Albert at the hotel bar is a gem 
340875,Ambassade Hotel, Room while nice and with own private entrance on the canal was a basement souterrain As a result the room was dark and people on the street were walking directly past our window could almost touch them we needed to keep windows and curtains closed for privacy Then needed to have the airconditioning on , excellent location private entry to our room just for ourselves directly on the canals Comfortable bed Very friendly staff 
340876,Ambassade Hotel, Our room was beautiful well appointed and spacious and quiet on the high floor we requested but at the end of the day climbing a circular staircase to reach the tower was sometimes daunting Do some research on your own for restaurants There are wonderful choices from grand hotel dining rooms to casual fun happening dining experiences The front desk disappointing here and recommends very commercial and forgettable restaurants , The location is excellent On a quiet but grand canal street In the nine streets the trendiest shopping cafe and restaurant area The scenery is gorgeous the hotel staff are accommodating A perfect hotel to use as a basis to walk Amsterdam a modern city with loads of old world charm Room service breakfast was a delight We had dinner at the restaurant and were very pleased 
340877,Ambassade Hotel, The hotel is split over several buildings and we were away from the main building The hotel was too expensive given we could not easily use the main facilities, The location was good on a canal but 2 3 blocks away form the crush of tourists
340878,Ambassade Hotel, Mini bar prices for snacks were outrageous 3 for a packet of crisps or peanuts No coffee or tea facilities in the room , The food was good the staff friendly and helpful without being overbearing The standard of cleanliness was outstanding 
340879,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, We stayed in the Ambassade for three nights The location is outstanding on one of the prettiest parts of the inner canals with a short walk to the museums shopping district or markets The quality of service was exceptional reception room and restaurant nothing was too much effort and all their recommendations were good The breakfast was extra not cheap but really great Our room was clean comfortable and with a really nice bathroom I would fully recommend this hotel

340882,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The location is excellent Having a channel view room was great Dont miss having breakfast it is delicious and the people serving and cooking the best We had a great stay 
340883,Ambassade Hotel, Bathroom in number 67 2nd room was very small First room was tiny and not worth the money we paid Could not even fit our suitcases in the room, Location decor staff and second room location The staff in the restaurant was also excellent
340884,Ambassade Hotel, I would have liked a room with a view for the money , Wonderful location Superb and friendly helpful staff beautiful and comfortable room Generous and very new bathroom 
340885,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing Nothing at all needs improvement in the slightest The Ambassade Hotel in Amsterdam City Center on the canals is a dreamy romantic unique and so memorable experience Nothing I saw could be improved upon AAAA rating from me , The staff unintrusive but on top of everything We had some travel money ATM card malfunction and no cash for a couple of days and they went out of their way to help us The location our room over looked the canal we had a hard time working up the desire to get out and see the sights Just sitting looking out the big beautiful windows at the life going on in the streets was magical If we wanted a bike it s was there immediately Anything we wanted or needed was attended to immediately quickly and then out of our space so we could enjoy a romantic personal time as newlyweds The Brasserie Restaurant was excellent We ate a only one or two other restaurants It was just too too good Grade A 
340886,Ambassade Hotel, Breakfast was all right although I would have expected something better limited selection overcooked and rubbery eggs I stayed just a couple nights before at the Hotel Estherea 2 minutes walk away which was cheaper and had a much better breakfast , This is a very nice hotel with extremely attentive and helpful staff very comfortable beds and extremely well located in the heart of Amsterdam My room had a nice view of the canal which was very pleasant although I could hear traffic quite distinctively and suspect it might be a bit loud in the week ends if staying there over the week end I would ask for a room with a garden view instead I would definitely stay there again 
340887,Ambassade Hotel, Room was a little small for two people , View of the Herengracht is always wonderful The friendliness of front desk staff is without comparison always the best 
340888,Ambassade Hotel, As with many European breakfasts its pretty sparse I would have expected much better at such a nice restaurant and hotel The service at breakfast was also poor Which is odd because the service at dinner was great Charged me 6 euro to use their crappy bike for an hour For the price and bike quality it should be free , The hotel was beautiful room very nice Staff was really professional and helpful Comfortable bed Location was outstanding with easy access to shops and restaurants Sits right on the canal Wifi was really good throughout the hotel 
340889,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Aesthetics comfortable bed and room personal touches delicious breakfast very helpful and friendly staff I could not have wished for better in any respect 
340890,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing , A really comfortable hotel with great rooms overlooking the canal if that s what you re looking for and comfy beds The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful without being too full on 
340891,Ambassade Hotel, This hotel has no facilities for a hairdresser or a gym but if you know that when you book the hotel ambiance may compensate for that It depends on what you need during a particular stay , The beds were extra comfortable The breakfast was delicious Loved the flower arrangements 
340892,Ambassade Hotel, Breakfast was just okay if you are in a rush it works But I would suggest exploring the area around the hotel , The rooms were spacious had wonderful views on the canal side totally worth the expense We loved the staff they were so helpful The location was great as well 
340893,Ambassade Hotel, Disappointingly dull breakfasts by Dutch standards Also layout of breakfast rooms very awkward too much walking back and forth between table and buffet Why not have the buffet by the middle windows at the front Breakfast staff seemed to be hurrying us and started clearing the buffet earlier than stated in the hotel literature , Room 47 and the view on the tranquil tree lined canal from the window lots of birdsong in May The reading rooms downstairs the library and bar The warm welcome on arrival all the front desk staff were exceptional Good sized and well appointed bathroom for two Overall a superbly well run quiet and relaxing hotel created from 17th century houses and only five minutes from the buzz and the trams 
340894,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location able to walk everywhere The art on the walls was in extremely good taste and very interesting The decor was lovely and the high ceilings in our room added to the elegance of the room Now having stayed in this hotel we wouldn t stay anywhere else in Amsterdam The staff of course makes a difference and all of them were helpful 
340895,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Best location in historical Amsterdam Grachtengordel The hotel comprises 10 different buildings all historical monuments and UN world heritage Don t mind steep stairs if you book a room on upper level Absolutely impressive how nice and professionally renovated with partially historical furniture This could easily be 5 level Don t miss to dine in the Brasserie a must e g try the 3 course surprise menu 37 This is for sure one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam The master in the kitchen is a genius 
340896,Ambassade Hotel, Unfortunately the hotel is full of stares and complicated isles Breakfast was poor for a 4 stars hotel AC very weak Check in time is very late 2 00 pm I asked for a special arrangement as I was visiting to celebrate my anniversary but unfortunately there was nothing arranged Price is quite expensive , Staff was very polite Location is in a place where you are close to everything Room had a high sealing which is really amazing
340897,Ambassade Hotel, I liked everything about this hotel , This is a cozy beautiful hotel in the old part of Amsterdam in the middle of everything Highly recommended for romantic weekend or any leisure time in Amsterdam The service and food are up to the highest standard The room with the channel view is awesome 
340898,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing at all , The room was quite big and luxurious There was ample of space in the room despite having 2 comfortable chairs and a coffee table The bathroom was also big with a separate shower and bath tub All in all if one can then they should definitely stay here as both the location and property are awesome 
340899,Ambassade Hotel, We had a problem with the comfort of the bed but this was resolved as soon as we raised the problem , Our room was gorgeous looking out over the canal The staff were pleasant and very helpful 
340900,Ambassade Hotel, When I went to check out there were 2 members of staff trying to deal with lots of Americans with lots of questions Took about 25 30 mins to get to the desk Perhaps have a method where check out can be simpler , Really good hotel Right in the centre very high standards pleasant staff excellent breakfast 
340901,Ambassade Hotel, Leaving nothing to negatively comment on, Bed super comfortable room quite large bathroom exemplary Breakfast very good Location excellent quiet but very close to all the sights 
340902,Ambassade Hotel, Towels a little bit old and hard Lack of tea and coffee facilities Inability to book canal view table for celebratory meal , The hotel exudes quirkiness and has a fabulous eclectic mix of art furnishings and literature The Library bar is a fascinating place to sit and have a fantastic cocktail made by Albert the talented mixologist who creates cocktails to suit your mood The Breakfast room transforms into an atmospheric restaurant in the evening offering good and innovative dishes The staff are all attentive and professional The canal view bedroom was comfortable relaxing and quiet A truly enjoyable experience 
340903,Ambassade Hotel, The bed the mattress was poor and it had a big dent in it meaning you would roll to the middle This should be replaced urgently , The location was great and the staff very helpful 
340904,Ambassade Hotel, Free breakfast , Location World class art collection throughout the hotel All of the public rooms are bright and comfortable a place in which to relax Best meal in Amsterdam at Brasserie Ambassade 
340905,Ambassade Hotel, Not a major issue but tea coffee making facility in the room would have topped it off , A hotel in a good location with excellent staff who could not have been more helpful Room was very comfortable with an excellent comfy bed Complementary water sweets and fruit each day in the room 
340906,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location on one of Amsterdam s magical canals exceptionally friendly and helpful staff great food a very comfortable bed what more could one want 
340907,Ambassade Hotel, Builders starting at 07 30 in apartment above us Terrible drain smell in the shower room initially Agreed to go to the apartment but regret agreeing to this as it spoilt the whole trip Did not get any of the benefits of the hotel , Bed was comfortable 
340908,Ambassade Hotel, The bedding pillows and linen could have been just a bit more luxuriant to complete the whole setting , Oh just a beautiful place along the most elegant canal of the city

340911,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The Ambassade s location on Herengracht is superb and the hotel s collection of canal houses makes an unobtrusive impact of Golden Age luxury The room service breakfast is a real treat with a champagne option for special occasions The more expensive canal facing rooms are worth every cent while the Brasserie is a very pleasant addition to the hotel s impressive range of services 
340912,Ambassade Hotel, We were in a superior canal facing duplex room with our own entrance Almost like having your own flat Only niggle was that bed area up stairs gets quite hot and is difficult to cool down This is made worse by steam from the bathroom They should install a fan in the bathroom Not a big issue but takes away from a perfect score In all other respects this is a great hotel, Amazing location Great service Loved the library Great breakfast
340913,Ambassade Hotel, Maybe a little pricey but worth it for a special treat , Location was excellent hotel was spotlessly clean with a great atmosphere created by the interesting art and great little bar serving the best bloody Mary I ve had

340917,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing I didn t like , Artful surroundings The Cobra Group art on the walls and the thousands of books in the Library Bar create a luxurious yet homey inviting environment Friendly informative staff Tickets to museums are available at the desk buy them here to save hours of waiting outside in long lines Contemporary restaurant with Great breakfasts good dinners Bathtub Canal view 
340918,Ambassade Hotel, The management and staff work hard to ensure that guests do not experience any negatives , Could not fault this stunningly beautiful hotel renovated to a very high standard with all modern amenities All the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home The location on a quiet canal was central for everywhere A special place and top class brasserie if you want a romantic dinner in after a tiring day sightseeing 
340919,Ambassade Hotel, Warning this hotel is created from authentic canalside houses The stairs are therefore steep and narrow But that s part of the charm and lifts serve most rooms , I stayed here for a two night weekend break with my brother and his wife The hotel is an original ten waterside houses converted brilliantly into a really lovely hotel Easy walking distance to main attractions The staff were perfect assisting me before my visit with an external restaurant booking for one of our nights The hotel bar is relaxing and surrounded by the hotel s own library Food and service in the restaurant very good

340925,Ambassade Hotel, I was asked to wait even beyond check in time because the only room available was a suite The staff wanted me to pay an additional 50 euro which I refused telling her that I have a confirmed reservation for a standard room I complained to the manager who upgraded me to the suite at no extra cost , The location was excellent The room was spacious and comfortable 
340926,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, The service was excellent all staff were very helpful We received a discount on the first night for a room we stayed in didn t have a very good view but the next night we were moved to a bigger room with a great view we loved our stay and will hopefully be returning soon

340928,Ambassade Hotel, The food menu in the room gave two options A room service menu and B non room service menu I fancied something from the non room service menu so went to reception to ask for directions to the dining room I was guided to the restaurant and seated but the menu was different again I explained what I d wanted and the waitress said she d ask the chef if on this occasion he d allow me to have my food selection in the restaurant He did but this made me feel inadequate cheap Food was nice if not a little embarrassing to obtain This isn t the right place for you if all you want is good pub grub Its more for the fine dining experience , The shower was very powerful hot hot hot Just what you need after walking the streets of Amsterdam in Feb 
340929,Ambassade Hotel, Once when we entered our room from breakfast the cleaner had just started his job He did not understand to postpone his work to give us a few minutes to collect our things Instead we had to wait that he finished his job and then we could use our few minutes to prepare for daily tourist attractions , Beautiful and fantastic traditional old building nicely renovated Charming and individualistic hotel with clean and large room with a view to the canals Friendly staff and good service

340932,Ambassade Hotel, room was not as beautiful as the ones in the pictures so I was a bit disappointed in the value for money , Location is great and staff are very helpful and friendly 
340933,Ambassade Hotel, No iron in room due to fire regulations although a laundry room by reception , Super view down the canal out of the three large bedroom windows Lovely room with great character walking down the corridors was like an modern art exhibition Staff very helpful 
340934,Ambassade Hotel, Difficult to find any fault A really well run hotel on top of its game Some visitors might find the external street access for some of the hotel s rooms unusual but this only added to the abundant charm of the property for our stay Anyone with mobility issues should mention this when booking as I believe that the hotel has a variety of rooms with different accessability , A great location for exploring Amsterdam Excellent informed and very helpful staff This boutique hotel is very well appointed and unique in its canal side configuration with great views over the Herengracht Easy walking access to all of Amsterdam s tourist attractions

340936,Ambassade Hotel, Large canal side suite was on 2 floors and rather crammed into the attic cheap carpet and very cramped shower and loo Bed was 2 singles as they could not fit a double upstairs We pushed together and they brought a topper but not comfy Approx 400 per night Not worth it , Staff very polite and friendly 
340937,Ambassade Hotel, No coffee maker in the room , The room was actually two stories with a sitting area below Quirky decor comfy mattress private entrance The staff was very attentive and friendly

340939,Ambassade Hotel, Noisy No acoustic insulation from outside noise old windows that also do not lock properly and inside flushing toilets from neighbours , Kind staff and great location

340947,Ambassade Hotel, Our room on the forth floor had constant strong smell from the kitchen we had to open the window all the time Bed was uncomfortable with very soft mattresses as if you are sleeping in a hammock , Location service staff

340949,Ambassade Hotel, From my particular room we had to go outside the building and back in to get to lobby and lounge My parents room was in the main building so they did not have this issue Had it not been raining the two days we were there this would not have been a problem , The location was great and the staff were all excellent The customer service was the best I ve had very welcoming and professional

340961,Ambassade Hotel, Nothing If I was really picky no make your own hot drinks in the room , The staff were friendly and helpful The d cors was luxurious Little touches which made the stay personal Felt like a stately home rather than a hotel Lots of little cosy places to sit on beautiful sofas or chairs Lots to look at 
340962,Ambassade Hotel, The mattress was a bit soft to our taste and we needed to remove a moulton made of synthetic material, The interior decoration is stylish and warm and this extends to the rooms We received a super upgrade to a truly fabulous suite We liked the bar with its reasonable prices and good service

340968,Ambassade Hotel,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel at the end of October and had a family room as we had our 15 year old daughter with us The hotel is in an excellent location on the Heren Gracht canal and is ideally placed for walking to all the attractions and has an abundance of local smart bars and cafes The hotel staff were very warm and welcoming from the minute we arrived We stayed in room 63 which was on the 3rd floor and had stunning views over the canal The room was a good size but obviously made smaller by the fact we had another bed in the room However it was well decorated and had a superb modern bathroom The room had a mini bar but sadly no coffee or tea making facilities in the room although the hotel does have 24 hour room service The free Wi Fi had excellent speed We can t recommend this hotel enough and would gladly stay again
