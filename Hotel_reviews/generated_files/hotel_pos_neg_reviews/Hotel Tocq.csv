469969,Hotel Tocq, Wifi was a bit weak and you would be logged out if your not using for a couple minutes , Location of the hotel is top Close to underground and public transit and if you prefer a cab the hotel will call and they always arrived in less than 5min The breakfast selection was amazing organic yogurt fresh honey direct from the bees nest even a juicer an many more standard breakfast options Clean rooms helpful and friendly staff made this an excellent stay 
469970,Hotel Tocq, The coffee machine in the room had no instructions so we made a mess Also only 1 coffee pod just a small thing but easy to remedy for other guests Only mentioning this because you asked it certainly didn t affect us enjoying our stay We will definitely stay at Hotel Tocq next trip to Milan which hopefully is very soon , Breakfast was perfect Fresh pastries wonderful choice of hot and cold foods superb coffee Location awesome the underground is right there and so easy to use Staff were super helpful Great choice of restaurants on the doorstep 
469971,Hotel Tocq,No Negative, It s a nice hotel in the centre of Milan Don t expect fancy interiors or exiting surroundings The hotel is very close 5 min walk to the Garibaldi train station so you can easily and quickly travel to Malpensa airport for only Eur13 It takes almost as much time as by taxi which costs more than Eur100 Only 15 20 min walk to the main tourist attractions and shopping streets The breakfast is better than average The street is a bit busy in the evening becase there are several night clubs nearby 
469972,Hotel Tocq, we had no water not the hotels fault due to road works in the morning however it could have been communicated by putting a note under each door rather than no information and quite a number of cross guests , Excellent location and very modern hotel
469973,Hotel Tocq,No Negative, We had a lovely time at Tocq hotel The staff was professional and supper friendly the breakfast was absolutely great and generous location was fantastic it is located next to hip corso como st and Garibaldi fs station direct train to Malpensa airport and to city metro 
469974,Hotel Tocq, Noise from the bar late at night The bar was overpriced No trashcan in the room The staff didn t follow up the breakfast very good It was almost always empty and we had to wait for refill , Very friendly and helpful staff 
469975,Hotel Tocq, The wifi reception in our room was poor We only got reception while standing at the doorway , A good location near railway stationGaribaldi in a new area Modern room with a mini bar Breakfast selection was excellent with hot and cold breakfast options 
469976,Hotel Tocq, I wish that they could have more perks for birthday customer, The location is very convenient It is a very convenient place that can access major sightseeing spots by walk It is quiet and safe place 
469977,Hotel Tocq, Our taxi driver found the hotel difficult to locate and first impression of the surrounding area was not good Otherwise nothing negative, The staff were extremely helpful and Marco looked after us very well at breakfast The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I have ever had The hotel oozes style and the whole experience was excellent It was in close proximity to the statin and the metro It was a 30 minute walk to the Duomo however it was a very good area to walk through The area felt very safe and it was very clean Top marks from us We will hopefully visit again
469978,Hotel Tocq,No Negative, We used as a stay before an early morning train It was chosen from location to station Staff were good they had a packed breakfast for our 0530 pick up as requested and recommended a good restaurant
469979,Hotel Tocq,No Negative, Main reason we stayed here was close proximity to train station as we trained in from Florence and were going out next morning to Barcelona by train Very handy to train and also pleasantly surprised by proximity to some good eating places and a few shops 
469980,Hotel Tocq, thought would be more central given the city centre description, The hotel is in the city centre in the financial district it seems there is a street full of restaurants and clubs but not disturbing noise at night our room was facing the other way and can take about 30 mins to get to the Dome i e Quite a big comfy bed towels changed every day bed not so well made one of the days 
469981,Hotel Tocq, The only problem we had was the bath sink that had to be unplugged Hope this problem was resolved , The location is excellent breakfast was excellent everything was excellent Very friendly staff City center in 30 minutes of walking Trains tram and metro in 2 minutes of walking from the hotel 
469982,Hotel Tocq, The entrance of the hotel at night can be a bit weird It s just in front of a night club and even thought I was there during work days I saw people drinking around the entrance every night Also even thought I emphasized that I wanted a quiet room I was given a room just in front of the elevator which is also near the room where the cleaners have the trolleys etc which made me have to sleep with ear plugs because of the noise I didn t asked for a change of room scared that I would get a lower floor and hear people on the street Also not ideal if you are on a business trip since there is only a very low tiny table to work so I had to work on the bed Lastly you had to introduce the details of the wifi every time you wanted to connect to it which made it very annoying when working All these things probably don t matter if you are going on a leisure trip for which I totally recommend it , The location of the hotel very handy since it s very close to the tube and the train station if you have to catch a train it s great Also the breakfast is really really good best part of my stay The staff is very helpful too super nice and attentive The rooms have a good size the best is very comfortable and the bathrooms are very big and clean Good choice of Tv channels too 
469983,Hotel Tocq, This is a lovely hotel but I did have a few issues during the stay Nothing major but something for the hotel to think about 1 The aircon is poor it was extremely hot on the first day of my stay but I just couldn t get the room to cool down and had to have a cold shower 2 On the second night I was kept awake until 4am due to loud music outside either from the bar or club downstairs 3 The wifi code was not easily accessible I had a busy schedule so didn t manage to ask reception for it until near the end of my stay I think it should be provided in the hotel room or given at check in without the guest having to ask for it , Lovely clean hotel good size rooms and delicious breakfast 
469984,Hotel Tocq, Beds are bad maybe it was just me but i found beds very uncomfortable , Hotel is great location all is in walking distance or max 4 stops with metro Metro station is just around the corner 1 min walk 1 2 from hotel you will find nice walking street with restaurants Breakfast is very good a lot of choices for all tastes and breakfast staff is super nice specially one little bold man sorry I forgot his name but so positive and nice person Hotel is very clean and quite at night no sounds from street at all 
469985,Hotel Tocq, They didn t have a kettle and tea in the room I asked at reception and they gave me a kettle which was nice but no tea With climate change and resource shortage it is outrageous that they wash all towels every day i stayed a week never left a used towel on floor which is usually the sign to have it washed and they washed 18 towels in that week crazy , Seriously the best breakfast I ever had and I travel a lot The lady with brown hair pony tail at breakfast was super staff Helpful friendly always keeping an eye out for everybody and everything
