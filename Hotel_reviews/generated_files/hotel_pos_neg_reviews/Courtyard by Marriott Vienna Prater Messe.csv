467827,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Didnt really have many good restaurants nearby but there is bakery just around the corner if you want a different breakfast from the hotel , Breakfast spread every morning was delicious with options to custom order eggs any way you want to Cafe machine produced some great cappuccino and cafe latte The rooms were standard size and big enough to put luggage and still have space to walk around The views from the room were not bad Room service was thorough with their cleaning and did a splendid job 
467828,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Parking fees 20 euro per day Wifi mentioned free But actually only 0 5 mb is free Above 0 5 mb to be paid Breakfast in hotel 20 euro Which is not worth it But many restaurants in stations, Located nearby Train Station Quite area Clean 
467829,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Nothing to reproach , Absolutely great stay Modern very nicely and tastfully decorated hotel spacious rooms everything looking great Wide selection at breakfast and everything really tasty I totally recommend great value for money I would expect higher price for this kind of standard in Vienna 10 minute walk from Prater and 1 minute walk from subway station 
467830,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Being upsold at check in to a larger room with breakfast included I didn t need the larger room nor could I have ever eaten enough to justify the premium charged I was jet lagged and easily manipulated I was made to feel like I was being done a favour when it was really a disservice Naked coed sauna was also a surprise , The gym was the reason I chose the hotel and it was well equipped Restaurant was lovely as were the staff

467832,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Twin beds were combined to create a single bed this caused the lamps on the headboard to be positioned awkwardly right in the middle of the bed had to be careful while getting in out of the bed, Excellent location Just 5 mins away from the Krieau subway station A 15 min subway ride takes you to the city center Vienna Opera Karlsplatz Airport shuttle bus stops right in front of the Krieau subway station easy commute to the airport Eur 8 per person and takes 25 mins Google maps doesn t pick up the subway system in Vienna To plan your sight seeing trips in Vienna just look for the closest subway station and use Google maps just for the final leg of the trip walking bit only 
467833,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Nothing, Good location 2 minutes walk to Krieu metro station make it easy to access to town center 24 Hours metro ticket would be benefit for travelling Surrounding was quiet and relaxing SPAR supermarket nearby Every things in room were of high standard Staff were nice and very helpful we were really appreciate the early check in

467839,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The reception told us that breakfast is until 12 but when we came 2 waiters have tolds us that on that day is just until 11 30 that we have to hurry up grab the food that we want because they will close everthing They repeated this message over and over again in a quite rude way So the Relaxing Moment of having breakfast was completly gone and plus this was a misunderstanding between reception and breakfast staff , The breakfast was really nice and on sunday is until 12 
467840,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, , The room was great big and clean The personnel was amazing the lady s from the reception started to speak in my language Romanian Th breakfast was great The location is excellent

467842,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe,No Negative, The property located in a very nice area with a lot of modern buildings and nice small pond nearby Also the subway station is in 2 minutes walk from the property The whole area near the hotel is so quiet and peaceful Good choice for people who wants to stay far from crowdy centre streets But it takes only 10 20 minutes by train to get to the city centre The staff was very friendly and careful The room was clean and modern Everything was great Hope to visit it more in future 
467843,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Taxi took me to the wrong Marriott Courtyard as it was not obvious on booking sheet that there were 3 other hotels in this group in city , Hotel was new and very clean and appealing 
467844,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Terrible soundproofing of the room You can hear all night the bathroom water from the neighbour rooms When somebody closed the door in the room next to us the entire wall and the bed moved We were very surprised to find this in a 4 star hotel , Nice hotel very clean and spacious rooms
467845,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, No bathtub but it s a very small issue hardly worth mentioning, Quiet very modern streamlined hotel Well trained helpful stuff decent good food Good place for inexpensive stop

467847,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Room had two problems 1 TV didn t work I contacted hotel staff they tried to fix it and by 9 pm they told me they couldn t fix it and offered a new room which is way too late at 9pm I wanted to just open the TV and sleep rather than repack and unpack They didn t even offer to compensate 2 The bathroom shower was leaking from the tube , Location was great bed was comfortable 
467848,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Breakfast should have been more affordable Toiletaires in the room need to be better quality, The Staff was very courteous and efficient the room was spacious and basic but clean The location is ideal next to a train station but not city centre

467852,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, 20 for parking by day for the circumstance that there is NO OTHER possibilty to parc the car even not for me as a leg handicapped person this is to be informed directly and clear before booking For me such surprises make me angry The hotel is quite far from the center so it is already nescessary to take much more time and cost to come and go There should be a free or very cheap parking for hotel guests , The room was very clean large enough and quiet Comfortable bed Perfekt located for visiting the MESSE WIEN
467853,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, They musn t have had occupants in our room for quite a while as there was dust on the bathroom countertops and the bathroom itself smelt of mildew disuse not very pleasant at all We did not bother with a room change request as we were only staying one night and had already unpacked There is nothing to do or eat in the local area so you have to plan around being in the main city hub for entertainment and food , The king size bed made for a good nights sleep Being on the 7th floor was nice as we had somewhat of a view The location isn t walkable to the main sights of Vienna but it is located 1min walk to a subway station and my partner and I made use of the city bike hire scheme to get around so that was fine 
467854,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Absolutely nothing to complain about , The location close to a station of the metro makes access to the city centre easy ALL personnel was professional smiling and very helpful

467857,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Breakfast could have been wider in range Taste is very fine very delicious but not too many to choose , We stayed in a deluxe room It was more than enough for our dog Pleasant surprise there were personnel who spoke Hungarian and Turkish so it was super easy to communicate Pet friendly Hotel I was there for Prater Run so the location is the best Also only 3 or 4 metro stops to go to the center 
467858,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Location is quite far away from city center but it has a subway station right around the corner, Staff is very friendly We checked in exactly on a Christmas Eve and have received very lovely Christmas present from receptionist Staff helped us to order some food delivery because the time we checked in hotel restaurant was closed already Room has a good space even in standard room 
467859,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Breakfast no fish offered for meat non eaters In the evening the variety of dishes for ordering to the room is very limited Shall not be like this in 4 , Excellent location especially for WU visitors Messe Wien visitors Metro in 1 min walk Fairly good breakfast Very nice staff Kettle and tea coffee set in the room it was exec room or smth like this Good wifi Area around is pleasant Prater park etc You can order food from restaurant till 10 pm 
467860,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Getting the right information from the front desk staff was not easy I called and inquired about how to get from the wein train station to the hotel and was told I could only get to the hotel via taxi which in fact was not the case Also getting a map of Vienna that was readable was non existent as the map I recieved was so hard to read it made my trip harder and more time consuming Very frustrating when you have only a few days to explore , Location to the train station was great The hotel was very clean and quiet 
467861,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, we booked a room with a double bed but instead we had a room with two single beds put together and thus the night lamps were right above our heads and not next to the beds Didn t bother us too much though , excellent hotel fabulous service staff great breakfast very clean excellent facilities very comfy beds close to the subway
467862,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Reception bar and lounge area all one big open space making it very loud and hard to hear when checking in Restaurant menu limited and not much else in the area but we found a Thai place across the street Fire alarm pulled one morning and it seemed the staff was confused about what to do , Quiet room Convenient to local metro stop to City Center Large breakfast buffet with gluten free bread and good coffee Nice hotel but more for business than leisure 
467863,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The staff is not so friendly at the front desk at breakfast they where really friendly Breakfast is okay but not a very big choice, The room was great quit nice view perfect connection to the city 
467864,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The breakfast although very good a bit too expensive per person , Impecable rooms warm spacious and well lighted Very close to the metro station which was conveniant since we took the metro often Breakfast food was delicious and plenty Parking space was a big plus especially since the cars were not outside but safely in the underground garage 
467865,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The room could have been a bit cleaner when we arrived the toilet seemed used and there was one towel with a stain on it, The gym was really well equipped Location of hotel right next to spar and a metro station so it was easy to access central Vienna The breakfast was really good
467866,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, I missed floor heating in bathroom, Nice big windows quite very comfortable bed good breakfast internet and parking for free and stuff was helpful and kind
467867,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Although I booked early they didn t had the room I asked for so I hade to upgrade for much more money to a bigger room My VISA card was preauthorized although by booking it was said it wont be Breakfast is not worth the 20 euros Parking is ridiculosly expensive too , The location is next to the U Bahn the staff is very friendly and polite 
467868,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Although I paid during check out the invoice the hotel did not unblock the guaranty amount they took on check in additional 50 of the value as a guaranty , friendly and helpful staff near to the subway

467875,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The only thing I didn t like in the hotel where otherwise everything has been perfect was the use of moquette in the room which reduces its impression of cleanliness Also the room cleaning gave the impression to be a little bit quick on some days or maybe I left the room too tidy and they thought there was not much left to do , Great location next to a metro station and a university campus in a recently developed area of the city The staff is extremely kind and the entire hotel is modern functional and bright The rooms are spacious The hotel facilities are also great and open almost the entire day 
467876,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, In general I am happy with my stay Two suggestions Service during the breakfast could be improved There was enough staff around but somehow nobody took enough care of removing dirty dishes from the tables after people had left Cleaning of the rooms especially the bathroom needs more attention too , The location is next to the subway some 20 minutes ride from the main attractions The staff is very friendly The gym is impressive having most of the equipment I use in my own sport school That s a much richer choice than the usual cross trainer and treadmill hotels tend to have in a gym Breakfast buffet is tasty and has enough choice

467883,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, They took a deposit by blocking the sum on the card but also we gave them the deposit and price for the room by cash so i would appreciate if they charged just once not twice Also i would appreciate as we were having room for two shampoo for each of us and also the shower gel , We asked for toothpastes and for a comb and we got them at the reception room was clean relatively big and new

467887,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The parking is expensive although the garage is very secured , Good facilities and decent rooms very good soundproofing Breakfast was nice Although it says paid WIFI there was a free option if you do not want a super fast one 
467888,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Breakfast is 20 euro which is very expensive On the last day the air conditioning didn t work properly because apparently the outside temperature the previous day was not high enough Would expect better from this hotel , Comfortable room with good quality bedding Location is very close to Ubahn station so it is quick and easy to get into central Vienna 
467889,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Breakfast items were very poorly maintained On my last breakfast there were no scrambled eggs and the container had obviously not been filled for some time as the edges were covered with dry and congealed egg The orange juice was awful not really juice The bacon was just dry and almost inedible I like crispy bacon but this was a step too far The many yoghurts were not labelled so you had no idea what you were eating Actually there were hardly any labels for the food , Very good shower

467892,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, I felt cold at night wish there was an additional blanket Location wise I wish there are more restaurants nearby I was surprised and disappointed that the European Marriott hotels do not give Gold members breakfast with the room , I really liked the hotel manager who helped straighten out some reservation problems I had with Booking com I liked my room the bed and the hot water boiler I liked the location for its proximity to a subway station 
467893,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Location was too far from city not good restaurants nearby Even hotel restaurant closed very early at night I asked for double bed but we got room with 2 separate beds, Nice hotel with all 4 star comforts close to metro station 
467894,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The breakfast is expensive so we chose to opt out of it , First of all the staff are fantastic and helped us with everything we needed They were friendly and polite throughout our stay The rooms are comfortable and clean with a good shower and bathroom The gym and sauna is great it was surprising to be so relaxed after a city break 
467895,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, Every thing was perfect for 4 stars hotel , Friendly profissional staff Excelent room the pillows could be with more options Excent location Excent parking
467896,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Prater Messe, The internet doesn t work on your phone in the room interesting why and you have to pay for hotel internet which very expensive 10 EUR per day great businees guys Assuming the hotel set up sensors which breaking internet connection on phone usually chineese hotels do it Breakfast is very poor no variety Room wasn t clean properly sometimes If you book hotel via booking com you cannot collect reward points and I got this information after second staying and the last but before I was informed it s possible The conditioning system isn t clean after staying I had allergy coughing and cold in the nose At winter time it s very cold in room I asked 2 times to fix it but my requests were ignored It s the last time when I stayed in this hotel Don t recommend to stay in this hotel as well , Gym is good
