11345,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We were there on Friday night came back to the hotel at about 9pm thinking we would like a quiet drink But there was very loud so called jazz being played in the only sitting area There was another bar area but we were told we could not use it so the only place was our room for such a large hotel there really should be somewhere to sit in comfort ,No Positive
11346,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bathroom was small and the floor got wet when using the shower as there was no step or tray to contain the water Made it slippery to use the toilet Glass door got in the way of the entrance the spa facilities were poor and not very clean Signage was lacking in the hotel made it difficult to find out where to go for the spa breakfast bar etc unless you asked staff, Food was great lots of variety and well laid out Staff were helpful and friendly 
11347,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel was a bit further from Kings Cross than expected There was no draught lager available on Saturday night, General standard of comfort throughout the hotel was excellent and bar prices were reasonable for a London hotel Hotel was also quiet considering its size 
11348,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Noisy aircon unable to open windows unable to use stairs and had to use lift, Crisp sheets room including bathroom was spotlessly clean modern smart interior friendly and efficient staff
11349,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Could not sleep all night as the people next to us were screaming and talking very loudly The room had a conjoining door this may have made it worse Tried earplugs and knocking on the door but it didn t help The gym facilities were falling apart and very small , The concierge and other staff were lovely and helpful 
11350,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Big negative for me was the fact that the windows could nt open so there s no fresh air in the rooms the use of air conditioning for air resulted in me getting a really bad chest infection The pay on demand TV system did not work for our entire stay and no proper effort was made to try and rectify it, Good bedding nicely renovated property Friendly staff in restaurants reception and housekeeping The lady that cleaned the room was very thorough
11351,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Air conditioning Breakfast trays were not removed when room was cleaned on one day I had to ring 3 times and ask for someone to take the tray away , Visit ruined by extremely poor air conditioning and inability to open window 
11352,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The lifts are shaky for anyone nervous of these things the room got stuffy do needed aircon all night although weather unusually humid , Stayed one night room comfortable even if only a standard room very little noise of other occupants
11353,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Having to pay for the use of the pool when i am a staying at the hotel terrible Having to wait a long time to check in and out very poor and slow service, bed
11354,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, After waiting for 2 hours over our check in time I finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that I was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available I felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple Then after walking around London all day we wanted to order room service after 3 trips to the reception and 1 broken phone we finally got 2 lots of fish and chips I never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your Fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect Highly disappointed , The room was comfortable and clean 
11355,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The room was spacious and the twin beds were very spacious and comfortable The staff were friendly and accomodating They easily assisted with helping me even through busy moments 
11356,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast can be very busy try to avoid the rush after 9am The hotel has three lifts for the whole hotel and the stairs were closed for renovation can take a while to get anywhere during the very sumner season The London underground is a good 15 20 minutes walk from the hotel , The staff were really helpful
11357,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, My car was broken into in the hotel car park Staff not in the slightest bit interested Had to drive home on seats of glass the day of sightseeing in London abandoned, The hotel itself was fine as a building Rooms okay etc
11358,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location you really need a vehicle it s a 15 minute walk to the nearest tube station , The Facilities were excellent especially the Club Room and the Breakfast
11359,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It s 15 minutes at least from metro King s cross or Russel station Which is fine if you plan to stay out all day but it s a bit of a walk For some reason the alarm rang in the room the last day for 10 minutes and stopped Hard way to wake up but overall everything was great , De liked the fact that we could do early check in The beds were comfortable it s good to have a mini fridge in the room too The spa was great and good price 3 50 the massages were too expensive though The rooms had good isolation and the cleaning personnel was very discreet when doing the rooms on our floor Also very thick curtains allowing you to sleep in It s Close to a nice neighbourhood exmouth market where you can find a nice cafe called briki 
11360,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Booking in and out was great for me my friends could have had slightly more friendly speedy service on reception Long wait for lifts often very crowded, The room and room facilities were very good Location to event attending really suited us Breakfast provision was excellent Very clean nice decor
11361,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location bit far from U G station you may need 15 min walk no attractions around the hotel , The facilities are excellent leisure center is very good even it is with fee Room staff facilities are very good Room is very large
11362,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Since being refurbished and changed from a Holiday Inn to Crowne Plaza it seems what were previously 2 good sized rooms have now been made into 3 cramped rooms Not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time Bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through Probably the worst bathroom design I have ever seen The elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe 3 mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen The end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom My shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point Breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing 18 pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to 15 pounds I find it hard to believe that most people could eat 18 pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value NOT GOOD VALUE AT ALL and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day On arrival I was told that since changing to Crown Plaza then the free WIFI no longer requires login or password What they didnt point out was that the WIFI is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and WIFI is important Although I didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level Reception smells strongly of chlorine Location at best is OK but not great with a good 10 15 minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc , staff were friendly and helpful
11363,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The only thing we said was that upon arrival to your room you get a free bottle of water and a small supply of tea coffee making facilities This is good if you re only staying one night but we stayed for 2 and would have appreciated the extra supplies , Bed was super comfortable lots to choose from at breakfast and unlimited tea and coffee What else could you want Staff were very polite and helpful very good location anything that was too far on foot can be quickly accessed via public transport but remember to buy your Oyster card because we forgot haha 
11364,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room was smelly when we first checked in The AC was not working properly so at night I was sweating We turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air It was a beating The distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number 63 that would shuttle us from King s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra 15 minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time , I liked the breakfast 
11365,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room was not ready when I arrived I was told to come back at 2 00pm which I did I then had to queue again this time for 20 minutes and it still was not ready ,No Positive
11366,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast was fine but the staff that were on at breakfast didn t approach my table so made it a little difficult to grab somebody s attention when I had a question but it was perfectly adequate and very nice food , It was a lovely hotel and it was in a great location The bedrooms were spacious and very comfortable and clean Hotel staff were great I made use of the leisure facilities and the pool and spa was great 
11367,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The only thing I would say that would make the hotel better would be that there doesn t appear to be any buggy or wheelchair access from the lower lobby reception area up to the Belgio and breakfast restaurants, The staff in particular Jason Richmond and Aneta were all amazing We were treated exceptionally well considering the nature of our stay was a child s hospital visit to Great Ormond Street 
11368,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The Leisure facilities at the hotel were not well sign posted or advertised in your room , Was able to get a good nights sleep The restaurant food was great 
11369,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, everything was perfect , everything the room was clean and big and had a great view The bathroom was perfect The location was great as the bus station was nearby I recommend this hotel 
11370,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Service was atrocious Initially I was told my room had been double booked so I had no where to stay Then I was asked if it was ok to share a room with a total stranger Staff were useless couldn t even get a tea bag brought up to my room , Stunning rooms fittings Close to a number of attractions restaurants pubs Very close to many public transport options 
11371,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Odd little niggles with slightly dodgy switches lights but nothing major at all, Bright and modern comfortable rooms close to the main transport links while still seeming quiet and cosy The Belgo bar restaurant is a great part of the set up 
11372,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I did not like Room 117 where after getting out of the lift I had to lug my case down stairs in the hall I strongly resent having to pay for swimming pool in the hotel , Tea and coffee making facilities in the room
11373,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday Inn to Crowne Plaza Previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable Now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic Windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air Beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs Probably the worst designed bathroom I have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about 3mm The shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue I had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet Staff were very helpful in this instance but I had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its WIFI now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant I couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly 18 pounds If you buy vouchers in advance you get 3 pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced Room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around 155 to 285 pounds per night which is high It may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas I beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine,No Positive
11374,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We didn t have time to take advantage of pool as we had plans with friends It took 1 5 hrs in an uber to get to Gatwick airport, Very fancy offered free pool use too
11375,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Having to pay as I went the computers were down , Lovely room very comfortable bed brilliant bar and restaurant and the wait staff were very welcoming and helpful 
11376,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Very slow reception staff not very welcoming considering a 4 star hotel more a free for all to get seen and staff do not listen to customers bad to see them smoking in uniform at side of restaurant was ok once there but expect 15 20min walk if your good at walking to nearest tube station really bad for location , Nice bed and bathroom breakfast excellent quality
11377,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Although it s only 3 50 you have to pay extra to use the gym, Staff were really helpful and welcoming I asked in advance if we could have a room with 2 double beds as I was staying with my twin daughters and the reservations assistant was really helpful The rooms were clean comfortable and had tea and coffee making facilities which was great too 
11378,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, it was a long walk from Kings cross station with cases over rough footpaths , Staff were helpful The room was comfortable and quiet and the location was close to the museums and the British library 
11379,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location was a little further from Kings Cross station than hoped for 10 mins walk but other than that all good , Comfortable rooms with decent beds Very clean and quite spacious Bathroom nice and clean with bath and shower over it Really nice freshly cooked breakfast on both mornings of our stay 
11380,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No information in room on the hotel facilities , Quiet hotel in convenient location very clean and recently refurbished nice bathroom with rainfall shower 
11381,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night , Hotel was very comfortable and the facilities were great Nice bar and restaurant 
11382,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Business men in particular were assured more than casually dressed folk soaked from the sudden torrential rain while queuing to check in manually as systems were down that Friday , The onsite restaurants especially Belga were great waiters were attentive and food was fab Shower pressure was ace 
11383,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I ate at the Belgo restaurant one evening The food was only just warm The waiter did not offer any condiments and I could not get his attention again I ended up leaving most of the food as it was too dry Some of the attention in the bathroom could have been better I moved to another room where the toilet was coming away from the wall but accepted this since I didn t want to be next to the lift The mini bars are empty meaning not even being able to have any bottled water late evening or early morning Two times I went to the fitness and spa and not all facilities were possible due to cleaning These could be done out of hours but at least cleansiness maintenance was paramount The only complaint there is that they should visit the sauna there was wood worms by the door coming from the wood frames , The breakfast choice was of a very good standard and plenty to choose from Definitely worth the value 
11384,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Charge to use the pool gym Location a bit weird about a 15 min walk from Kings Cross, Room a decent size bed comfy and everything very new clean and good condition Gets marked down for two reasons even as a guest you have to pay to use the pool and gym and secondly a very long check in time as computers down but had been down for 3 days 
11385,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It s far from a big supermarket But store in front was good to get something , The hotel is very near to where we always go for shopping like oxford street Very accessible to all 
11386,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We booked a room with 2 double beds but there was not one available and so we were given a standard double room The guests in the next room were very loud and partied with doors banging until 4am The air conditioning was noisy making a rattling noise all the time which seemed to become more noticeable when you tried to sleep The room was not overly clean and the remote for the TV seemed to be mood dependent when it wanted to work At breakfast the food was lovely but the dining room was a mess tables were not cleared there was cutlery missing from the table no one offered tea or coffee at the table or directed you where to find anything There was no printed information about the hotel or its facilities in the room we did not even know it had a pool or spa , Bed was really comfy and shower was excellent although it did soak the floor Plenty of power sockets in the room cocktails served in the bar were a lovely way to finish a busy day 
11387,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Parents allowing their children to dive in the pool, Food was excellent in the restaurant and the breakfast in the morning very friendly and efficient staff
11388,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, See above, All else was greatThere was a problem in the dining room at dinner on a Sunday night There was no decaffeinated coffee and there seemed nothing could be done about it as the machine they used only took one kind of coffee The machine in other area only made large quantities I had invited a friend for dinner I discussed with DR manager and he deducted an amount from our bill but it seemed totally ridiculous clearly the PM had not done the job he she should The breakfast Guests on Monday would have an issue too
11389,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bathroom was designed with looks in mind but not practicality The oversized sink undersized tap shower without glass etc i think an art major designed this with no practicality in sight D, Quick easy stay helpful staff
11390,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We had complaints of noise when we had music from a small Bluetooth speaker on a Friday night as we were getting ready to go out for dinner Ridiculous Also you have to PAY to use the poor or gym I don t know of any hotel that requires that , The lobby and reception were nice 
11391,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel was a 15 minute walk from Kings Cross station With a suitcase this was a nightmare Ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses Hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt Never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions Main toilets in the hotel were on level 1 in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment When arriving at the hotel in the morning I couldnt check in until 2pm and needed the toilet What they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in Very strange and I was not advised of any of this upon checking in Overall very disorganised and customer service not great ,No Positive
11392,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I only know that they charge us to use the pool and gym Their website is deceiving giving the impression that like most hotels those facilities are available to guests free of charge The location is also a bit far from the closet tube station Though the name carries King s Cross it is like 10 mins walk from the King s Cross station And since King s Cross is a big station it would take 15 20 mins from hotel door to platform , The rooms are clean and quiet
11393,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Housekeeping cleaning of the room If you don t leave money housekeeping will not leave shampoo toilet paper and water Location of hotel is great it s the real center of London Breakfast is good but a bit expensive , The best is location of the hotel It s the real center of London 
11394,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, had to pay extra to use spa facilities and wasn t part of the hotel as expected you had to go out of the hotel and into the cellar suprising after staying at other crown plaza hotels i emailed the hotel and got no reply, Room was lovely and good decor throughout
11395,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Few small details could have been better tv remote didn t work and there was no welcome note or hotel details booklet, Comfy and spacious room and staff were helpful
11396,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There was a long wait for check in however believe it was due to the BA cancellations so understand , We were celebrating our friends 40th Birthday at Piano Works down the road coming from Bristol on the train tube We found the hotel modern comfortable with large room for London The price was reasonable and staff were friendly The bedroom was quiet and comforting after a long day night out It has a nice central location and the following day visited Tower of London and Carnaby Street on tube We especially loved the rain shower 
11397,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There is an additional charge for using the leisure facilities Reception staff discourteous at times , Concierge was helpful Room was quite and comfortable 
11398,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Room service was very weird The waiter barged into the room without being asked to creating a very awkward situation He also didn t carry a card payment terminal , Amazing bedding and very nice bed size Also the desk with international power outlets was very guest friendly 
11399,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not much , Overall a good experience All of the staff were courteous and hard working To find fault would be picking holes but there are little improvements that can be made but overall a great place to stay made better by the staff 
11400,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location far from everything Impossible to open the windows in the room Lavatories in works at the lobby, 2 restaurants very comfortable rooms
11401,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No computer for guests although I think there will be one in the future Doorway to bathroom was narrow and the door had a tall handle so it was awkward getting in and out of the bathroom Very little space between bed and desk , Good food and service in the hotel s restaurants and bar two double beds in the room proximity to Kings Cross station which is why we were there 
11402,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There are still some minor surface issues like the door leading to my room having had its handle removed looked messy but I understand the hotel is in process of transformation , I ve stayed here a few times now and always find it comfortable and welcoming Great location access to Kings Cross Dickens Museum restaurants and British Library not far walk from these places 
11403,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The waitress staff at breakfast could have been more attentative I e asking if we required tea or coffee when being seated instead of us having to ask for it Also on arrival at the hotel we were told that there was no booking for us Yet I clearly had a confirmation email from booking com telling me that It was booked This caused us some anguish after a 3 hour journey The receptionist eventually sorted us out after a 30 minute wait , Beds very comfy pleasant friendly staff 
11404,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, no complaints everything was fine , the room was comfortable and it was possible to have a small breakfast in the cafe rather than the big buffet i also really liked the bathroom set up 
11405,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Car park spaces were ridiculously small scratched our 16 plate Mercedes due to one of your staff misguiding us in 20 for car park over night which is shocking Breakfast was vile and everything was hard and cold Ladies toilets were in the basement 2 floors from reception and was like a building site health and safety Oh and only 8 spaces in the car park, Nothing
11406,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No complaints , The bed was really comfy and the location was excellent The hotel is looking really good after the recent refurbishment I didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on food I also didn t get a chance to use the pool or gym but I would definitely like to return and give them a try 
11407,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I was asked was there a reason for the trip I said it was for my daughter in law and son s birthdays also there wedding annervesary which was all in that week of booking I had been informed they would have a bottle of wine waiting for them nil given , Breakfast very good
11408,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Had to pay as we went along their computer systems were down and so nothing could be charged to the room , The staff were lovely That s really nice especially when travelling as a lone female 
11409,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, the room was very small for the price When using the shower it soaked the bathroom floor The hot food wasn t so hot and was a little disappointing My room was not cleaned nor new towels provided despite being out of the hotel for 11 1 2 hours Not the service I expect for the price The staff were apologetic but not remotely sincere about it , Hotel was nice Breakfast options were good 
11410,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Never use booking com again Had a nightmare and they don t actually make bookings Who knew Avoid at all costs Nothing but hassle , Hotel was busy but staff still had time for you
11411,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Trying to order room service took over 40 minutes a number of calls to reception that did not finish the call before putting the phone down and the kitchen restaurant not answering the phones Also the worst part was the fact that all the systems were down so i was unable to get a receipt on booking in they tried applying a 2nd charge then on checking out still unable to get a receipt and still today i have been unsuccessful in gaining a receipt meaning i shall not be able to claim on my expenses for the accommodation despite a number of messages to the hotel and calls i still have not got a receipt very disappointing and would recommend booking com removing them , Room size and facilities were great
11412,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Reception and concierge handled by trainees IT system broke down a few days before and not fixed , Very good and large breakfast choice acceptable room size and cleaniness SPA more than expected 
11413,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Bellboy was extremely rude when we asked to store our luggage Asked us to drag our bags across the lobby just to drag them back then made us feel as if we were inconveniencing him when that s his job For 150 a night it s the least we expect ,No Positive
11414,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The gym was horrendous I paid 3 to use a few 8kg dumbbells It shouldn t list that they even have a gym Value for money is terrible to be fair when compared to others in the area , Great reception Looks a lovely hotel Nice room 
11415,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The view and no porters to help with luggage , Our view was the back yards of a row of house on the back side of the hotel We got the furthest room from the elevators and no help was available to take our luggage Close to a variety of restaurants a block away Easy walk to them just past the major Royal Mail building 
11416,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The cooked breakfast was practically cold This was on both mornings so was not a one off case We would have been better off going room only and eating out The staff were not helpful on arrival this was our first time here and we had no idea where to find anything It would have been helpful if they had asked if we had been here before and if not they should have a taken the time to tell us where things were Apparently there is a bar somewhere Reception staff looked miserable and unapproachable All in all not a very friendly hotel , The rooms were spacious and comfortable and had everything that you could possibly neeed TV hairdryer iron kettle safe fridge plus some extras shoe mit needle kit etc Lovely bathrooms with excellent shower 
11417,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Being very picky but perhaps a mirror on the wall near to the hairdryer , Assistance from staff was excellent when required Hotel room was light and airy and the pool facilities were excellent Slept very well indeed 
11418,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wifi was not accessible in our room at all , The room was really speacious and the bed comfortable The staff was really helpful and nice and were resolving our needs fast The location of the hotel is good just 10 min walk from King s Cross There is nice neighbourhood in the close vicinity of the hotel with small shops and restaurants which was quite useful Everything was clean and in order 
11419,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The bed was super comfortable and we had an upgrade to a executive room i guess The staff was understanding us and also the wifi was really fast and good 
11420,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, When I came back to the hotel almost 4 30pm my room wasn t made up I found this a bit annoying as I had been out and about since 8 00am and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready While at the lounge I waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink Eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly However when it came to paying for the drink I found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink The chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings , room was very well appointed clean and comfortable Breakfast was good 
11421,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I had to move to another hotel during the week end because the fare was too expansive but this is London , Everything was perfect The room was large and quite the bed very comfortable You can walk to the hotel from St Pancras station no need to take a taxi 
11422,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Charge for pool I only have cereals for breakfast told receptionist this and there was no mention of a small breakfast when I said I didn t want to pay 14 95 for cereals toast and drink , Very nice room comfortable and clean 
11423,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, After paying a lot you have to pay to go for a swim or to the gym The bath shower were a bit high and therefore getting into the shower is a struggle for small people, Comfortable room bed good tv good
11424,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hot water for the bath never achieved anywhere near 40 degrees The room was very warm even though the AC was turned down to it s lowest setting and I overheard another guest complaining about this at checkout When I went to open the room door from the inside I happened to look up and there was a gap between the ceiling and the door frame of about 1 2 a foot filled with wires which was a bit disconcerting On checkout I was asked to wait while they checked my room for damages Yup While they checked my room for damages That is literally what the receptionist told me I told her I was very insulted and she said I m sorry and then shrugged The shrug was the last straw I m not sure the British are very good with shrugs So I took it to the Manager who was very receptive and listened carefully and promised to report the woman to her Manager I wouldn t return again I ve had these problems with 4 star hotels before It s always better to go high or modest Not somewhere that is trying too hard to live off the parent companies name , It is a very clean hotel with large comfortable rooms and super housekeeping and room service staff When I speak at author events I want the anonymity of a large generic hotel I feel it gives me the space to prepare They let me stay an extra hour in the room to take some pain medication for a headache which was very kind 
11425,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was advertised with a spa but did not mention it was run separately from the hotel and had an extra cost to use the facilities Very disappointed with the spa hot tub was out of order swimming pool so small could not swim and member of leisure staff not helpful ,No Positive
11426,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Restaurant was on the expensive side I would prefer to give a tip than it be added to my bill Shame about the hot tub being out of order , Very clean hotel Friendly staff 
11427,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was a little expensive for the food provided as after a certain time there was only sandwiches and crisps even though the menu said fries , The staff was so friendly and more than happy to help with any questions There was always a cleaner in the spa area and on the room floors 
11428,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bed, The bed was too hard for me and the location a bit too far from a tube to be helpful but walking to bloomesbury was easy and the staff were really helpful If the bed had been softer I would have been happier
11429,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Drinks in the bar were very expensive so we probably won t use the bar again, staff were lovely and place was clean specially porter young man on reception was very helpful and got us a taxi etc
11430,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The shower needs a longer door or a supplemental curtain , Everything was great except that the shower door only went half way across so water went onto the floor They let us check in early which was great Nice tv decent wifi new looking rooms 
11431,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing, The hotel provided all that was needed from friendly staff at the reception efficiency in check in room service and comforts were ideal Staff in all areas of the hotel were most friendly and helpful 
11432,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Lacks character and charm bar area is nice and breakfasts very good They charge you to use the leisure facilities even if you are a guest , Nice clean rooms and bathrooms Friendly staff 
11433,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop The bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep The queue for The check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time The staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in ,No Positive
11434,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, When we first went into our room there was no kettle This was reported to reception at once as we would have liked a hot drink on our arrival I phone reception an hour later still no kettle At 6 00pm we decided to go out for a walk and to have a hot drink else where On the way out complained again about the kettle On our arrival back at the hotel at 10 00pm kettle was in our room , The welcome from the staff as soon as you walked into the hotel was great and the overall look of the hotel was welcoming as well 
11435,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, None , This is a newly renovated property Everything is perfect I love the hotel and decor It s very comfortable It s not luxury but it s modern I would stay again Breakfast is very generous 
11436,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room size for the price we paid Very cramped Not enough cupboard space We stayed there a week , The room was very clean and the beds very comfortable but was rather cramped The breakfast was excellent and the service in the breakfast room was very good All the staff were very friendly and helpful Location was very convenient Bus service just outside the hotel And underground stations within walking distance about 10 minutes walk The walk to Kingscross was not very pleasant A little shadey and quiet I would rather recommend people to walk to Russell Square tube station Very pleasant walk that way 
11437,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, They charged us 3 50 pounds to use the pool and fitness room the rooms are super small and there was no wifi for the first 2 days of our stay and when they did get wifi the connection was super slow I would not stay at a crown plaza again , the location
11438,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Pull out sofa bed wasn t made up on the first night like we re were advised but as I had a long day and the fact i was ill and already sleeping my auntie who was sleeping on the bed didn t want to call for someone to make the bed so slept with out and quilt or pillow the following night the bed was made up, The express breakfast I ordered to the room was fantastic and great value also staff were very helpful and friendly Great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family
11439,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff were not great We asked for our luggage to be picked up and said there will be someone there straight away I waited 20 mins before calling again and they then told me they were too busy to collect them I had 4 suitcases , The room was very clean and had everything needed for a good relaxing sleep 
11440,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We had heavy luggage and the walking distance was further than had anticipated Easy route by taxi or bus , Good accomodation at a reasonable price fairly near to Kings Cross station The bed was extremely comfortable and the bar staff friendly and helpful 
11441,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, we rang to reception to find out about the spa to be told it was in the basement we then had to call at reception to ask again as the lift didn t go to the basement due to refurb work that was all fine except it gave the reception staff two opportunities to tell us we needed to pay to use the facilities which would have saved my hubby from having to go right back to the room for money Jacuzzi then not working when we got in there Did think the spa let the hotel down , It was clean and comfortable
11442,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally Location was not as convenient as expected and despite King s Cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about 10 GBP taxi fare away , This hotel did not suit me personally 
11443,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, On arrival the Receptionist spoke so quickly that we couldn t understand We were disappointed to find out we had to pay for the pool this was not clear on the website The jacuzzi wasn t even working and the pool was smaller than it looked on website I chose the hotel based on the photos of the pool so very disappointing The bedroom but especially the breakfast restaurant was uncomfortably warm More air needed in there , The bedroom was clean comfortable and a good size The bathroom was modern and attractive although water splashed everywhere due to the design of the shower There was an excellent choice of food at breakfast and it was all delicious The location was not ideal but there are buses and taxis going past regularly so it wasn t a real problem 
11444,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The pool was ice cold due to breakdown or maintenance but obviously couldnt be helped , The Room was lovely clean and comfortable Breakfast good variety and pleasent atmosphere 
11445,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Charge of 3 50 per visit to swimming pool VERY poor show Belgo restaurant evening meal too small staff unable to increase portion size indicating to me it s all out of a packet , Great staff especially trainee consiage
11446,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I made sure it had parking but it really didn t and they charged 20 pounds for parking which they failed to inform I also booked in for breakfast it s was 14 95 and they charged me 20 and then had to go up to the room 3 times before the access card actually worked The quality of food from room Service was poor and not cheap , It was clean Staff was helpful to solve several issues which was the downside 
11447,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There were smell of cigarettes in the room and for me as non smoker it wasn t nice I felt like being in ashtray , Big nice and tidy room with two big beds
11448,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room was way too hot even with air con on not able to open windows Had to pay for pool facilities which was not stated on the website Not cool Water in the bath didn t get very hot , Bed was lovely Kevin who made the cocktails made my staff rating a bit better as he was amazing Reception staff weren t great not really much interaction Thank God for Kevin as he made it a much better experience all the bar staff were great actually Great location and really clean room 
11449,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Limited and expensive overnight parking expensive bar and the receptionist who didn t ask for the registration of our car which could have resulted in us being charged 100 had we not enquired later , The cleanliness and super comfy bed reception area very modern and bright
11450,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Too bad it is not closer to St Pancras or near a tube station You have to walk at least 15min to get to a station or st Pancras , Spacious room modern and comfortable The great breakfast Efficient staff 
11451,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel was under refurbishment and some facilities were not available The closest underground station is Kings Cross station and it takes around 15 minutes walking, Good choice of hotel Good room facilities Clean and spacious room 
11452,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Had to squash against the wall whilst showering to stop the shower flooding the bathroom floor No refund available when we accidentally booked the wrong dates through the online booking system so we had to pay twice , Good choice for breakfast Clean comfortable and spacious rooms 
11453,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, difficult to put plug in bath due to fixed shower screen also the hot water not very hot for bath and shower yet hand basin hot water very hot, very comfortable clean and well presented room
11454,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I thought I d booked the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury but got Holiday Inn Kings Cross Bloomsbury although it is in fact a Crown Plaza hotel It was a good 10 mins walk away from where I wanted to stay I ll book hotel direct next time , Quiet room Comfortable beds Excellent breakfast 
11455,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Gym charge not made clear but see above , I was charged for by the gym which isn t made clear but the lovely reception staff said it didn t matter Very lovely staff post Brexit the sevice industry is going to suffer
11456,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing major but maybe a few more car parking spaces As we arrived Friday to it being full and was so all weekend up until the Sunday, We liked everything about the hotel so much that we booked an extra night Would highly recommend The staff are all lovely and the rooms are kept very clean 10 10
11457,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing but confused as booked Holiday Inn and no one said it had been rebranded as Crown plaza, Been previously recently been rebranded Everything was excellent
11458,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Would have liked tea and coffee access in room not only via room service to pay another 3 50 charge for it as well also be nice if leisure centre access included as free to residents not 3 50 extra, Fantastic room lovely staff in restaurant v helpful luxury surroundings nice to have a pool and gym on site as well and very central
11459,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The buffet breakfast was fantastic The beds pillows linen and towels were all high quality All the staff I dealt with performed their jobs flawlessly 
11460,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast was okay there s a good selection of food but eggs weren t cooked enough and black pudding was overdone Pool closes to children at 18 30hrs think this should be later as we didn t get the chance to use it and kids were upset , Staff were lovely and helpful Room very comfortable and clean 
11461,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The rain shower was wonky so when turned on water sprayed everywhere When I adjusted the head of the shower the dirt that was on top of it was disgusting The staff where friendly but we had to wait a long time for bags to be put into storage ,No Positive
11462,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The booking for a smoking room was not reflected in my initial room assignment Luckily they had one remaining If this is your preference you may wish to call ahead to make sure the room type you reserved is honored at check in Otherwise a pleasant stay ,No Positive
11463,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The air con didn t work in the bedroom We were not able to open the window so extremely hot We only had one robe in a double room , Food and service was amazing 
11464,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I booked a smoking room and but was told there was no smoking room Booking com must make sure it is only available to book when there is availability, Location
11465,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, one member of staff was rude We booked a smoking room with a queen bed and bath We were given a non smoking room smaller bed and no bath When we contacted staff about this they came across rude and didn t accommodate us the room we paid for We expected the room we paid for and that s what we should have got , The bed was comfy The pool was great And location was perfect 
11466,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel is situated a good 15 minute walk to the closet tube station so if you plan to get around London via public transport you ll need to factor in a fair bit of walking, Hotel was extremely comfortable and very quiet The room was a good size and had everything I needed
11467,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Room was warm too warm in fact a day air con wasn t particularly good Selection of TV also wasn t great if your not into sport Good that sky sports was included but general channel selection was only adequate and movies were pay per view Additionally the pool wasn t inclusive and should have been for this level of hotel although not expensive , Location and facilities were good and reasonable for price Breakfast was of good quality and selection on offer was good 
11468,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Got extremely warm aircon seemed to have little effect exacerbated by the windows unable to open at all , Bed exceptionally comfortable bathroom was beautiful great shower Pool and fitness facilities were a brilliant perk after hectic travelling 
11469,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Only complaint is that the room kettle should be inspected more often for calcification and cleanliness, Rooms seems to have been refurbished recently which is great Modern and classy and comfortable
11470,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room while recently renovated and is very comfy has a very bad bathroom design The glass screen only extends half way so there is no way that the bathroom floor will be dry when you shower as the water will definitely splash there , The staff were very attentive and breakfast was very complete and yummy 
11471,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There aren t any restaurants nearby you have to take a bus to get to the main part of London However it s only a 10min bus journey , I was served by Elisa on front desk and she was amazing and very friendly I wanted a late checkout 2pm and they were happy to do that with no extra cost The hotel room was clean and the room size was a reasonable size Would definitely stay here again 
11472,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not a dislike necessarily but we found the tea coffee making facilities when we were checking out they are in a drawer This keeps the room neat and tidy but we completely missed them , The room is well laid out with everything you would expect for a pleasant stay although compact that s the norm for standard rooms in London hotels though The hotel is also within easy walking distance to Sadler s Wells and a little further to the British Museum 
11473,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The breakfast time was extremely busy and they constantly ran out of items so we had to keep asking hence having to constantly wait until they replenished this really was rather annoying Also i would suggest bringing pots of coffee tea to the table for the guests so the guests don t have to get up constantly Also the location is a lot further from a tube station than initially thought approximately 15 min walk so we had to Uber quite a bit on an evening where typically we would use the tube , Complimentary water in the room 
11474,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, After arriving after a long journey a member of staff woman was giving us weird looks as if we were not welcomed there We were very tired and got asked a lot of u reasonable questions and got asked for two ID cards One of the keys wasn t working either , Amazing bed setting Great coffee and tea facilities Really enjoyed our stay here after the check in 
11475,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We were told we were being upgraded to an executive room and in the same sentence we were told that the room was not very good but hey it s an upgrade We didn t understand why we were being upgraded to a smaller room Surely that s a downgrade The bottles of water and chocolate and other little touches were nice but was not worth the upgrade , The bed was very comfortable The pillows however could do with more choice Perhaps a soft and a firm 
11476,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was further away from kings cross station than implied I picked the hotel on the basis I needed to be on an early train and that wasn t ideal, The shower was awesome
11477,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The walls had holes carpets look worn out and paint on walls wasn t finished Needs refurbishment , The food the room looked nice and big with a good view and the bed was comfy 
11478,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Recently refurbished Excellent location quiet but a 5 minute walk to bus routes into the centre 3 stops from Kings Cross Union Tavern opposite has excellent food need to book it is popular
11479,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not a good location with 2 young kids A long way to nearest tube station they say 10 mins but it s 15 A lot of bus hopping done It s now Crown Plaza group not Holiday Inn Swimming pool freezing cold costs extra each day Room didn t have enough bath towels for all of us or tea making facilities biscuits TV problems apparently just this weekend really annoying , Staff very helpful in reception and breakfast lounge Clean tidy contemporary furniture fittings Comfy beds Great choices for breakfast
11480,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel rebranded to crown plaza the day I booked and it took over an hour to find walking late at night in the rain THE HOTEL HAS NOW RED EXTERIOR AND CROWNE PLAZA SIGNAGE NOT GREEN AND WHITE HOLIDAY INN NO ONE AT THE HOTEL OR BOOKING COM THOUGHT TO TELL THOSE WHO HAD BOOKED THAT THE HOTEL HAD CHNAGED NAME AND BRAND THESE IDIOTS ARE STILL CALLING IT HOLIDAY INN FOR GODS SAKE IT EVENTUALLY COST ME 20 QUID IN TAXIS AND GOING TO THE HOLIDAY INN BLOOMSBURY TO FIND IT THE HOTEL IS THE CROWNE PLAZA KINGS CROSS CHANGE THE BLOODY NAME FOR GODS SAKE AND TELL YOUR CLIENTS BOOKERS BEWARE THAT SAID THE REBRAND AND MAKE OVER MAKES THIS A REAL PREMIUM HOTEL NOT AT ALL LIKE HOLIDAY INNS THE MAKEOVER IS NOT 100 COMPLET BUT PRICES REFELCET THIS AND RIGHT NOW ITS GOOD VLAUE ,No Positive
11481,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff knocking on the door and male staff entering without warning Plus we asked for extra towels but they didn t come We asked for a refund on our room but not sure if we got that though the assistant manager was sympathetic , Head board of the beds were soft Nice wet room 
11482,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, I was accompanying my daughter for an audition and she had forgot to print something off that she required the reception staff let her use their computer and printer and saved the day 
11483,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bar only had lagers and ciders no good if you drink Guinness Breakfast could be better had to wait for bacon My wife said that some of hers was cold , Service was good we arrived early and were able to leave luggage Room was great good bathroom 
11484,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Loud music from guests below us woke us up and when we informed reception at 2 am nothing was done The pool and spa facilities weren t available and that was one of the reasons why we booked the hotel , Modern interiors Great shower Friendly staff Mussels restaurant next door is delicious 
11485,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Changing from HI to Crowne Plaza not sure on room allocations upgraded room was 2 double beds felt small Breakfast on Sunday was chaos run out of lots of things staff not effective slow, Lots of it was average
11486,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wanted continental breakfast but the the meat cheese looked dried out the pastrys didn t taste fresh , Staff were friendly but had difficulty when asked for were the tube was as and taxi Not sure if the staff understood us 
11487,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Most hotel kitchens seem to be unable to cook bacon properly This was no exception Lack of a public lounge area and no toilets near bar oR restaurant Toilets where available in the cold basement below reception but where very poor , Breakfast was good with plenty of choice Room had recently been refurbished Very comfortable bed and seating area for a standard room Shower was really good and probably best one I have ever used in any hotel 
11488,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The restaurant staff were shockingly slow and rude No idea of customer service and no response from management when complaining Very expensive menu as well This with rude staff who do not have a good understanding of english is very poor , The hotel was clean and well priced 
11489,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Perhaps a better design in the bathroom shower was next to the window so water went all over the blind Road noise was intrusive better double glazing possibly , Room was spacious and clean and quiet no noise late at night 
11490,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The only minor minus was 15 minutes walk to the nearest underground station But still not something big really , Very clean and comfortable room Great Belgo restaurant downstairs if you only are fan of Belgian beer Everything as it should be in a good hotel 
11491,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best Every option I asked for they were out Only one salad option no soup but I could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished I had Room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot I don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep The point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting When I booked I asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival I will not be using this hotel again , Room was modern and clean
11492,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The layout of the room specifically that the desk chair backs right into the bed making it awkward to sit or stand and if there had been a guest with me impossible to navigate from the sitting area to the door or bathroom Kind of an odd thing to do , I found the renovations very good and a nice surprise 
11493,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wellness section is for extra price maybe just the only bad news for bookers but no more complaining , The staff was increadibly polite and helpfull the building is fascinating everything in excellent condition there s no any microdust or neighter a spot in our well equiped modern rooms the beds our comfortable and clean made us feel us home The breakfast was if it had made for the Prime Minister we enjoyed the wide range of many sort of foods and the kindness of the staff special thanks for the Hungarians there 
11494,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I had to pay for the gym My room service was due in 15 minutes and took 50 The salad I ordered was covered in olives despite no mention on the menu The towels were thin and tiny the fan in the bathroom was noisy and I was unable to turn it off Terrible night I will not be back, the shower
11495,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Shower flooded the bathroom bad design Remote took 9 presses to get a button to work One room key didn t work long queue at reception to get it changed Toilets a long way from breakfast Bread at breakfast was stale, Looks nice
11496,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I was a little disappointed that the sauna was so small and I was a little alarmed about the light floating in the pool that had come loose I reported but the staff were fully aware and was in the process of getting it sorted out And although my room was lovely and clean I did see a pair of pliers that were left on the floor by the lamp that I luckily avoided stepping on as it was almost hidden by the curtain I also ordered breakfast to my room where some of the food items were cold so that was a little disappointing too but overall I had a pleasant stay , The room was a lovely size and included all the equipment that might be needed through my stay i e Ironing board and iron The hotel itself is in a good location and exceeded my expectations for a Holiday Inn It was really clean and comfortable and I fully enjoyed my stay 
11497,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Would have liked a wider menu in restaurant Light bites and sandwiches at lunch time , The beds were very comfy lovely clean fresh room Very friendly staff Breakfast was plentiful and tasty only criticism the cooked items were not hot enough but I appreciate its hard to maintain high temps on a hot plate service 
11498,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing, Greeted by excellent members of staff both at the front desk and in the restaurant Free wifi Cleanliness excellent room had really comfy beds tea making facilities and mini fridge The restaurant belgo has a great selection of beers ales wines and cocktails Really enjoyed our stay we stayed in a 2 double bed room which had been refurbished Nearest tube is Russell square you also have kings cross and Holborn within 20 minute walk
11499,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Comfortable bed clean room excellent breakfast Didn t use the pool Consierge very helpful with bus information staff all friendly Hotel now Crowne Plaza not Holiday Inn 
11500,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There were a small set of stairs between the lifts and the room may sound picky but with a big heavy case it was a real pain , The newly refurbished rooms are extremely comfortable well designed and the bathrooms are excellent Really impressed at the value for money 
11501,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The room was a perfect size and lovely layout and the breakfast was definatly worth paying extra for I actually forgot I was still in the country and thought I was at an all inclusive abroad with a very nice English breakfast and other things to go with it 
11502,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Lifts were very slow and over crowded we had to wait for 4 lifts before we could get in one There weren t clear signs to the stairs which we would have taken instead Building work happening in the hotel which we were not aware of prior to stay and the hotel bar area was unstaffed when we got back for a nightcap at 10pm, Location was great and rooms clean and comfortable 
11503,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not the best view, Wine glasses were fab we had a quick drink before we headed out We stayed in a refurbished room the bathroom and beds were wonderful we had a great night s sleep Staff were really friendly and ever so helpful in getting us a taxi organised 
11504,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The walls are paper thin Terrible nights sleep Hours of coughing and snoring from the bedroom next door Lots of noise from the corridor , Bed and room lovely 
11505,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No information in room about facilities meal times etc Charge of 3 50 for use of swimming pool for residents is not acceptable , Very comfortable room with lovely bathroom Breakfast was very good and included in price unusual for London
11506,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast room very dated Tea coffee out of flasks No poached or fried eggs Fruit selection poor fan in our bathroom on all night asked for handyman to take a look told no one available consequently didn t sleep much first night but second slept like a log Quite location, The room was lovely clean comfortable modern 
11507,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Parking I phoned to ask about parking to be told that there were 20 spaces but could not be reserved and were only available on a first come first served basis However when we arri ved no spaces available but two spaces had clearly been reserved NCP parking 10 mins away cost 28 for 24 hours, A wonderful receptionist Aneta Debosz who could not have been more helpful thank you
11508,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Would have been good to be made aware of the pool, Went an hour and a half early and was checked in no problems and allowed us to keep our bags there i till our train home
11509,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The food served in hotel was not the greatest the dining room was also not ideal but we appreciate this may be due to renovations, Initial first impressions of hotel was impressive We were aware of renovations Hotel room was great as well as spa facilities and reasonably priced The food served in the hotel could have been better
11510,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, In my opinion the breakfast could have been better choice was limited such as fried eggs not being available Food was good quality Only complaint would be the choice , Property just refurbished so room was very modern Extremely comfy bed and bathroom was amazing with waterfall shower and a nice deep bath Room very spacious also 
11511,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, the room was very small the bed too we go 1 towel everyday I had to call with my telephone as the phone in the room did not work for new towels every day , Staff where nice 
11512,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The only downside was our hotel room had only a shower and no bath , Excellent location Staff were friendly No complaints about breakfast selection Room was fantastic Clean and tidy 
11513,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The restaurant and bar area seemed a bit depressing e g no windows and too crowded The location is slightly inconvenient but overall we got a fair deal , The room was spacious and tastefully furnished We also really liked the bathroom 
11514,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wanted to use gym but was closed , Quiet clean comfortable and spacious rooms Ordered food to the room said about 20 minutes but food came sooner The price of food excellent considerng the portion size

11516,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hash browns felt overly reheated soft instead of crisp , The bed was very comfortable and and shower was absolutely amazing Staff at reception were very helpful and efficient 
11517,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, 10 mins swift walk to nearest tube station Russell Square , Renovations underway but no noise in hotel at times we were there Complimentary upgrade to higher floor appreciated Breakfast was excellent even though it was in temporary dining space on basement level 
11518,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Coffee for breakfast could be better the breakfast becomes repetitive after 2 days over 10 mins walk to the nearest subway, Everything was great clean and new Good breakfast The works are still on but it was not a problem
11519,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, coffee and bacon at breakfast poor Paid parking at 20 pounds was high should be split into shorter time periods, great location comfy beds and proper curtains that block out sun
11520,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Most people traveling on business travel really early to make 8am meetings London being a metropolitan you d think people could book in at 9am at least luckily for me I could freshen up and get to court by 9am your staff from reception to pool breakfast and room service were all friendly and professional Honestly was a pleasure being in the Hotel , Gym and pool facilities
11521,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, layout in lobby area was poor sliding doors were not open twice bar downstairs was not in keeping with the standard in the rest of the hotel, nice room
11522,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Due to renovations there were only lifts to get to the rooms not good for someone who is claustrophobic The one we got into stopped as it did not go to our floor The Prosecco ordered to the room as a surprise for my husband s birthday was not there No hot water in hotel the following morning , The room was obviously newly refurbished and very clean Staff dealt with the unfortunate problems we encountered quickly We were given a generous 50 reduction as there was no hot water in the morning and the Prosecco was provided free of charge
11523,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Don t charge 5 to use the lame gym in the basement horrible And I am a Holiday Inn Rewards member So stupid from a business standpoint , Location 
11524,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No where to put 1 let alone 2 suitcases except floor or lounge Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss Cups and glasses not always cleaned replaced and carpet not vacuumed once in 4 days The restaurant was terrible We were made to feel belittled because we didn t have a booking webpage just says come and join us no mention of need to book when we could see spare tables For what we received the food was overpriced Small portions and my salmon Caesar salad was just a hot piece of salmon dumped onto lettuce with the barest hint of dressing croutons or parmesan cheese quite tasteless , Beautiful newly renovated room Bed was bliss Bathroom was great with rainhead shower and nice toiletries Quiet room with blackout curtains Loved the desk which has power points and USB connections Reception staff were very welcoming and helpful
11525,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff were not very friendly and seemed like the guests were a irritant that interfered with what they were doing , The room was absolutely lovely Loved the complimentary fridge loved the space and the bathroom Non most mirror fab 
11526,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Empty area without any big chances for good meals Breakfast ok but not available some foods for example fried eggs , Nice hotel close to king Cross train station and also easy to get to the airports
11527,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, WiFi issues on the 1st floor although they were solved thanks to great customer service , Amazing customer service solved problems and offered solutions 
11528,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, When we arrived we walked up to the gentleman at the first desk pod and said we d like to check in he pointed towards 3 identical pods to his right and said reception There was no way to know which one he meant no signage and at that moment no one behind any of them We then saw a woman return to one so went to her and checked in The room was small and badly laid out could barely walk between desk and bed and could barely pull out chair enough to sit down The floor of the bathroom floods when shower used these are new rooms Food was served in the basement as temporary measure while refurbishing badly photocopied menus and ill tempered staff we left and found somewhere local to eat though quite tired , Bed was comfortable room was clean
11529,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, sound proofing could be improved could hear muffled sound of neighbour ladies laughing and speaking Air cond is also too noisy Could also hear water passing through pipes as neighbouring taps were turned on and off , Beautiful room Superb shower room 
11530,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The fire alarm went off several times during the night The hotel is quite a walk from King s Cross St Pancras station , Very nice hotel relatively big rooms tidy environment They gave discount due to fire alarm issues 
11531,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Great location with excellent transport links Undergoing refurbishment we had a redecorated room Good breakfast Helpful staff Great supper at the Union Tavern opposite 
11532,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I did not enjoy the quality of the food in the breakfast eggs fruits nothing tasted really fresh And I wanted to have a cappuccino but it was not included in the breakfast rate They only give black coffee And the worst thing during my 1 day stay was the fact that one elevator was not working so there was a long queue to take the lifts , The location of this hotel is good because it s only 10 minutes walk 1 km from King s Cross train station
11533,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I thought the use of the gym and pool was included in the price but it wasn t you had to pay extra , Bed was comfy lovely bath and shower Food was good 
11534,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast was average porridge and bananas lacking no marmite or kippers in evidence rolls and croissants slightly stale But staff most helpful especially as we had a three year old child with us , Fabulous new decor superbly comfortable beds 
11535,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No hot water endless queues to get breakfast I think we must have caught the hotel on a bad weekend , Nice modern and up to date rooms good location Small but convenient gym 
11536,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There was no hot water The air conditioning in the room didn t work so it was very warm wich made sleeping difficult There was a long queue for breakfast about a 15 min wait to get in simply because the breakfast staff weren t re laying empty tables quickly enough The restaurant was no more than 2 3 full and had more than enough empty tables to seat the people queuing There was still a queue when we finished breakfast and by that point the room was about 50 full There were a few staff who were wandering around doing nothing until unless somebody else told them to do something We arrived at breakfast around 45 minutes before it stopped By this point there were no fried eggs no mushrooms and no toast That seems inexcusable How can you run out of bread unless your planning is terrible , The reception staff were good and the rooms are nice The bed was comfortable We were given a partial 35 refund without quibble as a result of the things we didn t like 
11537,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Just wish I could ve stayed longer , I was amazed to find this cheap 4 hotel in central London that was a Holiday Inn More like Luxury Holiday Inn Wow Great hotel and the most comfortable bed I ve stayed in for a long time 
11538,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The room was clean and well presented the water was only warm in the shower not hot And there was a queue at breakfast which I m not sure why 
11539,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing to like , The hotel is in major renovations with drilling starting as early as 8 AM The bar and rest if you could call them that are a disgrace No carpet on the stairs its cold and absolutely filthy The rooms are a disgrace Dirty bathroom floors stained linen on the bed as for the noise you may as well forget about sleeping due to drilling One lift worked for the two days which stopped at every floor regardless of requests hence it took 15 minutes to get to your room You know a hotel with 100 s of rooms with one lift and no access to stairs is beyond frustrating Id also think illegal in regards to safety If a fire started you d have no way out And when you mention the problems to front of house they smile and shrug Seriously what type of reply is that Lastly I ve stayed in most brand hotels in London due to the fact I fly there bi weekly as a rule I book direct if you re going to take a percentage of bookings you should at least offer hotels that function as such Will i use you again Doubtful Will I stay at that the holiday in Nope Never As it stands that hotel should not be suggesting its full service considering its a a work site pretending to be a full service hotel Regards Kieran
11540,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Will be better when all work is finished , Good location for west end theatres Being refurbished and we had rooms on first floor and these had been refurbished they were very nicely decorated good bathroom facilities Breakfast was good with usual choice of cooked and cereal Plenty on offer We would book again 
11541,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It s a little sketchy from the hotel to kings cross, Great tv channels and bed was definitely soft as a cloud Bathroom was very nice too and shower pressure was top notch
11542,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The main elevator was not working so plenty of times we had to go up to the 5th floor using the stairs , Recently refurbished room clean comfortable bed 
11543,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Water and drink in fridge I booked for one double bed they placed me in room with two single beds, Stuff have become less friendly and don t respond to questions satisfactorily 
11544,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The Wifi signal was intermittent but we just found comfy seats in the basement lobby where it was stronger there we could plan our day so it really wasn t an issue , The reception staff were particularly helpful The rooms were extremely clean and well equipped The beds were very comfy We enjoyed the breakfast very much 
11545,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Late night major electrical fault in several rooms on my floor causing blue flames loud crackling noise at the wall socket in use and wrecking my device charger Night staff were helpful in changing my room but I didn t feel safe and got very little sleep Refund for the cost of a replacement charger the following morning was grudging , Newly refurbished rooms quiet 
11546,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The room hot as the air con is weak and wimpy , I ve stayed here quite a number of times The hotel is presently in an upgrade process so there is some disruption at present Despite this the staff are helpful and attentive as usual the place is spotless you would hardly know the builders are in and the new rooms are very nice I am sure the long term result will be great The bed was very comfortable and the room well lit not dark and dull like so many places with mood lighting bad mood The hotel is in a relatively quiet site and there is little internal noise but it is about 15 mins walk to any underground station 
11547,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The noise all night was a joke I stayed with a 9 year and 3 year old the night before Disney they never got sleep with the noise at 6 we gave up and got dressed and showered, Hotel to nice staff was polite
11548,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work The pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed The lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only 2 of the 3 went to all floor which meant getting from the Lobby to the room could take 10 minutes The fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night , The room was comfortable and recently modernised The hot tub was good and the pool was ok 
11549,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Standard so much lower than a 4 Croissants were cheap imitations Place was being renovated Alarm system went off 10 times between 2am and 8am My 4 star room had an adjoining door with an inch gap st the bottom I could hear our neighbours every words Wifi crap and cleaners didn t service room properly Rubbish was not cleared bed wasn t made properly , Nothing
11550,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The queues to get in the breakfast room were large Once in there we had to queue again for hot food By the time we had waited for toast and eggs the rest of the food was cold More kitchen staff needed,No Positive
11551,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The only very slight issue was no room information left in my room but was ther within 10 minsbof reporting it awesome , The staff their best asset from Umar reception manager to the housekeeping staff Especially the hear of the bar downstairs and the room service guys The amount of sockets etc was a bonus too Would DEFINITELY recommend and will be using again asap Thank you Heidi Roper 
11552,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast was quite stressful due to the long lines waiting I understand that this was due to the refurbishment and we were pre warned , The pool and friendliness of the staff
11553,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Bed was small bathroom flooded from shower woken up at 7 00 by hoovering and drilling and banging Staff were rude in terms of didn t tell us anything like where the lifts were or when check out was No book in room to tell us information , Room looked fantastic very nice decor Complimentary toothbrush and comb was nice
11554,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Checked in with family around 7 30pm Given room keys for a 1st floor room Upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids Had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where I was first advised that I had not booked family room Upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on 7th floor Upon moving from the 1st floor to the 7th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys Upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up The whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx 40mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids After all this turned on the TV and the remote control didn t work At this point gave up and went to sleep P S You have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool ,No Positive
11555,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Perhaps bigger lifts but not an issue at all , The hotel had recently been refurbished to a high standard I think they are still due to work on the restaurant The bedroom and en suite was amazing bed very comfy and extremely clean 
11556,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No info on website regarding building work luckily not at hotel during day but if I had I would have been annoyed Distance to nearest tube station was about a mile too far time in London is too precious , Fab upgraded room Good varied breakfast Pleasant and helpful staff
11557,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, As there was renovations which didn t bother us the water supply got cut off a few times which I would have liked warning with a phone call from reception to inform us and give us a time frame about it , Loved the curtains as it made the room extra dark Clean and a good size 
11558,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not enough lifts To hot in corridors No mirror for hair drier Bath very difficult to get in and out of especially out of nothing to hold onto Television reception very poor No long length mirror , Comfortable room Lots of space Nice decor
11559,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Basement not refurbished yet but if it matches the rest of the building it will be great Signage to find the bar and other facilities was hard to find , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful in terms of directions and so forth The complimentary i newspaper was a nice touch too 
11560,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The building was still to be completed following an obvious refurb The lifts were extremely slow waited almost 10 minutes before taking the stairs which were clearly being used to move tools and materials and therefor looked like a tradesmans stairwell , Room was very pleasant clean modern well equipped 
11561,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The layout of the breakfast was a bit strange cereals would have been better with the fruit and cheese instead of next to the hot food, Comfortable bed0
11562,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing Not cheap but I expect this is a standard price in central London , The room and bed were comfortable and the bathroom clean and well appointed I arrived went to bed and left early the next morning I had no breakfast so cannot comment on the food 10 minutes walk from King s Cross 
11563,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I arrived very late in the evening and had a very early start and the check in staff were extremely slow despite no other customer being around The floor was a no smoking floor but the whole floor and corridor stank of cigarette smoke The location is shocking Kings Cross I may as well call any wherein the M25 near Kings Cross This hotel is situated in a dodgy poorly lit area not that near to the station As a female sole traveller it felt very unsafe , The room was clean 
11564,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Work still being done in the hotel and inadequacy of temporary signage makes it difficult to find your way around This isn t helped by every corridor on every floor being decorated identically like being trapped in a maze, Newly refurbished room was cosy but comfortable Staff extremely friendly and helpful Breakfast was freshly cooked and there was plenty of choice
11565,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Everything about the stay was perfect We had a great time here, The perfect overnight stay for me and a friend Very comfortable bed and the staff were all very helpful and professional
11566,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The breakfast was nice but I did have a slight stomach upset afterwards Nothing too bad though , The room was immaculate The cleaners obviously take their work very seriously which is nice 
11567,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Due to ongoing improvements to hotel the breakfast dining room was moved to a smaller room on our second day and the breakfast was cold , Friendly staff very nice room 
11568,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Renovations going on so could be a little noisy at times , Room was of high quality and bed was very comfortable Location was good for visiting the tourist sites of inner London 
11569,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Hotel under renovation Noisy building works reception area drab and unwelcoming , Bedroom recently renovated Staff tried to hard to get us into room early 
11570,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel was lovely the weather however was not, We were in London for a friends wedding the bed was very comfy and the room was very nice for the price The bathroom was very modern and clean I d definitely recommend 
11571,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Restaurant food terrible hotel undergoing renovations The lifts were rubbish we waited for 11 lifts going up and down and ended up using the goods lift to get down, Location
11572,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Nothing Didn t even bother to check with all the arguments and hassle at the RECEPTION Decided that a Hotels reception is meant to be welcoming and not what l witnessed Asked for my money back Hotel Manager said No He checked with his staff and they told them there was no problems that day Well they were going to say that Shame as l will not stay in their hotels ever again and l will share extensively this experience in my business as how not to create a world class customer service 
11573,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The location did not feel safe I walked alone to Kings Cross Station during the afternoon and was hassled twice by 2 different men The renovations do not compensate for the poor location , I was in a new refurbished room which had been done very well 
11574,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, there was no fan in the bathroom , the location and the room was beautiful breakfast was always good It was close to kings cross station which made getting the tubes very easy Lots of places to enjoy meals and only 10 minutes or so on the tube to the london eye
11575,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not very convenient for either King s Cross or Russel Square underground stations , Spacious room with an area for reading laying out maps guide books etc No problems with traffic noise 
11576,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Had evening meal a couple of times in the hotel and although the food was good it took ages to arrive 45 minutes and I was simply told The kitchen is too busy with room service Need chairs to sit at the desk in the room to be more business friendly The concierge needs to smile more , Newly renovated rooms are nice airy and fresh Bathroom and shower were great Good food in hotel restaurant 
11577,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Very small rooms we had a superior room so I cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms Also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms Not so close from Kings Cross about 20 min walk TV not working Staff did not repair it over 2 days but they offered us a discount on the room Fair enough , Surely the refurbished rooms are modern and tastefully decorated
11578,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Room was really hot Air con does not cool just recirc air and window cannot be opened Complained and where moved New room was exact same , Overall a pretty good hotel Staff where great
11579,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, the room was cold but the staff provided a heater so okay would have liked a bathtub but the wet room was an excellent standard with a superb shower The food was a good standard though not exciting , excellent bed loved the swimming pool and Jacuzzi and friendly staff good location and value for money on the deal I got wouldn t have wanted to pay full price though for the standard 
11580,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Room had 2 double beds and a nice working desk but made for cramped space Wifi wasn t great in my room , Good standard of newly refurbished rooms and a good value for money in central London 
11581,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Our initial allocation of a room on the 2nd floor this floor has yet to be renovated and was a smoking floor We complained and were immediately relocated to Level 5 which was terrific , The room had been recently completely refurbished it was really nice 
11582,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The toilet malfunctioned on the last day Reported to reception and they promised to sort it out It was not anyone s making but it was frustrating a bit , Clean facilities 
11583,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Restauant menu was a bit boring The construction work on the hotel refurbishment was inconvenient , Close and convenient to Kings Cross Station and the Eurostar Terminal with the 63 bus pick up at the door direct to the station 
11584,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Well obviously the renovations in the restaurant were a problem no real air conditioning on the hottest day of the year but efficient room service, Extremely comfortable bed and good air conditioning The room service breakfast was good too and I would use the hotel again
11585,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No hot water in morning Soundproofing between us and next room was a locked partition door we could hear their conversations and other noises ,No Positive
11586,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The lifts in the building were very inefficient due to renovations taking place Some time had to use the emergency stair well to get to the ground floor , Pool and Spa Facility were great Bed was comfortable 
11587,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing Perfect stay , Very luxurious and modern facilities Beds were huge and the whole room was spotless Rain shower was amazing and the price for the location was unbeatable 
11588,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The construction noise from the hotel remodelling , Convenient to Kings Cross Station A good stop over when using the Eurostar Train Service A 63 bus stops just outside the hotel and delivers you the main entrance of the station
11589,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was a busy and crowded Bank Holiday weekend and there were real issues with only one lift seemingly in operation and an 8 floor building , The lovely view from the 7th floor room of an area of London I know well but not from that perspective 
11590,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There could have been a better choice of pastries for breakfast The cheese and ham were poor quality and unapoealing and cold croissants are awful More lifts needed and pool dominated by children till after 7 30 ,No Positive
11591,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast terrible for the price no choice more of a canteen look to it Room in need off refurbishment Hotel in need off refurbishment tiles falling Lifts not working Use stair most times My Bathroom smelled strongly of urine , Staff we hospitable 
11592,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The room was nice and clean with good facilities we were up on the 8th floor so no noise from any traffic heard Bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom was spotless 
11593,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location too far from bus routes shopping and theatres I e not handy, All hotel facilities used were excellent wide choice for breakfast staff courteous and helpful
11594,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Having read the advertisement for the hotel and drawn by the presence of a pool and a gym I thought the hotel very good value for money However I was disappointed that those facilities required separate payment and so have revised my opinion somewhat ,No Positive
11595,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location was a bit far from Underground station and the construction was noisy in the day , The hotel is currently converting to a different brand from Holiday Inn and construction was going on although they did warn me of this in advance 12 minute walk to the Kings Cross area and St Pancras Train Station Too soon to give a true evaluation Staff was great 
11596,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, During our 3 night stay the fire alarm went off 3 times in the middle of the night once in our first night and twice in the last The noise was deafening and sleepy people in night clothes came out to the corridor to see if there is a fire Nobody even apologized for false alarms and poor sleep quality when we checked out Although nearly each suitcase comes with a producer s warning that it should not be lifted by using the pull handle the luggage storage guy lifted the suitcases only that way and was really arrogant when I asked him not to Two functioning elevators were far too few for a hotel of that size Staying on the 5th floor we experienced it every morning that the elevator that was heading down to the ground floor was already too full when it reached our floor having started from the 7th By the 4th floor at the latest it was impossible to enter the elevator So make sure to ask for a room on the highest floor We could not find the stairs to use them instead no idea how we would have found our way out if there indeed would have been a fire , The room was clean modern and nicely decorated and truly spacious for London standards Towels changed daily Good bed and comfy bedding two different pillows to choose between There was even one C E F type socket as used in the rest of Europe in the room The location of the hotel is also pretty good although the nearest underground station King s Cross is 1 5 km away 
11597,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No dislikes Was allocated one of the refurbished rooms and it was lovely breakfast also very good with a variety of fresh food to suit every taste , Very enjoyable stay here and although refurbishment in progress this had no effect whatsoever on our stay
11598,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Having major improvements but for 277 for 2 nights I didn t expect to be woken at 7 45am to the sound of drilling under our window Noise was terrible Went to spa at 7pm the pool was full of kids so couldn t use it and a man was sat on side of hot tub in wet boxers exposing himself Final night decided to eat in restaurant asked for steak medium rare which came back twice medium to well done For 20 you expect what you paid for so we went to pub across the road which was excellent We were given a discount of 20 per night At such high prices I will not be staying there again , Friendly staff
11599,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The dining room was really small and very littleroom to move felt like every inch of space was a table so couldn t walk around easily The first day we ended up in a small alternative room The toast was cooked and brought down so was cold , Lovely comfortable rooms and a nice hotel 
11600,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Drilling 2 4 mornings before 10am One other day woke up by workmen WiFi was unusable from the room Was told I needed to walk 15 minutes to get something to eat when we got back from a night out No night porter or food services at all Pool gym only available to residents at 3 50 per person per visit , Lovely clean room and very modern bathroom 
11601,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The construction works woke me up at 8am I phoned to reception several times and the problem was not resolved This was stressful and not what I had hoped for ,No Positive
11602,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bedrooms were really tight to fit into The breakie was good food but quite chaotic and too busy to relax The two lifts were also soooo slow In one of our rooms the air con broke so we had to move rooms also the other room the bathtub blocked , We like the modern feel in the bedroom It was also close to Kings Cross St
11603,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Room beds breakfast staff all wonderful Close to St Pancras station Eurostar to Paris Belgium easily accessible Great restaurants in the area Pool Great experience 
11604,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff arguing with each other in restaurant Building work Shower floods bathroom Location to tube station and anything else Cost per night considering above , Nothing stands out 
11605,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, System was down both in the evening and morning no real apology and even the chains Twitter account fobbed us off Think I ll be heading back to my usual hotel in London , staff were very apologetic for system being down and queuing at check in even at 22 00 
11606,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, wifi didn t work well the pay tv didn t work and I could not receive a bill at the end of my stay , the room was comfortable clean and the staff was friendly 
11607,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Strange 5 steps down to elevators was a mild drag for hauling luggage This was the absolutely worst thing , Exceptionally accommodating staff allowing early occupancy following an Airbnb relocation They also allowed a hassle free bag holding while we did one last explore of London before our evening plane left BTW people in hotel bar had been to Stevie Wonder concert that very evening 
11608,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, took 5 requests to get the sofa bed made into a sofa even having booked it however the receptionist was very good , the shower was good the hotel was clean and friendly and modern
11609,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Only a service lift for people with limited mobility which was not working on the day we left There was a pool available but you had to pay extra to use it which was not made clear on the website , Breakfast was very good value for money The breakfast staff were excellent 
11610,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, What I didn t grasp when booking was that when they said refurbishments were going on that meant a jack hammer on the floor beneath us at 8am The restaurant had gigantic AC units in the dining room I m sure it will be beautiful in due time And we got a good price due to the construction I suppose But it was not entirely done and the poor staff seemed harried , The rooms are clean It s well run If you pay a fee there is a lovely pool 
11611,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Some areas were under renovation around us noise was not an issue however having to reroute patrons to an entrance to the elevator requiring the use of steps with luggage was a real pain Close to bus line but about 15 min or more to closest tube WiFI did not work very well from our room , Rooms were newly renovated Staff was mostly helpful 
11612,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff were very cold and too formal just prepared to do the bare minimum I was surprised by the cold attitude The manager in charge has to be sent for hospitality training so that he can in turn teach and hire people who are hospitable and suited for the industry This was very different from all the previous holiday inn hotels i have stayed before What a waste great resources put to waste by unhospitable attitude of employees retraining on customer service and PR is an absolute necessity , Clean comfortable rooms Nice shower facilities Nice bed 
11613,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Hotel is under construction and disturbing noises start in the early morning Free wifi but it disconnects every 5 minutes Location is not the best place to stay Poor breakfast Far too expensive for what you get , Nothing
11614,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wifi was really bad in the room and the whole place was being renovated So there was really loud noise all day This renovation was not mentioned while booking and the price was still very high despite this renovation I felt completely cheated ,No Positive
11615,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The nearest tube station Kings Cross is at least 15 min walk away The smoke alarm rang shrilly without any reason thrice on our first of three nights effectively spoiling the night s sleep , Room had 2 comfortable double beds Bathroom was clean and spacious Fridge with complimentary goodies was a nice touch 
11616,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was quite difficult to hail a taxi in the morning , The room was clean and comfortable and quite adequate for our one night stay before catching Eurostar from St Pancras 
11617,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Noisy hotel under reconstruction Relatively far from King s cross station Mold in the bathroom We were awakened by the sound of the drill around 8 a m I would definetely not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
11618,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, View from room Building works This was probably why the cost was so reasonable, Bed comfy newly refurbished room Very reasonably priced for central london
11619,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Housekeepers too keen and should check reception for who has checked out Knocked and walked straight in twice when I was in bed , Newly refurbished room was lovely Friendly efficient reception Breakfast not out of world but perfectly acceptable 
11620,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Location was a 15min walk from nearest tube and walking back in the evening through fairly quiet streets was a little intimidating, The new rooms were lovely very comfortable and great selection at breakfast
11621,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, When we booked we specifically requested on site parking was told 20 for overnight stay when we arrived car park was posed and had been since January so we had to wks to another car park and paid 9 more poor service from booking com We had to report that bedtime had long black hairs on it tea cups and saucers were filthy Whole stay felt like we had been cheated out of our money wouldn t stay again,No Positive
11622,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel was undergoing refurbishment works so was noisy in working hours but acknowledge this is unavoidable , The room was a good size with sofa and it was clean and comfortable The breakfast buffet which was included in the room rate offered lots of choice including cooked or fruit cereal etc 
11623,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing really nearest tube kings cross 15 mn walk just marginally too far especially if you ve mobility issues Refurbishment not yet fully completed but seems most floors now done, Stayed in newly refurbished rooms excellent
11624,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfast a little disappointing hot food was lovely but very limited fresh fruit no berries Pastries very dry and again very poor selection Was not offered toast unable to toast bread ourselves, Room nice and spacious big bed comfortable and very clean 
11625,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There was lot of construction noise as renovation on few floors were going on The rate is too high compared to what they offer Not worth the price we paid , The bed was comfy
11626,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Staff were not very pleasant They seemed to do there job with efficiency but with little customer service motivation A friendly smile along with a genuineness wouldn t go a miss , For purpose of my business in London it was nearby It was clean and nicely decorated 
11627,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No parking due to refurb Outside of the building would benefit a clean in upper regions to reflect the clean inside but i expect this is in the pipeline after work is completed , lovely new refurbished rooms very clean and warm and quiet very friendly staff Good location 
11628,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Thick yoghurt please , The fact that the room we stayed in had been refurbished to a good standard Bed very comfortable Ten minutes walk from Kings Cross All staff very cheerful 
11629,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, if I have to maker a comment um the lifts get a bit busy in the morning and staying on the 8th floor I was to lazy to use the stairs but otherwise nothing, great room good break fast friendly staff felt very relaxed 
11630,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Refurbishment in progress so only 2 lifts working for the whole hotel and NO FOOD available after 11pm not even bar snacks , Good room which had just been refurbished 
11631,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Refurbishment in progress Only one of the two elevators would stop at our floor Going upstairs downstairs was a nightmare Room was quite small , The location is good Bus 63 brings you basically anywhere The bed was extremely comfortable 
11632,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The guy in the restaurant area wasn t very attentive I had to track him down to get a refill of water , It s close to St Pancras International kings cross station so quite easy to get about town It s clean and comfortable 
11633,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Pillows not comfy Had a sofa bed which I was told when we checked in that it would be made up later We arrived back at the hotel to find it not made spoke to reception was told someone would be there in 10 mins that didn t happen Second call made to reception to be told that it could be 5 mins but couldn t really give me a definable time Finally some arrived half an hour after bringing it to there attention This is the last thing I wanted after a long day and all my son wanted to do is go to bed Other than that breakfast was very nice Reception staff could be more friendly and informative There was a English man by the luggage who was very friendly and helpful 
11634,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, They did not solve my WiFi issues but instead ran me in circles with various excuses that were inconsistent Some would say it s out of service other would say there are dark spots in hotel one tried to help for 30 second and gave up They seemed understaffed and willing to give random answers without trying to help I was there for business and won t return Also Non dairy breakfast options were inadequate , Not much
11635,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Stop the bloody constant alarm going off and oh my god let the potential customers know that there is construction happening at the hotel Cant believe all the above compared to the expensive price at the same time Diagraceful WIFI as my 2G network would be far better than their silly snail like WIFI Disgraceful for them to also charge to use the swimming pool 3 10 rating , Shower and bed
11636,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The fire alarm went off at 2 am then noisy renovation going on in the morning but we weren t there to sleep , Breakfast was excellent We had an unfurnished room but it was in great condition Staff friendly
11637,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Very disappointed to find no tea and coffee facilities in the room Plus there were builders drilling in the room next door on a Sunday morning which caused disturbance to our sleep , Luxurious bed excellent quality furnishings beautiful bathroom great location 
11638,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wasn t happy with the Internet wifi signal very frustratingly kept disconnectin and the tv was difficult to use regarding your films opinion tried to press menu just didn t bother in the end however it s not like I d not stay again I did think was a very nice helpful staff, I did like how pleasant and helpful the staff where right from booking in to booking out They tried hard to overcome my problems as much as they could
11639,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The place is under construction so was woken in the morning and couldn t sleep in the day There should have been a discount , The location was great Breakfast was great
11640,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wifi is poor And you get kick out all the time So you have to put in the id and password again which is not friendly Wifi is probabely the top on the necessity list Having to keeping in the id and password is really pain , Very comfortable beds Hotel is be renovated at the moment and we got new rooms Is nice when you get to use new things and room Location of the hotel is a distant to Kings cross underground But take the bus 63 the frequency is good Hotel staff should recommend option to take bus or walk which is 18 minutes walk 
11641,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The extremely slow wifi and the 2 device only limitation There should be a shower door as well to keep water from splashing to the toilet , The refurnished room was great the bed was comfortable The airconditioning actually works as hotel aircons are not very functionable 
11642,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Noisy neighbours at a ridiculous hour but was very well handled by staff Thin walls , Loved that everything was as expected Comfy EVERYTHING Great view of the sunset from window 
11643,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Only issue was the noise was horrendous A lot worse than expected and very early in the morning all weekend , Staff were amazing Tom and so helpful Room was nice and bed comfy 
11644,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We know the hotel was being refurbished and from the comments on Booking com and so we were expecting to stay in a refurbished room Besides this we asked on the reservation for a room in the upper floors They gave us room 201 an old room where you can see dust everywhere and lots of faulty things You can also hear EVERYTHING in the corridors and rooms nearby from people walking talking and having a shower It s definitely far from being a 4 hotel When I complained about not having a refurbished room at the checkout the only thing I was told was you should have asked , Full english breakfast with plenty of choice Good location considering the price If you have the oyster card or a travelcard you can easily get the bus number 40 to King s Cross Station and from there access any zone of London The concierge was very helpful and nice 
11645,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The construction was unpleasant and the un upgraded portions were lacking Staff not particularly empathetic to the effect of the construction on their guests It s not as close to Kings Cross station as I thought the name is a bit deceiving , The upgraded rooms were nice shows the potential 
11646,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Noise from outside and inside Acoustic is not so good Gym to be paid extra , Hotel newly refurbished spacious room very pleasant and functional desk properly adapted to work Good breakfast 
11647,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We were unaware there was an extra charge for the pool as we were looking forward to a swim after a day of sight seeing , The staff were pleasant There was a very good breakfast and the room was very comfortable 
11648,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We were placed in a smoking room on arrival despite our booking specifically stating that we had booked a non smoking room This room was disgusting dingy and it reeked of stale smoke Staff told us the hotel was fully booked and so we were unable to be moved that night We were also woken up by drilling at 8am , After the smoking room fiasco the manager was quick to change our room the next day 
11649,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Nothing, The staff were so polite Checked into our room early which was brilliant Beds were very comfortable and the food smelt delicious Also had a free leave your luggage service Couldn t fault the hotel at all can t wait to go back 
11650,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We would have liked some information for tourists with a list of top rated restaurants in the area local travel services how to get to the main London attractions and local knowledge No services such as preloaded travel cards and a map of the area were offered Luckily we had our smartphones with us otherwise it would have been difficult to navigate where we wanted to go , Staff were extremely helpful We booked a superior room for our anniversary and it was so quiet and nicely decorated with some nice touches Breakfast was included in our price and it was well cooked and warm 
11651,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Don t stay if looking for space, Gorgeous new refurbishment however very annoying during stay Smaller than expected quite cramped overall feeling to the hotel
11652,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Didn t consider it value for money 200 pp didn t even include breakfast Had to pay extra for a swim which I wasn t Aware of until I arrived Unfortunately on arrival Internet didn t work and neither did TV , Comfortable bed and lovely and clean 
11653,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The staff were not good with English very surprising given we were in the uk The breakfast was poor The lifts inadequate for the size of the hotel , The room was modern and clean 
11654,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Horrendous noise from building works Aware that improvements were being made to some bedrooms but not informed of the sheer scale of noise coming from the extensive refurbishment of the reception area We couldn t get away from the noise both in our room and in the spa Disappointed a charge now applies for the leisure facilities Staff unable to help at times had to ask 3 members of staff the same question and none of them understood English , Location and facilities on 1st impression
11655,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, they claimed on there website that this was a 5 10 min walk this is completely incorrect we walked for approxamitly 20 mins from kings cross, breakfast was great
11656,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The car park had been closed for building work meaning that we had no where to park the car I was not informed of this prior to our stay and this was one of the main reasons why we booked this hotel The receptionist brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to park in an NCP car park costing us 10 extra in parking fees Was not happy with this service at all,No Positive
11657,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Breakfest room is hot and old style Breakfest menu is simple Elevators are slow and not sufficiant for such a big hotel Maybe because of ongoing reconstruction , Refurbished modern room
11658,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, nothing, Spacious room very comfortable bed and pillows were just right made for welcome sleep well stocked bathroom toiletries very strong wifi signal whole time I was there Self service english breakfast which you just helped yourself welcome benefit to go back for more I got to breakfast late and staff were starting to clear away but I did get my meal and staff encouraged me to help myself to more food There is a small car park at front entrance about a dozen or so cars so if anyone needs to park a car I suppose you need to contact reception to reserve a space although I didn t need it just thought I d mention it for others 
11659,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Building work meant that the common areas of hotel are limited and cramped Breakfast was not great Dining room lacks comfort or style Although newly refurbished room felt too small , reception staff were great Room was newly refurbished
11660,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel is a bit hard to reach It s 15 minutes walking to St Pancras Kings Cross It s not a super pleasant walk I must say , Our room was very big and confortable You couldn t hear any noise which is very remarkable for London 
11661,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The spa jacuzzi too powerful and steam room burning hot Lounge area was poor, The beds and pillows were comfy The staff were helpful and friendly room was clean
11662,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Very poor overall for money spent Drilling started first thing in the morning Room very expensive and dumped into non refurbished area Lifts complete nightmare Spent 35 MINUTES trying to get lift to ground floor Not impressed at all Barely adequate room at ridiculously expensive price The bedrooms that have not been refurbished yet shouldn t be used as not up to standard Or offer them at lower price Very disappointed , Location
11663,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not the cleanest of hotels and lots of building works going on making it very noisy in the day The spa facility s charge also , Good sized room and bathroom but the windows do not open in the smoking rooms making it very stuffy 
11664,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Air conditioning was adequate but would have liked if the window opened for some fresh air Lock on bathroom was faulty but should be easily fixed by the maintenance dept , Great room Quiet Good view on 7th floor Great staff sho were ever present and ever helpful 
11665,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wifi didnt work very well but other than that no complaints , Great location rooms were of a very high standard not what i was expecting for a holiday inn definitely will come again 
11666,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We stayed in room 407 WIfI wasn t good at all it never worked The design of the bath made it difficult to get in and out plus the water never went that warm The tv had a very limited amount of channels compared to other hotels we have stayed , The room was very nice and had a comfy bed 
11667,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, There was construction work outside but no problems couldn t hear anything in the mornings , Stayed two nights in this hotel and can not recommend it enough will definitely be coming back for another stay here The rooms were fantastic very clean and modern Provided Safe in the room television and free wifi I stayed on the fifth floor Wifi was free was giving a token and no problems Only 10min walk from the underground Kings Cross station and international railway Staff were very friendly and helpful Area is very safe 
11668,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, for a large luxury hotel very tight with their complimentary items Had a double room with 1 bottle of still and 1 bottle of sparkling water 1 kitkat and 1 packet of biscuits containing 2 biscuits with the coffee tea , location brilliant for the O2 islington Very quiet area but close to the center of London if you were here a while
11669,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Spa and pool area is very nice even though it is not included in hotel price and room was very clean Bed was also comfy Overall a very pleasant stay 
11670,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The car park was advertised as open it was closed They did not advertise that you had to pay for the gym I have never heard of that before in a hotel The lifts did not work and they did not put up a sign saying so we were put on the smoking floor they serve terrible wine at the bar The place is under refurbishment and needs it the whole place needs it , Nothing really
11671,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Building operations and lack of signage outside the hotel indicating the entrance made access a guess , Very firm but comfortable bed Large room with sofa 
11672,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It is implied that the gym is included in the price It isn t and you have to pay 3 50 The gym equipment is dated and doesn t justify this extra expense There is also work going on at the hotel at the moment , Lovely clean and spacious room
11673,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Bed very comfortable room quiet and peaceful Restaurant staff efficient and welcoming They were doing their very busy job well whilst maintaining a calm unhurried atmosphere in the breakfast room well done There was an air of quiet respect no clattering of crockery etc The staff clearly take a pride in their work 
11674,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Although there is air conditioning in the room the windows are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air in the room A definite negative point for me , The staff were friendly and helpful The room very quiet with adequate facilities 
11675,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, booked the hotel solely on the strength that there was parking and a punch bag in the gym arrived at the hotel to find there was neither parking was unavailable due to refurbishment forcing us to use a NCP car park down the road for 28 per night punch bag had been taken down ages ago according to member of staff on the gym desk although still showed it being up in the hotel pics, rooms where pretty nicely furnished
11676,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, This is my threatment upon attemting to checking in Unfortunatley you booked through booking com Unfortunatley you havent paid yet Unfortunatley your room is not ready yet 12 15 and i had advised at booking stage Unfortunatley your card is not authorized On checking in something went wronh with my card I asked were was the nearest atm and i withdrew the ammount from the same card and the same card worked fine everywhere else No attempt from the lady to try it out again At this point i was already feeling pretty unfortunate Wifi was barley at my room 414 1 signal bar There are refurbishing underway and i would have loved to know if i was aware at booking stage The concierge on the otherhand were sublime in fact thats the only reason i scored better the service welldone to the concierge, Clean spacious
11677,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Little bit of nose due to the refurbishment but nothing we couldn t handle , The rooms was newly refurbished and very clean It was absolutely fine for our over night stay 
11678,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I booked with your hotel as it was meant to have a bath and on arriving it never had one do I was very dissapointed ALso I put the label on my door saying do not disturb but still room service knocked 3times aldo building was going on on it was extremely noisy I till report it but was told nothing could be done , It was clean 
11679,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, the hotel is under going renovations you can hear the drilling the location is not ideal nearest tube station is 12 min walk the staff and the concierge were not not helping at all not we had to handle our bags out and in a stared entrance and when complained about the drilling the simply asked us to leave instead of offering some kind of compensation, The rooms are new clean and spacious by london standards
11680,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wifi should be complimentary , I liked the location of the hotel in relation to King s Cross Station The staff at the hotel were friendly very helpful and very efficient particularly with regard to our dietary request for soya milk for breakfast I would recommend and plan on staying at this hotel in the near future 
11681,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The size of the room was disappointing especially as ours was a supposedly superior room Once the travel cot had been installed we could hardly move Also storage was an issue Both these issues made having the buggy in the room very difficult , Location good and rooms clean and in good state of repair 
11682,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The female Reception staff English speaking levels weren t great had to get them to repeat questions on a few occasions Walls were obviously very thin because we had the room next door complain that we were laughing to loudly at 11pm however come 8am the next morning their baby woke us up with its crying double edged sword really Hotel isnt a close walk to a Tube station nor is it located with any real tourist points of interest I personally dont care about that as im a Londoner but i do feel its location is abit of a pain because you have to get a Bus to the nearest tube if your not a fan of rain or walking , The room was very clean and modern Lovely bathroom Sofa and double bed decent sized TV and good blacked out curtains 
11683,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Bar area needs an upgrade , Rooms recently refurbished smart modern comfy At the price we paid value for money Not sure if the special rate will always be available Hotel being totally re furbished no noise during evening times 
11684,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website Which we hadn t used to book They also said work was happening 9 5 but on the second day we were woken before 8 30am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook On the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery It was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round , The shower was nice
11685,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Bed was very soft my personal preference is very hard Broken window latch so room got cold overnight Faulty power outlet and wifi had a weak signal it only worked when I stood by the door , Plenty of pillows well decorated room and good sized bath Easy check in and staff were keen to offer a partial refund due to the issues I had when I notified in the morning 
11686,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Work been carried out at hotel which I was aware but not the fact car park will be closed also Should have been clearer prior to booking Closest car park 5 mins walk not great about 4am in the morning with rain Hotel car park is very small not many parking spaces , Good location heart of central London close approximity of to do things in London 
11687,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel is about a mile from the nearest tube at Kings Cross Station which is not made clear on the website Walking in the evening from the tube station along Kings Cross road was not very pleasant , Comfortable and spacious room lovely bathroom 
11688,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, building work going on to refurbish the hotel but stops around 5 o clock, This hotel is excellent I stay at a lot of hotels in London and this is value for money refurbished to a high standard
11689,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, TV broke minor disruption caused by ongoing refurbishment no complimentary tea coffee water provided , Comfy room newly refurbished Good food Friendly competent service Good value 
11690,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, I had a refurbished room and it was perfect I got room service everyone was amazingly friendly The best hotel service I ve had Very good value for money The food was lush The room was very clean and comfortable and modern And even though there was works happening in the hotel there was very little disruption
11691,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The car park was closed no information given at time of booking Rude ignorant unhelpful staff told me to go to another hotel that was their only offer of help I will never use this chain of hotels again ,No Positive
11692,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Dissapointed we weren t told about renovations in progress and the car park being closed during the renovations , Nice clean Comfortable rooms modern bathrooms with good shower
11693,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Hotel parking is closed due to refurbishment so had to park in the NCP which was expensive Also a shame there isn t a tube station closer by but that s hardly something te hotel can control , Not a bad price and the steam room in the leisure centre was a decent temperature Also one of the things we like about the location was discovering the nearby village with very good restaurants 
11694,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Reception bar and restaurant area are all being refurbished later this year which will bring them up to the standard of the rest of the refurbed rooms , The newly refurbished bedroom and shower room were great Very comfy bed spacious room excellent shower Would definitely stay here again Great to have the spa facilities
11695,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Difficult to get a cab despite only a short walk to the stations it was raining clearly not the hotels fault though , Really helpful friendly staff and ongoing refurb had no impact on stay Short walk to Faringdon or King s Cross stations
11696,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The 8th floor has a constant hum it would be useful if reception staff informed guests of that when they arrive I had to be moved at 3am as I struggled to sleep , Staff very helpful room of high quality
11697,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The first room was not what had been booked It was also on a smoking corridor Although the room was non smoking opening the door on to the corridor was horrid the smell of smoke was pervasive I also thought the bathroom was tired grouting stained and unpleasant , The staff were very helpful and friendly Responding quickly to the request to move rooms The second room was great clean comfortable and roomy also the corridor smelt fragrant Throughout the stay the staff were helpful giving advise where to park and looking after the bags after we checked out Breakfast was a feast fresh wide choice and relaxed atmosphere 
11698,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Not in the best location due to distances to tubes or kings cross but only a short walk or quick taxi ride 5 , Very comfortable newly refurbed room on the 7th floor very friendly staff
11699,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, N A, Very accommodating and friendly staff who went the extra mile to make sure my needs were met offered advice for around London and extended my stay when required Beautiful clean modern room with excellent facilities You d be hard pushed to find a hotel this quality at this price anywhere else in London and I ve stayed in a few 
11700,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The hotel bar staf were not very friendly the larger was flat and not cold and when we complained we were not understood and were given the same flat drink The pool was smaller than we thought and busy , The bed was comfortable the service from reception was very good the room was very clean 
11701,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, We couldn t use the pool on both mornings because it was full Apparently they only allow max of 12 ppl and they charge you to use the facilities even as a hotel guest When we checked in they assigned us the old room which was outdated and the bed was worn down I literally felt veryigo just lying on the bed Worst of all they gave us a room right below the renovation work so there were loud bangings drilling and sanding in the morning My 7month old woke up in a startle from the banging and sicked My husband was fuming because the staff at reception wasnt very helpful until he demanded to speak to the manager who moved us to a higher floor to the newly renovated room ,No Positive
11702,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, It was an excellent place to stay no negatives , Very warm welcome clean and comfortable rooms Close to Kings Cross and Euston stations I would recommend this hotel 
11703,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, on arrival I was given a room card three times I had to return to reception as the cards would not open the door on the occasion prior to my third visit to reception I had telephoned from the corridor telephone and was informed a concierge would meet me at my room with a new card to open my room door I waited almost 15 minutes for this to happen and then decided to return to reception where my room card was again exchanged and I was escorted to my room to ensure the card worked which it did at no point through this 30 minute experience was an apology given for the frustration The hotel Bar also looked tired and the bar tender obviously wasn t aware he could keep the surface free from spilt drinks or polish the wood to reduce its stickyness my colleague that booked the day prior also gained a better rate for his room by 12 I use Holiday as often as possible and usually have a very easy care free stay this occasion could have been better, Location
11704,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The staff have no customer service skills was put in a smoking room when asked to be placed in a non smoking We asked to be moved and was sent to the second floor where someone was bringing up the keys waited for 15 mins in gowns outside the room The resraunt was closed and was unable to eat i strongly urge you not to go to this establishment and I won t be using the company again, Wasn t able to even enjoy the spa facilities which was the only thing that looked half decent also get a room on the 5th floor up Anything below that is getting refurbished or the very basic room where they put me and my partner along with a few other couples who all booked on booking com 
11705,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Wasn t as close to kings cross as you think 10 15 min walk depending how fast you walk , Beds were comfortable and the leisure facilities looked good but didn t use and didn t use restaurant so can t comment
11706,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Very rude member of staff at breakfast Firstly it was noticeable that those who had breakfast included in their stay were shunted off to a side room which was far dingier than the dining room used for those who were paying extra for breakfast On asking a member of staff for some butter having been unable to find some on the buffet she rudely grunted that it is on the buffet and walked away The sauna facility in the spa was in poor repair especially considering the additional fee for use Despite these minor grumbles the hotel offered great value for money and I would stay again , The room had recently been refurbished and was in excellent repair We also arrived to complimentary soft drinks and a snack in the mini fridge which was lovely The value was fantastic with breakfast included 
11707,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance There was renovation on some floors but overall no impact for me to the stay during this visit as a new room was allocated from onset , Newly refurbished rooms were great hotel staff was excellent and very accommodating Once renovations are finished it will be an excellent hotel for business travelers 
11708,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance substantial renovation on floors and lobby meant that as a business traveler it was not a hassle free stay Hotel management changed me to a new room 1 day after arrival which was great but booking com should have notified of this situation upon booking this hotel , Newly refurbished rooms were great hotel staff was excellent and very accommodating Once renovations are finished it will be an excellent hotel for business travelers 
11709,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I didn t find the staff helpful at all I hadn t been in that area before and asked a few staff for advice on where to go for eating and shopping There response was short and not very pleasant Breakfast was included in our stay but was cold and not tasty at all, The hotel room was clean and spacious Good location for the work I was over for but not central if I was there for a leisure break 
11710,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Hotel staffs were not trained at all The receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name Holiday Inn I called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before I finished talking I Just could not believe it Also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when I booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around I made a complain when I checked in but the receptionist accused me I was wrong that I did not check Holiday inn website That was very very rude of her saying and I was pretty upset If people book through booking com or Expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance I was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect If you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you They are in London but they DO NOT have mentality as British I RECOMMEND NOT TO CHOSE THIS HOTEL IF YOU EXPECT EXCELLENT SERVICE FROM FAMOUS BRAND NAME , Absolutely None 
11711,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The car park was closed as refurbishment going on this wasn t advertised at time of booking and car parking at an extra charge was a main reason for choosing this hotel We were disappointed on arrival to find no parking available Had to park a 10 minute walk away , Clean and comfy with a good breakfast choice 
11712,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The beds sounds like you are sleeping in a carrier bag Due to this one thing I slept only 1 hour the whole night The shower also naturally floods the bathroom making it unpleasant for the next person to take a shower when you share Only one bathrobe for 2 people only 1 floor towel for 2 people plus floor towel useless due to extreme flooding in the bathroom , It was a very clean environment with very friendly and helpful staff 
11713,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, I walked to to hotel and although it s about 15 mins walk from Kings Cross station but I didn t realise its on a bus route with frequent buses to Kings Cross Although hotel isn t near any tube stations its easy to get to Kings Cross for tube etc , I stayed in newly refurbished 7th floor room which was excellently finished new bed decor furniture and bathroom aswell as great view of city Very comfortable bed and pillows great wifi signal in room too I had dinner at night in restaurant and very tasty food Helpful staff and even better they also have separate concierge desk who ll give you lots of information about anything you need to know Frequent buses to Kings Cross pass hotel and into city Just a short few minute walk away from hotel is Rosebery Avenue where several buses go to city 
11714,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Staff polite friendly and very helpful all went out of their way to help me with all my queries Room clean comfortable and as expected Hotel easy to walk to from Kings Cross or Faringdon 
11715,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Second hotel we ve stayed in and we have stayed in quite a few that doesn t have a wee biscuit with the tea coffee tray , Very bright and welcoming
11716,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The breakfast was very good but it was expensive , Very nice hotel and good location Nice room and friendly staff We liked the swimmingpool and the sauna a lot The breakfast was good and we liked it very much 
11717,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Tv was annoying Water made skin burn Indian restaurant not great but few options nearby when raining Alarm went off multiple times during the night without any announcement Thin walls Changes in nightly rates were extreme as was cost of breakfast , Generally very nice Rooms reasobable Location great as near kings cross but away from the craziness Short walk to City University 
11718,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bath was too small, When we arrived in the room all we could hear was loud drilling above us to the point we went out and was then woken up at 9am on the Saturday morning again to loud drilling above us so again we went out We could have been made aware of this when we checked in 
11719,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Asked for a quite room but was woken during the night by a noisy child next door or above me a few times Corridor fire doors need improving to close quietly after noisy late guests fling them open , The bathroom and room were much improved on a hotel close by I have stayed in before 
11720,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The fire alarm went off with 3 sounds at 1 22am nothing was said about it They charge almost 5 per hr for WiFi we stayed at another holiday inn a few weeks previously Wi Fi was free , We had a smoking room which is unusual to get these days Room was clean comfy 
11721,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, Room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon Mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto Might sound like I m being fussy but if you re dropping 10 15 on a sandwich you least expect it to be right Also the hotel was cheaper 100 a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at 9am on a Sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head We rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a Sunday morning even with the discount , Rooms look new and are modern with a lovely bathroom with rain shower and a comfy bed with huge tv 
11722,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No coat hooks in bedroom Breakfast food was passable have recently had better breakfast buffet at another hotel My partner thought the hash browns were too greasy , Hotel room was very clean and fresh also the gym and swimming pool was very impressive Location very near Kings Cross a 10 brisk minute walk 
11723,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, The room was a decent size clean and tidy the bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows The distant from the station was okay just a short walk 
11724,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, They have some parking but they reserve it for thier managers Not what they told me after I drove for two hours becuase they said it would be ok to get parked The recommended the ncp down the road in Farringdon do not use it it is like a scene from a horror film and I doubt your car would be there in the morning , The refurbished rooms are excellent and the beds are so much better than other chain hotels 
11725,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, No halal in breakfast , Staff were helpful especially Marco the concierge The location is great 10 min From Kings Cross Station The breakfast was delicious and the bed very comfortable 
11726,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Very good value for the money we paid and this in central London Clean comfortable and with amenities like a pool we didn t have the time to use it unfortunately Will definitely come back and spend more time here 
11727,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, A good 15 minute walk from train tube station expensive for what s on offer better quality hotels in London for similar cost, Clean fresh room polite staff
11728,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, A mix up on my booking made me quite annoyed when I checked in One receptionist couldn t do much to assist but another redeemed the situation and allocated me the room i had booked ,No Positive
11729,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The bed was uncomfortable mattress far too hard Shocked at having to pay 3 50 each to use gym and pool never had to do this at any other Hotel I hav stayed at as always been free for guests really disappointing, The Indian food from the in house restaurant was delicious 
11730,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, WiFi did not work Rooms never ever had 30 square metres as advertised they had a maximum of 20 Matresses were worn out , Quiet location though still central
11731,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, The Bar staff were not very friendly The toilets for the foyer bar area and restaurant are in the basement which is too far away Cost of wifi is ridiculous In this day and age wifi is generaly free everywhere I was thoroughly disappointed to see this hotel charged for such a basic service This would definitely make me think twice about staying there again , The room was very comfortable and clean The Indian restaurant was also excellent Location was good 
11732,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, They put us in a diabled room for some reason the walls were so thin you heard everything soup dispenser empty hair dryer not working , Nothing to shout about 
11733,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross, staff rude and impolite, very uncooperative staff very unfriendly and rude impolite and did not help will never go again and won t recommend to anyone
11734,Crowne Plaza London Kings Cross,No Negative, Room was newly refurbished and immaculate Two choices of shower head which was great Bed super comfy No noise from outside Great and friendly staff Pool jacuzzi steam room and sauna are fab as are changing facilities and the fact towels are provided Plus there s a spinny thing to dry your swim clothes Breakfast was delivered by room service on time and nice and hot Thank you
