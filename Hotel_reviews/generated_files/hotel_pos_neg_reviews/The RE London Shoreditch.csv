186892,The RE London Shoreditch, Housekeeping knocking to check if we checked out at 9 am , The room the underground parking and that it had a restaurant bar Also the option of leaving the car in the car park till 8pm on the day of check out for a 10 fee 
186893,The RE London Shoreditch, The bed is not comfy at all The bathroom is OK but the shower space is so wee , I liked everything except the bed shower Very good value for money 
186894,The RE London Shoreditch, There were problems with bathroom fittings We informed the hotel staff during our visit , The room was fairly spacious for London and was comfortable The tea and coffee making facilities and free water were good 
186895,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Just a nice place to stay good air con great location friendly staff quiet bedrooms Great dinner at nearby Broadway market a great nights sleep
186896,The RE London Shoreditch, We had booked two rooms next to each other and had ordered food when we came back from the engagement party We were all in one room chatting and eating the food we had ordered A hotel staff member knocked on the door and told us there were too many people in the room There were 4 people in the room We told him we had booked two rooms He asked us to show him proof we had done so He was very rude and arrogant We told him to go and check the booking system downstairs He even threatened to call the Police we told him to go ahead as we were not doing anything wrong , The room was clean and decent After reading reviews on trip advisor we were hesitate to stay as a previous guest had complained about bed bugs We checked the mattress when we got there and it was clean and bedbug free We were NOT bitten in the night Our stay was ok It was a good location to Shoreditch 
186897,The RE London Shoreditch, Underground parking is a bit too pricey but i think that s normal in London We were about 10 15min late to check out from the room so we had like three different women knock on the door and hurry us up that was a bit annoying , Good location tasty breakfast and comfortable decent sized room 
186898,The RE London Shoreditch, uncomfortable bed pillows No safe in rooms , You get what you pay for really Hotel wasn t in greatest location nor was it the fanciest but was okay for how much we paid 
186899,The RE London Shoreditch, Nothing all positive for London anyway posdibly a little pricey, Great location room clean and comfortable bed air conditioning staff exceptionally helpful overall a good experience
186900,The RE London Shoreditch, The person who checked me in on the reception desk was miserable and unhelpful Added no value and provided no information passed me a form to sign and the key and didn t even tell me where the room was When I asked simply pointed to the lift He said 2 or three words to me came across rude and in my opinion should never work in a customer service role , The room was clean spacious and comfortable 
186901,The RE London Shoreditch, I travelled light so managed to leave the card I had booked our room on at home When I realised I presumed it would be fine seeing as the hotel had already taken the money months earlier At check in the hotel said they needed the card I explained I didn t have it but they kept saying they couldn t do anything without it I explained that I couldn t spend 3 hours travelling home to get it They said all they could do would be to refund the original money and I d have to pay again I explained that I didn t have 300 in my account to pay again so wouldn t be able to do so until the refund had cleared and I could therefore transfer it over They said they just needed the card to take a payment of 1p and then would refund it I then remembered I had the card on my phone via apple pay They explained this wouldn t be possible as they don t have contactless card machines At this point we were at a stalemate She went to speak to the manager who said there was nothing they could do and these were the rules I then asked to speak to the manager directly When he came out I explained I could prove the card was mine and could also pay the penny on it via apple pay plus queried why it mattered when they had already taken the money therefore I couldn t exactly do a runner He said it had to be that card but then said he would take payment at the bar on the contactless machine there So after 10 minutes of back and forth and him saying via the first receptionist that he couldn t do anything it was resolved in 30 seconds of speaking to him I completely understand the rules are in place for fraud protection and am pleased they take it seriously but I didn t expect a modern hotel to tell me that they can t take my payment as they don t have a contactless machine despite having them 1 foot away behind the bar , Rooms are nice free tea coffee and water 
186902,The RE London Shoreditch, Room service knocking on the door at 9am when check out was 11 anyway The cleaners could have been informed of this and room cleaned towels sheets changed after we had checked out , The location being a 10 minute walk from where we needed to be easy check in and out helpful staff always on hand 
186903,The RE London Shoreditch, The location is a bit grim The hotel is basic and ideal for travellers on a budget , The staff were helpful and the breakfast was good We booked it because it was relatively close to where we were attending training and was less expensive than other hotels in the area 
186904,The RE London Shoreditch, The deposit system crazy young couple come to london for the night you have to find 50 on a card or 100 cash or you can t check in The room was only 100 How about deal with the way you provide your sales after check in rather than make your guest pay silly deposits , Good position good value 
186905,The RE London Shoreditch, Breakfast not included extra charge Late check out 3 hours 40 Pound , Clean room Comfortable bed Nice bathroom Good choice for Breakfast Nice and friendly staff 
186906,The RE London Shoreditch, I bought this trip for my son he was asked for a 50 deposit which he had no problem paying in cash as he s 18 years old and does not have credit cards They wouldn t except his cash and where not going to let him stay He had to phone me in Spain and luckily I had the card with me Basically this was his first trip for him and his girlfriend to London and they felt frightened as they didn t think they could stay as it took awhile to contact me So no I wouldn t recommend this hotel, No bed bugs which I had read in a different review after I booked it 
186907,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Super handy loctaion 5 minute walk from Cambridge Heath station and plenty of convience stores around to pick up supplies The air con was perfect Very hot weekend in London so great to come back to a cold room which seems to be rare among hotels these days Great value money nice vibe about the hotel and super friendly staff
186908,The RE London Shoreditch, I phoned down for room service and simply said it was unavailable I also put the please clean my room sign on my door and that was ignored ,No Positive
186909,The RE London Shoreditch, This hotel is slipping in quality The beds need to be upgraded Our mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable The night staff the day I arrived were surly and unhelpful A little manners training is in order , It was very hot in London and the air conditioning worked 
186910,The RE London Shoreditch, The shower was poor fixed unit only and the control switch went from cold to hot too quickly making it difficult to set a suitable temperature , The room was quiet The blackout curtains were effective 
186911,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Nice helpful staff they had upgraded my room this time as I ve been many times before Lovely quite room as requested great location usually use parking which is great Fridge is very handy 
186912,The RE London Shoreditch, The hotel s incidental policy is disappointingly over zealous and very premium at 50 Further away from Shoreditch Liverpool Street station than expected You d need to use TfL bus to benefit from other Tube station locations , Friendly professional staff Spacious room Facilities Location in a hipster area of East London close to Hackney City Farm Walking distance to overground station regular bus route in Hackney road
186913,The RE London Shoreditch, Room was extremely warm could not get air con below 19c but the room was definitely warmer than that and uncomfortable to sleep in Not a great location for tube , Room was clean and comfortable 
186914,The RE London Shoreditch, no safe in the room but at reception which was ok but a little inconvenient, pleasant area bus stop into town right at the hotel tea and coffee set ironing board in the rooms 
186915,The RE London Shoreditch, I had cold room service one evening and ate in the restaurant the next Serving staff very polite and helpful but the food was not very good Tube ride here can feel like too much on a long day , Good spacious room good tea and coffee facilities and complimentary water Small touch but important many more expensive hotels have started charging for the bottled water in the room which I think is outrageous There was a sign offering complimentary toiletries if forgotten in addition to usual shower stuff etc which I thought was a nice touch I didn t need this but it was a good offer 
186916,The RE London Shoreditch, nothing to not like, Easy to get to from the train or tube stations Rooms all had air con it was the England s summer weekend Comfortable beds free water in fridge although we only had one bottle our son had two this was sparkling which I am not a fan of anyway Shower bathroom clean and good water pressure 
186917,The RE London Shoreditch, The area of hotel has a little dangerous atmosphere at night If you care about that please make sure around on google street view before booking , It is convenient place to explore for shoreditch area Bus stop is just front of the hotel Cambridge Heath station of overground line is a block near there 
186918,The RE London Shoreditch, Entrance was filthy covered in cigarette butts cigarette disposals were broken and hadn t been cleaned in a long time Check in was difficult as and all reception interaction as English was not the first language of reception staff leading to a misunderstanding with staff on payment No one available to help with bags and no trolley immediately available Homeless beggars always hanging around the entrance to the hotel the TVs in the room were flatish but square SQUARE haven t seen one since the mid 90s Furniture in hotel was falling apart holes in the arms of chairs in public spaces AC was only turned on after asking reception despite heat wave All Pillows were mismatched This is not the hotel it appears do not pay more than 100 pounds a night, The burger was surprisingly good nearby shops and restaurants were great
186919,The RE London Shoreditch, The breakfast food quality is the worst ever Internet connection is very slow if you re considering using it for your work purposes forget it Towels where worn out and dirty , I got a quite room air conditioning was working well 
186920,The RE London Shoreditch, Their seemed to be a lack of communication between staff on arrival I stated that my mother had made the payment so therefore I did not have the card on me the receptionist then stated I had to ask my mother to email her card details with a picture copy of her bank card which we did after a delay of over 40 minutes I finally was able to check in Two days later on check out a new receptionist then informed that I needed the original card my mothers to complete the check out I once again explained this was not my card I then had to make the full payment on my personal card the original payment had to be refunded to my mothers card It seemed unnecessary hassle and it added stress to my stay I felt this could have been communicated to me on check in , The location of the hotel was easily accessible Their was a nice ambiance on arrival The room was comfortable it had an ensuite with a bath which was a nice touch 
186921,The RE London Shoreditch, Front room of hotel overlooking street was noisy with traffic and sadly very unattractive views but hotel cannot change either of these Perhaps request higher floor in future , Very clean room and bathroom Bed very comfortable Shower excellent High quality finish in bathroom and good size room 
186922,The RE London Shoreditch, Reception staff were very unfriendly when checking in and had issues when trying to park as expected me to park in a very small space I have a large car which was never going to work as another car had parked shockingly in the space next to where I was asked to park which wasn t an actual parking bay but a spare small place , Good location for our needs and very clean and tidy 
186923,The RE London Shoreditch, The receptionist telling me my credit card had been blocked when she tried charging the 50 pound deposit they ask for at check in and when I phoned my bank after check out they tell me it was not blocked at all and was failure of the hotel s terminal Also being woken up by cleaning crew knocking at 9 am and then again later on near 12 when I had paid 20 pounds for late check out at 13 00 not blaming cleaning person hotel must inform them better about check outs An extremely loud alarm I couldn t locate origin of only seconds at time while finishing getting ready to leave contributed to my feeling of being a bit chased out of there Not huge issues but not things I reasonably expect from a not cheap 4 star hotel , The room excellent overall very spacious closet the size of a regular home one nice amenities free tea coffee Super comfortable bed The location very handy for my purposes 
186924,The RE London Shoreditch, We had to go back down to reception 3 times because the key cards wouldn t work We weren t the only ones on our floor with the same issues , Nice room and facilities The shower was lovely 
186925,The RE London Shoreditch, Unhelpful rude manager rooms not up to standard for the money you pay would have had a better cheaper experience if I d book the premier inn which I wish I had , The beds were comfy
186926,The RE London Shoreditch, Very over priced Was only the same as a premier inn room, Nice hotel but in a very run down area Massively expensive and relies on trade from the Olympic park stadium only 
186927,The RE London Shoreditch, Location is not great Lots of homeless people outside the hotel at night Long wait to check in out Reception staff were appalling it took over 20 mins to check in Not because of a long que but because every single person had an issue with checking in It started with them wanting to take 50 off a card for security not a problem but then it had to be the same card you booked with The room was pre paid with a different card then that had to be cancelled It just went on and on Check out was a long wait because there was a large que and once again customers having problems They need to look in to an express check in out system , Stayed in room 109 Clean spacious room with bath and large bed Bar open 24 hrs I couldn t hear any noise even though it s next to the road 
186928,The RE London Shoreditch, I have stayed here before and thought rooms were clean bed comfortable perfectly acceptable and reasonable value for London hotel On this occasion I was given a poor room that was sometimes noisy the main problem was the beds Two single beds that were spongy and felt like a camp bed to sleep on shower head also would not adjust Hopefully this was a one off ,No Positive
186929,The RE London Shoreditch, I was treated like I was in a motor vehicle bureau when actually checking in late at night Unwelcoming indifferent suspicious demeanor on the night clerk felt dodgy Room smelled heavily of cleaning products Charmless , Was reasonably priced and was treated courteously when I dropped off my bag precheckin in the morning before the work day Bed was fine 
186930,The RE London Shoreditch, The AC was much too cold and not giving the temp indicated on the control Also the lights of the AC and TV were intrusive and a mask was required to enable sleep , Very convenient to visit family
186931,The RE London Shoreditch, Hidden parking charge of 20 00 hidden deposit request of 50 00 refunded after 5 working days of checking out , Location and modern feel to room
186932,The RE London Shoreditch, Breakfast was overpriced, I know the area well from when I lived nearby and although it has become more trendy since then frankly it s still pretty rough and run down It s a short walk from Cambridge Heath overground which is limited in usefulness and a longer walk to Bethnal Green tube station and unfortunately although the buses are useful and nearby 26 and 55 they get crowded in rush hour and sometimes don t even stop to pick you up Nonetheless the good value and nice rooms make up for this and I will be staying again 
186933,The RE London Shoreditch, Aside from that very little to brag about breakfast was mediocre and rooms were barely adequate No safety deposit box and TV screen too small , positive issues first WIFI was there as advertised and the room was clean 
186934,The RE London Shoreditch, A little noisy but it is in London so that s to be expected The tv was a bit small and the hairdryer wasn t very powerful The shower scalded me as the controls are a bit confusing , Great clean rooms with everything you need plus a fridge A nice enjoy strong shower blackout curtains air conditioning nice hospitality tray 
186935,The RE London Shoreditch, Mattress was very old and sagged heavily making for an uncomfortable night There was not enough hot water meaning a cold shower in the morning The property is in a state of disrepair with torn and broken furniture in many places, Good room service dinner and spacious room
186936,The RE London Shoreditch, Our room was very cold It was actually warmer outside At one point we had to open our door and window to get heat We called down twice and was told that the heat would be turned up twice and it wasn t We also think the room price and the price of parking is high but it s still an ok hotel , I like the location Not central London but near and they took very good care of a parcel I had delivered 
186937,The RE London Shoreditch, Well we were there for the gigs which starts at 12 00 nearby We arrived at the hotel at 11 30 and were told to come back to check in at 2pm So we left our bags there and went to the gig only to be told that we can t come out of the gig and return So we have to go back to the hotel at our expense and explain to the reception staff that there no way we could check in at 2 The staff kindly look at this and checks us in at their discretion I know it s the hotel policy for travellers to check in at 2pm but sometimes it s not possible We wasted some money on the taxi to and back to the gig again , Bed is very comfortable Staff were very pleasant and helpful like the gentlemen at the restaurant who help me find things at the breakfast buffet I m hopeless at that 
186938,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Hotel is lovely and clean Staff friendly Well organised Security was good Overall a great hotel Great value will definitely stay again next time I m in london
186939,The RE London Shoreditch, 2 different members of staff on 2 separate occasions have stayed here twice now were very moody and almost abruptly rude plus had some random hairs on the top of my bed on arrival to the room Finally the rooms can be quite cold if you are someone who feels the cold a lot like me I took a hot water bottle on my 2nd time staying Poor wine selection at bar , Nice accommodation with all that you need for a little overnight trip to the East side of London City Trendy Shoreditch bars and restaurants all within short walking distance and easy public transport links too Mostly pleasant staff 2nd time staying Ate in the hotel restaurant last time and the food was fairly good 
186940,The RE London Shoreditch, A little off the beaten track My stay was pricey for what is a fairly average hotel , Close to public transport links in to the city Comfortable enough 
186941,The RE London Shoreditch, The seman splatter on the cushion on the bed and the what looked like the remnants of someone wiping their feses on the blanket also on the bed and nothing being done to compensate us for this disgusting and quite horrific find by reception or house keeping Also grumpy receptionist , The underground parking facility 
186942,The RE London Shoreditch, TV in the lobby with music channel on with commercials and ads A bit annoying wou d have been better to have chill music instead , Great location near Borough street with a street market with a good vibe on Saturdays Easy accommodation
186943,The RE London Shoreditch, the room was too hot even with the heating off and a window open I couldn t find the air con if there was any in the room Also the cleaner knocked on my door at 9am which is ridiculous when I didn t need to be out of the room until 11am I hadn t long been in bed from the event I attended and she was persistent not knocking just once but twice , Loved the hotel in every way 
186944,The RE London Shoreditch, The staff were extremely rude I did not have the card that I booked the room with due to cancelling it They demanded the full amount to be paid again and they would refund the amount already paid to a no longer exisitng credit card When I explained that this was simply not possible the manager said Do you want this room or not in an extremely aggressive manner I had already paid for the room and was willing to pay the damage deposit on another card but his customer service skills left a lot to be desired I would not recommend staying here simply due to the rude nature of the staff ,No Positive
186945,The RE London Shoreditch, Breakfast was cold eggs rubbery bacon hard toaster not working bread soggy however the continental breakfast was better and offered a good alternative, Comfortable bed spacious lovely clean bathroom very quiet Had everything you needed at hand
186946,The RE London Shoreditch, checking in process was not easy they asking safety deposit i was surprised and it s not mentioned in a hotel description location of hotel is a bit far from attractions shops historic center we were obliged to take a taxi all the time we wanted to go somewhere , the building room size and amenities are good 
186947,The RE London Shoreditch, Very noisy on our floor Obviously a party hotel We had to check out early return home to get some sleep , Located close to our business location 
186948,The RE London Shoreditch, The staff serving breakfast were unfriendly , The lady at the main reception was lovely and really helpful I was given a nicer room than the one I booked and I found it very comfortable The room was clean and quiet 
186949,The RE London Shoreditch, The Staff in the restaurant were appalling On arriving for breakfast we were told that we hadn t pre booked which I was aware of We were then asked for the little card sleeve that the roomy was in as proof of signature I explained that I d thrown the sleeve in the bin but was more than happy to just pay for breakfast upfront if necessary at which pint I was basically told No signature No breakfast Shocking customer service to the point were I will not return or recommend this place , The Staff in the bar were exceptional great service and good atmosphere too 
186950,The RE London Shoreditch, Neighbourhood seems not to be that much safe To get into the hotel you need to pass through an area where the people from the hotel usually sit and drink it is not friendly especially during match days Always put the AC in 19 C in winter autumn, It is relatively near to Shoredicth and cool areas 
186951,The RE London Shoreditch, I ll be honest and say we booked for a weekend of socialising and a night out so did not really care for the small and slow TV but if we had spent more time in the room would have been really frustrated with it As we were checking out we quickly glanced over at one of the executive rooms as I was glad we did not take the option to upgrade as the facilities were pretty much the same with the only obvious benefit being a slightly larger room and a seating area At almost 50 more than the price of a standard room I did not feel it offered the value for money I would be prepared to upgrade for We also opted against the breakfast at 13 50 per person I did not see what was on offer but would expect a high quality and fresh choice at the price , Very good value in comparison to other local hotels especially during what was a busy May Day bank holiday weekend Located on Hackney Road with good local facilities including a Tesco express which was directly opposite near enough as well as many other local and late night off licences and independent shops For those travelling into Shoreditch for a night out there are many local taxi firms as well as a very short waiting time for Ubers which are readily available swiftly Upon arrival the hotel reception area is quite impressive for what is a lower end in terms of price hotel in the Shoreditch district There is a bar area with plenty of seating and also shows sports with a good choice of drinks and food on offer We were greeted quickly by a friendly receptionist who handled the process swiftly and professionally whilst still friendly and easy going Our 4th floor room was surprisingly spacious for a standard size and was as you d expect clean Another impressive thing was for me unlike many other lower priced rooms it certainly was light and airy and did not feel like a prison or cage as you could open the large window with obvious safety restrictions but with the black out curtains you still could shut out from the outside world and retain your privacy There was good storage space a mini fridge and complimentary water which included sparkling for those who like it and the bathroom was a nice size and well finished 
186952,The RE London Shoreditch, I asked for a double and got a twin The lady wouldn t change are doin the parking took forever as spaces were to small to fit a car the prices for drink was way over priced The room was boiling even with window open and was risky awaken By cleaners in the morning And was way overpriced for the wrong room in the first place, Not much
186953,The RE London Shoreditch, I thought the bath housing the shower was extremely small and the shower curtain was a nuisance in such a small area If I was staying any longer than 1 night I would have complained , I got a good deal on the room I ve stayed there before and it is well located for my needs 
186954,The RE London Shoreditch, The wifi speed was really disappointing in the room and in the restaurant lounge area , I liked the proximity to Old Street Liverpool street and generally the centre There are also a lot of options for breakfast and lunch in the area although the breakfast at the hotel was really nice One more good thing for business travellers is that you can work downstairs in the lounge are 
186955,The RE London Shoreditch, The fact that we would have to pay 20 pounds a day to park the car this is very expensive although we realise it is because we are in central London Reception staff did their job well but could have been more welcoming and friendly makes a huge difference to customers as they check in Nor did they ask how our stay was as we checked out , Room and facilities were fine area around hotel is very quiet which we liked a lot Very good value for money 
186956,The RE London Shoreditch, Duvets seemed really small Get ready to fight for your side , Extremely clean Staff were very helpful in accommodating our early check in Food was really good 
186957,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Hotel is situated well have stayed before I like the consistency you know what you are going to get a pleasant room well appointed clean and a conmfy bed
186958,The RE London Shoreditch, Windows not sound proof and also not closing properly so there is a constant draft from outside and very noisy from the road Reception staff not very friendly We arrived one hour before check in time but she didn t even bother checking if the room was ready or not she told us to wait until 2 PM sharp The room was not a double room but also not a twin room just two independent tiny beds on wheels that move during your sleep , WiFi was OK and breakfast was also OK Close to public transport 
186959,The RE London Shoreditch, We had asked that the twins beds be separated and they weren t However the staff person on duty at night came and rearranged them for us The beds were too soft The staff was outstanding , Beds were too soft and needed to be firmer Everything was super clean The staff was always helpful Lot s of public transportation options Not a lot of dining options within walking distance 
186960,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The location was perfect for what I was doing I was intorduced to the Broadway Markets precinct which was a short walk where I could satisy all my specific food whims I also realized that I was an acceptable walk right into the centre of London The hotel was impeccably cleanand all staff were exceptionally helpful
186961,The RE London Shoreditch, Towels were somewhat thin due to their age Shower gel should be available with the shampoo and conditioner Bacon sausages and tomatoes were undercooked , The staff were efficient and friendly
186962,The RE London Shoreditch, Nothing only positives from my stay , The bed was very comfy and the staff were extremely helpful and kind Around a 15 min walk to Bethnal Green Station for links to all around London 20 min walk to Shoreditch and Boxpark Perfect of you want to stay a short distancr away from the buisiness of Londong but close enough to get into Central London quickly 
186963,The RE London Shoreditch, Beds are rock solid and I ve stayed here twice Price of food inside the hotel is nearly as much as the room, Nice and central with underground safe parking for 20 Very clean hotel 
186964,The RE London Shoreditch, It took over 45 minutes to get a replacement kettle to make a hot drink The meal in the evening was poor value with a microwaved brioche bun I decided to decline a vegetarian breakfast at 13 50 charge ,No Positive
186965,The RE London Shoreditch, gave me a room with interactive door so heard full conversation of room next door Room facing road so heard ambulances and police sirens till two each night Very poor WiFi Demanded 60euros at reception in case i used any facilities , Room was extremely clean and comfortable Great shower with plenty of hot water 
186966,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, I didn t try the restaurant as I had dinner appointments nearby but the menu looks OK and the area clean The hotel is easy to find the parking a bonus rooms are clean the staff helpful overall an enjoyable 2 night stay 
186967,The RE London Shoreditch, Terrible place Far from everything not really in shoreditch on a noisy road beds not comfy awful smell in the room Just horrible Good price but for a very good reason Won t be coming back , The receptionist was friendly
186968,The RE London Shoreditch, 1 Breakfast is super over priced and no variety over the 2 weeks 2 Cleanliness was a problem Many times there was a shoddy job done on cleaning the room 3 There was a terrible loud noise whenever the wind was strong Unsure why , It was overall ok Reception staff was helpful
186969,The RE London Shoreditch, Booking com sending me alerts about my card being invalid and my reservation being cancelled is not very useful The hotel staff could not help me as this is an automated process and human understanding is ruled out This was very disappointing and I hesitate using booking com in future , The staff relocated me to a quieter room after one night 
186970,The RE London Shoreditch, Air conditioning was a little noisy, Staff were very helpful and friendly Complimentary bottled water in fridge Very clean Large bed Bath with shower 
186971,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The full english breakfast was very tasty and good value Our room was very clean and the hotel was easy to find and conveniently located for public transport 
186972,The RE London Shoreditch, Location was a bit far out 15 mins walk from Bethnal Green underground stop Wifi didn t work for one night , Rooms were quite comfy and staff were helpful
186973,The RE London Shoreditch, Unfortunately one of the main items of gym equipment was out of order and looked like it has been for a while Bit wary of the surrounding area , Great value The breakfast area was light and airy and a comfortable temperature Gym was quite well equipped 
186974,The RE London Shoreditch, Nothing, Nice room small gym good bar and social area Staff friendly helpful Gave me mobile charger as forgot mine Public transport links good 
186975,The RE London Shoreditch, Sooooo many instructions when I checked in And just reeled off like a robot TV in room was tiny so far from bed it was unwatchable , nothing stood out

186977,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, A great first impression when entering the reception matched with friendly staff When we opened the door to our room it was clean and very comfortable 
186978,The RE London Shoreditch, AC unit in room was faulty and noisy reported the fault and the AC was repaired in that it kicked out cool air but was still very noisy , Location was ideal for our visit 
186979,The RE London Shoreditch, Only thing that could ve been better was the temp of the room Heating didn t work and room was cold all night , Hotel was great Best facilities for us was the location and the car park
186980,The RE London Shoreditch, The hotel Taxis service was not good It was dirty did not know where to go And did not speak to me Terrible service so next day I caught a black cab Don t use hotel taxi system, Room was great and very good value 
186981,The RE London Shoreditch, 1 I was meant to be paying 79 but they charged me a extra 50 on arrival for a deposit they said would be returned the following day nothing has been returned nothing showed up in terms of the booking either 2 Location it says it Shoreditch yet its 15 20 mins walk away from Shoreditch and its actually Bethenal Green still 10 mins away from that tube stop also 3 The Hotel was advertised as a 4 Star yet the carpets in the room wasn t nice The TV s was portable s and didn t work The Bath was ok but the plug didn t work and hot water still come out when I ve turned it to cold 4 Lots of noise in the hotel and they did nothing to quieten down I m very annoyed customer who feels cheated, Nothing
186982,The RE London Shoreditch, It s not in Shoreditch it s Hackney so it s a long walk from Old Street with a case , Absolute gem I travel alone and stay in London often I will absolutely be back despite the location Great value amazing food

187008,The RE London Shoreditch, Bed was too soft with no support and the room very hot even with the window open and the air conditioning didn t appear to work Only the bar area for evening dining which had the TV blaring out football ebsite seemed to suggest a bistro as well as a bar Location wa the very edge of Shoreditch area and name suggests in the centre of things , Breakfast was good evening meal was adequate and staff very friendly and obliging

187027,The RE London Shoreditch, I had to pay a 50 deposit this was not clearly mentioned in the email info before we went to stay a definite inconvenience especially this clost to christmas and the money isn t back in my account a few days later If you have my card details I can t see that you need the deposit and thought this was bad and could be a real spoiler for some people s stay , Generally a very nice clean hotel easy location good staff
187028,The RE London Shoreditch, The key didn t work a few times but the staff fixed that for us straight away , The location is a 10 minute bus ride away from the local tube stops or you can walk it in about 25 mins so you get to explore the area The bed was ridiculously comfortable The complimentary tea coffee biscuits and hot chocolate was a nice touch I wasn t woken once from the noise outside in fact it was completely silent all week Wifi was decent managed to watch a few programmes with no issues Staff were polite and friendly

187034,The RE London Shoreditch, This Hotel would not let us check in because the night s stay was paid for by someone else who was not present and the paying debit card was not with the persons staying on the night unless a separate card was proffered and despite the fact that the night had been paid for a further payment was demanded Staff are surly unfriendly and unaccommodating Will not stay again ,No Positive

187040,The RE London Shoreditch, Disrgaceful condition of tables and chairs outside of lift door one morning which the staff new about but didn t want to resolve Guests are not treated individually but rather as tribe that can only function when they and everything else are extra loud and want to be surrounded by XXL televisions Not able to offer anything for guests who want a quite environment Towels and bathrobe worn and old , Staff did try to resolve very poor experience but they are restricted by company policy which they stated 
187041,The RE London Shoreditch, curtains and carpet wasn t clean bed was uncomfortable food was very expensive location was horrible and scary when alone to many drunks in the bar and no one to control them and for a lone women this was very intimidating , Food was nice facilities where okay and price was good nice place to stay for no more then a day or two

187043,The RE London Shoreditch, Personally struggled to get the room warm enough even switching thermostat up, good size room great bus link into London Bridge very nice and helpful staff
187044,The RE London Shoreditch, We arrived after midnight after a show in Hoxton and were told that again there was no disabled car parking available and no standard spaces either The hotel policy is they won t allow guests to pre book their 20 a night parking so it s pot luck if you can park when you arrive How ludicrous The receptionist was very kind and said he would find us a space When we entered the secure car park there were at least twenty empty spaces Unexplainable So we went to the bar that is open til 2am to get a coffee and we re told the coffee machine was turned off even though the bar was open for another 95 minutes Disappointed We had two double rooms booked and paid for for my wife and I and also our friends Our room was freezing cold when we opened the door I turned the heating on full and temperature set to 30 degrees After an hour of freezing cold air blowing round the room we decided to turn it off By this time it was 2am and I thought it no point telling reception as we didn t fancy having maintenance men in our room so early in the morning we were tired and just went to bed for a few hours fully clothed after trying to warm up with the hairdryer We could t sleep properly and we re glad when morning came so we could leave the room I am a disabled man with a chest condition and have now picked up a cold from the freezing inhabitable conditions in the room I told reception in the morning and they said I should have told maintenance at 2am and that was the end of it Also when we checked out we noticed there was hardly a car in the car park so why pretend the car park was full to capacity at 12 30 in the morning Thoroughly disappointed after our fifth or sixth stay at the RE hotel we won t be staying again They re just not bothered with having happy customers so they won t be having any more of our money Avoid like the plague unless you like a challenge , The receptionist that checked us in was helpful
187045,The RE London Shoreditch, There was nothing I did not like but we did not eat at the hotel so I don t know how good the food is , I tried to book the most basic of the well known chain hotels for economy but could not get a room I then discovered this hotel for the same price but of a much better standard than I would have expected from my original choice It was a real find and I will definitely use it on future visits to see my son in Hackney I could not fault it 
187046,The RE London Shoreditch, It is clear from some of the reviews that some people do not understand the deposit scheme Deductions are taken from the 50 only if you buy something using your room number If you pay for drinks etc by cash or card nothing is deducted and the account ends when you depart The hotel should print a simple leaflet explaining this as it leads to a lot of arguments The background music in the bar is monotonous and repetitive only about one hour s worth and intrusive if you want to watch the televisions , Clean warm roomy and at the back quiet Very helpful staff 
187047,The RE London Shoreditch, Don t order a taxi It costs you more than if you go and hail one from street 15 instead of 8 50 in our case into the City Shower rather unreliable cold to hot and hot to cold , Efficient and polite staff Comfortable room Nice bathroom other than comment above

187055,The RE London Shoreditch, AC good but heating didn t give off any heat Duvet was a little thin Needed more than 2 coffee sachets that s just my personal preference though as I have 2 sachets to 1 mug , When we arrived we checked in without any hassle The staff were polite and helpful The front foyer was bright and spacious with the bar and restaurant on this floor When we got to our room we were on the roadside I was worried about the traffic on Hackney Road but I needn t have worried The windows blocked out the noise The room had a huge double bed and a good sized wardrobe with robes and slippers available Inside the wardrobe was a full size ironing board with iron We had tea and coffee facilities with a good sized mug which was much needed after a day of travelling and wandering around spitalfields market number 26 bus from outside the hotel Having the bus stop outside the hotel was really handy We took the bus to St Paul s Cathedral roughly 25 minutes The bathroom had a half sized bath and a power shower Power it really was Lovely shower and toiletries After a great nights sleep we walked to broadwalk market 5 minute walk A must visit for any food lovers amongst you Amazing food stalls and little shops offering food from around the world Shoreditch high street reachable with a 15 minute walk max despite google maps saying 30 minutes An added bonus was that the hotel was happy to hold our bags in a secure room after checking out for the rest of the day 
187056,The RE London Shoreditch, The hotel bill should have come with breakfast It was not good that we have to pay for our breakfast differently for such a very nice hotel The television was very small and did not have enough prgrammes May be some further discount on the bill, The receptionist was simply wonderful Very ready to help and smiling The rooms were were comfortable spacious properly lighted the tea items were simply wonderful with biscuits beverage The sleeping robe bath slippers were all fantastic The wifi was very helpful and adequate 
187057,The RE London Shoreditch, Overpriced hotel with only basic facilities there was no mini refrigerator in my room after two days of reminding the staff to provide one I got one that was faulty Internet in room was also really poor TV remote was faulty double room is extremely small comparable to a budget hotel Manager was really unfriendly and uncooperative ,No Positive

187064,The RE London Shoreditch, Better communication before we arrived about parking on site We also requested a ground floor room when booking was made but was allocated to a second floor room however this was quickly remedied , The location was perfect for our short break The hotel was very impressive and the basement car park was essential for our trip 
187065,The RE London Shoreditch, Disappointment when sitting in the foyer area of the hotel as to the amount of homeless people coming into the hotel and begging guest for money or cigarettes These same people at times were intoxicated and used the lounge area to sleep As a paying guest this is not the idea of a chilling time I had in mind This was our 5th visit to the RE and we have always enjoyed our time However the above incidents in the lounge area was most unwelcome A suggestion is that a better system is put into place to ensure that members of the public who enter off the streets are there to use the facilities i e the bar area not just to go to the toilet Maybe a security guard could be employed I work with the Homeless so have much sympathy but as a paying guess I don t think it is right that I should have people coming into the RE asking for money etc , Room was very clean and bed was very comfy

187070,The RE London Shoreditch, Whilst I thought the hotel was good value for money and on a whole facilities were good the lounge area was a bit tired , Good location I was visiting a friend who lives in London Fields Just a ten minute stroll Also close to Bethnall Green Tube Station In a vibrant part of London which I haven t visited before 
187071,The RE London Shoreditch, The Wi Fi was poor low speed and bad connectivity It put the damper on what would ve been an excellent hotel experience , The room was a nice size staff was very friendly accommodations were worth the money 
187072,The RE London Shoreditch, The bed was super average could feel the odd spring Also the occasional stain on sheets pillow cases TV remote was dead My phone was faster than the free WiFi Had requested quiet room when booking due to early 5am starts but was was given ground floor room right next to reception Lots of noise outside heels walking on solid floor elevator doors alarms colleagues talking etc Wasn t ideal For the price paid it was a very average stay I m afraid to say I m sure this might be a one off event but it s put me off staying here again , Friendly staff Good bathroom shower facilities Helped out with a luggage trolley for all the camera production gear I had with me

187079,The RE London Shoreditch, Avoid at all costs Strange rules and behaviors I ve never seen anywhere and I ve been to a lot of places I d have to spend too much time typing how awful my experience in this was and why I won t bore you too much though I ll just say that the little untrustworthy rude manager who took care of my check in late at night was awful beyond belief Felt like a dark comedy of some sort really she even suggested at one point that I should giver her 150 pounds in cash even though I payed for the room beforehand because I used my fathers card to pay online I had to call him at 1 a m woke him up he had to turn on his laptop print some kind of sheet and fill it with personal details scan it back to the laptop send picturres of his credit card and number and sign everything or I d be sleeping in the streets with my room already paid for This was the tip of the iceberg that was my awful experience ps this is in Hackney not Shoreditch I don t know why they re ashamed of their location and then allow shady staff like that to manage anything plus the local drunks in the bar in the same counter as the reception loudly making fun of customers along with the staff wasn t very pleasant , I liked that I only had to stay two nights in this The staff girl in the morning was helpful and gave me a toothbrush with a smile on her face this behaviour felt really special in this hotel perhaps she was new there 
187080,The RE London Shoreditch, Just a lot of little irritants like the sink being too high the bed a bit springy a piece of used tissue paper under the bed small TV with no Netflix bad too bright lighting , Overall an okay hotel and room 
187081,The RE London Shoreditch, We found no reason to criticise or complain This is a new hotel n I have already recommended it for a London break, We checked in early n got immediate access to room Warm welcome from reception Lovely quality biscuits for Coffee in room Ate in restaurant for dinner Staff friendly nice options on menu 
187082,The RE London Shoreditch, Air conditioning kept switching itself off and there was some noisy pipes under bathroom sink these issues were highlighted to staff when we checked out who thanked us for letting them know The price of breakfast was quite steep for us so we ate at the cafe across the road for 5pp , staff really nice and friendly hotel well looked after and modern Room was clean with great facilities and the housekeepers ensured our beds were made and we were given fresh towels Free wifi was a bonus shower was nice and hot We had a fantastic stay 
187083,The RE London Shoreditch, Breakfast was very good quality but a little expensive Also it shuts at 10 30 even on Sunday so if you need a lie in after a busy Saturday night you may miss breakfast , Smart modern hotel that offered us two quiet interconnecting rooms in what is a noisy part of Hackney Air con was VERY effective so even on two really hot days the rooms were very cool 
187084,The RE London Shoreditch, Had to leave 50 deposit which I have never had to do in a hotel before this wasn t mentioned when I booked the room Executive room was disappointing basically a normal room but with a sofa shoved at the end of the bed , Clean room Comfy bed 
187085,The RE London Shoreditch, The staff were extremely rude and made interacting with them a nightmare The hotel is nice but having to deal with staff like this is a real turnoff Funnily enough we met some friends that had the exact same experience in this hotel Its good value location and the bedrooms are nice but don t look for anything beyond that ,No Positive
187086,The RE London Shoreditch, Unhappy about the deposit held as it is not stated If my stay was an emergency I may hv been out of pocket or anyone for that matter Tv in rooms are very disappointing for 4 And decor is outdated , Breakfast was good however takes time for trays to be refilled once empty breakfast goes cold waiting 
187087,The RE London Shoreditch, The restaurant staff were slow and kept interrupting the meal asking if everything was okay rather than just the once They also did not wait for the whole table to finish before clearing plates this was a table of 2 Also service charge was put onto the bill before asking if you would like to pay it , The beds were comfy and the staff were helpful
187088,The RE London Shoreditch, The location quite a bit of noice and the area in general was a bit grim, The bed was very comfortable nice bathrobes and slippers which was a nice suprise
187089,The RE London Shoreditch, Lighting in the room is either too bright or too dark bed was TERRIBLE I have stayed a few times with no problem before This time was awful Receptionist assumed out loud that my male acquaintance was staying with me and that was a bit awkward at check in Checking in and out took slightly too long , Reception wasn t busy my request for a quiet room on a high floor etc was met the room was clean kettle shower and hairdryer worked well The hotel was calm as usual which I like 
187090,The RE London Shoreditch, We were not sure how the air conditioning in the room worked a notice in the room would be helpful, The location close to Broadway market the flower market the Hackney city farm shore ditch and the London fields gave us a true sense of london the bus into city centre is right outside the door The bar staff were so helpful
187091,The RE London Shoreditch, wasn t told we would need cash deposit of 100 on arrival room was hard to find no English staff so bad communication very long wait in the morning for return of cash deposit , very clean hotel comfy beds 
187092,The RE London Shoreditch, The covers do not fit the single beds The reception insisted on taking a swipe of my card even though I had already paid for my room I said I was unhappy about this but it was ignored , Very clean staff friendly
187093,The RE London Shoreditch, There was bed bugs in our room they changed our room for the one just next door to it They didn t think to offer any kind of compensation even though we have spent four nights in the establishment ,No Positive
187094,The RE London Shoreditch, Rooms are the usual small UK size so if you re from the US you may be disappointed but this is good value in a pretty good location , Easy Access to London via a number of bus routes Its not on tube lines but there s also a London overground station nearby The buses run so frequently you don t need trains and you see more of the city 
187095,The RE London Shoreditch, I feel a bit mean mentioning it as l didn t say anything to the hotel staff but those pillows are a killer I ve still got the crick in my neck , It s in a great location with loads of cafes close by It s about a 10 15 minute walk to Hoxton station and to all the buzz of Hoxton and Shoreditch Nice bar and food inside the hotel too 
187096,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, liked the feel of the place the staff and the decore everything was very clean and professional and the location for what we wanted was brilliant 
187097,The RE London Shoreditch, The surrounding area is a little dire , The hotel itself and staff are great Clean and efficient I like it as it is close to clients premises and the city of London 
187098,The RE London Shoreditch, The dodgy window And fridge was not cold , Location is perfect Bus stops extremely close Walking distance to old street shoreditch Columbia flower market bricklane London fields Big rooms Loved the view from room 430 
187099,The RE London Shoreditch, The only thing and im sure it doesnt happen quite often was the fire alarm 1245a but guess never a dull moment in my life lol and there was only a view of courtyard but oh well i wanted the top floor and i got it, The people were friendly and helpful most of the staff were able to advice us tho a few didnt know what we were talking about sometimes but overall was a nice stay bed was comfortable close to underground and buses very convenient location
187100,The RE London Shoreditch, The booking in system is idiosyncratic and awkward particularly for non English speakers The Manager is autocratic and dismissive Despite the Olympics being on television the lounge bar area is plagued by loud repetitive mediocre music and the staff are unable to turn it off , The rooms are spacious clean well furnished and at the rear of the hotel very quiet Requests not to be disturbed are respected With the exception of the manager the staff are very helpful and friendly in as far as language differences permit 
187101,The RE London Shoreditch, I didn t like the fact that our power wasn t working for one morning and when I called reception they said they would send the manager up to check it out we waited half an hour and the manager never showed up then we called reception again and they said they would send the maintainer guy but then all of sudden the power came back on I didn t like the fact that I had to even fuss about the power first of all and that they took so long to help us out with it The carpet also smelled funny I think that they should spend some time washing it because it gave off a weird smell Also the sink doesn t seem to drain the water properly because it would take a couple of minutes to drain the water which got annoying , I liked the fact that the staff was pleasant for the most part The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom The pillows were also really comfortable and there was air conditioner available in our room which was great since it got a little hot sometimes The hotel is also in a good location there s plenty of cafes and restaurant and bars around the area Good for nightlife If you take the underground it s like 20 minutes to the center of London 
187102,The RE London Shoreditch, This was our seventh stay here and we did not find this visit as good as previous ones The room was not as clean no water as we usually have the lights in our room were not working Many items in bar Beers and Lagers were out of stock due to new menu Not the usual standard , Very convenient for family 
187103,The RE London Shoreditch, Traffic noise was very bad Had to request replenished water on day 2 We stayed 4 nights and shouldn t have had to ask , Great convenient location Very clean 
187104,The RE London Shoreditch, Nit picking a bit but the signage in the car park to get up to the hotel could have been better , The staff were all very helpful and friendly The room was comfortable and the air conditioning very effective clean and well equipped too Good secure parking worth 20 for our peace of mind 
187105,The RE London Shoreditch, The wifi kept going off I managed to find one position where it stayed on and it was in a corner on the floor , Second time in this hotel and everything was good Comfy bed linens and the location is amazing 
187106,The RE London Shoreditch, Wifi didn t work in the room It only worked in reception Extremely inconvenient One of the receptionist was not very helpful when asked about directions Not very friendly or willing to go the extra mile to help , Room was very comfy Toiletries can be provided if you have forgotten to take yours ie toothbrush razor etc
187107,The RE London Shoreditch, The room service was terrible I ordered a hugely overpriced tuna toasted sandwich and which was dry and almost inedible And a bowl of chips which were undercooked But I was starving after a long day and had already waited 40 minutes for it to be delivered Would have been better off visiting one of the great Turkish restaurants nearby , The bed was firm and comfortable I had a good sleep and the window opened a little to allow some fresh air in
187108,The RE London Shoreditch, Bigger TV in the room The TV was fine but a little on the small side when watching TV in bed Yeah I know first world problems , Great location for us close to everything in East London We also had an Executive room and it was very nice Good size aircon large safe free spring water and tea and coffee and biscuits and a small fridge to store a few food products 
187109,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and in particular the bar staff was very attentive and customer service was exceptional Will definitely be staying here again 
187110,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, No breakfast included which is a shame for the price Really Nice hotel in a horrible area of London but if you need to stay in the area id recommend it 100 
187111,The RE London Shoreditch, There are two things about the hotel that need improving The booking in procedure is complicated and confusing particularly for non English speaking guests and it is difficult to arrange remote payment something that most companies would find convenient Secondly the otherwise very comfortable lounge and bar area is plagued by loud mediocre musak which works on an hourly loop It is impossible to relax or to watch the television It would cost little to have a more varied music selection and it could be played at a lower level , The hotel is solidly built and at the back away from the main road is very quiet It is also quiet internally very little sound penetrates from above or from either side and the bedroom doors are too heavy to slam an idea that other hotels might copy Rooms are large comfortable and very clean with good adjustable ventilation and heating The staff are very helpful and pleasant apart from the manager Bathrooms are excellent The location is excellent for the city and for London Fields 
187112,The RE London Shoreditch, I spoke to reception about the importance of parking for me and a place to put my bike for the rPrudential ride 100 None of these faculties were available to me when I arrived at 17 00 Saturday although a note had been left in their book , We were going to the Olympic arena so the location was good The room was clean and although the restaurant was quite expensive the food was good quality 
187113,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Staff couldn t have been more helpful It was a very busy time with the cycling on and the staff were very accommodating Providing lock up for the bikes and local information Great size room and comfortable and well looked after 
187114,The RE London Shoreditch, It was a tad bit far from the central London but the bus was directly in front of the hotel so that was very convenient for us , The bed was comfy and it was very clean as well 
187115,The RE London Shoreditch, The food late at night wasn t great but that was maybe because we were ordering food after 10pm Just a pre warning they do take a security deposit off you at check in so 50 on card or 100 cash which was a bit annoying because the bank takes ages to process it back into your account, Maid service was excellent like seriously me and my friend were quite messy and they literally organised everything in the room every day 
187116,The RE London Shoreditch, 30 for early check in at 1pm was a bit steep given the cost for the room , I loved the location The room we stayed in was silent at 2am regardless of the other comments Staff were lovely 
187117,The RE London Shoreditch, breakfast was so so much like a Toby Carvery but much more expensive , the air conditioning in the room was the best ever buses ran from outside the hotel to everywhere we wanted to go even back to waterloo Stn there were cafes pubs and good restaurants in walking distance 
187118,The RE London Shoreditch, Nothing very impressed would definitely recommend and stay again , Lovely room facing quiet street Room very clean and well appointed plugs near mirrors plenty of storage nice complimentary beverages and water in fridge Very helpful and cheerful staff 
187119,The RE London Shoreditch, The bed was not comfortable There were buttons on the mattress A good quality mattress cover might be of help or mattress replacements , The location was good and quiet Convenient to train bus and food shops 
187120,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel is very nice it s clean and the staff is professional Rooms are good too comfortable bed It is central although if you re not going to be much in shore ditch east London it s a bit further away Close to metro and bus though In overall I m very happy with staying here despite being in west London for a bit 
187121,The RE London Shoreditch, Lot of noise from outside the window in our room had warped and didn t sit in the frame properly letting in road noise Particular bad in the morning, Staff were friendly Place was clean and has a car park 20 a night Close to Cambridge Heath station and nearby bus routes Walkable to Victoria Park Overall more than fine for our one night stay 
187122,The RE London Shoreditch, Could not open the door with the swipe cards provided Had to come back to reception twice Finally the receptionist opened the door for me using a different card , Apart from what did not like like the rest was perfectly fine 
187123,The RE London Shoreditch, The only thing that was less than great was the shower curtain I hate it when they stick to your legs , The room was a good size the bed was very comfy Excellent restaurant and bar very convenient location with good transport connections 
187124,The RE London Shoreditch, The bed is bad Pillow is OK The room faces a busy road There was traffic noise all night You have to get in the bathtub to take a shower But the tub is so small that it was hard to stand on my feet That tub is useless for any purpose , Breakfast is not bad
187125,The RE London Shoreditch, The dining room bar food was very ordinary The telephones in the rooms didn t work, The room was basic but comfortable and the staff worked hard
187126,The RE London Shoreditch, The mattress was too old too soft we were always in the center of it ready to replace The instant coffee instead of having a real coffee machine The soap that was never replaced no hair conditioner, Quiet room Bottle of water Bathrobes and sleepers
187127,The RE London Shoreditch, The television was really poor Room lighting was very dim The desk was very dark even with all lights switched on The hot water was inconsistent with cold shot surprises , I appreciated the generous space of the room and temperature control The robes were a nice touch With the room being on a courtyard it was very peaceful and quiet 
187128,The RE London Shoreditch, Hotel was excellent Onsite parking was great but expensive at 20 per night Not bad for London I suppose but it adds to the cost of the stay We stayed 3 nights A discount would have been nice , Hotel facilities and location perfect for central London Don t be put off by its close proximity to Hackney The area felt safe and people were generally friendly Some really good local traditional pubs nearby Hotel was excellent Reception staff very efficient and friendly rooms spotlessly clean Loved the thoughtful little touches excellent quality biscuits and daily bottles of water in room fridge Everything that you would need including full size ironing board Thankful for the air conditioning and dark curtains Very quiet considering near main road Safe onsite parking for our car Could not fault this hotel 
187129,The RE London Shoreditch, The size of the room small The positioning of the TV and it was old fashioned and we were not able to adjust the position so had to always watch from the bed or had to move a heavy chair to near the wardrobe The shower head was angled straight ahead towards the back wall therefore hitting you in the face at times if not careful also the bath very small my wife is only 5 4 and had to bend her legs so very uncomfortable to bathe in The dinner menu choice very limited and food tasteless The gammon was tough no offer to replace or refund inedible Lighting in room too bright with all the spotlights no choice other than the infrared bedside lights which were inadequate for reading or even to light the room , The restaurant staff very helpful and informative of the products at breakfast Gym great 
187130,The RE London Shoreditch, location only accessible by bus or cab, Vibrant location and enjoyed people just walking in an having a drink and chatting to the barman Meal was good too 
187131,The RE London Shoreditch, Some of the staff were pretty cold with us One time we ask the receptionist to print off 2 pdf from a pendrive it was a ticket confirmation but they refused im working in a same star rated hotel actually in the reception area and in my place we do this couple of time every week for free just to help our guests Guy in bar on mornings was pretty busy was pretty Bad experience to realize that to park your car in the car park costs 20 pound per night , The hotel looks nice One long reception bar area as u enter the building Bed was comfy room clean No shower gel but 2 shampoo 1 lotion Comp water in the fridge was a good surprise Tv has lots of channels and u got aircon in the room 
187132,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff charged me a deposit of 50 on arrival but were vague about why and when I would receive it back saying it was down to my bank to release it I was not at all happy about this as I ve never been charged extra prior to a hotel stay before I m a very tidy and conscientious person so I expect them to refund it but it annoyed me as I hadn t budgeted for it and may have now gone overdrawn , Bath massive bed clean and quiet posh biscuits
187133,The RE London Shoreditch, Didn t get a great night s sleep due to my room being at the front of the hotel and it being noisy Bed wasn t particularly comfy , Very good location for the purpose of my trip On site parking good facilities although not used and the staff seemed nice if not a little disinterested at times 
187134,The RE London Shoreditch, The fact that I could not have my booking cancelled and my payment refunded due to serous illness I tried to cancel this booking 9 weeks prior to the date DISGUSTED , Nothing
187135,The RE London Shoreditch, The bath only had a shower on the ceiling without a cable to use The bar was exactly next to the reception thus the main reception smells beer and gives bad first impression The hotel charges 50 for guarantee and the amount is given back to you at the checkout First time I saw that but the receptionist said it s common The outfit and the look of the receptionist not very good Breakfast not included in the price Overall not very nice hotel for this price , The room was quite good and big with all the necessary things provided Coffee and biscuits provided TV charges for additional movies channels Cannot comment on breakfast as I didn t have 
187136,The RE London Shoreditch, We are coming to this hotel since many years and it has changed owners In the beginning we were welcomed at check in and felt welcome Now we have the feeling when we check in that we are just allowed in subject to pre authorizing the full amount for our stay over 1 000 Pounds plus 50 GBP for extra s what extra s the minibar is empty I travel around the world for over 35 years and stay in a lot of hotels So I know this is not common practice I am afraid the love is gone , The location is good as shoreditch is becoming more and more trendy and nice with nice shops and boutique s 
187137,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, We have stayed at The RE quite a few times and when in London would always pick this hotel to stay The rooms are very comfortable and clean and the staff are very friendly and professional It is a good location to get easily by bus to almost anywhere in London 
187138,The RE London Shoreditch, There is nothing that I could honestly say one could find fault with , I have stayed here a few times now and have to say it is a real find Rooms are good size with amenities that other higher priced hotels often lack A working fridge working air conditioning and free consistent wifi Moreover the beds are super comfortable The staff are all friendly and efficient and it has a decent restaurant and a proper bar I d happily recommend the RE to anyone looking for quality and comfort at a more than reasonable price 
187139,The RE London Shoreditch, No nonslip bath mat in bath shower No handeail to help older persons out of bath , Staff very friendly and helpful Room quiet and a great shower 
187140,The RE London Shoreditch, I didnt like the 13inch TV from 1997 The bed comfort was stiff The room service was awful I had 1 bite and didnt eat the rest I then informed the from of desk staff and still had to pay 21 for a club sandwich and some cold wings , The underground car park
187141,The RE London Shoreditch, the fact they took 50 deposit to cover any room service however they then took the room service charge 25 out also still waiting for the 50 to be refunded a week later called them and all they said was to call my bank very unhelpful,No Positive
187142,The RE London Shoreditch, Hair in bathroom and sink was blocked guessing they didn t know about the sink , Bed was extremely comfy the hotel location is perfect for heading to central London and the staff were friendly
187143,The RE London Shoreditch, Reception was sloppy and tired key cards didn t work room had rubbish in it rubbish not cleared by house keeping lumpy bed ripped duvet cover complimentary water in some rooms but not others elevator is the slowest elevator on the planet This is a 3 star hotel but far from 4,No Positive
187144,The RE London Shoreditch, Check in Staff not consistant with comments eg about how to get a VAT invoice bill as I booked through booking com One member said I had to obtain through Booking Com and refused to give I spoke to another member and no problem,No Positive
187145,The RE London Shoreditch, Majority of staff were polite and courteous but too many were borderline rude particularly in the bar dining area and all fell short of being warm Notable exception was the lady on reception who was polite efficient and friendly Restaurant food was very poor fish and chips looked great on the plate the tartare sauce and the peas real crushed peas were the highlights but the fish and the chips were totally tasteless and the batter was practically soggy only managing to be crisp at the very ends Peas aside the meal could have been absolutely anything in a blind test It didn t help that the maitre d was too busy chatting to a lady friend and I had to interrupt him to get a seat then his friend stood right in the way blocking the entrance to the dining area Also didn t help that two TVs in the lounge bar restaurant area were playing download charts the volume was low scantily clad pop artists are fine but not while I m eating my dinner please and definitely not a place to eat with young children Breakfast the next morning was fine but again fine but spoiled by staff who showed almost no manners and made you feel you were in their way Will not be returning , The bedroom and en suite were very comfortable with good office space for working Very clean overall Friendly reception staff 
187146,The RE London Shoreditch, As frequent guests at the RE we have often wished there were coat hooks on the left inside the room The space in the wardrobe is very limited so it would be very useful if we didn t have to keep coats in it Also worth mentioning the carpets need renewing Last visit there was the unmistakable smell of cats urine Clearly a previous occupant had smuggled in the culprit , We like the morning biscuits very superior We also like the quiet room insulation is good 
187147,The RE London Shoreditch, Workplace was somewhat uncomfortable Adjustable chair would do the trick I choose that type of room Executive double because I had a lot of work to do in the evening and several hours in that chair is not ok ,No Positive
187148,The RE London Shoreditch, The hotel food is revolting was sick with food poisoning for all of our stay would never stay here again Kitchen needs to be shut down, The night staff
187149,The RE London Shoreditch, They lost my room key at the front desk and then charged me for another one, The staff was very patient with me and even allowed me to make an emergency call to the United States from their phone when mine wasn t working The rooms are sophisticated and modern I felt like I got more than I paid for 
187150,The RE London Shoreditch, Would have been the icing on the cake if they had a spa massage service to unwhine Also what I wasn t aware was that when you order room service payment is taken out of your holding fee The hotel stay payments and authorisation process was a little confusing to me , Value for money considering near central city Rooms were accomadating to families Staff were real friendly Stayed an extra night Will definitely go again 
187151,The RE London Shoreditch, How the bed was made too tucked in but just pulled out the edges, The staff were just great from the bar staff to the house keepers food was excellent and hotel was convenient to everything loved every minute of my stay
187152,The RE London Shoreditch, The only thing I didn t like the fact of no lamp The main light is a bit of discomfort and the bed lights are not bright enough , The shower was a delight and to also have a bath was nice The bed was very comfy to sleep in also 
187153,The RE London Shoreditch, only price high but without breakfast also no kettle inside the room , everything happy good size room comfortable bed staffs very helpful and quite good location next time will come back again 
187154,The RE London Shoreditch, Ability to reserve car parking when booking Had to phone on the day and had there not been space we would have to park in street As usual room too hot , Parking available on site Comfortable room quiet Important as We sleep with window open Helpful staff Good location for the wedding we were attending
187155,The RE London Shoreditch, Value of the breakfast 13 00 Ok if you have a large and varied appetite well over the top if you only have cereal or toast usually Like people on special dietary needs or can t eat a lot , All very good 
187156,The RE London Shoreditch, Furniture in bar looking a bit tired And felt a bit like an airport departure lounge as it s right inside the main doors and so people are constantly coming and going so it doesn t feel very relaxing but I guess that s the only area it could be given the size of the room and the fact that the restaurant is directly in front of the bar so small niggle really Everywhere very clean though always a plus point And like I said earlier staff very friendly and even opened the bar up again for some members of our party which was lovely , Lovely check in girl who had a very difficult customer to deal with in front of us when we booked in but she remained calm professional and friendly bless her 
187157,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, location was just what we wanted transport links are so close Great Saturday Market around the corner plus places to eat and drink young vibrant location
187158,The RE London Shoreditch, Bed was uncomfortable to not horribly so and room was noisy could hear loud voices in courtyard outside the room , Room service staff were all great 
187159,The RE London Shoreditch, Really far away from all majour attractions and nearest underground station is 15 20 minutes away by bus Hovewer as I spent most time on business meetings in the City it was quite OK as it is about 3 miles from Liverpool street station Breakfast really not worth to pay for , Quite modern hotel Staff is polite and helpful Price is very attractive for London Such hotel in the city center would have costs at least triple the price I ve paid 
187160,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, the bed could have been comfier but my main gripe was I had chose specifically a quite location in the hotel the hotel gives this option and I felt as if I was sleeping in the corridor the guy in the next room sneezed and I said bless you I felt as if I was sharing the room with another person 
187161,The RE London Shoreditch, Hotel Lobby combines all check in bar restaurant areas not well separated no inviting atmosphere Lighting concept in the room was poor You only got LED spots at ceiling lighting and the reading light at the bed thus it s either like operating light or too dark A table lamp on the the desk or a floor lamp would improve the situation very noisy AC and bathroom ventilation, clean room good Wifi Rooms to the backside of the building are indeed very quiet
187162,The RE London Shoreditch, I would say it could be a little less priced for the room I stayed in also checkout could be a little later , The rooms interior and the helpful staff also perfect location 
187163,The RE London Shoreditch, The noise from screaming shouting guests in the nearby foyer went on until 4 30am The staff did nothing to help No refund offered No sleep Weekend ruined Booking com also uninterested in complaint , The negatives made the positives completely pointless
187164,The RE London Shoreditch, The iron sucks It s probably the worst iron I ve ever had to use It doesn t work , I enjoyed the hot breakfast The bed was springy but comfortable 
187165,The RE London Shoreditch, Restaurant staff and reception staff, Reception staff are so slow and disinterested I swore I d never stay here again after this issue on a previous visit but had no choice and the staff didn t fail me again 
187166,The RE London Shoreditch, Waiting ages at check in for no real reason self serve breakfast very good but staff were to busy or un interested to offer me a coffee left breakfast without having being offered a hot drink , Good location I had a meeting just behind the hotel early morning bed was very comfy clean
187167,The RE London Shoreditch, Don t order taxi through reception Asked for a taxi for 4 Sent car that was only suitable for 3 Unmarked car and driver did not even know how to get to Leicester Square Got out and hailed a black cab which also turned out to be cheaper Staff very abrupt bordering on rude Food expensive and not good quality , Not a lot
187168,The RE London Shoreditch, TV could be bigger Room was on the main road, Welcoming staff and the room was lovely they were very helpful Location was good easy access into central London by bus or train Food was really good with prompt service 
187169,The RE London Shoreditch, when I rang to see what was the earliest time that I could check in I had a wedding to get ready for the receptionist bombarded me with a range of prices per check in time by the hour which was rather alarming, good standard accommodation for a reasonable price in London
187170,The RE London Shoreditch, Expensive for what it is Holiday Inn Express would have been better No breakfast included Dirty plates were left outside rooms for over 12 hours The TV was small cheap and so far away from the bed that it was hard to watch The bath was so small that you couldn t lie in it properly I called ahead before we booked in and the receptionist didn t speak English The queues for check out were annoying , The beds were OK 
187171,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff are rude and unhelpful can not speak good English only interested in taking your money never smile sky TV is allways broken had no wifi internet maintenance man did not have a clue what he was meant to be doing when he came to our room to fix tv could not understand anything we said and left without doing anything no dressing gowns or slippers that are meant to be supplied free with excutive double room phoned down to reception waited an hour for a member of staff to bring dressing gowns and slippers and then only came with one of each dressing gown was rough and off colour and old beds smelt musty and unwashed the wifi internet not working again which we were not told about when we booked the room The corridors are smelly and the carpets are stained there is plaster crumbled of the wall left on the carpet in corridor if I was on a business trip as an excutive I would not be impressed at all, Comfortable beds
187172,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff that booked me in were very unhelpful and slightly rude , Room was a decent size and very clean and comfortable Staff member that checked me out was very friendly 
187173,The RE London Shoreditch, If the bed had been comfortable would never hesitate to stay again at this Hotel but the bed was not comfortable and the staff did let me try another bed in another room but it was the same and I spoke to many people who had either stayed or were still staying there and not one of them said the beds were comfortable but because their stay was only short they were not concerned But considering my stay was for 15 nights and have back problems there was no quality sleep and this was very disturbing If quality mattresses were on the beds am sure your business would be even in more demand to stay at your hotel and I would always stay there with a great comfortable mattress quality costs but not where business is concerned that needs to be a no 1 priority as so much more is going for your hotel My son and myself ate dinner there one night but one of his prawns was not cooked properly and we did report that but the staff person didn t seem to be concerned luckily my son picked up on that otherwise he could possibly of had food poisoning so therefore due to the staff person not having done anything about that we did not eat there again But saying all this re the mattress if really comfortable would stay without a hesitation and thank you to all the good staff who were wonderful and efficient and love their smiles and friendliness , The staff were always usually busy but always very helpful and willing to assist and prompt and very pleasant to deal with neat respectful and always a smile to give and room service very good as well as the girls who cleaned the room always very swift and efficient the Reception and foyer always clean and comfortable
187174,The RE London Shoreditch, Traffic noise Poor sound insulation made sleeping v difficult Even the sound of the beeping of the pedestrian crossing was annoying Perhaps rooms at rear would be better Couldn t recommend anyone to accept our room Improve the insulation please I wouldn t come back No sleep unhappy guest , Friendly staff Clean Modern 
187175,The RE London Shoreditch, The staff can be a bit unfriendly as people working on reception at a Hotel they should be more friendly and helpful they dismiss any complaints you might have and can be a bit rude, It was my last stay here with my partner we have stayed several times nice clean rooms very comfortable beds Would recommend
187176,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, I booked two rooms one for me and one for my sons for one night I requested they be close by and they were next door to each other The rooms were comfortable the free water was a nice touch We didn t have breakfast Good location for York Hall A pleasant stay 
187177,The RE London Shoreditch, WiFi might work better connaction was lost too often Getting an invoice to the company at the leave took 15 minutes , Comfortable room good for work Hotel offers parking and conference room Good restaurant bar in a hotel Good breakfast Helpful staff Getting the nearest subway station in more then 10 minutes by foot is fine for me but be aware of it 
187178,The RE London Shoreditch, Room was small and bathroom unmaintained looking dated Door to bathroom didn t close parts of shower hanging off , The reception area was nice and bright 
187179,The RE London Shoreditch, The booking in and payment systems are a bit cumbersome but nothing to worry about I would have given the hotel a top rating had it not been for the manager I was sitting in the lounge when he emerged from his office and started shouting abuse at the reception staff at the top of his voice in front of his customers He appeared generally ill natured and was also abrupt with the bar staff The owners could do better by replacing him , When I saw the promotional pictures of the RE I assumed that it was part of some standard chain such as Holiday Inn etc but it is actually a privately owned hotel of a high standard Spacious rooms immaculate cleanliness good food quality furnishing and d cor The operational staff were helpful and attentive but see don t likes Locationally it seems a bit odd but it is a short bus or taxi ride to Liverpool Street and a short walk from the very trendy London Fields area 
187180,The RE London Shoreditch, Invoice was not provided on check out and hasn t been sent to my email as agreed yet , Staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and with big enough 
187181,The RE London Shoreditch, You have to leave a 50 deposit when checking in not explained when booking that doesn t go back into your account until 7 working days after you leave I was not happy about this as it was over the holiday period so had the option to leave in cash after a lot of hesitation I don t think a deposit is necessary when you have already paid for the room and the staff member on reception was rude and less than helpful,No Positive
187182,The RE London Shoreditch, Alarm went off at 2 00 in the morning for about an hour We weren t told why or how long it would last for When we were sufficiently frozen outside and realised that there was no fire We made our way back in ,No Positive
187183,The RE London Shoreditch, On checking in the receptionist was a little rude whe she wanted to charge us 30 a night parking and I knew it was only 20 when the manager came which I may add she called he confirmed that is was only 20 she apologised I didn t think to be honest she needed to apologise but she was really angry that she was wrong didn t spoil the stay though , This is the second time we have stayed here the location for is is perfect as we visit our daughter who is on uni and lives in hoxton room is spotless and the bed is especially comfy
187184,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff Management locked door to get in and then four nights if continuously reproving my identy In four times theynever got the bbreakfast right Every breakfast was cold no cutlery no condiments TV was broken and took two days to fix it was a nightmare experience , Nothing The staff were rude and discourteous I was treated as if they were paying me and why was I there 
187185,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The hotel was comfortable and the staff were very friendly The rooms were clean and a great size Pricing is incredible for the location We stayed as part of a group for a corporate function and really enjoyed it 
187186,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Straightforward modern hotel with all normal facilities Excellent location for us close to son s house but also v convenient to tube to central London Vibrant mixed area locally Likely to use again 
187187,The RE London Shoreditch, You need to get a little bit more manners I realise that to get a room you are 110 a night But I would pay a bit more for a hello goodbye how are you Sir , Some of your staff are excellent Carlos at the Bar Kitchen was outstanding And your Bar man who owns a few dogs was a great Bar man very funny But some of your desk staff where rude Your manager never introduced himself to us either which would have been a nice touch You have a policy of asking for payment for goods As Soon As You Order Them Its very annoying I only ordered tea and coffee I am not going anywhere I would have paid the 2 for my drink We were asked to leave our room twice After agreeing the first time we would depart at 11 30 We got a physical knock at the door by a manager It did n t bother me but me it really annoyed my better half
187188,The RE London Shoreditch, Not the comfiest beds but that is quite a subjective point The TV was very small and a bit out of date , The location is excellent for exploring East London short bus journey to Bethnal Green on the one side or Shoreditch High Street on the other The hotel is clean and the staff polite professional and helpful The room I was staying in was quiet and great for a good night s sleep in the heart of East London 
187189,The RE London Shoreditch, Firstly the hotel is located in BETHNAL GREEN so is falsely advertised as London Shoreditch The main reason we stayed at this hotel was because it was advertised as shoreditch if we knew it was a 15 minute cab journey or 30 minute walk we would have never Stayed there Also when checked In we were given a room next door to a room that had building work going on which was loud and something we definitely did not want to hear , The helpful and friendly barman
187190,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were very helpful we needed a phone charger and it was no problem The location was perfect for us The room was clean as was the bathroom 
187191,The RE London Shoreditch, The room wasn t as clean as I would expect Hairs in the bathroom sticky marks on the desk grubby looking bedding The room could really use a new mattress we could feel the springs and it was pretty uncomfortable We were generally disappointed with the room It just seemed rather shabby and tried I definitely wouldn t pay more than 60 per night for this hotel , We got the room for a good price 59 and the location was great only 15 minutes away from the centre of Shoreditch The bar and gym looked good but we didn t have chance to use either 
187192,The RE London Shoreditch, Additional high car park charge Disturbances by hotel residents in adjacent rooms However more a reflection of the behaviour and manners of the hotel residents rather than quality of the hotel , A modern comfortable hotel in a modest but increasingly gentrified part of the East End of London 
187193,The RE London Shoreditch, Christmas dinner prices were abit over the top 55 pounds per person for a set menu had duck unfortunately was cold not very good, Place felt like a 5 star hotel very clean with a bar had air con nice overall a really nice place to stay 
187194,The RE London Shoreditch, Rude receptionist even asking me where I am from after I spelt surname3 times The manager came and found my booking straight away she spoke loudly I don t understand her accent she doesn t speak English I am from the area I asked why they needed my card for a further 50 per room and she said I just told you that why weren t you listening ,No Positive
187195,The RE London Shoreditch, The only negative was that the service on reception was a little slow but no major issue , Great location for Old Street Shoreditch The bed was comfortable and the room service was delicious I would definitely recommend the RE They also kept my luggage for the day which was a lovely touch as I was here for work and would have been a pain to carry to meetings Great stay 
187196,The RE London Shoreditch, Nothing so far and I ve stayed here twice , All staff are outstanding and go out of their way to pay attention to you and make sure you have what you need 
187197,The RE London Shoreditch, Two out of the three breakfasts were at best luke warm Staff were informed and said the kitchen would be informed , Ideal location for visiting family who live in Bethnal Green 
187198,The RE London Shoreditch, When i tried to order room service and i was told the kitchen was closed although i ordered within the advertised time frame It is not might fault if you are having a slow night if you advertise the kitchen to be open for a certain time frame you should stay open for your guests I would have accepted a limited menu instead of a blanket no and the staff member hanging up on me I am 8 months pregnant and really was in need of food Appalling service from the guy who answered the phone , Location cleanliness and size of room
187199,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, I regularly use the RE Shoreditch for overnight stays when I have an evening function and have to go to work in the City the next day The rooms are quiet clean and comfortable and the bathroom facilities are excellent The only slight drawback is that the nearest tube station is 10 15 minutes away but weather permitting I just walk to the City it s not too far 
187200,The RE London Shoreditch, Reception during my arrival I was told curtly that check in is at 2 00 pm and should leave my luggage in the luggage room and come back later after a long haul flight of over 10 hours Issued some dos and don ts as if even I am joining a boarding house , Facilities work perfectly and the cleanliness is superb
187201,The RE London Shoreditch, Front desk staff weren t very responsive happy and lacked knowledge of the local area Didn t take the initiative to call us when the taxi arrived so we nearly missed our friend s wedding ceremony There must have been a bubble in the water pipes as there was a vibration note that kept coming and going in the morning staff didn t seem to appreciate that this disturbed our sleep when we informed them I contacted in advance for early check in but they tried to play dumb when I arrived and also tried to charge me more than agreed by email Clearly the room wasn t ready but they faffed about instead of being honest with me , Convenient location clean rooms so I would actually stay here again just don t expect helpful staff 
187202,The RE London Shoreditch, The running water was off for my whole stay and that meant i didn t shower clean my teeth or flush the toilet for over 24 hrs When asked at the desk when it would be back on i kept getting the same answer and that answer was in one hours time I stayed and paid for a late check out so i could make sure i could shower and it still wasn t on when i left I was also not offered any compensation on my check out for the water and the whole experience was disappointing and handled poorly ,No Positive
187203,The RE London Shoreditch, The staff always looked extremely stressed and were actually quite rude on one occasion We asked could they help us print some pages for sightseeing vouchers as there are no self printing facilities we were informed there was a charge per page which was compleltey fine by us This request was met by what I can only describe as distain The lady was so rude and dismissive we just left The immediate local area is quite run down I wouldn t recommend walking alone at night , The rooms were quite nice and impeccabley clean The location is close enough to to Public transport 
187204,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, Although I have rated the location less than excellent this needs some clarification I don t like the idea of walking down hackney road at night However on a road adjacent to the hotel and a relatively short distance there is a terrific eating area All along the road is well lit and the Italian restaurant in particular is excellent The room is generous in size the bathroom very good and overall a great find for us 
187205,The RE London Shoreditch, Fairly large chip in the enamel in the bath I was woken at 4am by somebody whistling in the corridor and at 7am by kids playing and laughing loudly in the next room They are not the hotels fault just inconsiderate selfish guests , The room was great Free Internet in rooms Great value A bit of a way from the tubes 
187206,The RE London Shoreditch, Felt it was quite pricey as we were told it was a cheap rate at 139 a night which I had to pay twice as we had to amend due to circumstances outside our control, The French reception man was very pleasant polite and helpful The location was within walking distance of our required venue The room was clean and comfortable
187207,The RE London Shoreditch, Asked the hotel to book a taxi for us and we found that we were charged an amount of 12 for a journey of 1 1 miles The cost with other firms for same journey was 6 The taxi they booked did not have a meter a fact that lends itself to overcharging We did complain to the desk staff about this , Room and bed were very comfortable
187208,The RE London Shoreditch, Overly complicated breakfast arrangement where one had to decide exactly what one was planning to have before sitting down I thought I was entitled to a glass of juice and was scalded for having something I had not paid for I breakfasted at the greasy spoon across the road subsequently , Easy check in liked the location room was cleaned and tided well 
187209,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff really unkind For the first time in a hotel I was feeling uncomfortable to ask help at the reception In three days I found just two nice people as all the others were really unfriendly The Hotel is nice but I would not recommend it especially if you are in London for holiday and not for working , the cleanliness of the room
187210,The RE London Shoreditch, A constant noise in the bathromm that did not stop It sounded like a fan but there was no way of stopping it Very annoying I have complained to the hotel , Mostly this is a very nice hotel A bit pricey as it didn t include breakfast and the cost of breakfast was astronomical 
187211,The RE London Shoreditch, The fact I had requested a late check out but was disturbed twice by housekeeping The fact that I had to push for an extended check out beyond my late check out and was still charged I won t be visiting again ,No Positive
187212,The RE London Shoreditch, The area is not the best but busy so not so bad , Nice big bath sheets free bottled water great shower bathrobes and slippers provided also hairdryer and toilettries Very comfy bed right near where my son lives and close to Broadway Market We ve stayed here loads of times

187214,The RE London Shoreditch, Staff were unfriendly particularly when water was cut off during our stay for 4 5 hours , Nice functional hotel very convenient for White Hart Lane on overground 
187215,The RE London Shoreditch, Checkout was so slow I m not sure why we couldn t just hand the key back And they put a 50 charge on our card as a deposit I can understand if a group of people turn up but a couple paying over 100 for a room What were we going to do , Great location Quiet room Very clean and good facilities 
187216,The RE London Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff were very helpful one of the maintenance men helped me out with my bags Hotel is nicely refurbished to a high standard Busy hotel but efficient service
187217,The RE London Shoreditch, The bad experience was not of the hotel s making but the staff s management of its correction which relied on service delivery by a third party company was exemplary over the 6 hour period We and a handful of other guests were affected but the staff provided appropriate remedies for our differing needs , All the hotel s staff right up to General Manager level treated us as people not just as hotel guests Communication was proactive and intelligent genuinely seeking out what our needs were 
187218,The RE London Shoreditch, We upgraded to an executive room but there was no dressing table area with a mirror I had to use a really low table in front of the long mirror for my makeup etc Also the safe didn t work even after someone came and looked at it TV was tiny and bad reception Hair dryer missing from room but was provided straight away when asked for , Location was great for the purpose of our visit and this is why we have stayed several times Room was perfectly adequate for a 2 night stay 
187219,The RE London Shoreditch, stuff not overly friendly stressed out bed uncomfortable bid worn out lobby cooled down to the minimum , to be honest nothing really location was kind of OK if you like that part of town Only 1 5 k to Victoria park makes it nice for runners
187220,The RE London Shoreditch, Bit of a trek from the tube 15 mins take a cab if you have a lot of luggage breakfast price laughable when there are 2 cafes within a 2 min walk for less than half the price, Comfortable clean good sized rooms good bar didn t eat there Fast free WIFI Very reasonable room rate when we booked
187221,The RE London Shoreditch, 50 per room charged as some sort of retainer were not informed of this before we arrived Reception staff dreadful need some form of customer service training, The Room
187222,The RE London Shoreditch, London is expensive Also the lighting in the room was inconvenient I felt like in an ER Oh and the noise In fact I had to sleep with ear plugs , My room had a good bath The bedding was fresh and clean Every room seems to be equipped with a tea kettle I guess that s how they do it in London 
187223,The RE London Shoreditch, Bit if a walk for tube Staff on reception not that helpful We had to help an older gentlemen plan his route to the airport as the staff weren t helping him at all This delayed our day by 20 mins but we didn t mind However reception should be reminded they get paid to help the quests , Hotel was clean and new bus stop outside
187224,The RE London Shoreditch, That the breakfast cost extra That they run out then took ages to get fresh coffee etc , The bedroom was clean all needed was provided Check in out was simple and fast

187226,The RE London Shoreditch, We asked for a quiet room but were placed in a room facing onto the main road Traffic noise was audible all night and this increased dramatically from 6AM on A pedestrian signal directly underneath the window was also clearly audible The double glazing in these rooms needs to be improved dramatically , Clean 
187227,The RE London Shoreditch, Just the coffee at breakfast time why do so many hotels still let themselves down when there are so many good coffees available, Very Comfortable good value hotel Tube about 10min walk 
187228,The RE London Shoreditch, It was a joining room which we were not aware of Traumatized when we opened it thinking it was a cupboard to find two elderly people asleep The sheets where unclean with stains and hair The only thing I can t complain about is the location and the nice man who checked us in however not the lady who checked us out It wasn t worth 200 for the night ,No Positive
187229,The RE London Shoreditch, I spend more than two hours including time on the phone with booking com to have one day extension I fell that they where hunting me to overcharge by delaying answers to very simple request , Very poor services at reception and reservation Some of the personnel think that are investigators not receptionist in a leisure house 
187230,The RE London Shoreditch, Having had to move rooms at 4am after laying awake for hours due to a faulty extractor above the ceiling we asked if rather than the complimentary breakfast offered to us we could have the amount discounted from our bill we don t eat breakfast We were told that wasn t possible by a manager who also said our opinion on the customer service offered was ours he had his own on the situation and then smirked at a colleague as we were about to leave as if to say we won So nice hotel terrible customer service by the manager on duty ,No Positive
187231,The RE London Shoreditch, Bath rope and towels need replacing with new ones The bed well me and my partner hardly slept Over all not worth the money , The room was clean staff nice and helpful

187233,The RE London Shoreditch, When I first walked in there was a man at reception staring at me like I was lost I don t know what it was about my appearance that intrigued him so much The TV wasnt even tuned correctly therefore we couldn t fully enjoy shows because of the buzzing noise in the background, The bed is really comfortable
187234,The RE London Shoreditch, I asked for a quiet room and was reassured the room over looking the back street was fine but it was not extremely noisy I suggest your management experience their rooms from time to time , Location cleanliness and staff all very good
