143051,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, The resturant my wife ordered a burger cooked medium but it came well past well done Not burned but way too tough to eat The first night there we both ordered burgers and it was one of the best we d ever had , The Regency Club membership was given as a gift for our anniversary as well as them bringing us Champane and cake for two They just surprised us Went out of there way to make us feel special on our special day 
143052,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Flies in the buffet area They never replace the water in room and have to call them everyday to get water, Location was very central Nice bathroom and room Comfy bed Good entertainment on TV

143054,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, There are some twin rooms seperated with a wooden door for large families If you stay in one of those rooms sometimes it might be noisy if the people staying next door speak loudly or listen to music I had such an experience but when I told this at the reception they apologized and made some discount on my bill , Location was perfect Just 100 m to all shopping centers famous Oxford street and public transport Breakfast was good Staff was polite and helpful 
143055,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Room modern but a bit austere No cupboards Not a lot of light in the room Next time will try for better room, Superb staff great location Fantastic breakfast
143056,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Views from room limited, The bed was great room was well appointed the front desk staff Lorenzo was very resourceful and helpful Hotel staff welcoming and accomodative The bathroom in the hotel room with heated seat is the best 
143057,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Our toilet did not have the washing system as the other rooms we stayed in park view suite and connected to twins room and both rooms had no washing system which was disappointing, Location room size staff and this is our favorite hotel in London and we stay in it in every trip
143058,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, the room was very small compared to other London hotels i stayed in the view wasn t better room window was towards a side street and nearby building you need to pay extra to get a better room view portman square in front of the hotel is private and closed the room card keys needed to be programmed couple of times, room was very clean and updated staff was very nice and friendly specially Mr Yam the porter house keeping was fast to change the feather pillows and bed lining in my room since i have an allergy to feathers the bed was nice and comfortable WiFi was excellent and very fast
143059,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Booking com we re supposed to cover some of the cost of the booking due to issues we had with a previous apartment I have instead been billed the full amount by the hotel I have yet to call up the Hyatt and discuss as well as booking com The weekend was going well until this happened which has left a sour taste in my mouth and i will think again before using booking com, Beds were comfy and the decor was classy and tasteful All in all a nice hotel
143060,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We were staying on the 2nd Floor near a Ballroom and you could hear the music from the event there the whole night, Breakfast super friendly staff and good location
143061,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, There was a delay in getting the luggage to the room possibly because the arrival time was a couple of hours before check in time , Excellent location modern furniture and furnishings the room size was perfect great variety for breakfast being a vegetarian was not an issue 
143062,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We needed to ask for some amenities like bottles of water and tooth brush It wasn t refill on the next day after clean up , the bed is very comfy We re a group of 4 ladies and we all slept very well during our stay 
143063,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, I didnot get the room which i book from point of facility and comfort as they inform that they have avalible connected rooms but they cannot give me until i pay extra money which i found it very bad attitude from the staff, Only location
143064,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, the shower water comes out to the whole bathroom, the WiFi is good and I loved the two times house keeping room service a day and 2 bottles free water a day 
143065,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, It is VERY expensive especially on the South African Rand ZAR But it was for one night only and if I can afford it in future I would not want to stay anywhere else in London ever again , The most amazingly helpful and friendly staff from reception through to every other department that we had contact with e g housekeeping Also this is possibly the best hotel bed I have EVER slept in Is there a bed size bigger than King Size Extra Length This certainly looked and felt bigger than my own King Size at home LOVED our stay here 
143066,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We paid for a room for 3 people but one of the beds was a bunk maybe this should have been a normal single bed If it was a child that would be different but it was 3 adults But in saying that was still so comfortable the hotel staff were so fantastic , The service was outstanding Room beautiful Cleaned daily Location couldn t have been better Will for sure go back Wouldn t go anywhere else now Loved so much 
143067,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Wish I could afford to stay here all the time , Easy walk to the shops on Oxford Street restaurants nearby Gracious and friendly staff Request for early check in easily accommodated 
143068,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Reception staff were rude during check in hotel is very old smelly and its time for extreme makeover rooms were small and there was no coffee machine which is usually provided by any 5 stars hotel During my stay I called the housekeeping on a daily basis to provide water shampoo towels etc Moreover by the checkout time I paid the total amount in cash and the hotel is still blocking my bank account Overall it wasn t a 5 stars hotel and overrated , location only
143069,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, This is more that I am used to paying BUT it was extremely comfortable and a very pleasant atmosphere No problem getting a taxi and staff do not stand around waiting for tips , Excellent reception and indeed all staff are there for your comfort and convenience Excellent decor and feel good factor Rooms comfortable and well insulated so we got a good nights sleep Wonderful location 
143070,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, My sons put up bed was not really adequate for a 5 11 14yr old Unfortunately he turned over in bed and sustained quite a nasty cut to his right eyebrow on the corner of the bedside table that he had no choice but to be very close to , Everything
143071,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, The windows don t open fully, The concierge were extremely helpful the staff in general were very cooperative Spacious rooms compared to other hotel in London The electronic washing toilet Cleaned the room twice a day Complimentary water bottles daily and treats Location Fully equipped facilities for disabled guests

143077,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, The attitude of staff The treatment that discriminate The awkward talk that levelled to highly discriminative manner, the location Is excellent the hotel is a good one the breakfast and its lounge are average not good or to the standard of money paid for the hotel
143078,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, The restaurant and dinning arrangements are inadequate for the size of the hotel and certainly do not reflect its 5star rating, The location is excellent for discovering the west end The hotel room was a good size and well appointed
143079,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, My room was cold no matter how i adjusted the temp Toilet is cold with no heated bars for towels etc, Good breakfast selections Great location as well 
143080,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, The room was cleaned daily but if a napkin was under pillow then it stayed under pillow Dust was still on tables During breakfast the smell of forks stink , The location The staff were helpful 
143081,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Inside the room they don t change the linens and bed sheet for ten days because we don t have the paper that said change the sheet Last fivve days we the house keeping put this paper and they change it In addition I don t like the way of chick in with the trainer they put the mistake to each other My booking is 5 850 My card have more than this amount he don t know how to take the amount he tell me go bring it cash Imagin 5000 all in 20 segments after i give them cash and complete the rest of the amount the orderd 650 pounds as an deposit While i am withdrew I lose 250 commissions for the bank Totally unprofessional, Location security and breakfast
143082,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Bad elevators speed as it takes too long only 3 elevators are there one elevator was having problems several times of my stay there the space hallway when we go out of the elevators and heading to our room sometimes smells like kitchen Gym doesn t contain good equipment like hotel next door as it only contains Dumbbells one bench and cardio machines running cycle elliptical , Professional Staff Very friendly Clean rooms bathrooms Amazing house keeping comfort beds and rooms amazing room design room size was fine

143085,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We were initially placed in a room within an area currently being renovated and the drilling was pretty intrusive No walk in shower at 21 weeks pregnant posed an additional problem and the cleanliness of the first room was not good Had this been the extent of our experience I would have been deeply disappointed , My husband immediately sought assistance and the front desk staff were quick to remedy our unfortunate room placing us on a higher floor away from disturbance The room was sensational spotlessly clean an entirely different feel to it and thank heavens a walk in shower The room change transformed our opinion of the hotel and we were impressed with the nimble and proactive approach from the front of house A lovely night in a super location ensued 
143086,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Housekeepers don t remove all used items such as tissue towels paper bags and water bottles Bathrooms and cups are not thoroughly cleaned daily , The community of staff is very lovely and helpful at all times The location and atmosphere is also wonderful 
143087,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We didn t eat breakfast as we considered it too expensive for that particular meal , We liked the position of the dining bar area as one could sit relax and watch the world go by

143093,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, My baby had a cold while we were in London so I wasn t sleeping all night I called Housekeepers at 1 am to bring extra complementary water so they did but the next night one of the staff his name was Ron refused to bring me 1 bottled water and if I want more he will charge it to the room very rude and he hanged up the phone very quickly This thing has never happened to me at any hotel around the world they always and every day will offer more than 4 complementary water for two ppl this thing really bothered me and I don t want to come back , after I booked the hotel I read some really bad reviews so I wanted to cancel my booking but since It s not free I hoped it will be fine and it was Staff were friendly and very nice except Ron the elevators were fast and no waiting maybe because it s October the room is clean food was delicious WC has washer

143096,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Twin room is too small room deco doesn t feel like 5 star hotel also the corridor room carpet smell bad it s probably because it s old and lack of cleaning , Location and shower are great Staffs are very friendly and helpful

143099,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, busy hotel all day staff dont even notice you and most of time not welcoming you worst customer service I had in my life felt like 2 stars hotel because I always stay at luxury 5 stars hotels and get treated well this time didnt happen 1st I told them its my 1st time at your hotel and they were like Oh really yeah sure its Hyatt Regency Churchill the best and blah blah blah no one showed me how to use card for elevators and nobody bothered to show me the way to my room or presenting the room and the facilities they have Like Go find the room yourself and I requested late check out and didnt get it because its OVER booked I never heard that before and when I was waiting fof my taxi I noticed alot of guests leaving from their Rooms late after 5 pm so they just wanted me out of the room and my luggages were left OUTSIDE the hotel 12 pm and Im leaving after 6 pm when I asked them why they said we are busy and didnt get chance to store them I understand the being busy part but why throwing them outside like Im not welcome here And what was the worst of all when I asked 2 times to talk to the manager he she didnt want to meet me which was really rude I paid 1440 for 4 nights to get the best customer service but I was so disappointed Next time Im London sure I dont want to be back to this 2 stars staff hotel and will never recommend it to any of my friends or family , rooms were new and decent size and could find all amenities you need bathroom was small and wished it had walk in shower not a tub tea and coffee with kettle comfort beds and not bad view of portman square 
143100,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, We went to the bar in the evening The staff told us we had to spend 25 per person to go to the terrace and also would not let us sit in the large booths that we wanted to That was after we spent 800 in the restaurant, The champagne brunch was amazing We stayed over too and the facilities in the room were exceptional
143101,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, sometimes a bit hectic and felt a bit uncoordinated eg check in There were 5 concierge statt standing around and 2 charming ladies behind the reception which had all hand fulls because of many guests trying to check in or out another example Breakfast very hectical atmosphere Also would be great to have a larger cigar terrasse or why not a lounge to compliment CHURCHILL since tables are a rare ,No Positive
143102,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, waiting for our luggage to come up took too long , food was good although more choices would add to the our level of satisfaction WC with the its facilities was great and its the only hotel I used in UK that has such facility I will always select this hotel because of this and will recommend it to friends and family 
143103,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Only two elevators servicing the entire hotel lobby Sometimes you might need to wait to get an elevator to your room didn t try the resturant so I can t comment on it when facing the south end of the hotel there is a big construction site so very noisy very weak WiFi in the rooms , The location is very good few minutes away from Marble arch Staff are very friendly and supportive TV good channel selection Clean rooms and bathrooms Room service very professional and fast comfortable beds 
143104,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, its pricey, so i made a last minute booking at this hotel i checked in after 15 min from my booking I got upgraded to a suite of a bedroom and a living room with two bathrooms which is awesome I find the house keeping service impeccable and the free breakfast at the 8th floor is such a nice touch I have also got the offer of a late checkout for free my stay was lovely

143118,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, What I didn t like was nothing to do with Hyatt Churchill it is all about Hyatt Group they downgraded me after nine years stays on weekly basis just because I didn t stay in Hyatt for 6 months and that was because of Grand Hyatt Dubai that they had gap and lackof eexperience in handling my account as they account manager left the hotel and the new person didn t know which rate to apply until someone else came and solved the problem During that time I was staying in other hotel which took them 6 moth to resolve it , I would like to thank Joodi from the front desk for her outstanding customer service and the way handles cases and issues
143119,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill, Breakfast should really be included for 350 per night tariff And there should not be a great kafuffle at the restaurant when you request a non pre ordered breakfast The breakfast hot plate was very far from hot , The newly refurbished rooms
