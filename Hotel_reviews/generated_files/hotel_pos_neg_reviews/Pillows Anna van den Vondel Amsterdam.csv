270116,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Room was small which is quite normal if you staying in the center of Amsterdam i guess, Interior is beatuful Location is great Hotel staff is friendly and helpful
270117,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Didn t have the breakfast as I think it was too expensive , Immaculate clean and comfortable hotel with great attention to detail Best shower I ve ever had in a hotel The staff are super friendly very efficient and smart 
270118,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, There ws nothing about this hotel that we did not like and I do not recall ever having been able to say that before , This was a brilliant hotel It was run efficiently had great facilities and the staff were polite attentive and could not do enough for us I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel 
270119,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, The only thing we didn t like was the price of the breakfast which at 25 euros was over priced in our opinion , The hotel was very well presented and the staff were very attentive The room had the most comfortable bed and pillows Its set in a beautiful street next to the lovely vondelpark And has easy access to the centre of Amsterdam by tram 
270120,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, room available was not the book I booked I book a superior room and got a normal room staff offered us breakfast that we didn t want, clean room and clean hotel with lovely staff
270121,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, These a small details which did not detract from our appreciation of the hotel however I will mention I am 5 2 and could not see the mirrors in the bathroom It would be nice if they were lowered a bit Also I would have liked a wash cloth , This is a charming boutique hotel in a quiet off the beaten track location Although not in the hubbub of the central rings the location provides quick access to the park transportation and the museums After a busy day of touring the hotel provides a wonderful respite The staff was very eager to please and worked hard to fulfil all requests There is a sense of personalized service and attention Our room was nicely sized and comfortable 
270122,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, One of the best hotels I ever stayed in The attention to detail in the rooms and living area is amazing The restaurant is beautiful tranquil and the food is out of this world I enjoyed eating at the hotel much more than eating in town Staff is relaxed and friendly yet extremely efficient It is a real retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city 
270123,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Gorgeous home from home boutique hotel Wonderfully friendly and accommodating staff Terrific location Lots of class and style without being pretentious The smell of cakes baking when we came down to the delicious breakfast was to die for Pretty garden Couldn t fault it and would love to stay here again for longer 
270124,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Awkward light and temp control as mentioned above Feeling a bit nickeled and dimed when spending over 400 a night , During a previous visit to Amsterdam I had stayed near the Vondelpark a lovely location which we chose purposely on this trip for its being a bit out of the usual tourist rush of the Centrum We splurged on the Grand Suite for our tenth wedding anniversary The staff were extremely professional helpful and pleasant We were delighted and touched to find a split of champagne and some macarons waiting for us upon check in as a nod to our anniversary When we needed our soap replenished after three days of a six day stay it was handled promptly Adrian arranged for a bit of breakfast for us to take with us as we departed for the airport at the end of our stay which was beyond kind The newly refurbished property was stylishly and comfortably furnished There is also a private leafy garden with tables out back which is a lovely retreat Our suite had ample well designed storage The only complaint on the ambience score was the electronic system which programmed the lights temperature control and indicators for do not disturb and please make up room Perhaps we missed something in our room orientation but we were not able to put the lights on in only the living area for example while leaving the lights off in the sleeping area And although the bathroom lights had their own wall switch for some reason they too would be turned off if the all lights off indicator was touched by someone in the other part of the suite You ve never known pitch black until you ve been in that toilet cabinet without illumination Quelle surprise I underscore again the charm warmth and professionalism of the staff because I now have a few words for the owners of the property We were told when we checked in that the goal of the experience was to replicate the feeling of being at home which I guess was to arise from the open kitchen at the end of the dining area The chef and his staff were also extremely lovely 
270125,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Rooms a bit cramped with little to no space for big luggage No bidet, Faisal from reception was just a delight to deal with Incredibly helpful and cheery he made us feel incredibly welcome and was super efficient in assisting us with restaurant recommendations and laundry issues Located perfectly blocks away from the Museum quarter and steps away from gorgeous Vondel Park The reception area smelled amazing 
270126,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Size of room could have been bigger , Our host was brilliant his recommendations were all right on the money The room was comfortable although small Facilities in the room were good though Shower was really good which is always hard to find in a hotel when your 6 ft 4 Overall a good stay Would recommend Would say it was a little expensive based on room size 
270127,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, We spent ages trying to find the hotel There is a small plaque on the wall that identifies it that s all ialso would have preferred a buffet style breakfast with bacon eggs cheeses and breads rather than a served breakfast, The bed was amazing
270128,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Breakfast a little pricey so we didn t have breakfast at the hotel , Lovely hotel in an ideal location for exploring the city a short tram ride from the city centre The hotel was comfortable and has been refurbished to a very high standard modern clean and bright The staff were all very friendly and helpful Our only regret is we only booked for 2 nights So much to see and do and unfortunately we didn t get time to do everything We will come again and stay at this hotel 
270129,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Everything met our expectations , Very comfortable room Hotel recently renovated with new plush carpeting throughout The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent 
270130,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel is ideally situated just outside the old city centre on the No 1 tram route The hotel was quiet and comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful
270131,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, House keeping did not always replenish the tea and coffee and we had to ask for more , The hotel was very good and the facilities are good It is located near to a tram route which made it is to get to and from the centre of Amsterdam 
270132,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Staff were professional and very friendly nothing was a problem with staff being very attentive to your needs The room was very comfortable also was very quiet with emphasis given to soft closing doors and sound proofed windows What an amazing nights sleep the best I ve ever had in a hotel room , Comfort Staff

270134,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, The best hotel ever stylish comfortable with nice service The bed and pillows are amazing The room was small but it was a pleasure to live here A small round table and chairs made a perfect combination for drinking tea and wine 
270135,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, It s a new hotel so there are still something that needed to be improved such as some facilities and the smell of the paint , The staff is really nice and helpful Although there are some problems at first they helped me to resolve them very soon Plus good location easily access to the public transportation 
270136,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, Couple of issues Minor moderate ones I specifically asked NOT to get service I just do not like housekeeping going in my room when it is just a short stay When I returned to my room I could notice my request was not respected What is even worse the cleaning lady emptied the trash bins but left them in the middle of the room next to the empty tissue box from the bathroom that she did not refill Seemed like she kind of left the room in the middle of the cleaning process I asked for help for a specific restaurant and I was suggested to visit one When I got there I needed to realized that they have no items on their menu according to the specific diet I was asking guidance for Major ones Needed to wait cca 20 minutes for my invoice at check out because they could not manage earlier to figure out how to add the name of my company even though I requested this already when I made the booking I was offered a 25 discount due to the inconvenience with the room I did not ask for it but when the staff realized that I pre paid my room they just simply said Oh okay so then there is nothing to pay Well this is quite unprofessional , Brand new hotel with all the advantages and disadvantages Bed is super comfy the whole hotel is charming The design is beautiful the location is great One can sense that they are doing their best to do the whole thing right but it seems that they kind of lack the experience to accomplish this goal The staff is trying to be nice and helpful but they sometimes lack experience confidence and or genuineness to really do so Entire staff would need better training 
270137,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, We had a really great stay Pillows The hotel has been totally refurbished 2 months ago The room was great Breakfast was great We had a perfect brief of what we could do in Amsterdam wihin 2 days upon up arrival Hotel is just close to a lovely park and from tramway 1 The you are 10 minutes away from the center Definitely a place to go for a lovely lovers week end

270139,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, The stairs would be difficult for disabled persons, We had a room in the upper floors with a view to the garden It was nice to see the squirrels also birds play in the larch The room was well equipped and the interior design was just beautiful Although the room was small it was well planned and functional Bed was excellent with lovely bedding not to mention the superb towels The shampoos and shower gels had a lovely fragrance The staff was very helpful and friendly Lovely experience 
270140,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam, We arrived late at night and the front door was locked No door bell to get in so we weren t sure what to do Ended up having to switch data roaming on and call the hotel to let us in , Beautiful hotel room was great albeit a little on the small side Great location great staff

270142,Pillows Anna van den Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, My boyfriend and I have just returned from Amsterdam I had surprised him with a trip for his birthday We had the most fabulous stay at Pillows hotel I couldn t fault one thing from start to finish From reception to bedrooms the hotel was clean and modern with a boutiquey feel throughout You could sleep for days in those beds and make snow angels in the thick plush carpets what comfort dreams are made of As for the staff I can t stress enough how fabulous they were friendly calm up for laugh and incredibly attentive they did everything to make our stay the most special it could be At the start we experienced a slight mix up with our room thought what we had booked had a terrace but this was quickly resolved by the fantastic staff who showed us to a different room equally as fabulous that was better suited to our requirements if of interest swapped to basement room it had doors that led to an outdoor patio Since it was a celebratory trip I had asked the hotel to decorate the room with balloons etc for when we arrived back to the hotel after a day in town Normally a hotel would just put a bottle of champagne on ice but on hearing my boyfriend has more of a sweet tooth than love for alcohol the hotel manager kindly went out herself to source a selection of sweets and chocolates to sprinkle around the room with balloons and a birthday banner What a woman All in all I can t recommend this place enough I will most definitely be returning there on my next trip to Amsterdam and can only hope that they expand to more cities around the world
