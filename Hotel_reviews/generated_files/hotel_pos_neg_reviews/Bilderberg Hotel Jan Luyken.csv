349006,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, the showers in the bathroom were ridiculous water goes all over the floor so that extra towels have to be used to mop it all up not good for our environment , The Airlines lost my luggage and your desk staff were exceptionally helpful in trying to locate It never did turn up but I do want to thank each and everyone one of them for all they did to help me with this problem

349008,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Stayed in room with Single bed that was fine except for the shower in the bathroom which only has a curtain around it no stall to keep the water from spreading onto the floor As the drain cannot adequately absorb the flow the bathroom floor gets drenched with each shower A bit messy to say the least , Clean compact single room with a good functioning desk with outlets for electronic gear The location is also quite good with the centre nearby as well as easy access to the more refined Old South residential area with wonderful restaurants and cafes

349014,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, I found the rooms a little overpriced and the breakfast was not even included in the price Taking the breakfast extra is also quite pricey, The rooms were tasteful and comfortable and the staff was very nice and helpful
349015,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Teabags weren t replenished after first night but this was a minor slip , Great location very handy for the major art museums and the airport bus number 197 and nice and calm after a busy day Friendly and helpful staff including in the bar which was a good place to have a quiet drink after that same day 
349016,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Beds could be more confortable My room mate had breakfast once she said it was ok not wonderful But we were surrounded by good caf s and restaurants and could taste very nice breakfasts each day , Location is formidable The hotel is quite nice the room is good and the bathroom too The staff is excelent 
349017,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The size of a standard double room is quite tight We were put into an extremely small one to start off but were then moved after we complained , The location was excellent if you re interested in visiting the museums The staff were very helpful and had fulfilled my special request for soya milk which was great

349021,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Single room tiny for an exorbitant price with breakfast not included Bathtub difficult to access no space to open close the shower door Wall to wall carpet a bit tired , Perfect location near Vondelpark museums the Concertgebouw Lovely view from the window Some of the staff were flexible and helpful a gentleman receptionist offered to find and print out the platform number for my early morning train 
349022,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Parking on the street was painful you have to remember to pay the meter daily and difficult to obtain , Great location for high end shopping and a couple important museums

349028,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Rooms were extremely small size This was not obvious in photos posted on Booking com Room rate is very expensive compared to the less than average rooms and service Breakfast was also modest and very expensive as well Definitely I won t stay in this hotel on my next visit, Near to city center
349029,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, I guess the hotel itself is old There is only 1 elevator and it is very old The hallways and room doors are old and basic Bathrooms are old although they are clean If you are looking for luxury this hotel is not for you , Location is excellent 2 minutes walking from Tram Bus Stop Bus 197 takes you directly to from the Airport Short ride on Tram 2 and 5 takes you to the middle of Centrum Me and wife love to walk so except for a couple of times when it was very cold late at night we just walked to and from the hotel You can walk from any where in Centrum to the hotel in less than 30 minutes Hotel is very clean and all what you need as a traveller is in the room we had a premium room You will have Coffee Tea kettle and service in the room for free A safe is a available an iron and iron board 
349030,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken,No Negative, Beautiful hotel very friendly staff perfect location near delicious restaurants walking distance to great shopping and close to public transportation to whisk you away to other charming places throughout Amsterdam 
349031,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, We also rented a room for our daughter It was 170 a night It was smaller than her dorm room at college I would not have rented that room for her if I had seen a photo that truly reflected the size of the room The hotel must use a fish eye lense to make the room look a lot bigger than it really is Lots of steps in the hotel Someone who is handicapped would not be able to go to breakfast It would have to be served in the bar area or brought to their room The treads for the steps are shallow which is a problem too The bathtub shower was difficult to get in and out of The side of the tub is very high The makeup mirror is so high on the wall only a tall person could use it We were charged 20 for breakfast Booking com said it would be 16 euro which is about 16 40 right now , The size of our bedroom was generous The comfort of the bed was very good The location was great 
349032,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Maid service tried twice to come into the room in the morning waking me up And they started hammering something around 9am This stopped after I called the front desk , The staff were very pleasant The was location perfect as I ve been to Amsterdam before and liked being away from all the tourists It is only a block away from a main area but feels remote and calm 
349033,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, While not facing a busy street our room on the third floor was very noisy The single window glazing offered no protection whatsoever making it difficult to find sleep during the night The same was true for noise from inside the hotel we heard every door clapping room maids moving around in the floor etc It was as if it was all happening next to our bed That was very different to modern hotels and for me personally will be the reason to not book this hotel again as lovely the house and interior is A room change while initially envisaged for half way during our stay was not feasible in the end , The Hotel is conveniently located in the Museum quarter with a very charming architecture and easy access to the inner city 
349034,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The room is a bit small but perfect for a couple and well equipped, The location is excellent right next to the museums and in a very elegant neighborhood Downtown is easily reachable with a 10 minutes walk The hotel is very nice and cosy the staff absolutely helpful and nice The breakfast is nice and abundant 
349035,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Nothing, Excellent quiet location and yet not fat from lovely shops museums bars and restaurant Helpful friendly staff Lovely clean and spacious rooms
349036,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Reception desk staff was neither unfriendly nor friendly We just did not feel welcomed Stairs within one floor level make it inconvenient when you travel with more than light hand baggage , Very close location to the main museums as well as for city walks 
349037,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, We did not like the fact that the bathroom smelt as if somebody had been smoking in there even when it was a non smoking room , We loved the location and the receptionist who brought us an ibuprofen at 1 am thank you 
349038,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Noisy building site nearby could do with double glazing but otherwise a good 3 star hotel with friendly staff , Wifi good well located for attractions 
349039,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Pity that this hotel ignores the concept of sound proof windows street noise can be disturbing The overhead rainshower has probably not seen any maintenance since installation and scale deposit obstructs more than half of it , The single bed is comfortable and larger than a standard single bed
349040,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Breakfast was expensive and the service a little tardy Had to ask for tea and coffee minor point I suppose Our room directly above the front door and we experienced noise appreciate it was probably quieter than central Amsterdam , Location was superb Museum district airport express bus stop and trams 2 5 into the centre all a minute away 
349041,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, the room was very small nothing like the pictures there was no noise isolation we hears everything from the hall and fron the rooms above us the bathroom smelles very oddly like a smell of a very old and moist room , the staff was really nice and the location was perfect few minutes walk from the i amsterdam sign
349042,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Don t think the hotel is worth nearly 200 per night Staff are friendly and hotel is clean Location is ok about half an hour or so walk into the centre of Amsterdam Would suggest that the hotel invests in some rubber bath mats for the bathrooms Shower over bath I had a nasty fall during my stay resulting in a bad gash on my knee and multiple bruises never really thought about reporting it at the time The shower over the bath is quite a neat set up Would prove very difficult and uncomfortable for a larger person Overall Amsterdam is brilliant and I will definitely be planning another journey in the future perhaps to a different hotel maybe safer , Clean hotel friendly staff fully secured at night time 
349043,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The booking com driver dropped us at the wrong Bilderberg hotel even though we told him it looked nothing like the photo on the website, The location staff were great
349044,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room was comfy and clean however was a little too small for my liking and having to pay to use spa facilities I feel should be included, Loved the location appearance from outside was great and staff helpful 
349045,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Despite the receptionist informing us that our bags would be kept safe as our room wasn t ready We returned that evening to find our bags in our room We were satisfied with this until finding that one of the suitcases was broken Despite informing reception no suitable compensation was provided and the bag remains still broken ,No Positive
349046,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Bath was badly marked and bidet cracked so nice big bathroom which needs attention However plenty of hot water and very clean , Great location near all public transport and wonderful museums but in a lovely quiet road Good size room with wonderful comfy bed Would recommend and hope to go back 
349047,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The location for dinner is at their other hotel a few minutes walk away , Great variety to chose from at breakfast Brilliant location in a quiet street but close to museums restaurants Helpful staff 
349048,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, pillows no choice and the ones available were too high a small complaint and I wouldn t be mentioning it only you asked , location fantastic coffee machine in the room generously supplied with coffee pods robes slippers and toiletries of a really good standard Lovely and quiet yet not off the beaten track Really close to trams and busses and two minutes to Van Gogh 197 bus from the airport leaves you less than 5 mins from the hotel 
349049,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room much smaller than the impression given by the photographs Breakfast pricey at 19 5 euros Smelly drain in bathroom on first night Cleared up after that , Staff were very helpful and friendly Very good location
349050,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, On our last morning there was a lot of noise in the hallway outside our room From around 8 in the mornign house keeping staff were there hoovering and banging , Staff service generallywere fantastic location was fantastic only around the corner from Van Gogh museum and Heinken experience Also near bus stop that has direct bus to airport bus 197 Rooms bathrroms were small but comfortable but location made up for it 
349051,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The total stay had been more negative then positive First the toilette had some brown dirt directly on the seat which we had to clean ourselves because we needed to go on the toilette After complaining at the reception we only got offered a different room which wouldnt make sense as we already cleaned up Further the room had been very noisy Whole night some kind of blubbering sound was to hear incl something sounded like a motor Wont recommend the hotel as 180 EUR per night is much to expensive for this uncomfortable stay ,No Positive
349052,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Very weak wifi in the room especially during the day No international tv channels none english speaking channel The receptionist made mistake in booking didn t follow our directions and he booked wrong time for a table in our favourite restaurant , Perfect location just next to the tram and bus station going directly to the airport and close to luxury stores and museums
349053,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken,No Negative, Everyone who works at the hotel is wonderful And the cleaning staff is exceptionally accommodating and efficient and so kind I felt very much at home Some hotels are so impersonal as to be forbidding but not this one It is small cozy and pristine 
349054,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The room is comfy but just a bit dark lacking in atmosphere Not the worst thing in the world Room service selection , Right next to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh Museum Iamsterdam sign Bike rental Right next to Vondelpark Easy tram and bus access Good pillows Clean 
349055,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Not worth the money at least room where we stayed The same room have no jacuzzi hydromassage as I saw in description BE aware with the parking you have to pay for it I hope this will help others , Good location
349056,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, 20 for breakfast and 5 for crisps in the mini bar seems a bit excessive but that s the price you pay for a boutique hotel in Leidseplein , Great location with plenty of shopping cafe s and bar lounges all a short walk away Rooms were modest yet functional and the blankets were super comfortable 
349057,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The spa facilities were falsely advertised It s only big enough for one person you have to book and there is a 35 charge that isn t advertised anywhere in hotel literature , Location size decor were all lovely
349058,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Absolutely nothing , Location A couple of minute walk to Van Gogh Museum Stedelijk Museum and Rijksmuseum I didn t do Stedelijk but if you want to do one of each of these museums a day this is the perfect location to stay in my opinion As an added bonus there s Albert Heijn grocery store chain right next to Stedelijk Van Gogh Museum so I could just grab some food and other necessities on my walk back to the hotel and I loved it The street on the other side of the hotel is lined up with high end stores Louis Vuitton Gucci Hermes etc and well lit so it s nice and safe to stroll around at night Also it s a short walk to the canal and a tour boat office Blue Boat During my stay they had this Christmas illumination canal tour going at night Watercolors so I booked a tour The tour started from the office location so it was very convenient Bath tub very nice size bath tub I m 5 4 and I could stretch all out in the bath tub If you like taking a bath after a long day of museum visiting like I do don t forget to bring your favorite bath salts or bath bomb Was hard to find in stores while staying Amenities the room was equipped with little luxuries like an espresso machine hot water pot different glasses for different types of drinks a fridge a big mirror behind it there s an iron and ironing board stuff that s nice to have but not always available at the same time at other places I ve stayed Much appreciated Staff every staff member I interacted with was courteous and professional and it made my stay a pleasant one When I checked in I arrived around 10am and a twin room two beds not double was ready At first I mentioned I d just leave my luggage and wait for the double room to become available but then I changed my mind while putting my luggage down really wanted to take a bath and a nap after my flight 
349059,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room and bathroom were very small Paris size Breakfast room also small and therefor not much privacy we had to share a table with an other couple Staff was professional but could show a bit more enthusiasm interest in guest a bit dutiful The bar is not very welcoming however there are more than enough good options in the neighborhood , Very good location close to museum district the premium shopping street P C Hooftstraat and theatres Leidseplein Public transport tram close to hotel quiet and safe area cozy atmosphere boutique style hotel 
349060,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The windows are single glazed only This means the room was not quite warm enough December stay and noise from the street was not filtered out , The location close to main museums Well equipped rooms Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent breakfast Nice extra touches such as Nespresso machine and kettle in rooms and free buns at the reception desk 
349061,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The radiator under the window was not on and it was very cold the first night However I turned the white knob and the heat came on later The space for shower is a bit small and the room, I liked very much the breakfast only the bacon was overcooked and the price is too high and the service Everyone was very helpful and polite I hope they help me now by sending me 1 2 minor things I left behind 
349062,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken,No Negative, The location was excellent The room was clean spacious and had a really nice view of the park the bathroom was a good size with lovely products provided The staff were friendly and helpful and were very willing and able to be of assistance Close to transport links and loads of great museums I would definitely recommend the property and would stay again 
349063,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The furniture and decor in the rooms is not as expected for 4 stars The staff is friendly but the ones at the reception seemed unprofessional and did not clearly explain the deposit which has to be blocked , Good location next to the museums and walking distance from the main attractions The room was spacious amd clean The breakfast has a lot of choice 
349064,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Perhaps the bath towels could have been a bit bigger , Comfortable room Good bathroom Close to Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum the purpose of our trip 
349065,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location A block from the Rijsmuseum the Van Gogh the tram and a canal A great place to stroll around Very safe with a fabulous bakery just around the corner Nice comfortable quiet room 
349066,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, My room was relatively small for me it wasn t a problem , Very nice location close to Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum but on a quiet street Overall a very pleasant stay 
349067,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Level of customer service not acceptable Arrogant and immature reception service on arrival Average room nothing special I doubt I would stay here again , Very good location for key Amsterdam museums 
349068,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Rooms are tiny I had some problems during Check in I was double charged so had to wait for a couple of days to get my money back on the credit card , The location of the property was worth staying very close to many places of interest and about 20 min from the train station 
349069,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, In October 2016 there was road repairing on the street so a little bit noisy in the morning The single room was really small but still enough if you are travelling with light baggage , Location was the main advantage of this hotel close to museum plain All other things are good as well Clean Hotel is old but furniture is pretty modern 
349070,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, My single room was quite cramped with barely space for the desk and chair so no armchair or anywhere comfy to sit except the bed My bathroom had a fairly confined wetroom style shower which although powerful was not very convenient Given that public transport in Amsterdam is so good I think you could save money by finding somewhere a bit further out with more space , Excellent location in a lovely area Right next to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh Museum boutique shopping on Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat and the very relaxing Vondelpark Also walking distance to the centre Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable bed 
349071,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The bar was opened till midnight but they had turned coffee machine off before 11pm Wr returned to hotel thinking we could have a nightcap and coffee , The beds were comfortable and clean A little bit of luxury for out last night in Amsterdam Its in a great spot We actually walked gack from the city 
349072,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Some staff were unsure over booking trips etc Booked a cruise but only paid small amount and still had to pay at Kiosk for the trip A lot of exposed heating pipework within the room is this typical to Amsterdam or just dated plumbing The road and pavements were being replaced on the whole street access was OK but not ideal I accept the Hotel can t do anything but prior notice or a few words on arrival would have been courteous, Location was fantastic Welcoming Reception Nice room but small but you don t spend time n your room so no worries 
349073,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The cleaners varies and some are not so good I found my sleeping socks beneath the duvet after the had made the bed which showed that she just pulled it Also found a sweet in one of the armchairs I would prefer that the shower was not on top of the bath which was very high and slippery , If you like to go to museums shopping beautiful and expensive clothes and also eat in good restaurants the location is perfect The superior rooms are big and comfortable the breakfast very good The staff is very attentive and charming 
349074,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Single room very small Construction work on pavement road outside hotel started well before 7 00am , Excellent location for Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum 
349075,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Hotel could have told us in advance that street outside was being reconstructed Daytime noise didn t bother us though because we were out being tourists , Excellent location friendly and responsive staff windows opened for fresh air comfortable bed good size room nice little bar area looking out onto internal courtyard
349076,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Street outside being dug up will be temporary I needed to amend Booking com reservation which was impossible to do online I phoned hotel to make the change but there was still confusion which in the end got resolved , Very comfortable helpful friendly staff great location

349080,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, At the time of our stay the surrounding road was going through major reconsrtruction That was a complication mainly for the cab drivers , Location flexibility when checking in 
349081,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Not being told after asking that our car was at risk in the street It was broken into the first night We put it in a parking station not too far away for the rest of our stay ,No Positive
349082,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, the room was small certainly not worth the money i paid and the breakfast was not good for the money either , the staff where friendly and the hotel was clean 
349083,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, There was a subtle but constant buzzing sound from outiside our room more obvious overnight from the ventilation system maybe During check out double check what you have been charged , The espresso coffee machine The fast WiFi we used the free one The summery weather in early September the perfect time to visit Amsterdam We will be back 
349084,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, I was given two single beds put together rather rather a double which I had originally booked Breakfast requires more variety , Extremely good location with excellent knowledgeable staff 
349085,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, We went for two nights and stayed in room 1 there were road works taking place from 8am noisy if you want a lie in a bit noisy throughout the night party people even though it s not in a party area , Very nice small hotel friendly and helpful staff 
349086,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The road is under construction and the parking is a little bit expensive , very good location continent to visit VanGogh Museum and easy to take bus tram to go to the center 
349087,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, There is no parking available at the hotel Public parking in the area is expensive 40 d due to the location in the centre of Amsterdam an alternative is to park at the Olympic stadium for 8 d including a public transport pass , Perfect location for our purposes Bed was super comfortable Staff was very helpful 
349088,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The single room is so small It is smaller than 14 sq m as it is written on the website , The location and the staff There is a direct bus from the airport to the bus station near the hotel 
349089,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The bathrooms are so poorly designed a to access Space between basin and opposite wall is barely enough for a well built person to squeeze through and accessing shower positively dangerous Distance between end of bed and desk was so tight I know it was not the super room but it was ridiculously cramped as a result of poor design Snack bar food was overpriced and not appetising , Fittings well kept cleaning was very good Staff courteous Access to City very good 
349090,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Water pressure in shower very poor Small annoyance being coffee pods for Nespresso machine not replaced and iron could be replaced with a modern steam model, Excellent position and very friendly and accommodating staff We were given a big quiet room at the back of the hotel as requested 
349091,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room a bit crammed but lovely Nice finishes , Location location location Right next to tram and bus stop Airport bus direct to the stop Close to museums Tim helped us with our luggage thank you Tim Staff very helpful Thank you for the apples at the reception desk 
349092,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Nothing really , Of all the hotels near Museumplein this hotel takes the prize We have stayed at Piet Hein several times and enjoyed it but when you get older being less than 2 blocks from Van Gogh Museum and not much further to Rijksmuseum and Stedeljik is a good thing The building is old world with modern comforts Room front desk were great Wonderful restaurants nearby 
349093,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Offhand manner of some of the reception staff Although I am aged 80 and walk with a stick was not offered help with luggage Shower over bath problametic for older guests Several times the key did not work necessitating going back down to reception after coming back tired Faulty bed light not repaired during our one week stay , Great location good breakfast helpful housekeeping staff size of room comfortable bed and pillow 
349094,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, We paid EUR 175 city tax for a night in this hotel and we ve got a tight room with a small window about 40x80 centimetres and even this window was at 1 8 m high Since we knew that we were gonna get there quite early we asked for the check in between 11 12 I don t think that this could not have been arranged with just a minor effort of organization the first room left by any other guest in the morning should have been cleaned at first but they couldn t make it we had to wait up to 12 30 when we ve got this hole , At least on the 2nd day they allowed us to remain in the room longer than usual check out time so we could leave only about 2pm 
349095,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Road s reconstaction just before bilding They start at 7 o clock Wi fi is not so good , Good location Good staff they change our room from basement to 4th floor
349096,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Shower was not separate from toilet and created a flood like condition, Location was in a quieter neighborhood by the museums Good staff clean and functional room but very small
349097,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Stair access to the breakfast room the lift did not go down there Jan Luyken Straat was inaccesible in part not of course the fault of the hotel , The location suited the purpose of the visit The staff were very helpful and with a smile 
349098,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Breakfast is way overpriced for what it is and it s in a basement room with no windows I would recommend eating breakfast at one of the many cozy cafes around town instead Room on the street was a bit noisy no double glazing on windows , Location was great nice neighborhood Bike rental was convenient Staff very friendly Comfortable cozy hotel 
349099,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Really small room next to the elevator roof view from the windows small bar without garden Closet too small for 7 days stay for 2 persons We didn t unpack the suitcases Construction work on the street in front of the hotel , Excellent location for best museums and for shopping branded clothing You need transport for old city restaurants red light district and other touristic location of interest Public transport 150 m from the hotel next to Rijks Museum Recommended daily ticket Room and bathroom bathroom was really nice and big were always very clean Bed was very comfortable and big enough 
349100,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Breakfast had limited variety not worth the would recommend the bakery coffee shop around the corner Construction outside noisy, very comfortable beds front desk staff were excellent very accommodating Would stay there again for sure
349101,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Road works outside extra tax s put on room 50 Expensive breakfast It may have been OK if you like a big breakfast but not if you require a light meal , Good position for museums near to communications
349102,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, I wish there were draws for storing our clothing as there for five days , The staff was the best part Excellent location to the museums Concert Gebouw Breakfast amazingly good and requests so kindly accommodated Bed bath lights excellent Kept very clean Good to have frig electric pot for tea 
349103,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The rooms are not big though it was ok for us The hotel itself is also small more like boutique hotel Breakfast room was on the 1 floor and thus had no windows and was too tiny On the whole it is a good place to stay for a few nights but costs a bit too much , Not far from the center just next street to the museum square less drunk and drugged tourists nice neighbor buildings many good restaurants in a walking distance The staff was very kind and always ready to help and answer all our questions 
349104,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The breakfast was adequate but not anything special not particularly good value There was a mix up when we checked in over whether we had prepaid for breakfast This was resolved when we checked out , The hotel is conveniently located next to the major museums The room was air conditioned and a reasonable size The bed was very comfortable 
349105,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The price of the breakfast was a bit steep , Very close to main museums and in a quiet street yet easy to walk into the city centre from here or take the tram from just around the corner Large comfy bed in good sized ground floor room 
349106,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Bathrooms do need better ventilation as some other reviewers have already remarked , Staff were friendly and helpful they recommended restaurants made reservations on our behalf Room was comfortable and well equipped Location of hotel was great with a tram stop nearby Breakfast also good 
349107,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken,No Negative, Great location Not to far from all the sites Loved everything about the Hotel and the staff The breakfast fair was also excellent We will be back 
349108,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room size we had room 510 a standard twin I doubt the room was more than 4 metres square excluding the bathroom it was simply too small to be comfortable in There was a tiny wardrobe with 6 hangars and two small shelves to put your clothes on this is inadequate The recently renovated bathroom was very attractive with hi tech equipment but as there was no water pressure it was pretty near useless I spoke to a receptionist at a nearby hotel and apparently these tiny rooms are the norm in the Museum Quarter Next time I will spend more and get a room that is comfortable or try another area out of the tourist hotspot , Very friendly and helpful staff at reception
349109,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Room was smallish with no drawers and few options for hanging hand wash We were there for almost a week so that was a minor nuisance , Location is perfect Very near Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum Trams and bus from airport stop by Rijksmuseum A park concert hall and restaurants nearby Nice quiet block Very pleasant helpful staff Bed was very comfortable We would definitely stay again

349113,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Generally speaking rooms have limited free space if you don t like narrow places like me this could be a bit disturbing , Location is perfect if you want to be close the museum center Staff helped to change our room from basement to first floor 
349114,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Nothing I didn t like but here s a couple of tips My room on the 4th floor required me to climb a few steps not an issue for me with small luggage but something to look out for Also lift door is manual so unless you open the door when the lift stops it will move to wherever it s been called with you still in it I took the stairs a couple of times but note that they re pretty steep , Fantastic location just down the road from Museum Square and bus tram stop direct connections to Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam Centraal Take a walk from Amsterdam Centraal to the hotel and you ll pass by most of the city s sights Lots of eateries and shops all around although most close by 6pm Staff were friendly and helpful As a solo female traveler I felt completely safe walking around the area even at night

349119,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, TV Not that we watched that much as there wasn t anything worth watching only BBC2 despite Beeb1 being listed as channel 22 This is just nitpicking , Position in the Musem quarter but a short walk to Vondelsparc and Princengraft Good transport link via team canal boat to Old Town Very quiet position but easy to get to centre Couldn t have been better Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful The room was spotless and comfortable better bed than I have at home Would have been nice to have another English Channel to watch other than BBC2 
349120,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Inevitable wait for some for breakfast Standard rooms a bit small but did not bother us , Very clean bedroom serviced well Beds very comfortable quiet location so good night s sleep Standard room small but adequate for our needs Breakfast was good we ate early so avoided any delays Very pleasant helpful staff Excellent location for bus to from airport and to Kukenhof gardens Close to museums good quality shops and places to eat We dined at The Seafood Bar two evenings which was excellent We took breakfast in the hotel which was good

349123,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Noisy sometimes from being under flight path of planes landing in Schipol when the wind blew from a certain direction , Great location very close to the Riyksmuseum and away from the seedy side of the city Personal friendly service 
349124,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, The breakfast was overpriced and the selection was only basic The room we stayed in was very small and stuffy Similarly the bathroom was small and got very hot from the shower The room was very dusty and the sink wasn t cleaned well Parking nearby is expensive and not secure so do not drive Generally an expensive stay for an average hotel , Staff were excellent throughout the stay Location was great right next to the museums and easy walking distance from the canals 
349125,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, Very poor overhead lighting in the rooms, Excellent location near the major museums in a quiet neighborhood Friendly staff clean and comfortable room though a bit small Would stay here again

349129,Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken, We were moved from our first room as there were a few things wrong with it this was dealt with very quickly and professionally but unfortunately we then had to move again the following night On the plus side we got to see 3 different rooms in the hotel all different all comfortable , Very friendly staff and a super location for visiting the museums It was also very peaceful for a city hotel apart from some rowdiness out on the street in the early hours of Sunday morning but that s not the hotel s fault There is a nice bar area and the rooms were comfortable with very well thought out lighting
