34660,The Rembrandt, English standard breakfast is difficult to like There is no whole milk much less half and half and the coffee has almost no caffeine It won t wake you up at all , The concierge was very helpful and taxis were right in front all the time Very central location 
34661,The Rembrandt, Only the one lady having a bad day Everyone else was extremely helpful and very kind , The eggs were not cooked enough The beds were great as was everything else except for the breakfast hostess the first morning very sour Made it clear a large party was a bother In room iPhones with local attractions and very detailed maps was awesome Also able to call home was awesome We had a great time and would stay again without hesitation 
34662,The Rembrandt, Was initially given an inferior room to which I had paid for displayed on the booking site This was quickly corrected by the reception staff , The ambience was relaxing and friendly Very helpful staff
34663,The Rembrandt, Don t stay if it s a business trip as it doesn t cater to business people The rooms lobby and gym don t look like the photos on the website it is a really old hotel but not in a good way , I paid for a Club room on Booking com and when I got my room Room 666 the photos did not match the ones on Booking com I was told to complain to Booking com about it but the photos are still up on the site and I feel if the Rembrandt are going to be available on Booking com they should make sure it is correct I was moved begrudgingly to a better room but it had soft decaying apples on the table and the bathroom was small The rooms seriously need a renovation if someone is paying more than AU 600 per night I chose The Rembrandt imagining I would get an elite hotel and found it old and tired I tried to print out a book contract on the computers in the lobby and the printer had run out of ink I assume this is supposed to be the business centre A table with two computers and a printer in the lobby I had to organise to get someone from the front desk to print it and they weren t overly impressed None of this suggests a hotel with as many stars or costs as much as it does The breakfast was pretty bad the eggs overcooked not runny the tomatoes waterlogged and the juice containers appeared dirty and had drip tray saucers underneath again I would not expect this from a hotel like The Rembrandt The bar lounge was OK but I wouldn t expect to have televisions playing in there and it was largely empty with very old 1970s carpet and furnishings I m afraid I was really disappointed in the experience and will stay somewhere else next time Just as a note a Club room should only be called a Club room if you have a Club lounge I booked this room also believing I would have access to a Club room for the extra money I paid It is deceptive and I was told many other people had mistaken the same thing Call it something else 
34664,The Rembrandt, Read instructions on operating the Jacuzzi bath but not able to find the on off switch or button , The Handy phone provided in room was helpful but not really worked like own device 
34665,The Rembrandt, Old door in bedrooms and especially if interconnecting allowed sound to travel through too much and service in breakfast area was slow at busy times , bedroom was well equipped breakfast was good
34666,The Rembrandt, The restaurant in particular the rooms and reception are extremely dated The gym facilities are abysmal and the 7 00 charge is ridiculous for its use , Location and the building itself 
34667,The Rembrandt, I booked a twin bedded room as I was meant to be staying at the hotel with a friend not my partner The twin beds were right beside each other My friend was unable to come with me so my partner took her place so it was fine for us but would have been a bit too cramped for two friends sharing the room , Comfortable quiet bedroom but a little cramped Breakfast was good 
34668,The Rembrandt, Too bad we only have to stay one night , Spacious rooms attention to details quick check in and out free use of mobile phone internationally and locally friendly and not intimidating staff great breakfast spread
34669,The Rembrandt, Nothing I can think of Everything was just perfect for our stay , Very nice hotel excellent breakfast perfect central location to tubes buses A special mention on the most helpful concierge They were so helpful and willing to assist with anything They even arranged a hired car for us just before we were about to check out It was sorted and arranged in a flash Traveled and stayed all over in the UK for 2 weeks and this was one of my best stays and locations If i visit London again i will most definitely book here again 
34670,The Rembrandt, The rooms have jacuzzi baths which looked good until you hear the neighbouring room using it It drowned out the TV any conversation and one neighbour decided to have a jacuzzi bath at 5 30am waking me up The staff in the bar were very offhand and unwelcoming we were going to spend the evening there and ended up only having one drink and leaving , It had a very comfortable bed very clean and an amazing location The neighbourhood was stunning with loads of cool cafes and shops The museum is a must visit and the local architecture is beautiful 
34671,The Rembrandt, What s not to like , Great hotel in a great location Staff were really lovely and nothing was a problem Breakfast one of the nicest in all the hotels I ve stayed in London and I ve stayed in quite alot over the years Restaurant good was also top quality ate there every nite which says it all Will come back to the Rembrandt again because of its location accommodation and the high level of service to its customers Thank you Rembrandt 
34672,The Rembrandt, Nothing to fault, Good sized modern and clean room comfortable beds free bottles of water in room Great individual temperature control in the room which was welcomed on a humid day night Staff were super friendly Breakfast was fantastic
34673,The Rembrandt, Unfortunately there was some redecoration going on whilst we stayed which I wasn t aware of , Check in was quick and easy Friendly staff Room was a good size Bar has a good range of drinks and cocktails open til late good choice of breakfast not rushed Good location
34674,The Rembrandt, Ok except for price room size shelf space and all of this is really minor and I plan to keep staying there , Have stayed their many times and like the hotel the staff the breakfasts and the location A standard room a little small and very little drawer or shelf space Hotel is expensive as all London hotels are so for London the value is good but for Europe in general it is expensive for the room one gets 
34675,The Rembrandt, The service at breakfast was appalling Waited 40 mins for 2 poached eggs despite repeated requests for them Only 1 arrived after 40 mins and when we asked where the other one was we had to wait another 5 mins and 2 arrived No apology or explanation Other tables near us that had ordered after us had received theirs and gone before we got the 1st Not good enough , Nice room with balcony so could open the doors for air instead of air con 
34676,The Rembrandt, Air conditioning was a must during the two days we spent there however the unit in the room was not operating for a brief period late one evening but thankfully windows opened Whilst I was already awakening I would have been upset if the workman sandpapering outside my room door at 8am on the Monday morning had broken my slumber Plus I would not have liked to have been the guest in the room further along the corridor next to where the drill was used to remove a room door shortly afterwards Passed this on our way to breakfast at 9am , High standards encountered throughout our stay which you would expect from a four star hotel We chose this venue as it had a pool and the visit was worth the additional 7 50 per head cost to use At breakfast time you got a feel for how many people were staying at the hotel however it never seemed busy or overcrowded Quiet room located at side of building made for a good night s sleep that and the comfortable bed V A museum directly opposite bonus 
34677,The Rembrandt, All great, We keep returning to the Rembrandt due to the friendliness efficiency and helpfulness of every staff member and for the superb location and accessibility of the property 
34678,The Rembrandt, Nothing could have been improved, We have stayed at this hotel several times as it is always clean and the breakfasts are good The staff are helpful and the rooms have always been comfortable This time was no different lovely as ever 
34679,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The Rembrandt is very well located and comfortable We were given an upgraded room at no extra charge and it was a very pleasant stay Breakfast buffet was excellent and late night dining in the bar was welcomed 
34680,The Rembrandt, We could hear an annoying electronic buzzing noise that went off about every 5 seconds and made it difficult to sleep The room was compact and had no view I have stayed there previously and had a better experience that time , Excellent location for museums great restaurants nearby and close to tube station Superb full English breakfast 
34681,The Rembrandt, Unfortunately I ve had a weird experience of a cleaning lady entering our room at 8 o clock in the morning I told the receptionists about the incident but she told me I was not the first and definately not the last one to experience that in this hotel I was shocked as I travel a lot around the world and things like this do not take place or if they do the hotel management at least tries to apologize and do something about it My morning was disturbed by this situation and therefore I am not satisfied with my stay in this hotel,No Positive
34682,The Rembrandt, The bathroom was old fashioned and didn t have a walk in shower I have some mobility issues and would have found a more up to date bath easier to use If I consider staying there again I would request an up to date bath and if not available consider other options, Have stayed there before it is a nice hotel in a great location 
34683,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The hotel has a great location near good restaurants shopping and in front of Victoria and Albert Museum a block from the History And Science Museums South Kensington station walking distance from Albert Hall Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and so many attractions The rooms are nice and the whirl bathtub is a plus before going to bed It has iron fridge coffee and tea with biscuits and a bottle of water in a very comfortable room The breakfast has a good and fresh variety of hot and cold food to choose from to start the day The food at the restaurant and bar is also great I highly recommend the Rembrandt to everyone who wants to visit London 
34684,The Rembrandt, Breakfast was satisfactory but not great Hot food wasn t very appealing and plates weren t hot Breakfast tables were very close together Decor in bedrooms and public spaces is very dated but they are undergoing a facelift which will no doubt improve things Very noisy air con in bedroom , Friendly staff and very quiet room on 5th floor Good shower in bathroom
34685,The Rembrandt, There wasn t any thing I did not like about our stay The only negative situation was my husband needing a doctor , My husband needed a doctor he was in a great deal of pain I went down to the front desk for guidance This was late in the evening on May 1 2017 Neil Cowen Head Conciege and Pablo German Conciege were on duty Neil Cowen assisted me with contacting a doctor He was so helpful patient and caring There were several phone calls to the medical group and my insurance company which was back in the United States before the doctor was sent out Pablo German was also wonderful He showed so much concern about my husband s pain He brought me some tea to help me relax while waiting for the doctor to arrived which was approximately 11 45pm called me when the doctor arrived and brought him directly to the room The next day he helped me contact our tour company to cancel our tours as the doctor stated my husband was unfit for attending the planned tours and needed to rest until our flight home He checked with me several times to see how my husband was doing He was also there when I needed support regarding a problem with our statement Thanks to him the problem was cleared They help me through a very difficult situation I am so thankful for Neil Cowen and Pablo German being on duty I am so happy to say my husband has healed and doing well 
34686,The Rembrandt, The personnel is not very friendly we almost got kicked out of the room by the cleaning staff with 1 h before check out The breakfast has a great ambiance however the food did not get refilled fast the coffee machine was broken the were no fresh veggies and very limited fresh fruits , The location of the hotel is great just across the street from V A Museum a 5 min walk from Harrods and in the nearby there is Kensington and Hyde Park There are multiple tube lines and busses The hotel room is spacious the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is modern The atmosphere of the hotel is very nice and the bar area is perfect for a coffee break 
34687,The Rembrandt, Twin beds I expected a double Room was small but had everything required for a short stay , Ideal location for Royal Albert Hall museums and Harrods
34688,The Rembrandt, Early check in not available even though offered by email We had flown for 23hours from Sydney and were anxious to get into our room but after many requests and suggestions that the room may be ready by 12 30 it was 2 40 pm before the room was made available An arrangement made with the hotel confirmed by email to have paid Oyster cards held for us at reception was not recorded and the cards were not found A refund has to be sort Our room faced the street and the constant road noise was annoying at night If you want to stay at this hotel ask for a room at the back The bathroom was quite small , Good location close to V A good Italian restaurant a few doors away as well as many other eateries and metro a short walk 
34689,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Lovely hotel stayed here before very central lots to see within walking distance just up the road to harrods across the road from the V A and not far from the royal Albert hall and Hyde park 
34690,The Rembrandt, We were told that the buffet was one price There was turkey pork and beef roast on the line THEY charged us a carving fee of 7 lbs That was the only complaint It is a great place , The staff was very friendly Helpful and knowledgeable 
34691,The Rembrandt, Room was a little small staff were a bit reserved , We loved the location of this hotel right opsite the Victoria Albert Museum and the older style and character We had a very quiet room that was clean and comfortable We did appreciate the complimentary bottle of wine delivered to our room for our anniversary Breakfast was great often very busy and overflowed into the lounge but we were always looked after and the service was excellent We will certainly return here when next in London 
34692,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Comfortable room good food in the restaurant Very nice breakfasts offered Museums are very close as is the tube for easy travel Excellent location 
34693,The Rembrandt, Nothing we didn t like, Good location we were Visiting the Royal Albert Hall a clean comfortable room and a super breakfast which is unusual for London Staff were all very friendly and accommodating Would definitely return to this hotel
34694,The Rembrandt,No Negative, We have stayed here once before Perfect location less than 2 minutes from tube station bars restaurants shops and museums Our rooms were not ready for us at the relevant time but we were upgraded one room after a short delay The only downside was that there was a pack of old cheese left in the mini bar from a previous guest We did not report this at the time as we had better things to spend our time doing My young niece reported that she had lost her mobile phone once reported the staff sprung into action to sort this out extremely attentive All in all great service 
34695,The Rembrandt, NOTHING, I could not be any happier with a hotel than I was with the Rembrandt Everything I heard about the hotel was that it was a five star hotel in every possible way I totally agree 
34696,The Rembrandt, Should have stayed more than just the one night , Staff were super friendly and helpful and I m not saying that only because I got an upgrade The style of the property is probably not the most modern however the standard of the equipment and amenities was top Very nice and wide range of breakfast buffet selection too It s conveniently located right across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum and the HTB church 
34697,The Rembrandt, This is quite an expensive hotel but then again this is central London , Upgraded room request was granted free bottle of wine provided by the hotel as celebrating a birthday Breakfast huge choice good quality Room clean and comfortable
34698,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The locotion was ideal close to Underground museums cafes and walkable to most things Would absolutely choose the property again Really liked the option to purchase early check in 
34699,The Rembrandt, My room was a little on the small size , The location was excellent within walk to trains bus right out front Harrod s down the road museum s across the road restaurant s around the corner what else do you need My double room was a little small but was comfortable and clean whereas my boys had a double twin room and their s was a very good size So happy all round 
34700,The Rembrandt, housekeeping was not friendly and the clean not good English breakfast was so bad and a little furniture so old i did not like the red carpet and the doors are so old , location very good
34701,The Rembrandt, As we always use the Rembrandt a loyalty scheme would be more than welcome, Excellent breakfasts Very helpful staff on the front desk Comfortable rooms Location perfect for Albert Hall museums tube and restaurants 
34702,The Rembrandt, Nothing not to like, Have stayed in The Rembrandt a number of times over the years it s my favourite hotel in London We were upgraded to a Club Room the bed was the softest I ve ever slept in in any hotel The fruit and salad bar at breakfast had been expanded since my last visit there in September now there was even more choice and the eggs at breakfast were lovely 
34703,The Rembrandt, the spa and pool were an extra charge which I think should be included as it isn t a cheap hotel 7 50 per person each time to use facilities and the pool is not very big and was full of children having swimming lessons would have been nice if the attendant told us this and gave us choice to use or not , it is very centrally located and the breakfast was really good rooms nice and all very clean and comfortable
34704,The Rembrandt, The room wasn t as large as advertised, The spa has swimming lessons for children and whilst the is ok one child cried hysterically for the whole lesson he should have been removed if you are expexting guests to relax
34705,The Rembrandt,No Negative, A fabulous base for a few hectic days in London Staff were attentive and happy to help with any request We had a classic room which overlooked a quiet side street and was ample in size and spotlessly clean The food was fantastic and breakfast was outstanding 
34706,The Rembrandt, Old and outdated design of the lounge Same in dining room no redecoration or no improvement in interior design, Politeness of the personnel Cleanness Good service Familiarity with hotel during the last 30 years
34707,The Rembrandt, First day in second room we came back to find room hadn t been cleaned This was rectified after a call to reception , Staff were very helpful First room a little small so we were moved to a bigger one 
34708,The Rembrandt, The restaurant menu could do with improving This was obvious as it was virtually empty on the Wednesday evening I ate there , Have stayed at the Rembrandt four time before on my own and with my wife Always had a great room with excellent service from all the staff This time the room cleaners are very helpful 
34709,The Rembrandt, The room was not very big As there was two of us the bed was up again a wall so you have to climb over your partner to get into bed not very satisfactory for us The TV did not work very well so gave up on it , The bathroom was ok 
34710,The Rembrandt, Small stuffy rooms overpriced for the executive double not much different from a Travelodge so wasn t worth the extra money The English breakfast is pre cooked and left under lights so not good, Location fairly comfortable
34711,The Rembrandt, Too Many Flowers in hotel my husband has really bad hay fever and having loads of flowers everywhere even in the dining room wasn t really nice, Brilliant staff and hotel lovely room 
34712,The Rembrandt, The sausages were like rubber and a little too spicy for morning fried eggs looked awful and overcooked , Excellent beds shower very pleasant reception staff and helpful Waitress s service excellent 
34713,The Rembrandt, It was a little pricier than I had hoped and there really weren t too many good restaurant choices in the neighborhood , The hotel breakfast was great The location was fantastic and the facilities were good too I thought the complimentary mobile phone was a nice touch And the staff they were extremely attentive and very friendly 
34714,The Rembrandt, The only thing was that the breakfast could have been better It was good and a nice selection but was not as good as the rest of the service and facilities , Overall this was an excellent stay Location was just where we wanted and there are a wide selection of shops and nice restaurants nearby 
34715,The Rembrandt, The swimming pool is extremely small and children s swimming lessons take up most of the space , The fantastic location of the hotel makes this a perfect choice for visiting London Easy walking distance to the Natural History Museum Science Museum and literally on the doorstep of the V A Also very close to tube station and Harrods etc what s not to like The hotel room although very traditional and perhaps slightly dated was extremely spacious clean comfortable and quiet All the usual luxuries you expect were included in addition to a fruit bowl bottled water coffee maker bathrobe slippers etc Breakfast which was included in the room rate was fantastic everything was provided and there was nothing I could fault here The foyer bar area and restaurant very comfortable Another added bonus was the quality of the room service menu we were so tired our first night we opted for this choice and were not disappointed with the speed of service quality of food and value for money 
34716,The Rembrandt, the room was very small and overpriced for what you get Also the furniture etc seemed very dated I felt like the least desirable room went to me because I reserved through Booking com,No Positive
34717,The Rembrandt, WiFi was not working well in room where I initially was placed but remedied by being relocated to a different larger room , Very responsive staff Also very easy to get to from Heathrow 
34718,The Rembrandt, Only a very minor detail creaky bed and floor boards As a light sleeper every time I or my husband moved or he got up to visit the bathroom I was disturbed by this , The staff were very friendly and approachable The whirlpool bath was amazing I am a very fussy breakfast eater and found this hotel had a great choice and tasted delicious It s an excellent location for visiting The Royal Albert hall and the Natural History Museum Science museum and a lot more besides with underground stations close by Will definitely stay here again 
34719,The Rembrandt, On 2 occasions our breakfast didn t arrive So I had to call the reception once the breakfast card guests fill in to order what they want in the morning was not collected when the time slot had passed within which I ordered my breakfast I looked outside and my breakfast card was still hanging outside Next day same issue although this time my card was collected but no food So a little setback on the break fast side of things annoying because we had our day planned and it set us back a little with our time But as mentioned the staff where all great And we left this hotel with a smile , The staff where all very pleasant and extremely professional The safe that didn t work in our room was replaced within 5 minutes Wow Also the location was great 
34720,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable room A good night s sleep and a delicious breakfast each morning served in attractive dining room Super situation for museums and shopping with tube only a quick walk away for connecting to other parts of the city 
34721,The Rembrandt, Room was only really suited to single occupancy Small double bed shoved up against the wall so when the one sleeping next to the wall needed to get up in the middle of the night both of us had to get up , Location was fantastic for the sights and transport
34722,The Rembrandt, Piped music in the reception and lounge Music not really needed and the type played was completely wrong Didn t see tea coffee making facility in the room , Impressed with the hotel location very good as was breakfast Room good and very quiet considering we were on Brompton Road side Staff very helpful two came out to get a taxi for me 
34723,The Rembrandt, I don t mind keeping my towels for a three night stay and appreciate that the hotel puts up signs and asks to keep towels to reduce the impact of cleaning on the environment But at the Rembrandt the signs are there and then still the towels are changed everyday The cleaning staff had no idea and said we always change every day ,No Positive
34724,The Rembrandt, 50 surcharge per room for changing dates One room was very small I had to protest to reception to get a better room The room on their web site looked alot bigger than the one we were first given , Reception and lounge nice 
34725,The Rembrandt, The superior room I got was much smaller than the ones showed on the website , I got very good service when I complained about the small room I got I got another room spacy this time and in accordance with the pictures provided Very friendly staff Good breakfast 
34726,The Rembrandt, Our room needed a renovation If you can ask in advance for a renovated room , I liked the Handy cell phone provided by the hotel it s a brilliant idea even though the last day it didn t work Breakfast was good and varied 
34727,The Rembrandt, Lighting in the bathroom could be improved Rooms are small but very clean and well appointed , The staff were most helpful Great location for access to many restaurants near the tube station For a single woman traveler area is safe and easy to get to all sights and shops 
34728,The Rembrandt, However the floors were creaky at places and you could hear the person in the next room or above walking I am not used to hearing noise when I sleep so it made a bit of an impact in the first couple of days Then I just got used to it , The bed and pillows were comfortable and in general the hotel was very clean The food breakfast and meals was tasty I think the breakfast buffet was very good as there was plenty on offer The location couldn t be better Only 5 min walk from South Kensington tube station opposite to V A museum and Natural History museum 10 min walk form Royal Albert Hall There is a variety of restaurants around 
34729,The Rembrandt, The rooms to hot couldn t turn air con off enough Also had to pay for swimming pool we have been to plenty of hotels with free leisure facility s to guests, Very convenient for museums and Royal Albert hall
34730,The Rembrandt, They give back rooms looking to the air conditioning to the booking com customers This is the case I experience form London to Dubai nowadays Booking com needs to talk to them about not only the comissions but also the confort of the customers There is a wifi connection problem at the hotel Their wifi system operation is an old fashioned I didint connected to wifi with my laptop , Confortable stay Value for money 
34731,The Rembrandt,No Negative, what was not to like staff friendly good very good and so helpful warm feeling of happiness all over ideal for shopping and outside coffee shops eating or in hotel so clean every thing working and if not soon was what more do you need ypou only get what you pay for 
34732,The Rembrandt, The hotel was very busy and we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for breakfast Table service was slow but the waitress was apologetic The breakfast itself was excellent , Superb location Clean room and we paid extra to have more space which was certainly worth it Excellent breakfast and service 
34733,The Rembrandt, Nothing, All our expectations were satisfied the room all though not large was perfect for a short break The breakfast had plenty of chose Valet parking 35 pound for 24 hour a bargain in London
34734,The Rembrandt, The rooms are very small and a bit claustrophobic They are attractive and clean but you can only sleep in them There is no room to even walk around the bed , I loved the location staff and breakfast 
34735,The Rembrandt, Had Sunday lunch and thought the roast beef very dry Not fore rib Breakfast 8am bacon dry and tough to cut beans and fried egg dried out from sitting in hot plate too long , Our room was lovely Shower hot and powerful Staff friendly and welcoming Sunday lunch starter choice was excellent 
34736,The Rembrandt, booking come is very unresponsive and only interested in taking your money Rembrandt itself is a good hotel but booking com is a disaster for customers , generally ok 
34737,The Rembrandt, Breakfast staff always seem a bit miserable and disconnected compared to most nice hotels these days , Excellent across the board accommodation comfort but location is best feature by far 
34738,The Rembrandt, An item promised to us by night staff at reception for collection the next morning was not ready and had not been handed over to morning shift which created a delay to our schedule However morning shift did manage to solve the problem Also had some language problems with restaurant staff in explaining what we required Snacks in minibar would have been nice and perhaps a bit more info as to how the free mobile offer worked, Concierge staff very efficient and helpful Wifi very good Bed extremely comfortable nice work desk all in all very nice rooms
34739,The Rembrandt, Getting charged an extra 10 when booking in Booked a double room on line then get charged because I brought my husband Didn t get that We also had a letter from reception asking us to settle our bill as we had reached the house limit of 150 never told there was a limit when booking in again I do not understand when they are holding a credit card Didn t appreciate that and when we made our feelings clear the receptionist was uninterested and did not even apologise for any inconvenience , Great location warm and comfortable with a big lounge and open fire
34740,The Rembrandt, Booked because had a pool wanted to charge 7 50 to use it I refused charge to use the pool wasn t stated at booking Asked for poached eggs and crispy bacon 3 times eggs arrived after 15 mins and bacon took 25 mins I was then having to rush to my meeting, Location
34741,The Rembrandt, Breakfast was luke warm and well below the standard i would expect of a Hotel like the Rembrandt , Great Hotel in a very nice area Right opposite the V A Museum and several good restaurants nearby 
34742,The Rembrandt, The en suite in our room was cramped Anyone overweight would not have fitted in , Good choice for breakfast Good meal in bar restaurant Thursday evening Very clean and staff very helpful
34743,The Rembrandt, The room was quite small at the top floor But we still had two seats which becomes a rarity in many hotels and is convenient when you want to have a small snack in the room or watch TV This fact that it was a small room may explain the good rate we got for such a luxury hotel Noisy vent for heating up the room Turning it off and being under the roof meant the temperature went low during the night down to 17 C We could hear noise from next door the first evening , The location is excellent Close to the main London attractions I mean Museum and shopping Breakfast included was a treat also The noise from the avenue down was quite well shut off by the double glazed windows For your enjoyment a spa jet bath we did not try Clean 
34744,The Rembrandt,No Negative, A lovely hotel in a great location for visiting V A natural history and science museums and for shopping at Harrods 2mins walk to the underground takes you wherever else you want to go in London My daughter and I stayed for a few days at New Year Had a great time Highly recommend this hotel 
34745,The Rembrandt, An area of the lounge bar at 11 00 pm was reserved for a private function and no seating was available as a result , Very good location room and service Excellent breakfast 
34746,The Rembrandt, I wanted an interconnected rooms for me and my family but the only ones offered were on the back side of the hotel with nothing to see through the windows also the rooms were ate the attic where half of the rooms occupied by the structure so we lost space the room service communication is poor and they don t respond before keep calling for 15 min and calling the reception to let them respond we couldn t make any booking for Christmas eve dinner although we stay at the hotel no privilege we had 2 rooms but they rejected our request to keep only one room for late check out at 1 pm we had to exit at 12 sharp , location of the hotel only otherwise nothing
34747,The Rembrandt, Staff were extremely unhelpful and their credit card machine doesnt accept credit cards with 6 digit passwords Definitely more of a 3 star hotel, Bed comfy location perfect breakfast is good
34748,The Rembrandt, Fir a twin room for two ladies sharing it was a bit small but we quickly got used to that , Very friendly staff extremely helpful Nothing not to like really and I ll certainly be back yet again 
34749,The Rembrandt, Would have liked a greater choice of breakfast cereals perhaps some organic granola or Bircher muesli , Very comfortable friendly and efficient staff 
34750,The Rembrandt, Told in advance that pool was not available however when I enquired at the reception desk I was informed that it was back in action too late ,No Positive
34751,The Rembrandt, It was rather warm in the room but we could open up window There was some construction outside but nothing really noisy , We loved the location Nice king size bed Everything clean and good breakfast Very nearby all the action 
34752,The Rembrandt, The management and staff of this hotel is horrible and that s the reason I can t recommend staying here First housekeeping left us without tissue and very little toilet paper and no spare on the first day We got in late and didn t really realize it until the next morning When we ran out that morning I called housekeeping and they said they don t come to the rooms until later and to call reception So I called reception and they asked if we could wait for two hours What a stupid and ridiculous question when a hotel guest says they have no tissue or toilet paper I said no and I guess to their credit someone brought it Second the brochure in the room talks about a breakfast to go option which I asked about at the front desk since we had a tour that left before they started serving breakfast The person at the front desk didn t know what I was talking about despite the brochure so connected me to a food service person She told me I could order for the next day and pick the delivery time and it would be brought to our room I did so However the breakfast never arrived I called to inquire and the room service food services person told me that you cannot order via the phone and have to fill out a card and leave it on the door and that they had no record of our order anyway Again just great customer service Third our tour operator had called the concierge to say that they would be running late and the concierge never relayed the message The bottom line is that the management and staff at this hotel is inept and useless This all happened in a four day time span I ve never had an experience like this at any other hotel I ve stayed at , The hotel is clean and in a good location across the street from the Victoria Albert Museum and Natural History Museum and very close to Hyde Park and Harrods The breakfast is very good as well If you don t need to talk to any staff member then you will probably be okay but good luck to you if you do need assistance with something 
34753,The Rembrandt, Service has markedly declined at this property I ve stayed at the Rembrandt for over 30 years but can t help in feeling that I ll need to now look elsewhere , Great location 
34754,The Rembrandt, I ve stayed at the Rembrandt for over 30 years but I m not sure if I ll return The price is quite good but the housekeeping and dining room service is very weak To me the facility is simply a value no longer a destination , The conceirge service continues to be most helpful and I would continue to rate this highly 
34755,The Rembrandt, The air con made some very small noise The toilet would have been perfect with a flexible shower head , Executive room was spacious and the twin beds were comfy Excellent location with South Kensington tube station just a few mins walk away Really loved the neighbourhood and being right opposite to the beautiful V A Museum was a big bonus Last but not the least the breakfast buffet was something I looked forward to every morning 
34756,The Rembrandt, Drinks at the bar were quite expensive and a 10 service charge was automatically included for drinks when purchased at the bar this seemed a bit much I expect that for food but not for drinks , The location was convenient for us and the hotel was nice and comfortable The food served in the bar was really good 
34757,The Rembrandt, Breakfast table had been re laid but not wiped covered in drink rings and sticky marks Abrupt dismissive manner of one of the female waiting staff Unpleasant scrambled egg , Mostly helpful courteous staff Clean room with plenty of refreshments and toiletries 
34758,The Rembrandt, We were given rooms on fifth floor which were dark but we were allocated much nicer rooms on fourth floor when we complained , Evening meal was good and breakfast very good Staff apart from one was very helpful would recommend this hotel if you want to shop in Harrods or Harvey Nichols 
34759,The Rembrandt, The first room we were given was very small and in our opinion did not come up to the spec that we thought we had booked the hotel changed the room for us without argument , The bed was very comfortable and the breakfasts were excellent The room was well decorated and had all the facilities you would expect of a 4 star hotel The staff were friendly and helpful 
34760,The Rembrandt, If we had known we should of booked beforehand for a treatment in the spa as it was fully booked up , The room was lovely clean and comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast and dining service was excellent Overall a throughly relaxing and pleasurable weekend 
34761,The Rembrandt, Pillows were a little hard , Comfy bed Underfloor heating in bathroom Friendly and helpful staff Great location for Albert Hall and museums Good breakfast Dining room well managed 
34762,The Rembrandt, To be honest there wasn t anything we didn t like but if I had to be picky I would prefer an independent shower as I don t like to wash my hair when in the shower , We liked the good choice at breakfast and nice to come back to a nice warm room 
34763,The Rembrandt, The cost of the room 233 pound for one night should have included free use of pool they wanted to charge extra 7 50 each although some areas were closed due to refurbishments cooked breakfast was luke warm View from our bedroom was full of ducting and air vents not what you would expect for a scenic view of the capital ,No Positive
34764,The Rembrandt, Check in was slow my card was debited with a penny but then I was asked to pay for the room in full in advance Staff member couldn t explain the logic of this Twin beds were pushed together I was told by reception they would have them separated but this was not done , Good room facilities i liked having Windows that opened aircon iron great location 
34765,The Rembrandt, Check in Check out Also the bath room not in good condition let some body try to wash his hand and u will know the problem where the water come up like a pool and take time to go down , Location
34766,The Rembrandt, It is pricey But it is worth it , Location Location Location Great location Breakfast was excellent Relaxing in the lounge after a day out in the city was a nice treat Very enjoyable Rooms are big and comfy with all the amenities 
34767,The Rembrandt, Nothing really although our television didn t work the first day but housekeeping reported it and problem sorted right away Whirlpool bath worked well but would not turn off so had to have someone up to our room to unplug it Therefore unable to use again , All food in restaurant cooked well Hotel was quiet for the amount of people staying there 
34768,The Rembrandt, The breakfast is a bit boring with the same items everyday In addition the buffet food is always luke warm if not cold and unappetizing I would rather order from a menu and be able to order an omelette pancakes waffles Eggs Hollandaise or something like a breakfast steak , The Rembrandt is perfectly located in Knightsbridge near the Kensington South tube The staff members are very helpful 
34769,The Rembrandt, Breakfast buffet had a lot og choices but the quality of the food was very low Would prefere less options and a lot higher quality I personally did not est much because of the low food quality The first morning we arrived me and my child at 10 02 to the breakfast breakfast was officially until 10 and was denied access to the breakfastroom That seemed like a rather absurd situation principle and gave us a quite bad first impression Our tiny delay was because our room had no more bags for the drycleaning so I had been waiting a little while in reception to deliever my close there instead The People at the restaurant could generally learn a lot from the kindness of the People in the reception to different mindsets at the same hotel , Very friendly and helpfull staff at reception Thank you for that The hotel provided a local phone to bring around in town Including free internet acces and most important the app with map and free phone calls Clean Close to museums and to Harrods 
34770,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Bed was amazing Room was just what we wanted Also liked the security that only people other room keys can use the lift Staff were lovely and really helpful
34771,The Rembrandt, The room looked a little tired and was small in size , We liked the location ideal for the Museums The breakfast was plentiful in variety Staff were very helpful and polite 
34772,The Rembrandt, Excellent, We were upgraded to a larger room which was very comfortable and quiet Also we arrived early and were able to get our room immediately which meant a lot to us 
34773,The Rembrandt, The staff were very slow to bring coffee at breakfast Four days I had to get up and go and ask them to bring me some They seemed to have a knack of not seeing that I was waving to them , Although the room was small it was very well appointed and was kept sparkling clean The bed and bedding were very comfortable 
34774,The Rembrandt, The view from the window was a disappointment but at least it was quiet , Staff were pleasant friendly room was clean Bed was huge Loved the bathroom Plenty of choice at breakfast 
34775,The Rembrandt, Breakfast was a bit chaotic with some food not being replaced quick enough in the buffet so some dishes were not available all of the time which annoyed me Pleased with the room upgrade but disappointed the hotel couldn t make the gesture of giving us the bottle of wine free which I had asked to be in our room on arrival for our special occasion , We spent our honeymoon night in the hotel when we got married and were going back to celebrate our 43rd wedding anniversary and got upgraded to an Executive Room Checking in and out was problem free and straight forward 
34776,The Rembrandt, we were charged to use the pool but this was not mentioned when booking the receptionist was very slow when checking us in even though we provided him with a print out of the booking, the room was lovely
34777,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Actually had room service breakfast 3 surcharge 2 mornings I suggestion don t cover warm toast apart from that very nice Dining room breakfast 1st day very nice buffet style help yourself Very busy 
34778,The Rembrandt, The rooms are quite dull and a bit run down for the price but that seems to be more of a London issue Location is worth it , Neil in the concierge desk was a legend organising me a taxi and making jokes I think the lounge bar area is also lovely I also lost a key ring which had been personalised that day and one of your team came rushing to find me before i boarded my taxi very happy to receive that 
34779,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Great location Next to the museums within site of Harrods and short walk from South Kensington tube station 5 minute jog to Hyde Park Friendly staff and good price See how the 0 01 live for a day or two Extra attractions included the Lamborghini shop just the other side of the tube station 
34780,The Rembrandt, With it being a short stay we did not experience any problems All our needs were attended to very effectively , Handy location Very good service with staff members being efficient attentive and displaying courtesy 
34781,The Rembrandt, I am being picky here but I do have a dislike for shower curtains, The bed was very comfortable and the room spacious Very good buffet breakfast and the staff was very friendly and helpful Two minutes from South Kensigton tube station and 5 minutes from Hyde Park 
34782,The Rembrandt, Bar prices were a little high but we know the hotel was in an expensive area , Staff were most courteous and efficient Room was a good size with a king size bed which was really comfortable Breakfast was superb with a wide choice of cooked and continental foods
34783,The Rembrandt, My only disappointment is that we had to leave so soon I would have enjoyed staying a couple of more days , Always a comforable room and a great breakfast 
34784,The Rembrandt, Nothing I was delighted with my stay, I was upgraded to a superior double which was well appointed and comfortable Having to use the key card to access the lift made me feel very safe The staff were helpful friendly and efficient The full English breakfast was very tasty and set me up for a day s sightseeing The location was excellent though the roadworks made travelling by bus VERY slow not the hotel s fault
34785,The Rembrandt, The restaurant is slow serving and haphazard in its timings The pool connected to the hotel is booked for children and one cannot swim and the spa pool in undergoing renovation so it cannot be used , The reception staff the rooms the location and the facilities were very good 
34786,The Rembrandt, It s a bit pricey but that s London and when you consider the location and the standard of the hotel it is worth it It s a pity Australia isn t one of the countries you can make free calls to on the room smartphone , This is the 3rd time we have stayed at the Rembrandt and we love everything about it From the service to the food and the innovative smartphone which now comes with every room English breakfast with black pudding was amazing as always 
34787,The Rembrandt, Reception area is sparsely equipped with furniture and could be more welcoming , Exec room was spacious and comfortable with good sized and modern bathroom Breakfast was very good with a full choice available 
34788,The Rembrandt, To much noice from shutting of doors in neighboring rooms during the night Woken every night by banging doors between 3 and 4 am, Good breakfast but orange juice not good enough for a 4 star hotel
34789,The Rembrandt, The bed was really hard and not that comfortable, I loved the location of the hotel It was walking distance to museums and to the metro for when I wanted to head up town The best part is the neighborhood feel ina big city The staff were very freindly and helpful they even let me check in early 
34790,The Rembrandt, After staying here for three nights in August another three nights end of September and advised relatives to book Rembrandt I Wanted an extra night breakfast not required can t have room without breakfast 240 for one night overpriced disappointed customer , although deluxe room on the small side beds very comfortable paid for upgrade to executive room much bigger with walk in shower Good breakfast with plenty to choose from
34791,The Rembrandt, Noisy neighbouring guests Wifi worked intermittently Furnishings tired Room located in back of hotel over a service area Noisy air conditioning pump , Location Fairly large room with king bed 
34792,The Rembrandt, No meat choices in the breakfast although many muslims were staying there I stayed nine days and 99 of the breakfast items were the same My daughter was bored and stopped eating breakfast , The receptionists
34793,The Rembrandt, The room service food was not delicious , The breakfast n they provide u with a smart phone where u can call GCC countries free of charge which was amazing 
34794,The Rembrandt, breakfast room was quite busy and crowdy , location very close to South Kensington underground opposite to Victoria and Albert museum and other museums and Albert hall wifi works quite well very friendly staff
34795,The Rembrandt, The restaurant staff started to clear up the breakfast buffet 15 minutes before the due end of service , V clean room super to have a nespresso machine in the room shame there was only 1 coffee each 
34796,The Rembrandt, Drinks at bar very expensive, The breakfast was excellent we found the drinks at bar very expensive which was a pity as the seating area there was really nice
34797,The Rembrandt, reception staff were not very kind and welcoming the internet was very poor and the mobile phone in the room was not functional at all, the location was okay 
34798,The Rembrandt, Rooms too small though I had an executive room Tiny beds , Perfect location for shoppers just 10 mins walk to Harrods Many restaurants and cafes on the street Excellent breakfast 
34799,The Rembrandt, When we used the pool it was booked for private lessons leaving hotel guests swimming on a side with low ceiling It is as if the hotel guests were coming after club members The club attendant at the club front desk could have put a smile on his face , The hotel staff were great Very welcoming and accommodating I needed a simple comb as I forgot mine They did not have any A staff member went out to buy one It was beyond the call of duty 
34800,The Rembrandt, I thought when I booked online I paid for breakfast to be included but when we arrived I had to pay extra The room was extremely small I said that to reception but they didn t change it We travelled from OS with the luggage you couldn t walk in the room The bed was very small uncomfortable for 2 people , The location is excellent right across the from the hotel is the V A Museum we like spending time there 
34801,The Rembrandt, Lift constantly broken for 6 7 out of the 8 days Room key constantly not working in the lift had to get it replaced over 4 times No bath which was disappointing , The location was good close to most museums and a main tube station Room really clean and bathroom pretty clean Most staff nice and friendly 
34802,The Rembrandt, Nothing , Excellent location Great value Room was nicely decorated and very comfortable For being in the center of London this was a very quiet location The entire staff was extremely friendly and very helpful We were there for 6 days with a wonderful experience the entire time I would definitely stay at The Rembrandt again for future stays in London 
34803,The Rembrandt, A problem immediately solved knocking in the pipes in the room Hotel staff moved our suitcases while we were out and the next room was comfortable and silent , Very good breakfast comfortable bed helpful staff the rooms had all the conveniences of iron safe hairdryer etc 
34804,The Rembrandt, the bed is not comfortable enough room service left my room open by mistake there are no Varieties food in breakfast , Location is good staff are friendly clean rooms 
34805,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Well equipped comfortable hotel in a fantastic location within close proximity of the London underground to provide easy access to tourist attractions We attended British Summertime in Hyde Park Staff were professional and on hand for any assistance required A good variety of food on offer for breakfast including accommodating to specific dietary needs An enjoyable stay and I wouldn t hesitate about staying again 
34806,The Rembrandt, Room small jacuzzi going off on its own randomly in the night Staff couldn t have been nicer in the bar and restaurant, Location amazing very comfortable beds
34807,The Rembrandt, 1 There were no drawers if you have folded clothes to store away there is no space to store them We literally had to live out of the suitcase there was only a small area for hanging clothes 2 The room was pretty small for a couple with a 10 year old The double bed was large very nice but then with the sofa bed right next to it was quite tight leaving little space to work with And without closet space and all the suitcases and stuff on the floor it was unpleasant 3 Insulation between rooms was very poor The TV next door was on the wall facing our room and you could pretty much hear everything and with neighbours watching TV late at night we had to sleep with ear plugs 4 I found it odd with a door to the next room even though it was locked , Location very central and easy to get around either walking or with the underground Very near an underground station and the surrounding area was very nice a block away from the Science History museums which were excellent Across from the Victoria Albert museum Imperial college was also a couple of blocks away it was a nice area to take a stroll in the evenings Royal Albert Hall is within 10mins walk Lots of shopping restaurants not far away the famous Harrods is about 10 mins walk Hyde Park was also lovely and within 20mins walk
34808,The Rembrandt, the room was very small we expected a family room for 2 adults 1 child to be a bit more spacious paying extra for the use of the pool was also disappointing , location
34809,The Rembrandt, housekeeping can be improved sometimes they dont change dirty sheets and towels upon check out they asked us to pay for a phone call that we didn t make , wide rooms comfortable beds helpful staff perfect location very calm and quiet
34810,The Rembrandt, The hotel was very difficult to find due to its address being so similar to other addresses in the area I recommend looking carefully on a map for its location before venturing there Google Maps wasn t working for us that day so we were out of luck We called and the front desk people with strong Eastern European accents could not sufficiently explain how to get there Very frustrating start to our stay Also the concierge gave us misinformation about the presence of reduced price theater ticket booths told us they don t exist in London and they do and sold us full price theater tickets Also he gave us serious misinformation about the length of a taxi ride to the theater said 15 minutes and in 45 minutes we still hadn t made it Had to get out of the taxi and literally run to the theater We were very upset with the concierge , The room had only foam pillows I requested feather and they were able to provide them and they provided them quickly The room was clean and very comfortable The location was just perfect 
34811,The Rembrandt, Paid for room upgrade and early entry then on arrival was told this wasnt available Choice of waiting several hours or pay more for a further upgrade Not the way to treat arriving guests , Prime location in the heart of Kensington Opposite the V A and a short stroll to Harrods Luxurious accommodation and excellent food the Rembrandt is a jewel 
34812,The Rembrandt, Our stay was as good as perfect Minor detail is that the windows had to be shut at night busy traffic but for us this was not a problem because of the airco in the room , Good location opposite the V A museum close to Harrod s and little restaurants around the corner a o creperie near South Kensington tube station Good English breakfast accompanied by fresh fruit Comfortable beds Mobile phone available in room to use during stay with internet access 
34813,The Rembrandt, We had no negative experiences , We continue to return to this convenient comfortable consistent hotel where the staff is always welcoming friendly and responsive We value the many memories and experiences as we anticipate our return in a few months time 
34814,The Rembrandt, front desk gave us room cards that didn t work at all I knew she did it on purpose working in the consumer research company I know very well how hotel staffs manipulate their clients housekeeping lady slap door to try to wake up clients in the morning it is absolutely insane ,No Positive
34815,The Rembrandt, We were on the 6th floor and I had to mind my head at times because of the eaves Choice at breakfast wasn t as good as I would have expected and the fried eggs each morning had hard yokes , The staff were excellent and very helpful Location was really good The hotel was light and airy and had a nice ambience to it 
34816,The Rembrandt, Perhaps the ambience of the front lounge could have been better but the staff was most helpful and obliging , The bed was comfy the pillows just right size and had a very quiet room conducing to sleeping well 
34817,The Rembrandt, Tables for breakfast rather cramped One lift out of order for duration of stay, Very comfortable beds Room servicing staff with a sense of humour Extremely pleasant helpful staff on reception in the bar Quiet peaceful atmosphere
34818,The Rembrandt, There was a fee to use the gym and pool which should be included in the very expensive room rate The housekeeping staff took one of my socks that I d washed and had hanging to dry one sock is pretty useless no compensation was offered On the same day within an hour three staff members entered our room without waiting for us to answer their knock at the door this was unacceptable especially the one who had no reason at all to be there , The location was perfect close to shopping cafes easy walk to several major sights close to the hop on hop off bus short taxi ride to Paddington station Breakfast was great room was a bit tight but bathroom was a good size 
34819,The Rembrandt, Room was a little small with double bed pushed against a wall , Breakfast was excellent quality foods Extensive selection including cereals juices and cooked items Really set me up for the day 
34820,The Rembrandt, I like a soft bed the beds are very firm They need to offer a memory foam topper to those who need it , Good breakfast good location lots of restaurant s near by
34821,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The hotel was comfortable and very clean It is in a brilliant location for visiting the museums in South Kensington The staff were friendly knowledgeable and helpful They did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable 
34822,The Rembrandt, Room 150 was a very nice until 4 am when the air conditioning started up out side the window then it is a no sleep zone This room requires secondary glazing at the least Good job we only stayed for one night , The hotel is great but don t get room 150 
34823,The Rembrandt, The mattress on the bed is too soft and sags towards the edge The famed breakfast has declined in quality We have made 3 visits in the past year but now short cuts are appearing at breakfast time Bacon and sausages in our view were over held causing them to be cold and tough during our 6 night stay only one of the breakfasts was of the quality we previously experienced Not cutting the peel off oranges and melons is an unacceptable short cut In addition the staff start clearing the breakfast buffet away before the official closing time It seems that either re training or adequate numbers of staff at breakfast needs to be reviewed ,No Positive
34824,The Rembrandt, I had no significant dissatisfactions about this hotel , Excellent location close to three great museums to the Piccadilly tube line to facilities adjacent to the South Kensington station and in Brompton Road and to attractive areas to walk The hotel has an excellent bar and good facilities for travellers with a mobile phone serviceice a bonus 
34825,The Rembrandt, The Spa should be included in the price which is not low and opened a couple of hours after 8 pm The jacuzzi was closed and therefore it should definitely be free of charge Only the pool was opened in limited hours 8am 8pm and costed ca 10 Euro pp , The hotel is high comfortable no disc Fine rooms perfect bed The breakfast is in high class definitely Nice helpful staff 
34826,The Rembrandt, Everything was just perfect , The Rembrandt has the perfect location for us Right in front of the Victoria Albert Museum a block from the History and Science Museums 10 mins walking to the Kensington Palace and in the opposite direction the great shops and restaurants on Brompton RD Knightsbridge In the mornings we eat the best full English breakfast The room is comfortable great bed and pillows and it has everything we could wish for Fridge coffee tea and biscuits iron and iron board safe and the TV channels has other channels than the news ones In the evenings we always stop at the bar for a nice licorice and mint tea to finish our day in a great style Excellent atmosphere people in the hotel and restaurant are polite and make us feel like royalty These are some of the reasons we always come back to Rembrandt and have the greatest time ever 
34827,The Rembrandt, No fan in bathroom Not enough space in dining room means you wait for aprox 12 minutes as the staff work hard to get you a space quickly , Location infront of the V a Excellent breakfast Clean rooms Nice but small swimming pool on sight Afternoon tea was a treat Minutes from the tube Minutes from royal albert 
34828,The Rembrandt, It has a pool yes but what you don t know is that you have to pay 7 per person each time you want to use it It s not free to guests , Great location for The Royal Albert Hall V A Museum Harrods The location was perfect for us we enjoyed walking from the hotel to Hyde Park Chelsea Buckingham Palace Very close to underground station and taxis right outside the door and plenty buses too 
34829,The Rembrandt,No Negative, On arrival and without asking given an upgrade to a room much more comfortable very generous Nothing too much trouble Very comfortable lounge bar open until late after show very conveniently Assistance with luggage without expecting a tip 
34830,The Rembrandt, Rooms lack space to put clothing Closet ok but very little else , Stayed a lot of times and the hotel is a good one in a perfect location for walking or traveling right next to the tube station and three great museums London is expensive and the Rembrandt is no exception The rooms are good but not luxurious The staff very helpful and friendly 
34831,The Rembrandt,No Negative, A great location across the road from the V A Museum and a 5 minute walk to South Kensington tube station Helpful and friendly staff and decent size rooms 
34832,The Rembrandt, Nothing Lovely clean room and a view over the Victoria and Albert Museum What a treat , Lovely room Think we may have been upgraded because of the occasion of my sister s 70th Birthday 
34833,The Rembrandt, , Staff great location great we enjoyed our stay The breakfast was Very good so was dinner well done The Rembrandt I hope we get to stay again 
34834,The Rembrandt, My own fault but I only booked 2 weeks before My friends room was big and had whirlpool bath for half the price No stunning view but quiet , Everything was lovely No complaints 
34835,The Rembrandt, Our bed was against the wall and not easy to get out on one side There was a bath and shower but the water was never really hot , The breakfast was good and varied and the service efficient Concierge was helpful The room was adequate Most of the staff were helpful 
34836,The Rembrandt, Breakfast restaurant was rather warm , Great breakfast buffet with lots of choice Excellent tea coffee facilities Really excellent set up of sofabed for small child 
34837,The Rembrandt,No Negative, We have stayed at the Rembrandt now a few times and it is always our first choice The hotel is extremely clean the staff are very helpful and courteous The breakfast that is provided is second to none Very well recommended and would always return 
34838,The Rembrandt, Breakfast could have been a little hotter and a bit mean with he milk and coffee in room, Free upgraded room Air con brilliant and very controllable Would certainly recommend and ok again myself
34839,The Rembrandt, Aircon was very loud when on and the room was boiling Move sensitive lights by the bed came on every time I turned over in the night and woke me up I couldn t work out how to turn them off This kept me awake most of the first night The breakfast we had delivered to our room on the first morning was cold the second morning was better There was also a lack of cooked breakfast options full English or nothing I would have like to see eggs benedict or other variants available The room was a weird layout too with the dressing table opposite the bed and the TV around the corner I would have liked to be able to watch TV from bed , Comfy bed great shower Nice bar area And the spa is lovely 
34840,The Rembrandt, Room 532 very small located just over the extractor of the kitchen with very bad smell view on the court yard, The location was perfect Very good breakfast Mattress and base comfortable
34841,The Rembrandt, Everything perfect, The welcome by reception staff the efficiency of the housekeeping the professional concierges and the swimming pool gym excellent A good position for sight seeing and shopping
34842,The Rembrandt, The room was really tiny and a bit dated I would also have liked a better fresh fruit selection at breakfast , Location was perfect Having a decent breakfast included made a difference 
34843,The Rembrandt, N a, On arrival we were warmly greeted made welcome all staff throughout the hotel were helpful and polite Room upgraded clean spacious and very quiet Breakfast was well stocked with lots of variety Lounge bar was welcoming and good prices Close to Underground network buses and local attractions Would highly recommend and most definitely stay again 
34844,The Rembrandt, The bed was too soft and you rolled together giving me a bad back Other than that I couldn t complain, The location was excellent Everything was in walking distance or just a tube ride away The hotel and staff were lovely The breakfast was lovely self service so you could have what you wanted 
34845,The Rembrandt, The room we were allocated to start overlooked a building site not the hotel s fault but obviously not that great However they fixed that very quickly , We were looked after from before we arrived until we left Because of a mistake I made we needed to change the date the hotel could not have been more helpful On arrival the room was not really to our liking but we were offered another room immediately The hotel has everything you would expect from 5 hotel and is in an excellent location for exploring London I would recommend it highly 
34846,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable The hotel is close to museums and transport We were turned around time wise due to our overseas flight and got up and walked around the neighborhood in the middle of the night and felt very safe Just lovely 
34847,The Rembrandt, Nothing I can think of , Attentive staff wonderful large room executive king opposite the V A great breakfast perfect location with South Ken tube less than a 5 min walk Knightsbridge shopping a short walk just along the road 
34848,The Rembrandt, We would have liked our bedroom to have a window with a view Half the window was frosted which made the room quite dark , Super shower in a clean bathroom Breakfasts were excellent and staff were helpful and pleasant Location is ideal for so many London sights Bed very comfortable 
34849,The Rembrandt, The double bed was very comfortable but was squeezed into a space with no room to move on one side therefore no bedside table on this side either , pleasant and helpful staff very good breakfasts and great location for our needs 
34850,The Rembrandt,No Negative, We love staying at the Rembrandt Everyone is so helpful and pleasant Pablo at the desk always greets with a warm smile and welcomes us back It means a lot to us 
34851,The Rembrandt, Nothing at all , All the staff reception concierge bar dining room housekeeping were exceptionally polite helpful and professional Food was good value tasty and filling All areas of the hotel we experienced were very clean We have no hesitation in reccommending this hotel and will definitely stay again 
34852,The Rembrandt, Spa area was dark dim and didn t feel fresh and clean Bar area very dark and dated Cleaners were noisy in the morning opening and closing doors Thin walls could hear the neighbours tv at night and in the morning maybe put a monitor on levels , Room 159 was JUST PERFECT Lovely balcony Everything we needed was in the room clean and modern Location was great Reception staff great We didn t have the opportunity to eat at the hotel so it wouldn t be fair to comment 
34853,The Rembrandt, Rooms could do with better soundproofing Could hear the fan in the next room , The staff were very helpful We stayed for our daughters twenty first and the hotel left a bottle of wine and a card in her room which was a very nice touch
34854,The Rembrandt, Not being able to pay by cash for drinks in the bar Preferred to have had just the accommodation on credit carc, Room could have been a bit bigger but overall very pleased indeed
34855,The Rembrandt, Bedrooms were dark and dated certainly ready for refurbishment Guests want light and airy not dark and dismal Breakfast staff not the most friendly , Easy access to shops and attractions Breakfast was very good great choice and endless amount 
34856,The Rembrandt, Tiny window No outlook Room temperature on entering was 27 5 C uncomfortably hot After 7 hours we could only get the temp down to 24 C Bath water would only run Luke warm Did not feel this was good value for money Would not stay here again , We upgraded so room was comfortably large Bathroom lovely 
34857,The Rembrandt, I had to get out of bed to turn of the tv Not a very big problem , We felt very welcomed The facilities felt very well taken care of I especially liked the lounge area between the reception and restaurant The Wifi in the hotel was excellent The staff was very friendly and the hotell had the right sice It very quickly felt a little bit like home away from home 
34858,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Great location right opposite V A Museum Very friendly and helpful staff Pleasant spacious bedroom with a comfortable king size bed Executive Double good bathroom with spa bath and shower and bathrobes too Breakfast served between 7 10 am was very good 
34859,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Bed very comfortable breakfast superb We were offered an upgrade a couple of days before we arrived for 20 per night ended up with a huge room excellent
34860,The Rembrandt, double room was very small no room for a bedside table both sides of the bed fine for a short stay for one person but room would have been cramped for two , staff were helpful when I had trouble with the Wi Fi the room was very clean as was the bathroom which was modern and a decent size although the room was small it was well furnished and was better than other more expensive 4 hotels I have stayed in in London recently very handy for all the museums NHM Science V A and a short tube ride to British Museum and Covent Garden 
34861,The Rembrandt, The breakfast was excellent but a little on the tepid side , Everything about the Hotel met our expectations and more Externally beautiful architecture and position The staff were exceptional The room was spacious bathroom very comfortable and functional and the beds were super comfortable very important 
34862,The Rembrandt, Nothing we really enjoyed our stay , The hotel was in s great location We wanted to be by the V A and it was across the street Everyone there was very kind and courteous The hotel restaurant has good food 
34863,The Rembrandt, There was no CNN or many news channels on the TV but that was not a big deal , Very nice mid level hotel nicely situated in Knightbridge Good for museum seekers as it s right across the road from the V A and a short walk from the Museum of Natural History Also a 9 block walk to Harrod s The surrounding area is quite nice for walking around and it s just a 5 minute walk to South Kensington tube stop The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable We also had a small balcony and could open the windows which we loved There s free wifi and the elevators worked and were fast We had no complaints at all and would stay there again 
34864,The Rembrandt, No bedside table on one side of bed No room available therefore no place to put my watch spectacles and glass of water Not good enough for expensive room, Good location and good breakfast
34865,The Rembrandt, Noisy guests after midnight banging doors and talking loudly everytime they stepped into the corridor the lights came on shining through the door waking us up V BAD when non UK guests register they need a note in their language asking them to be quiet after 12 we were supposed to have a room upgrade I don t think 361 is an upgrade No view except for fireescape ,No Positive
34866,The Rembrandt, No telephone information in the room Eg how do I phone reception , The staff were exceptional Good value for a London hotel The room service arrived promptly
34867,The Rembrandt, The hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade The facilities are stuck in the 1980 s The pictures are very misleading I felt like I was tricked , Good location Good breakfast 
34868,The Rembrandt, I had no time to use the spa and pool which is next door and guests can use for a small extra fee Next time I will make sure to have the time to enjoy it, What s not to like Excellent location near to museums shopping and public transport links I was upgraded to a better room without asking Staff went out off their way to create access to wifi when my phone blocked access My bath had lovely jacuzzi jets Breakfast in bed only costs a small additional fee 
34869,The Rembrandt, Unaware of charge per child Also no compromise on an oversight of only booking one room with breakfast included and not the other No adjoining room for the children even though our room had the possibility The people in the adjoining room noisy with the tv late into the night No guest information in the room , Lovely bar and open fire place Fantastic breakfast with gluten free bread 
34870,The Rembrandt,No Negative, we always enjoy our stay at the Rembrant but this time they had building work going on at the back of the hotel very bad first thing not the fault of the hotel
34871,The Rembrandt, The room was too hot for me on entering immediately set the air con to 18C 30mins later it didn t have any significant effect Wedged window open for comfortable sleeping temperature , Superb room really well equipped excellent night s sleep in a very comfortable bed Breakfast was equally good with non standard items delivered to the table in a timely manner Staff were efficient pleasant without being intrusive 
34872,The Rembrandt, Being offered a really awful room to start with which had a tiny cell like window Very claustrophobic Room 332 awful Moved to 347 or 349 I think which was very much better but lots of building work outside so I expect it would be very noisy during the week , Excellent arrangement regarding breakfast Fast and speedy do it yourself 
34873,The Rembrandt, N A, Staff from check in to check out very polite and helpful Breakfast greeter very pleasant and cheerful Explained everything we needed to know to us We had asked for connecting rooms or as close as possible and to facilitate this they had given us an upgrade very much appreciated We hope to return as the location was perfect for us with excellent underground links and close to museums diverse selection of restaurants and lovely shops 
34874,The Rembrandt, I asked for a quiet room a week in advance and was given a noisy room close to an external building which is undergoing refurbishment It started everyday 8am they could have put me in a quiet room facing another side of the hotel , Location Wifi Facilites Cleanliness 
34875,The Rembrandt, The rather loud Aircon Unit in the room the cluster of Aircon units outside were really noisy as we had to have the window open Sleep was remiss , Really comfy and everything where it should be 
34876,The Rembrandt, Cold bathroom not even a heated towel rail brrrr, Best location for V A Harrods Albert Hall Lovely staff in reception bar restaurant Great caf s close by
34877,The Rembrandt, some of the chairs soft furnishings in the lounge reception area looked grubby, value for money clean friendly staff well positioned hotel Would stay again 
34878,The Rembrandt, Nothing Service food excellent Rooms clean comfortable Shower great Thank you, The service from every person with whom we came into contact was impressive We mentioned the air con was not working they sent an engineer then upgraded us as an apology Every question was answered courteously 
34879,The Rembrandt, The entrance lobby is a little sparsely furnished and doesn t give the best first impression of what is a very good hotel , All the staff we met were friendly helpful polite and attentive The bedroom was well appointed as was the bathroom For once there was somewhere to place sponge bags etc and a magnifying mirror which is now essential alas The location was perfect for our needs close to the Tube museums and Knightsbridge There were plenty of places to eat nearby We will definitely stay again 
34880,The Rembrandt, Nothing I d definitely recommend it , Very helpful and friendly staff When there was a problem logging onto the wifi the concierge immediately called tech support who called within five minutes and it was sorted out straightaway excellent service Good sized room comfy bed pleasant bar to have a drink in the evening 
34881,The Rembrandt, everything about our stay was absolutely fine the only thing my Partner didn t care too much for was the drinking mug at breakfast time but even that didn t impinge, everything about our stay was more than adequate 
34882,The Rembrandt, King room a bit small TV too small A little dated Breakfast had no fresh cheese selection which is s shame and not much fruit, Location Pool facility Dining room
34883,The Rembrandt, The free computer station needs to be replaced by a better and faster computer system It was down of and on throughout the entire week Service must improve here , Great Location Helpful staff Nice bar Free breakfast Well maintained rooms
34884,The Rembrandt, The breakfast needs more collection and choices , Perfect location it s close to hyde park harrods and train station It was a comfort and cleanliness stay and I ll recommend it to others 
34885,The Rembrandt, Hard pillows compressed flat duvet better in premier inns Hotel of this quality would expect soft feather pillows and soft plump duvet also had room with connecting door and at midnight a family arrived in adjoining room unpacking sounded like they were in our room with us nightmare Not the romantic cosy night we had planned , Great location great food in restaurant great breakfast lovely lounge and furnishings
34886,The Rembrandt, Room could ve been slightly bigger felt more like a single room rather than a classic double , Friendly staff welcoming Clean tidy hotel Ideal location 
34887,The Rembrandt, To request a room for three hours after check out was 90 I thought this was ridiculously expensive I could understand if I was staying in a five star place filled to the brim with celebrities but I wasn t, The location was brilliant very comfy room polite staff
34888,The Rembrandt, While we assumed breakfast would be a buffet we hadn t realised that we wouldn t be able to sit down when we went to the restaurant so had to wait for a table in the lounge this would have been ok if we d known in advance but as it was the 15 minute wait for a table meant a brief and very rushed breakfast as we had to checkout and get across the city to Marylebone to catch a train Had we known in advance we could have timed our morning better as it was the rush spoilt our breakfast in fact we left before we d finished and being anxious about catching the train the only one we could catch to meet a later engagement that day made it all a bit stressful Better advance communication with guests on this would help , This trip was all about location for us a little Christmas shopping up the road and we had tickets to a Candlelight Christmas concert at the RAH and this was close enough to walk This was a lovely treat our Christmas present to each other We asked for a room near stairs lift on the first floor as my husband is claustrophobic they honored this request when booking which was lovely of them 
34889,The Rembrandt, They charge not pre authorize 50 pounds for additional costs at the outset Any refunds are done at a very different exchange rate Annoying , good quality functional convenience all around
34890,The Rembrandt, We arrived early before checkin time the hotel was notified before They offered us an early checkin for additional charge that we paid immediately But we found out the room is a single occupancy one The bed was too small for two We notified them and they said our room is not going to be ready and we either accept this smaller one downgrade or upgrade for another charge for the duration of our stay We asked for what we paid for they kept saying it s not available due to new year time Frustratingly I went online and found the same room type available and offered to guests Eventually we accepted the paid upgrade and paid the additional daily charge our reservation was inclusive of breakfast During the paid early checkin they said we can t use the breakfast on that day as breakfast starts from the next day We weren t even thinking about it but we found it very wearied during checkout we asked for help to carry the luggage and nobody came without even a simple apology the receptionists were mostly unfriendly , The location 
34891,The Rembrandt, SPA and facilities not inclusive with the price Whirl pool bath randomly starting for no apparent reason even when empty Plastic bag tied over smoke fire detector previous occupants although house keeping quickly checked and cleared removed whilst we went for a walk Breakfast was ok standard self service buffet with a good variety on hand , Location friendly and helpful staff comfortable beds and again the location 
34892,The Rembrandt, The room which was booked as superior twin was a bit too small, Year after year I am staying in Rembrandt hotel due to its excellent location friendly staff good room views
34893,The Rembrandt, The bathroom was a little on the small size This would not stop us staying again but would enquire for a slightly larger room, Very comfortable hotel staff very helpful and nothing too much trouble breakfast excellent requested early cleaning of room as my daughter was on a night shift and had to slleep during the day on Boxing Day sure enough the housekeeper knocked the door at 8 30
34894,The Rembrandt, The rooms need a serious renovation the furniture is old and the tv and channel selection are poor, The location is excellent the breakfast is great and the atmosphere is very friendly
34895,The Rembrandt, We stayed here for 3 nights 17 18 19 Dec to celebrate my wife s birthday We chose this hotel as we had stayed here before for the exact same dates two years ago and had a very enjoyable time This time was very different Our booking from booking com shows we had booked a superior room but this is not what we were given The room was so small that the double bed had to be sited against the wall which meant that I had to climb over my wife for the usual nocturnal visit to the bathroom Also I couldn t have a glass of water at the bedside and obviously the was no reading light my side Not ideal for a couple in their sixties We were informed that the hotel was full so no other rooms were available WE were here however to enjoy ourselves and decided to get on with it but this is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel When we checked out I asked how many such rooms the hotel had and was informed by the check out lady that they had only a few and these were normally reserved for single occupancy but when the hotel is full they were given to couples I then asked why we were chosen for such a room as we had booked and paid for a superior room on October At this point she became very coy and stated that Someone had to have it I again I asked why us but she just repeated Someone had to have it I got the impression that because we had booked via booking com and had probably paid less that some other guests we were fobbed off with a room that you could not call Standard never mind Superior I ask for some kind of recompense from booking com as the room was not what was described I have been a good customer and booked many stays with them and this experience leaves a bad taste Jess Ashman, Location
34896,The Rembrandt, The hotel concentrates on a full English breakfast which is superb and constantly kept fresh However the alternatives are quite poor Just cottage cheese and pre packed BabyBell with a smoked cheese item which is impossible to get into without a scalpel is not what you expect from a classy hotel No smoked salmon no water melon no grapes no fresh fruit salad no omelette eggs Benedict or eggs Florentine offered and only plastic pre packed ham and salami for cold meats Provided you like English Breakfast you are OK If you are looking for something else you may be a little disappointed , Location is great for Hyde Park and the Museums The atmosphere is classic with impressive communal areas 
34897,The Rembrandt, Breakfast was hectic and not very organised drinks were not offered when we sat down had to wait for a waiter to get drinks, Location enjoyable stay cleanliness food
34898,The Rembrandt, Staff weren t approachable eager to assist Staff on check in were rude answering the phone in the middle of dealing with me not once but twice just checking in as this was a first impression it wasn t great Room small but clean Breakfast tables were far too close together no cups on table or cutlery had to ask , Location great just down from harrods
34899,The Rembrandt, Pillows very uncomfortable Hotel policy for young children and it s actually most hotels needs to change All hotel policies should allow 2 children 12 and under in any room with their parents if prepared to use existing beds or already located sofa bed Or with one extra bed free of charge , Clean room and very fast service
34900,The Rembrandt, The TV didn t work in our room we rang down to reception they said someone would be up shortly no one turned up we did miss not having a TV for morning news, The hotel is very cosy this time of year
34901,The Rembrandt, The only problem was the extract fan in the bathroom which was on 24 7 and therefore not conducive to sleep, Good Location Plenty of restaurants nearby Taxi journey to theatre
34902,The Rembrandt, Could not connect to free wifi Housekeeping walked in at 8 15am whilst we were getting dressed and did not apologise , Very large room Very comfortable Friendly and helpful staff particularly the concierge 
34903,The Rembrandt, This hotel is on the expensive side which is not surprising in view of its location While the breakfast buffet has an extensive choice the coffee served is not very good The hotel should consider providing the choice of double expressos instead of just weak filter coffee but then again its all down to personal preferences , The hotel staff were extremely helpful and polite I had reserved a standard double room but was upgraded to a superior room at no additional expense which was greatly appreciated The room was very spacious with lots of extra trimmings and a great view of the city The loung area is lovely to sit and chat in and the food served there is good and well presented
34904,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Excellent location just across the road from the V A museum within walking distance from Harrods and very close to South Kensington tube station 
34905,The Rembrandt, Mattress was only adequate but worst thing was the sound proofing to the next rooms The guy one one side of me had toilet oriented issues and on the other seemed to have to talk to Siri very slowly loudly to learn about London and also at one point some tourists were loud in the hall it all sounded like it was in my room Like many London hotels this one seems to be composed of different buildings so maybe one of the other ones has quiet rooms but then why did they ignore my request for one I did get put in the back so there was little street or hall noise so they didn t totally ignore it but then I m surprised I m the first to complain about noise here , Excellent location wifi very good breakfast good sized room in fact large good shower sunlight coming in during the morning as I used the room as an office good desk laptop power 
34906,The Rembrandt, The staff are unfriendly and unprofeshional The hotel is old with old furniture and un ronivated bathrooms The bed is disasteroous uncomfortable at all The cleaning staff disasterous, The location
34907,The Rembrandt,No Negative, the location is excellent being very close to the Piccadilly line the room was large and very nice the lifts were prompt always breakfast room was large enough to accommodate everyone 
34908,The Rembrandt, Thee only down side was having sat down and ordered our early evening meal in the bar area at 5 o clock We were told that area would be closed at 6 o clock for a function and that we might be asked to move , Have stayed before it s the location close to all the attraction s and shops that we needed to visit
34909,The Rembrandt,No Negative, When the receptionist found out that we had stayed twice before and it was my husbands birthday the day we checked in she kindly found us an upgrade and wished my husband a very happy birthday I booked 2 consecutive nights but booked each night a few weeks apart I emailed the hotel to ask if we could stay in the same room for the 2 nights When we arrived this was arranged and we was really pleased not to have to move All staff were very welcoming and I will certainly stay again the next time we are in London Thank you
34910,The Rembrandt, Although the room we were in was comfortable enough the walls were a little bit thin, The staff were excellent and the main reception and lounge were very comfortable 
34911,The Rembrandt, nothing to dislike, The location for the albert hall was brilliant very clean hotel friendly staff breakfast was excellent you even get a mug for your tea or coffe
34912,The Rembrandt, 100 pounds deposit taken at check in for any expenses that may be charged during your stay when you check out they refund to your card but still not returned after 2 days, Great Location for the shops
34913,The Rembrandt, There was insufficient room art one side of the beds to move in and out The matress has seen better days as it had a dip in the middle , Excellent location
34914,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Another great stay My first choice whenever in London business or pleasure Comfortable welcoming great breakfast access to swimming pool and great location 
34915,The Rembrandt, Room temp cold and adjustment did nt work Window was draughty , Close to the museums the tube Our room 641 had a massage tub a big plus 
34916,The Rembrandt, The staff at breakfast could be a little more proactive in offering tea coffee when showing to tables Shouldn t have to attract someone s attention and ask for it , The rooms were clean and well presented and housekeeping staff were very keen to make sure we were happy Reception staff very helpful when giving directions to London attractions and in how to get there 
34917,The Rembrandt, Great for a couple of days but if staying longer make sure you book a bigger room , Location was brilliant Room was adequate considering London is an expensive city Staff were excellent and the breakfast was fabulous lots of choice and attentive staff ensuring it was all fresh and plentiful 
34918,The Rembrandt,No Negative, The location is great across from the VA Museum a few blocks from the tube Very good Full English Breakfast Nice size rooms and have been updated nicely WIFI in the entire hotel Overall Great 
34919,The Rembrandt, Even though we booked a superior double room it was extremely small with very little space to move around and no case storage Also breakfast did not start until 7 30am and as I had to be out by 7 15am I had to forgo my booked Full English Breakfast A sin in my eyes as it was already included in the deal and could only have a Room Service inadequate breakfast My wife did enjoy her breakfast though , The proximity of the hotel to the R A H where I had to perform I had to be there by 7 30am so being this close was a bonus 
34920,The Rembrandt, Building work carried out at back of hotel which our room overlooked Also only one lift working for whole of our two day stay , location of hotel Decor of room
34921,The Rembrandt, Only one disappointment our room wasn t ready until 3 15 pm Arrived at 1 30pm , We loved the location the room was spacious Breakfast excellent staff very friendly Coming back soon

34924,The Rembrandt, Nothing Would def return with kids , Perfect location for half term trip with kids Walking distance to all museums Harrods and South Ken tube Decent sized bedrooms with tea and coffee facilities and decent bathrooms Good breakfast 
34925,The Rembrandt, Unfortunately the bathroom water supply was interrupted on both mornings of our stay the second time when I was having a shower , Excellent location for Knightsbridge Kensington and the Royal Albert Hall 
34926,The Rembrandt, The rooms that were not renovated are old and not fitting a 4 stars hotel The breakfast is nice but could easily be upgraded The height of the shower could not fit anyone taller than 1 80 , The room was cozy and clean The staff was excellent e g the first room was not impressive so we could choose another and we found one that was renovated The breakfast is quite minimal but nice The location is convenient 
34927,The Rembrandt, Nothing to dislike superb hotel and location, Our room was upgraded when we got to reception you couldn t fault the room staff very friendly and superb breakfast looking to stay next year for a week
34928,The Rembrandt, Nothing, Excellent traditional city centre hotel with character Lovely lounge area quiet room despite being right in the centre of town Superb breakfast with good quality ingredients particularly the availability of Darjeeling Tea 
34929,The Rembrandt, Constructive criticism breakfast was really good in quality but somewhat spoilt as a the plate for the hot breakfast was not even warm and whist the bacon was of good quality and cooked to my liking it was cold There is nothing like a good hot breakfast to start the day and I was somewhat disappointed , Location of Hotel Room size and facilities 
34930,The Rembrandt, There was nothing to dislike about the hotel, Everything about the hotel was perfect for us Location was great Room was lovely Food was really nice
34931,The Rembrandt, The maze like corridors The smaller rooms could do with leaner or less furniture Breakfast could do with a change in menu every 3 days at least For longer stays gets repetitive even if somewhat extensive , Right opposite the V A Museum bus stop tube a short walk shops restaurants Staff
34932,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Our stay was very comfortable and staff were very pleasant A small point but our bin in the bathroom had not been emptied The breakfast was adequate but we thought not up to the standard of the hotel with no individual selection on the menu 
34933,The Rembrandt, Lack of basic amenities such as cotton buds Glasses left unwashed for days and then taken away and never returned Room key having to be reset once and often twice a day Cost of laundry Having to call maintenance 3 times for things broken , The staff and the location of the hotel were faultless Breakfast was a good variety of items so not bored if staying a few days 
34934,The Rembrandt, I do object to being treated like a criminal as if I didn t pay my bills Having paid for my room in advance they then insisted on a deposit of 50 for any extra expenses repaid when I left but Truly awful breakfast which I had not expected as I thought this was supposed to be an excellent hotel It was tepid and tasteless , Lovely staff Everyone I came across was very helpful and they smiled 
34935,The Rembrandt, First look at the web site wasn t clear that gym and pool were not included within the hotel costs but required an extra costs , Very large room and quiet Access to Aquilla gym and pool excellent facilities at reasonable extra cost per day 
34936,The Rembrandt, View from my room Was spoilt on last visit with balcony and view of museum This time we were at back of hotel not as pretty But that can t be helped , Friendly staff great facitilies good location Wifi was good and breakfast was excellent Second stay in a few months will stay here if in London Thanks

34939,The Rembrandt, unfortunately there was a water problem during our stay On arrival NO WATER they forgot to tell us then again following morning so unable to shower husband I was in shower when water went off so unable to rinse or wash my hair Sometimes I Lift our card didn t always work , It was useful to be able to leave our luggage there after checking out 
34940,The Rembrandt,No Negative, Fantastic location Situated in a beautiful area of London down the road from Harrods across the road from the Victoria Albert museum and very close to the South Kensington Metro station within bag trundling distance there are great restaurants bars and cafes very close by 
34941,The Rembrandt, Room we stayed in facing main road too noisy even in the middle of the night because of heavy traffic flow , Good location short distance to Harrods and other branded shops Big spacious room with good king size bed
34942,The Rembrandt, The first room we were offered was no bigger than a shoe box and had a bad smell In fairness they moved us immediately , Hotel was well located staff were excellent Breakfast was nice 
34943,The Rembrandt, Noise from traffic had to move rooms but hotel were very accommodating Breakfast was OK but not fab as buffet which is never great no matter where you have it xx, The staff location and luxury of the hotel 
34944,The Rembrandt, Spa health club facilities next door are not really impressive, Perfect for the Royal Albert Hall Very efficient and professional staff Upgraded to a Club room which was very good Ample breakfast
34945,The Rembrandt, Unfortunately our booking for a superior twin room I went with my daughter via booking com was incorrect and for the first night we were allocated a double so got very poor sleep as she wriggles Staff moved us the next day when a twin became available , Excellent location very comfy beds and very helpful pleasant staff 
34946,The Rembrandt,No Negative, We had just spent a week hiking in the Lake District and were ready for a little pampering The room was large and comfortable and the location was fabulous We spent all our time in the area immediately around the Rembrandt 
34947,The Rembrandt, executive room is small no complimenry water in room when I asked they gave only 1 bottle for each room there is no room service to clean the room after 2 30 pm bed mattress and pillows very bad , Location safety of hotel room service food was ok 
34948,The Rembrandt, Very dissappointed to be told on arrival that the swimming pool and spa were not included in the package and that we would have to pay a considerable amount daily top use it , superb locality close to all tourist activities and tube station
34949,The Rembrandt,No Negative, We were given a complimentary upgrade to an Executive King the room was very well appointed and bed extremely comfortable a pleasure to return 40 years after our first visit

34951,The Rembrandt, Rooms a little old fashioned but clean and comfy service excellent , Excellent prime location for everything museums shopping west end theatres superb 
34952,The Rembrandt, Coffee and Tea for Breakfast very bitter Bed and Pilllows very uncomfortable as well as position oh the bed no room to get in and out on one side Shower in bath not very safe for mature couple , Location and access to hop on hop off buses 
34953,The Rembrandt, We booked a Superior King room and although the facilities were good the room was on the small side with only a small window looking onto the fire escape , The breakfasts were really good with all international tastes catered for We found the staff to be helpful and nothing was too much trouble when requesting additional items The central location was ideally placed for many tourist areas 
34954,The Rembrandt, Nothing to complain about, Travelled with my 7yr old son upon arrival after a busy day in the natural history museum which is only a five minute walk away the young lady on the check in desk referred to him as a VIP and took a genuine interest as to what he had seen at the museum this made his trip The place was really clean all the staff were very child friendly and the room was very nice topped of with a jacuzzi bath Room service was quick and really tasty The breakfast buffet style catered for every nationality the full English was brilliant

34958,The Rembrandt, This place reflects its nearby community s new found wealth The kind that wants to be seen and heard 12 midnight to 2 am nothing but high powered vehicles racing up and down the streets A police car with a siren that lasted for ten minutes put an end to the noise at 2 10am , This hotel is a gem in the wrong setting Managed well and staffed with competent people The housekeeper seemed genuinely surprised when I gave her a tip on the second day Her reaction led me to understand that such gestures are uncommon and says something about their clientele I had good service which I wanted to reward 
34959,The Rembrandt, Other guests being rude to staff it costs nothing to say please and thank you , We told the hotel we were in London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and they gave us a free upgrade to our room The breakfast was good value considering the price it would have cost if you would have eaten at a nearby restaurant 
34960,The Rembrandt, Really hot weather complimentry water the first day but none on the other days we were at the hotel only very expensive water from the mini bar Also very noisy at night with children running up and down the corridor , The hotel location is great for visiting London and close to the tube network
34961,The Rembrandt, The smallest bathroom I have ever seen Booked an executive double room could only just get round the bed which was a double not a king , EXCELLENT location
34962,The Rembrandt, Nothing really , The staff at the reception were absolutely fantastic Booking com had messed up our booking and the staff were very accommodating Sofia at the front desk was particularly helpful She made sure we were as comfortable as possible 
34963,The Rembrandt, I would not stay here again as the restaurant pizza was an absolute disgrace and was not removed from our bill despite being so bad that it was inedible Also bed was sloping and breakfast room service only delivered one of the 4 items we requested with no explanation or apology No one asked us how our stay was , I liked free wifi and that it was opposite the museum we were visiting That s all 
34964,The Rembrandt, My only complaint is that the bathtub was kind of high which made it harder to get out of , The location was perfect Close to restaurants pubs shopping South Kensington Station Museums Harrod s The hotel was beautiful The staff couldn t have been nicer or more accommodating The rooms were spacious very clean The breakfast buffet was wonderful I highly recommend this hotel
