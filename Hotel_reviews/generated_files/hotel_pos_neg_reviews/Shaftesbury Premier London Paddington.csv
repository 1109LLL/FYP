213170,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The Deluxe Room was pricey and extremely small It was so small that a big suitcase couldn t be moved around The bed was too narrow for an average sized adult to roll from one side to the other , Good location The toilet and bathroom were neat 
213171,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Work was being done in the hotel no mention of this work when I made the reservation When you enter the small reception area there is a very powerful odour of some sort of floral chemical it is terrible makes you wonder what kind of smell they are trying to disguise in the area it does not smell fresh and clean They kindly gave me a room early much appreciated the room was an upgrade two double beds very small the bathroom for four people would be very tight There are no hooks available to hang a toiletry bag very inconvenient The room overall was very dark no place to properly put make up on lighting over the beds for reading were well placed They provide instant coffee tea biscuits and water Beds were on the soft side sheets clean and decent quality There is a safe in the closet A few blocks from Paddington station quite a distance from the centre of things but the tube is close by and one can come and go as long as you don t mind tube travel and have the time This hotel would not be one to stay with children very small and cramped however for singles and couples it is very affordable and does provide a comfortable stay for the cost Definitely worth a look if you are on a budget Lots of good little restaurants to eat meals very close by One can walk from the station with your luggage to the hotel easily , Close to paddington station room was clean staff friendly 
213172,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful in dealing with any problems that we encountered and we would go back especially when the refurbishments are completed 
213173,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I felt the room was very small scene as though I thought id booked a deluxe double When we arrived we was made aware that the hotel did have building work going on which was fine Room was ground floor Room number 12 I was awoken at 8 30am on our last day by the sound of building work going on And at 9am I opened my curtains to the sight of 2 builders looking through the shed I don t mind being on the ground floor but I 100 believe that this room should of been taken off the avaliable rooms during construction due to the fact I could not open my curtains the while time i was there as fear of builders appearing at any time Not having the light from the open curtains was made worse by the fact the ceiling light kept turning its self on and off again , Bed was very comfy cannot fault that but I felt the room was tiny scene as though I d booked a deluxe double room And having a shed outside our room and 2 building men looking through the shed at 9am in the morning wasn t my idea of a nice wakeup call 
213174,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The iron spat dirty water all over a very expensive scarf The rooms were tiny noisy workmen on site right outside bedroom window, clean good bathroom
213175,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room bathroom was extra small and required special skills to do shower no2 shave when lying in bed could change channels with my toes walls are extra thin, I liked the location Close to the station and in a very nice part of London Apple each day is a benefit 
213176,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I arrived to the hotel and was told that it was full that I had to go across the street to a sister hotel No lift or help to bring the luggage to the room , Location
213177,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, i couldnt sleep the 2 nights i was in room 804 bevause the couple in the room next door spoke all night till 6am Reception could not move me the last time i was at the hotel two weeks earlier the I dian male staff at reception though courteous smelt of a cery strong bad body odour which unfortunately spread to the whole lobby area my wife almost threw up You need to firmly insist that male reception staff bathe more than once a month , good decor
213178,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I stayed in a single room which was very small for a 4 star hotel The shower was also quite small There was a problem with the lights in the room not something that bothered me much though , Good location very close to Paddington train station Decent breakfast Polite and helpful personnel OK in terms of cleanliness 
213179,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The only down side was the noise in the morning from the renovation but that will not put us off staying here again Its a lovely hotel , All the staff where lovely the room was high quality location perfect breakfast offered everything you could want We will definitely be staying here again 
213180,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Receptionist st Shaftesbury a bit aloof all other staff very friendly and helpful, I was actually transferred to the Park Grand same road with complimentary breakfast due to some kind of booking issue which wasn t made clear
213181,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The first room was a complimentary upgrade to a triple room which was down in the basement next to a fire exit workers entrance and smoking hiding spot and in the first 5 minutes of being there 4 people came crashing through the fire exit door you know the one that should remain closed I asked if we could be moved and the only room available was opposite the elevator and hotel entrance That s right you here the door open then 30seconds later ping going up this room also had blood on the walls Half the lights did not work and the curtain rail was broken letting a bright beam of light through from the main entrance across the bed where your head lies Now I then checked their website and they are advertising deluxe double rooms for that evening at half the price with a free breakfast The rooms are small that is well documented however if you are 6ft or above like myself good luck fitting in the shower This place is definitely not worth the money Oh and both booking com and the hotel fail to inform you that there building work being carried out from 8am 6pm , Friendly staff Looked after our luggage whilst we went out on the Sunday 
213182,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, Very short walk to Paddington Rooms small but not by London standards and perfectly comfortable I think this hotel is a little bit of a step up from most in the area but still good value for London 
213183,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The sheet is really dirty You can see it in the picture And the manager didn t say any sorry when we told him He said it was the cleaning company s fault , Breakfast is good 
213184,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Building work taking place loud noise from 8am not known until check in I would have booked elsewhere if warning shown on Booking com website , Friendly helpful staff Excellent breakfast 
213185,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very noisy I was on the ground floor and I could hear absolutely everything from the people upstairs to the bathroom extractor in the room next to me I did not get much sleep at all which was a shame as the room itself was lovely, Very nice clean and comfortable room right next to Paddington station which was the reason I booked
213186,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room had not been cleaned on arrival Underground room was tiny and cave like Smoke from nearby stairwell , Convenient to Paddington station Fast check in checkout Good shower 
213187,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room very shall bathroom very very small, Were moved to a sister hoteliers park lane hotel across the road due to renovations Staff very friendly and good location
213188,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I knew my single room would be small but it felt even smaller because some of the furniture fixtures were to large for the room The bathroom had a very large sink basin which took up SO much space In addition a smaller chair at the desk would have served the same purpose without taking up so much space There was a full sized ironing board in the closet which took up half of the closet space but the room was so small there was no where to set up the board if it was needed ,No Positive
213189,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The lighting was not great Couldn t get one of the lights to turn off So had to sleep with it on The shower would have been better if it had a bit more power Knobs were missing covers on bath shower controls , The location was good The room was well equipped with iron fridge safe etc 
213190,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Didn t get to stay at the Shaftesbury Hotel they we doing renovations so was taken to the Park Grand Hotel and was offered to have a complementary breakfast I was given a room in the basement Comfortable bed but unless I drew the curtains I could watch peoples feet going past on the pavement and there were steps outside to the basement The sink in the en suite was difficult to wash in as my shoulders touched both the wall and the shower unit so you could not move No breakfast as left before 5am to get to Heathrow ,No Positive
213191,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Not told when we were booking that the hotel was being refurbished and when we arrived we were moved to a sister hotel 5 mins walk away Also We were paying in euros and it was not the price quoted when we booked so beware it depends on the daily exchange rate ,No Positive
213192,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Booked a room with 3 single beds picture on internet but was told no such room exists The other issue is the water kept leaking out from the shower to the floor , Location is great Very convenient to Tube train station and several tourist spots Staff was quick to address issues they can fix Breakfast is good given its price 
213193,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room could have used more lights and in general the hotel could use a slight refurbish , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Made check in and check out a fun experience Fast in room wifi

213195,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, They provided a room in the basement which I did not like at all The room is very small The ceiling is very low as well When I requested them to change the room they told me that the room rates are high in the upper floors I think information related to room rates should be mentioned in the website in detail , Location is very good 
213196,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Customer service leaves a lot to be desired Booked for an employee and they refused to accept 3rd party payment booking com did little to help The staff were clueless and quite rude considering I wanted to pay I wasted 3 hours just trying to pay really not worth the hassle ,No Positive
213197,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We were located on the lower ground floor my mistake as I had booked a DBL room but needed a twin The noise overhead walking to and fro and down the stairs made it difficult to get to sleep the second night Not a biggy but would prefer a room on a higher floor next time, The staff were warm and friendly accommodating and helpful The club room was clean and spacious Good variety for breakfast I made a mistake in booking but this was resolved quickly and efficiently I was made to feel like a welcomed guest and my father who is 80 was very impressed with the location size of room and staff We plan to stay again soon 
213198,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Lighting too dull in bedroom No lighting behind the chairs and therefore difficult to read Had to sit on bed to view the TV, The cooked breakfast items were well presented and not greasy
213199,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, didn t realise that there was a bar we may have had a drink there is we had known , great location really close to the train station nice and quiet at night room was great 
213200,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was very very small not much room for luggage Couldn t check in at allocated time , Very comfy bed good wifi and really handy to Winter Wonderland and tube stations Really good value 
213201,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bed far too soft for me and curtains wouldn t close in room which did let some light in in the morning so I was up a little earlier than I would have liked But all small issues nothing major , Breakfast buffet choices were great nice hot breakfast choices eggs were lovely not sloppy and bacon nice and crisp Staff friendly and attentive 
213202,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The window door in my room was single glazed wooden chipped and didn t close fully so a small draught could be felt and outside traffic noise heard, The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was good the room was clean and the heated bathroom floor was a nice surprise
213203,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, No restaurant the first room was so pokey that the door wouldn t open fully as it hit the wardrobe and difficult to get carry on size suitcase through the door , Staff helpful
213204,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The single room is not as same as it was showed in the website and it is a little bit too small , The service is great All staffs are very nice and helpful
213205,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Photos on website deceiving Very tiny room website showed a bathtub in deluxe rooms but not so bathroom so small even thin person like me could hardly turn around Overall the price should have been half what I was charged ,No Positive
213206,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Really really tiny room Lack of acoustic insulation room was on the street and was very noisy during the night, Newly renovated room Very optimised space Good as it s really small Modern shower room
213207,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Dangerous steps down to bedroom as soon as you open the door checkout staff getting the bill wrong room very small unable to access iron because of this, Lots of choice everything very fresh at breakfast comfortable bed check in staff excellent 
213208,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Cold water in the bathroom was warm , From the check in to the check out this was an excellent stay Staff were friendly and prompt the room was clean and spacious Quiet and relaxing the perfect place to stay 
213209,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, perhaps the housekeeping can check the shower there was a black mouldy and lime scale at the dge of the door , Deco of the room even though single pun very pretty with comfy bed 
213210,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Three different bank accounts all have money taken out The staff fail to contact the banks to expedite the return Don t ever trust the staff here , Leaving
213211,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Steps down into the room were dangerous and annoying the decor in the room was very old needed updating i think it might previously been a hallway that was converted into a single room The bed position in the very tiny room m ade watching the TV very difficult a grungy hotel yuk Except for the ensuite that was great with a good shower The bed sheets were dirty and had to be changed when I saw them and asked for a change The smell of whatever chemical they were using on my floor was pungent overpowering and possibly toxic , It was close to Paddington station and the bathroom was newish and clean 
213212,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We were shown into a room with only a shower when I asked to have a room with a bath I was told that they didn t have one I felt quite put out as I particularly wanted to have a bath went back to the reception and told them that I wouldn t have booked there if the room didn t have a bathroom I saw the maids were still cleaning so I said we are going out to eat and when we get back I would like a room with a bath Suddenly I was given a key to another room with a bath , Bed was smaller than the usual Hotels and so was the Room I felt instantly claustrophobic 
213213,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Freezing room and despite frequent requests for staff to turn up heating it remained freezing No extra blankets provided despite requests The original room was so small I would hardly have been able to turn round in it Staff did upgrade me to a larger room on request,No Positive
213214,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I wasn t very happy with the staff at check out We checked out at 1 30 as per our request at earlier in the morning and the person my partner spoke to did not mentions anything about any late check out charges To point out also when I checked in the night before I didn t get told what time check out was from anyway so we had to take up our resting time in the morning to call the reception and ask which was a bit inconvenient I would come in future as it was a lovely hotel close to central and the room was very cosy but in future the guys at reception should really ask their guests at check out if they enjoyed their stay and whether they would need a taxi taking them anywhere It s very basic customer service Being a manager of a Boutique hotel myself I know what to expect and I wasn t expecting such an unfriendly check out experience Nonetheless we could come back in the future , The room was very cosy and it was a nice spacious bed with a good sized TV and a bath as per my request which I was very happy about 
213215,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Rather uncomfortable worn out chair at desk , Bed very comfortable and room was a good size for the price and location Wifi good Well equipped room
213216,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The deluxe double was so tiny you had to move sideways between the side of the bed and the wall Similarly the wardrobe was too narrow to accept normal width coat hangers There was no double glazing which meant considerable heat loss and traffic noise from the road outside , All good facilities and spotlessly clean Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice and individually cooked eggs Managed to park directly outside the front door for a charge
213217,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I found bugs on my pillow that could have bitten me They didnt even give me free breakfast or an upgrade or anything they just moved me into another room On top of that I was taking a shower and then the water would not go from boiling hot to normal I had to call the reception and my hair and everything was wet and they had to come up and fix it for half an hour The staff was not even helpful when I had to move the rooms the person just helped us a little but it was is moving our things It was just horrible thank God we were out most of the time , The only thing that was okay was the fact that it was well centered but other than that nothing 
213218,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Because I didn t pre book breakfast price was 15 for a rather dated breakfast with mediocre coffee in an empty dining room , Quiet comfortable room and friendly staff Fruit bowl a nice touch 
213219,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Little effort done for housekeeping Cups we used from the first day were not washed or replaced for the 9 days we were there Cleanliness is a little suspect so we bought and used our own cups Bedsheets weren t changed Windows weren t cleaned If you look under the bed it s horrendous Worst part was Check out was delayed half an hr as duty manager was asleep We checked out at 5 30 am the trainee told us the duty manager is on break We could see him trying to call the duty manager for a good half an hour to no avail until we demanded that he returned us the deposit and allowed us to check out Almost missed our train as a result , The location s very convenient Bed was nice Toilet was newly renovated so it was clean 
213220,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bar, Checked in 10 30 when we arrived Staff at front desk very obliging We didn t like room And we were moved right away Would definetly stay again and would recommend it to anyone
213221,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I booked a single room it was tiny for a client of mine that was not very fluent in English they tried to charge breakfast that I had already paid for and also tried to change 200 for phone calls that actually were 60 I had to go personally to the reception and clarify the situation On the guest book the rates for calls was not mentioned for rest of Europe only for certain European countries with an average 1 5 per minute however they claimed it was 3 per minute for Europe while at their book Australia is 2 5 and USA is much less ,No Positive
213222,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Did not like the receptionist on our arrival after a 20 hour flight Saying that I had double booked a room for the night an that I would not get a refund, Comfy bed rooms a little on the small size great breakfast choice
213223,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, 1 Window was not sealed properly drafty resulted sleepless night due to coldness as the bed was placed next to the window 2 Noisy both inside the hotel and out on the street 3 Mouldy under the cupboard , location is okay
213224,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I opted for the super deluxe single choice and regret it The room did not match the photo I received on my booking sheet It was far too small and with my luggage I couldn t move the end of the bed was so close to the wall that I couldn t get my suitcase to the luggage rack I know rooms are small in London hotels but there is better value and larger rooms in other hotels nearby I know I stayed at one on my trip , The prepaid breakfast of 9 95GBP is well worth the investment It is a substantial choice and good value compared with local cafes etc The service and staff was good The location near Paddington station was ideal 
213225,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The corridors were a bit dark as this is an older building so perhaps brighter light bulbs would help Yes the floors are creaky but that is to be expected with older buildings The bathroom towels could be bigger and the pillows could be a bit softer but I am sure if we had contacted housekeeping they would have been happy to bring us a feather pillow All in all more positives than negatives and the negatives did not deter from the enjoyment of our stay , The breakfasts were delicious and the scrambled eggs were light and fluffy I travelled with my sister and we shared a club twin room for 3 days The staff were excellent and offered us an upgrade owing to a maintenance issue with our booked room and also complimentary breakfast for our stay The bedroom was a good size on the 4th floor and was lovely and clean and the bed linen of good quality The bathroom although small was refurbished with a good size soaking tub and a well fitting shower screen The bathroom towels were also of good quality although a little bit small There is plenty of hot water and the central air can be well controlled The location is excellent as it is only a short walk from Paddington station so ideal for tourists catching the Heathrow Express and the Tube connections from Paddington are ideal We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and when I travel back to London with my husband and children we will definitely stay here again as you definitely get value for money 
213226,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Not enough space in restaurant to accomadate for those wanting a breakfast buffet, Staff were friendly welcoming and efficient Rooms were comfy Location was good as Paddington tube station was very close by Restaurants close by
213227,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was very cold on checking out where advised we could have asked for heaters Luckily only really spent minimum time in room, Good breakfast excellent staff
213228,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, View from room was a bit uninviting , Beds were very comfy Staff extremely polite professional and very helpful and accomodating Very central location Good value for money 
213229,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was cold and the bathroom heater was broken No refund or discount when asked They offered other rooms but they were no better and colder , the room was cold and the bathroom heat didn t work The staff wouldnt help me nor discount my room Apparently the room was double booked but they wouldn t give me an upgrade or refund my money 
213230,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was tiny to the extreme Small double against wall top and bottom and 6 inches from wall window on one side You can t get out without other person getting out or climbing over Room on lower floor so could hear aircon unit outside all night Hallway noisy in morning think it was near breakfast area I stayed one night and went out for evening so coziness wasn t an issue for me but for some it will be especially if staying longer Even with a single bed in it this room would be tiny , Staff very helpful parking out front great for location underfloor heating in bathroom 
213231,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room I was in was small I work on cruise ships so small rooms don t bother me but they may bother others If you like to have room to move don t get the single bed rooms I also found the hotel quite noisy The window in my room wasn t double glazed so I got lots of traffic noise and some noise in the guest corridors If you re a light sleeper I wouldn t recommend , I enjoyed my stay here it was clean and comfortable and the staff were great Thanks The bed was like sleeping on a cloud Heavenly 
213232,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Could not use shower due to bad design Had to climb over toilet to get into shower I reported this to reception and they did not offer us an alternative except to say it was the best they could do This is England which has standards A functional shower is a must , Location
213233,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The so called deluxe double room had the smallest double bed I have ever experienced and was hard against wall with no bedside table or light at the wall side Only way to get out of bed was to crawl over partner ,No Positive
213234,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Shower was rather a tight squeeze Diet needed post Xams , Very close for Paddington Station and perfect for a stop over when travelling Easy walk for any early train Staff were as good as gold and I will definitely use the hotel again 
213235,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, To be honest there was nothing that wasnt to my liking Although if i was to stay here again i would print a map next time , Friendly staff Comfortable room Reasonably quite for central London Close to tube
213236,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Even for a club room it was quite small Bathroom very small Some of the decor lamps etc quite worn and missing parts Not the greatest view as we could see into someone else s room Very warm and quite noisy A C But all these things were minor niggles Would definitely stay again , Complimentary tea coffee and bottled water in the room as well as a fridge and microwave were definitely superb Huge comfortable bed Hairdryer vanity pack ear buds emery boards cotton pads sewing kit and toiletries all made it feel very welcoming and helpful Location excellent Quiet 
213237,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Size of the single room number 510 a typically tiny London single room you can t reach certain places without first lying on the bed Strange mix of modern elements and probably older parts that haven t been renewed Would be cool if those old parts were antiques but they are just old , easy check in and check out good and easy wifi access rather modern room great location very close to Paddington station
213238,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Breakfast was between 7 30 and 10 30 a buffet style continental or full English breakfast We arived for breakfast at 9 45am no staff around to ask anything for 10 mins Not a lot left for full english no eggs beans and very little of anything else Finally saw a member of staff where eggs were cooked for us and other items replenished Had to wait 15 mins for tea to be brought to our table So made to with orange juice untill it arrived Staff very unhelpful just saying they were very busy ,No Positive
213239,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms were tiny the so called deluxe double room is the size of a tiny single room the bed touched three walls the room was very dark broken wall paper single blazed windows no sound proof at all you can hear the noise from streets outside as well as the TV from next room The staff were not friendly they have us a tiny single room despite the fact we paid for deluxe double room It s a total rip off and we ll never go back again The breakfast was very salty , The only good thing about it is its location 
213240,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, the breakfast is totally useless to wake up for Nothing good to eat even you cannot have Islamic food at all No vegetarian sausage 1 type of cheese and not available daily, location and Room service 
213241,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Single room was in basement and was size of a cupboard and window was 2m away from room opposite For one person for 1 night and not spending any time in hotel it was ok but if I needed to spend any time there other than sleeping then I would have gone insane, Location
213242,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The bathroom was tiny and crammed not for overweight guests also bedroom crammed even with a double bed had clamber over the bed to get in it, People were ok
213243,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, From outside the hotel didn t live up to much and the size of the rooms are outrageously small , The bed was extremely comfy and the location was perfect The room although small contained all the essentials 
213244,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I banged my head on the cupboard above the desk , The hotel was lovely all the staff were very friendly and attentive The beds were very comfortable and we were in a room at the rear of the hotel and so it was very quiet The hotel is just a short walk away from the underground and train station excellent location We really enjoyed our stay 
213245,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Although paid via booking com in advance needed to have ID taken and copied as well as manual card transaction with signature for amount again I know where identity fraud will have happen , Location very good and excellent for money

213247,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, Short easy walk from Paddington station Apples and chocolates on reception Decent tea tray in room Lovely breakfast staff Small but perfectly functioning single room with a balcony 
213248,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Breakfast very boring although there was plenty of food Hash brown potatoes especially poor and dry tasting Entrance room to hotel needed urgent update bad impression as one entered the hotel , Bed very comfortable Bathroom updated but if you were overweight one could NOT get into the shower Breakfast room staff very proficient and friendly Reception staff were excellent 
213249,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, If you want the feel of what is a British make do this is it Several row houses strung together whereby you have to traverse stairs even while on the same floor Low ceilings Tight hallways and elevator Lighting was poor in the room Had to request a floor lamp to light the desk area and corner of the room otherwise couldn t see in the closet or use lap top , Good location Fairly quiet for being in a popular area Upkeep was good Generally modern Beds were comfortable Breakfast was ample good and well prepared 
213250,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Small room overlooking back didn t have breakfast extortionate price Raffles restaurant round the corner 6 for full breakfast tea and toast result , Good location to Paddington bathroom tiny
213251,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The first room was not for two people really room002 next to lift on ground floor Avoid this room if you can as it is so small we could barely fit in and the noise level from the lift was pretty bad, Staff did well to change our double room for one which resembled a proper double room with shower and bath
213252,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We ordered a taxi to Heathrow for an early morning flight and there was no record of the booking and no car available We managed to hail a black cab on the street at 4am thanks to some nice guys who gave up their taxi because they could see we were desperate Otherwise we would have missed our flight , We were moved at check in from this hotel to their sister hotel The Shaftesbury Metropolis down the road because there was a problem with the maintenance The transfer was fairly well managed and it wasn t far away 
213253,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I have had better rooms at this hotel This time I had a ground floor double which was very small and the shower room was minute I am 6 2 tall and the only way to use the toilet was side saddle Just about OK for one person for one night If I was staying longer I would have requested a room change , Location is brilliant Near Paddington and a choice of tube lines I have stayed here a number of times and do recommend the Shaftesbury despite my negative comments this time 
213254,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Your room overall condition looks poor and old except the bathroom is quite brand new However your bathroom is extremely small I have never seen in my life The hotel room price I paid GBP150 nite is absolutely not worth , Nothing I like your hotel 
213255,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The two of us could not have been more happy at The Shaftesbury , Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly especially Lycian always smiling and giving help on places to eat outside 
213256,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Had a very depressing dark room in the ground floor The hotel is very basic and breakfast was standard The price is too high compared to the quality , Location good 
213257,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was very small but clean fine for a 4 night stay Mattress on the bed needs replaced was very soft Window needs replaced as well not double glazed the frame had seen better days could feel a draught coming in I actually moved the bed a little bit away from the window so I couldn t feel the draught as much Window also didn t do anything to reduce traffic noise Would have been nice to be able to get some food in the hotel Arrived late on my first evening hoping to get something light at the bar but was presented with a take away menu for a pizza joint Thankfully there s a Subway close by , Handy to get to from Paddington there are a good choice of restaurants in the local area 
213258,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Advertised a double room that wasn t big enough to get into the bed No room at all to move and couldn t open the door and use the toilet at the same time Was told when i booked the hotel had a gym but it doesn t have one For the price paid i would expect better , Friendly staff good location Breakfast was good quality and was clean and presentable 
213259,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The location was good but the rooms were very small and even after upgrading with an additional charge of 100 pounds per day their best room fell below expectations, The breakfast were courteous the reception was ok and the location was good

213261,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Till we moved room at a hugely extra expense the room we were given was minute I ve never been in anything so tiny , Breakfast was good location is good and staff were helpful
213262,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms and shower facilities were very small I am not a extra large person but I am not small either There was no room to do anything other than sidestep around The shower had enough room for an upright Hoover and a mop and bucket , I liked the location 
213263,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, N A, Hotel was perfectly located for our stay Staff were professional friendly and courteous Rooms were exactly what we needed for our stay clean and comfortable 
213264,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, bathrooms are not clean the shower door was broken lots of scratches on the wall the towels are very old there is no privacy at all I could even listen to the guest who was staying next to my room while he was talking on the phone it s like a fitting room I could also listen to people who are walking in the upper floor because of the ceiling it s like made from wood in short it deserves a 2 stars hotel not 4 at all the value of money is not worth it as well , The location it s close to paddington train station
213265,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was rather small but adequate for one person It could be nosy because of overlooking a very busy road but it was okay if the window was kept closed , The bed was comfy and the location was perfect for its closeness to Paddington tube and rail stations 
213266,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Tiny room a bit too cramped Not at all what I expected from the website But it didn t matter much , Location location location 5mins walk to Paddington but very quiet Elegant building rooms were nicely appointed with ok fittings 
213267,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room clean was a bit ordinary Some reception staff were a bit tricky , Room was quiet spacious and included toiletries iron and board hairdryer etc Loved the inclusion of an empty fridge and a microwave Staff were mostly friendly and helpful Location fabulous and close to Paddington Station Walking distance to Hyde Park and Oxford St 
213268,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Mainly the bed Too soft for me You might prefer it that way, The location is great The staff is not over bearing and if I needed anything they always provided it The fact that you have AC in the room is huge bonus 
213269,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very small rooms Ive booked 10 Delux Double Rooms On check in I realised it is not even sufficient for a single person Beds were very small and no space at all I suggest the hotel to seriously look into this I will never book this hotel once again definitely I seriously doubt on the ability of the hotel to get repeated customers , The hotel was clean 
213270,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was really small it was a single deluxe deluxe very much refers to the look of the furnishings vs it feeling like a luxury room As a petite person and only staying 2 nights it worked for my needs but would have struggled to stay longer in this size room as you could literally walk in door just about walk round the bed and then into bathroom The bathroom is adequate for one person but there isn t turning space for those of us that are a bit larger or a little infirm As they didn t have an evening restaurant if you wanted the option to bring food into your room you wouldn t be eating in great comfort This also applies to those travelling for business Where would you work as the desk had the tea tray on it so you would have to put it on the floor to use as a work space I had managed to get a decent room rate but if I had paid normal rates I don t think I would have been as happy to accept as value for money I understand that they are using the space to full capacity but it also means everything is very close together , Likes the location very central but not too in the hustle bustle and really easy access to tubes and buses The rooms were clean the staff were polite and helpful 
213271,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, we paid for a deluxe double room and got a bed size ca 180 cm long and ca 130 cm wide we were told that all double rooms are like this If you want a double bed do not stay here Also just enough space for but one small suitcase , proximity to Paddingtom
213272,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Single room had a tiny bathroom no room to swing legs round the toilet so had to sit sideways Shower cubicle so small i had to enter it sideways and could not bend down in it to wash my legs Room was noisy at night The head of the bed was 2 foot from the raised door which had a 1 inch gap under it this meant all the corridor noise was loud No double glazing either Thankfully i had ear plugs , All the staff throughout the hotel were friendly and seemed happy in their jobs Arrived early to see if i could leave a bag and they made the room available for early check in Great choice at breakfast 
213273,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bathroom shower too small especially if you re tall or of a larger build but it worked well, Small room but compact and nice With comfy bed and a good tv
213274,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, got a shock upon arrival that i may have to be moved to another property the room they initially gave me was tiny and not what was advertised on the website, reasonably close to halal eateries and of course near to paddington station for convenience to lhr
213275,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, One night was very noisy rooms face a busy street But I m told staff addressed the problem with a party across the street and the second night was quiet , Very helpful staff Very good location for taking an early morning fast train to Heathrow 5 minute walk with bags Small single but well laid out and good bath 
213276,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Not a problem for me but single rooms have steps down which could be a problem for mobility impaired travellers Also TV was on side wall meaning you couldn t see the screen full on Just needs a swing out bracket , Great location for Paddington Station and rest of London Great and helpful staff and very comfortable and smart room 
213277,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We have reserved a Deluxe Double Room however the room had only a bed with a size of 190 cm x 120 cm which rates as single according to international standards We couldn t even fit two pillows on it next to each other and the room was so tiny that there wasn t enough space between the bed and any of the walls to fit our normal sized luggage The staff advised us to leave our luggage at the reception however there was not even a cupboard in the room where we could put our clothes only a small rack for the coats There was just enough space between the bathroom and the bed to open its door but once it was open the only way to enter it was through the bed This room was much smaller than you expect at any hostel at a price of an expensive 4 star hotel There were also hairs on the bed and in the shower and also one of the towels had brown spots After some extremely frustrating and heated debates with the very unprofessional and arrogant staff the manager the manager of the manager and the manager of the manager of the manager we got 25 discount for that night breakfasts but for the quality it was still way overpriced From the next day we could move to another room which was much bigger than the first one but the quality was still not high Overall our stay was a nightmare so I would not recommend this hotel to anybody ,No Positive
213278,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The service was spectacular staff were really friendly helped us with all our needs greeted us whenever we came in would really reccomend this place if you are travelling to London walking distance to the tube station too overall a really lovely stay 
213279,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I had to go to another hotel as this one had maintenance issues no one helped with my luggage and I got lost trying to find it Staff were quite rude and unhelpful, The bed was comfortable
213280,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I was assigned the room on the ground floor opposite to the reception which is different and so much smaller from the luxury single room advertised on the website I could hear all the conversation of the staff members at reception all night The window facing the street does not block the noise either On top of that the bed sheet was dirty I would really not be going back , Bathroom facilities were new 
213281,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The staff were lacking in customer skills The first problem was that I had booked a twin room and was made to feel as if I was causing a problem when I corrected the receptionist by showing my booking was for a twin not the double I was being offered This was eventually sorted out Milk was not replaced in the twin room and when ordered through reception never materialised My niece came to my single room to see if I had any and was questioned by someone who appeared to be part of the maintenance team and when she explained what she was doing she was told that she should go upstairs and that she was stupid When checking out this was all related to the receptionist who just shrugged her shoulders and said that it was not her problem as she had not been on duty We were really impressed with the rooms and the location but will not be revisiting the hotel as the attitude of the staff was very disappointing and rude , Rooms were excellent although being in the basement was disappointing They were spotless and beds were really comfortable 
213282,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Finally I woud like to express here my graet thanks and appreciation to the duty mgr Alisha Antao for her help and her respect to the guest Its really a lucky hotel to have a kind of person like her , The postive Its a nice location hotel to metro station Its a clean and have good room furniture its have a good a c its have a welcom busicuts and tea
213283,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We where given a room by the lift and main door to all the other rooms we spent the whole night being woken up by people coming and going in and out of the lift at all hours When we complained the manager lied to my face and told me he had never had a complaint I then googled the hotel and found several complaints about that room and the hotel There was blood on the walls and dirt and grime in the bath room when we showed him he became angry are dismissive I would advise any one thinking about staying to not bother The rooms are small dirty and the manager is rude dishonest disrespectful The breakfast looked and tasted as if it had been there hours Rated 4 not a chance is it I wouldn t even give it a 0 rating Emailed the company s customer service team and was advised I would hear back within 24hours nothing from them at all , Location
213284,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was so small I needed to climb across the bed to get to the closet The nightstands have no handles needed to use a key to open the drawers , Convenient location very nice staff 
213285,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The single room was minuscule which was expected but putting the bed exactly in the middle of the room meant two feet on one side of the room was unusable , The location near paddington station was excellent The staff was friendly and professional 
213286,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room itself was smaller than advertised bed was not a double but a small double and the shower was tiny As a deluxe double room we expected at least a double bed to be honest , Hotel stay was good value for money room was clean and hotel had a lovely smell Staff were wonderful 
213287,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was tiny as noted by others To get to the closet I had to cross over the bed Placed my regular size suitcase on the desk as I could not open it on the floor However bathroom was quite adequate For 2 nights close to Paddington to get to Heathrow Express it was a bargain , Good price clean quite easy to adjust the thermostat quick elevators staff fine 
213288,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, N A, Comfortable beds good hot breakfast all good Too many people know about this it will be harder to book a room Staff is very friendly and helpful 
213289,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel is very quiet despite being in a central location The room was more spacious and much more comfortable than I expected and the coffee tea facilities in the room were plentiful 
213290,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, A bit of noise from the corridor early in the morning as the room was next to a janitorial office , Close to Paddington Comfortable modern room with enough space for a short visit to London Reception staff very friendly and helpful Room was ready even though I arrived early 
213291,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Absolutely ZERO customer service No help with bags Rooms are small and the housekeeping staff did the minimal amount of work that needed to happen Tiny elevator that can have you waiting up to 10 minutes just to grab a space Usually I am not too picky but so many things were off with this place don t even bother And it is not cheap , Location was the only good thing about this venue Close to Paddington Train Tube 5 minute walk The breakfast is ok 
213292,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Disappointing Toilet would not flush properly and the air con machine was blowing in a disgusting smell We complained the following morning Not worth the money , The room was a decent enough size clean
213293,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Staff on the desk surly not helpful initially Being told that Deluxe room means ordinary standard means ordinary deluxe should be better than ordinary The 1st room was tiny and we could barely move in it couldn t open bathroom door without moving desk chair bed was smaller than a double as pillows were hanging off each side 2nd room had slightly more room to stand up due to stairs Being told at the desk that breakfast wasn t included when I had paid for it and it said so on my booking confirmation surly woman continued to argue with me 2 tissues in the dispenser Being told again at breakfast that I hadn t paid for it having to stand and wait while staff member went to check with front desk, Comfortable bed Good choice at breakfast polite staff Baggage attendant very courteous and helpful
213294,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, to whom concern i have booked the hotel in london through your website by master card you withdraw 113 bounds from my account but the hotel they didnt able to take the rest of the money through my master card so they took the total amount of the price of booking and they didnt exclude the amount that you withdrew from my account now i need my money that i gave it to you becuse it was not included with the price of booking Thanks in advance Regards naflah,No Positive
213295,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very very small single room Ok for a night but just be aware Staff at reception barely speaking English and slightly rude, Very clean hotel and rooms Nice staff at breakfast Lots of fresh fruits at breakfast
213296,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room onto of u is always super noisy thin walls and everything outside ur room is happening in urs You wake up super early from the noise , Amazing super friendly front reception staff
213297,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, It was quite pricey and when we arrived we were told the price didn t include breakfast which was annoying so had to pay additional for breakfast, Bed was huge The complimentary snacks and drinks were a nice touch and magazines Staff were helpful and the breakfast was amazing plentiful and good choice 
213298,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Rooms are smallllllll Rooms are the size of the bed where there is no space to open your bag or to walk bed side Old furniture small bed , Good things are location elevator clean rooms and hall way Hotel staff were helpful and nice 
213299,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Could have been a magnifying mirror in the bathroom for ladies to apply their makeup better , Proximity to Hyde Park and a superb pub opposite called THE MONKEY PUZZLE 
213300,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Walls were paper thin and none of the doors in the hotel appear to have soft close installed so the entire week was spent listening to doors slam throughout the night and from early in the morning This caused the teacup to rattle on the saucer which woke me up with a start The room was quite dark with only 3 spotlights providing lighting 2 of which were directly over the bed and therefore blinded you first thing in the morning Electrics were quite dodgy as using the dimmer caused a lot of flickering and sometimes the lights went off altogether Shower cubicle extremely cramped so not at all suitable for the more heavyset individual , Close to the train station as well as restaurants and pubs around Paddington I had minimal interaction with the staff checking in and out only but when I did they were friendly Good WiFi 
213301,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The wallpaper and headboard were stained and marked It is on a busy road with traffic and emergency vehicles through the night The doors to all the guest rooms bang everytime someone comes in or out so I was woken through the night until 3am with people coming and going The pillows were like rocks even leaving one soft or feather pillow in the wardrobe would be a good idea There was no pen I eventually found a tiny pencil but this was no good for the work I needed to do surely a biro of some description isn t too much of an expense , The room was adequate for a single The bathroom was clean and smart 
213302,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The hotel was under renovation and we were not inform of this No access to club lounge Woken early each morning by builders banging and crash about The bathroom was falling to pieces and mouldy plus shower head unstable and not fit for use water was spraying everywhere Very limited wardrobe space not enough for two adults Fridge broken Iron facilities rubbish We had a club room and expected much more and in reality it was very basic double room Zero room service had to get take away from outside each day Few freebies of an apple and orange does not make it a club room and 4 star Hotel , location
213303,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, N A, Staff were very curtious it was my birthday and they spoilt me with deliocious chocolates fruit basket and a super happy birthday display out of petals was on the bed That made my stay extra special X
213304,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The construction work was disturbing me and the road was very noisy , The bed was comfortable and the free WiFi was a great bonus Staff were very friendly and helpful 
213305,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, Brilliant stay Literally a 5 minute walk from Paddington station Friendly staff lovely room spotlessly clean Comfy bed Would definitely stay again 
213306,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Can hear sound coming from next door and thumping noise from upstairs Probably because it s from bad soundproofing Thankfully we were out most of the time and only came back to hotel to sleep , Location is great near to Paddington station The doorman is wonderful always greeted us with big smile but I forgot his name 
213307,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We were in room 816 which was in the basement so not much of a view Also the room we had was far too small for twin beds no room for cases and so the bathroom door only half opened against one of the beds so you had to sidestep into it Lucky we are both fairly slim , Good location
213308,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We were woken up in the morning by loud banging noises Apparently they are having refurbishments which nobody told us when we were booking nor did they tell us at check in They apologised the next morning but only after we called down to complain and offered a 15 discount but by then the damage was done Not a great way to spend our anniversary to be honest , Room was nice and clean as was the bathroom We were left chocolates on the bed and towel swans which was a nice touch Great location very close to Paddington tube station 
213309,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, When we arrived at the hotel we found it was being refurbished and our rooms were no longer available which is something you normal contact someone about if you then have a change of plans However by looking at the hotel and the greeting of the staff anything could be better they moved us across the road at park grand where it was lovely but I just don t understand why no cantact had been made to tell us we were being moved ,No Positive
213310,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Building work Told on check in there may be some minor disturbance that pm but started again before 8am the following morning It was not minor works either It was right next door to my room ,No Positive
213311,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Mattress was old big dent in the middle which gives you a backache When the neighbour took a shower it sounded like it was raining inside my room Free mobile was promoted to be available for use calls 4G but battery was broken and by the time it was fixed I was checking out , Great location close to tube train and bus Good breakfast New bathroom 
213312,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Dirty toilet in room on arrival like the worst kind of dirty Room size was rediculously tiny and I m a small woman Had to move the chair away from the desk in order to be able to open the bathroom door Wasn t exactly blown away by the customer service , Good location in terms of proximity to Paddington station 
213313,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There were a few flight of stairs to the room though it was on the 2nd floor and the corridor to the room was narrow , The location was great few walks away from the Paddington Rail Metro Station the staffs were all welcoming and check in and check out process was simple and prompt The room was the same as the picture advertised Generally our stay was pleasant 
213314,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, This hotel was booked as it is advertised as having car parking facility only to arrive and find that the facility is not available and wont be available to guests until after September 2017 this is because they are having renovations done on the property and are concerned that there could been falling debris masonry onto parked cars although there is no restriction on pedestrians in the exact area when questioned are you not concerned about debris falling on people more than on a car that can be repaired there was little response clearly a major health and safety issue As parking was the key factor we did not stay and moved to an hotel across the road , Nothing as didn t stay due to the reasons outlined in what didn t you like 
213315,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Hoping I got the worst room because if they were all like this I d be surprised Was in the basement at the end of a corridor past all other rooms and signs down some more steps and round a corner Was v cold down there window didn t shut properly wallpaper was damp bubbled and patched up not what I would expect from what claimed to be a 4star hotel Felt like they decided that as I d booked cheap they would give me a truly rubbish room , Bed was comfy
213316,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room if you could call it that was way to small No room for large luggage had to put thee chair on the bed to get to the bathroom Room crappie indeed , Staff very friendly and created a great atmosphere Bed excellent 
213317,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Building work meant sleeping during working hours wasn t possible due to the noise which was unfortunate as we were tired and jet lagged after a long flight, Comfortable and quiet at night at least 
213318,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Noisy the room isn t comfy to stay in Noise has been experienced from cleaning staff chatting with each other loudly they didn t consider guests I can see that a number of guests are complaining about this issue as well I ve reported this issue to the reception as well , Facilities available cleanness of the property 
213319,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was very small to be called a deluxe double To draw the curtains one had to squeeze past the end of the bed a gap of a few inches and bend at the same time to avoid hitting ones head on the TV , The room was exceptionally clean and the location excellent A tree lined road which was very pleasant and the property was set back from the traffic noise 
213320,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Scaffolding outside of window woken up at 7 45 both mornings wasn t informed of work until upon arrival no refund and no compensation poor customer service would not recommend, Area was nice That s it
213321,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very small room 160 a night excluding breakfast is not good value in my opinion, Stayed here as it was near Paddington station Hotel is in a lovely quiet location At check in we were upgraded to a double room This rooms are very small and in the basement Which meant that I was awoken by delivery drivers at 6 00am 
213322,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, this was our 3rd visit to this hotel and sadly had it been our first visit it would of been our last Our 1st visit we were told on arrival we were being moved to their sister hotel due to ongoing building work 2nd visit was fine and we were unaffected by the continued refurbishment and were informed by the manager that we would experience a fantastic 5 service on our return sadly that wasn t the case due to the work still being carried out and the noise levels first thing were awful on the 5th floor the entrance exit to the lift also on the 5th floor had a loft ladder in front of it so caused a bit of an obstacle with our luggage if we had been aware of this building work at the time of booking we would of avoided but this was the 3rd time with no mention of the refurbishment until you arrive and see the signs in the lift , Nice and close to Paddington station 
213323,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I was transferred to the Grand Park Hotel as Shaftesbury is undergoing construction The hotel is not so far from the original hotel and they provided complimentary breakfast to make up for the unexpected transfer so i think it was fine However i was disappointed how small the room is I booked for a Deluxe Single Room from Shaftesbury but i feel that this one is really small , Great location Free breakfast
213324,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, When I arrived at 1130pm I was told I had been booked into their sister hotel and when I complained they then gave me a room in the hotel but someone had been smoking in it so I had no choice but to complain I was the Told they would order me a taxi to the sister hotel so I waited for five minutes but then I was offered a room just off the lobby which was fine although noisy because of its proximity to the lobby , Close to station
213325,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was too small furnitures were a bit yoo old, The location is good Very convenient to go to the train and underground station Also very close to the Hyde Park There are also good restaurants near by 
213326,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I should have been informed at the time i booked the hotel that Contractors were undertaken major works to the property and the noise and disturbances that they caused Workers were turning up very early morning as early as 6 15am and with the banging of vehicle and site office doors it disturbed my sleep A compensation ought to have been given for the upheaval Make sure that if I do decide to stay again no workmen of any sort will be present , The breakfasts were very good and the beds were very comfortable and the housekeeping well managed The staff were excellent and very polite and courteous Would stay again but not while contractors are working on site 
213327,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Language barrier with reception staff and not helpful No previous warning of the big renovation going on at hotel which we were told will be going on for next couple of months I don t mind a small room but this was basically a single with two beds pushed in hardly any floor space to move around Not able to open bathroom door more than half way as the beds were in the way and low ceiling Would have been totally unsuitable for a large person I sent an email to the central booking team on our return and nearly a week later have not even recieved an acknowledgement back General impression is they couldn t care less once they have your money , Set back off road so quiet Bed very comfortable and nice modern bathroom with plenty of toiletries 
213328,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The first room we were given which was meant to be a deluxe double was a small single room with a double bed Rooms were advertised a lot bigger on web site Moved to a slightly bigger room after complaining but not until second day Bathroom was smallest I have ever seen Hotel was a building site with top three floors under renovation This was not mentioned at time of booking Bar was just a set of chairs in a hallway Not offered breakfast although would not have taken , The air conditioning and the location The staff at reception were very pleasent 
213329,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Lighting poor in room couldn t operate the lamps Currently have the builders in but noise at a minimum, Bed comfy staff friendly and helpful Nice touch apples at reception
213330,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, We had a call to tell us that we could not be accommodated at this hotel due to building works On arrival we were swiftly taken by taxi to the Shaftesbury Metropole an excellent substitution and courteously accomplished 
213331,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The cost of accommodation in London is always a bit of a shock especially if you haven t been for a while , The location was very convenient for mainline stations and the Tube It was also very convenient for the concert we were going to in Hyde Park 
213332,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, While building work is going on it wasn t easy to see the hotel name , The fresh flowers were a lovely touch and there were plenty of tea coffee biscuits and bottled water The room was really quiet and we both slept well 
213333,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There was a construction on street taxi had to drop us off with the luggage a block away Also there was a construction of the front of the building We were given a room in the basement with the window facing front Noise from the both constructions was awful early in the morning the workers who worked on building would get together and talk loudly for hours before even started work Room and bathroom were tiny but this wasn t as bad as the points mentioned above At least the building remodeling or construction had to be disclosed on website , Location close to Kensington park easy to get to the center of London
213334,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Booked a 4 night for my birthday On check in told we had to go to identical sister hotel other side of the road Staff were friendlier there However room was small dark very shabby very dated couldn t walk round bed properly and the tiniest bathroom I have ever see Breakfast was so so but foot cold on third morning Restaurant staff were friendly and helpful tho unlike the reception staff at the Shaftesbury Very disappointed ended up checking out on the day of my birthday Definitely wouldn t recommend it, Location
213335,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I have just returned after a 2 night stay in June 2017 There is nothing advertised when booking to say they are renovating floors 3 4 5 It was booked for a special occasion so this was really disappointing There was scaffolding on the front and back of the building with building work from 8am to 6pm Although you could hear them in the room above us from 7 30am Was just a shame as it was a special occasion to find surprise building work think it would be polite to let people know before they arrive , We pre booked breakfast for 9 95 the day before and it was reasonably priced for a cooked buffet breakfast and continental buffet breakfast Room was comfortable with a bath in the bathroom Also a microwave and fridge if you would like to use them A free in room safe ironing board iron dressing gown and slippers and a hair dryer were all good features 
213336,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The place should be close to do the repairs Otherwise is False advertising This place cannot be four stars today , The place is under construction They listed parking in booking com website but the parking is five blocks away from the hotel No bar available 
213337,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I had no water in the stay and the water was dirty which meant I had shower in freezing cold water and had to clean my teeth with bottled water They still charged full price and 24 hrs later have had no contact that they expect to do anything about it ,No Positive
213338,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I was most disappointed with the Hotel it is undergoing major refurbishment had we known we would not have booked we have stayed previously in a Hotel that was undergoing a refurbishment we should have been told about this and been given the opportunity to book a different hotel and if the room was a Deluxe Double I m at a loss to see why The room was very small you had to edge sideways to get between the bed and the wall to get from the door to the hanging space for our clothes and as for the bathroom apologies for getting personal but you could not sit on the toilet properly as it was too close to the wall in front of you The corridor our room was in room 005 ground floor had been blocked off just passed it so the chambermaids trolley and the dirty washing was right outside of the door and it appeared that there was a smoking area in the street outside of the window as regularly workers were there smoking I cannot see how this warrants 4 status We would not stay again at this hotel, Location as it was close to Paddington Station
213339,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, bathrooms were very small in comparison to the room size no floor space which made it difficult getting in and out of the bath shower single rooms had no windows to open for fresh air , beds were really comfortable and the little extra s in the deluxe room were a nice touch Very near Paddington Station
213340,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Sleeping in the basement and the room looked like nothing in the pictures Having scaffold outside and not being told it was being renovated, Nothing
213341,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, When we arrived we were told that we could not have the room we had booked as the top three floors were undergoing refurbishment we were offered another hotel but this was not convenient We should have been warned about this when booking , Complimentary breakfast but only after some haggling 
213342,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There were renovations being carried out but we actually didn t hear too much Will be spectacular when it is all completed , Top location Spacious room Very comfy bed Fantastic breakfast
213343,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room could be alot bigger as it wad difficult for my husband and I to move around in the room , The staff there was nice especially the breakfast ladies that was working the dining room and the baggage boy ras very helpful and kind 
213344,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Being woken before 8am by banging drilling and scaffolding work We never checked in until gone midnight and were looking forward to sleeping in until at least 10 30 this didn t happen We checked out early and left I did politely complain to reception and was told I should have rang down at 8 am and complained then We are not happy customers , Helpful courteous reception staff
213345,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There was construction going on all around the hotel when I arrived The staff felt like they didn t really acknowledge me at all when I arrived and were far too busy in conversation with each other The room itself stank of dampness and smoke and the corridors we literally taped up with water running down the walls Overall a very poor experience will not be returning , The accommodation was very handy for getting to the train station in the morning 
213346,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The single bedroom is really small Missing the mini fridge The shower was very small And the water drain was slow, It s good clean Stuff friendly The breakfast was really good Hyde park walking distance And paddington can get you anywhere in London
213347,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Only one small thing not a complaint but our room had the extractor fan to the kitchen outside our window so at six o clock we knew breakfast was being cooked lol , Staff helpful cleanliness could not have been better infact it is far easiet to say that it was all excellent 
213348,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The building work being carried out and work men at our window in the mornings so couldn t shower on last day as they could see straight in as nothing at the window, Staff friendly
213349,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was a bit small and the lights in the room can be brighter, Excellent location nice breakfast helpful staff nice room the room was well equipped everything handy
213350,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The hotel is set back from the main road and is having some improvements There was scaffolding outside completely obliterating the signage It needs a temporary sign so that guests dont miss it The standard rooms we saw looked very small , The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful We were given and upgraded room which was well appointed but a bit dark It was very quiet and an ideal location for Paddington Station as it is only a few minutes to walk Reception is a very small area but having negotiated a slightly later check out we were able to sit there and read the papers before we left for our function 
213351,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Our room is on basement very dark and uncomfortable Hotel is in decoration so that hard to find it No breakfast, The location is very good Close to Paddington station
213352,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was tiny supposed to be a deluxe double It was in the basement so very dark and warm Could not open the windows as people were smoking outside all the time Was very noisy was woken up both days at 4 30 am There was building work going on wish I had been told as I would have cancelled Will not return , Good location
213353,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, THE ROOM IS INCREDIBLY SMALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FOOT OF THE BED AND THE WALL IS APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES AND IF YOU WANT TO REACH THE WINDOW OR USE THE TELEPHONE WITHOUT SCRAMBLING OVER THE BED YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THIS NARROW PASSAGE I HAD ONLY A HOLDALL AND WAS ABLE TO DEPOSIT THIS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED NARROW SPACE THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITH A LARGE SUITCASE AND I AM AT A LOSS AS TO WHERE ONE COULD DEPOSIT A LARGE SUITCASE LET ALONE MORE THAN ONE LARGE SUIITCASE EXCEPT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR WHICH WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE At 156 I consider that the room was EXTREMELY overpriced , The only things I can say in its favour is that it is reasonably near Paddington station and it was quiet
213354,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bed uncomfortable bathroom minute and could only switch bathroom light on if main lights were on so using bathroom at night woke partner up as well coz had to switch on main light, Plenty of choice at breakfast
213355,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I don t like the single rooms they are way to small to move around I wouldn t mind deals 30 40 off when I stay as a loyal customer , The staff are always courteous and excellent in their service I choose to stay here now because of how the staff interact and the rooms are great 
213356,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room size really small for what we paid bed also very small for two people bathroom had to squeeze in past a chair small again inside the bathroom , In a good area near public transport into London
213357,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Lighting in the room was a little bit weak not really a big problem though Also there was a smell in the bathroom probably from the drains which wasn t too pleasant but nothing that spoilt the comfort of our stay , Everything was very good especially the food available at breakfast All the staff were very polite friendly helpful and efficient 
213358,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Deluxe Double Room was just large enough for the bed so that it was impossible to use it properly with two people having luggage We could not open two suitcases at the same time ,No Positive
213359,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, When we arrived the entire hotel was clad in scaffolding At the front desk I asked if our room was free of scaffolding and was told that the only rooms open were in the basement There was no mention of this on Viking com or the hotel website which is pretty outrageous The room was built under the pavement in front of the hotel and had a small frosted glass window looking out except you couldn t look out onto some kind of store room hard to tell Almost no natural light in the room People talked just outside the window evening in the middle of the night possibly staff having a cigarette break The room itself was very small for the 228 charged for the one night The hot water took ages to heat up The cold water tap ran warm for ages The air conditioning unit rattled No breakfast included in the 228 The front desk apologised for the building work when I first arrived and asked about having a room without scaffolding I pointed out there was no note about the construction work when I looked and booked online He said customers who rang were informed but most people book online Clearly I would not have booked this hotel in this state if I had known and I regard the lack of warning as extremely bad trading practice , We chose this hotel because we needed to be near Paddington station We booked a deluxe twin on the basis of photos on booking com and the hotel website The rooms are well fitted out 
213360,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, 1 Star is more than enough for this hotel We arrived me and my husband around 1am and hadnt be late we were to leave to another hotel The second we opened the door it stank of mold and dirt Room 103 hadnt been cleaned for decades everything stank even the bed sheets there were fliplops on the floor from previous guest and floor was covered with white bits The biggest surprise was the Filthy bathroom where there was urine spots on the stool Floor dirty and shower all stained we ended up sitting the rest of the night we couldnt touch anything didnt even take our shoes off Simply Disgusting , Nothing
213361,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Wasn t warned at head of arriving or at time of booking of the on going remodeling and construction at the property Noise started every moring a 8 am sharp and made sleeping in impossible , Breakfast included with room was fair and tasty Clean rooms and comfy beds 
213362,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I have stayed at the hotel from 5th to 7th of May Despite the hotel being very nice with a comfy bed v good breakfast nice location the whole experience was disappointing On my arrival after 19 30 I was told that the hotel undergoes refurbishment and that they have to accommodate all the guest at another hotel just cross the road I was offered to pay straight away after what I was accompanied to another hotel I refused to pay and chose to see the room at another hotel first After I checked the room I immediately realised this is not the category of the room I paid for first thing which I confirmed after checking the rates on the booking com webpage After long telephone discussions of a very friendly receptionist from this alternative hotel I was sent back to where I started And surprise They do accommodate all guests despite the refurbishment I was upgraded to the room of the next category in the end and received a bottle of wine But the aftertaste after these tricks of the personnel is highly unpleasant, clean comfortable bed very good breakfast conveniently located close to Paddington 
213363,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The is currently renovation work being undertaken at hotel Noisy building site noises form 8am to 6pm Outside of hotel as scaffolding had to keep rooms curtains closed for privacy from builders Avoid hotel May 2017 3 night stay, Room and staff 
213364,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Staff were sometimes difficult to understand You had to pre book breakfast the night before to get it at a reduced rate Odd , The hotel was quiet and comfortable and adequate for our one night stay
213365,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel was great and its location within 3 blocks of Paddington Station was a real plus when you re schlepping luggage from the station to where you re staying It was on a very pretty and quiet area and convenient for using the Tube at Paddington to access other parts of town 
213366,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Breakfast good Didn t feel so comfortable with staff there , Single room was cute and comfortable Clean Staff very welcoming really good introduction to the hotel Room quiet Hotel very close to Paddington 
213367,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, No refrigerator in room even though it s rated 4 stars Maybe that s the new thing thought it was odd though , The bed was soooooo comfortable I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow And lovely and close to hyde park to go for a walk each morning Loved it would stay again 
213368,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The hotel was cramped and claustrophobic There was practically no space in the room to work The bathroom was tiny and we both had difficulty using the shower because we had to step over the toilet bowl to get through the door There was little space shelf to put soap and razors Flannels were not provided which is unusual in a modern hotel these days, It was very close to Paddington station where I had to catch an early train This saved me from getting up in the middle of the night
213369,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rude and unhelpful staff The fact that there was no manager present until I mentioned the bad review I was going to give them And that they charged us 344 for a 226 room Also the room we booked wasn t available due to refurbishment but we were only made aware of this on arrival and me and my female friend had to settle for a double room to avoid us having to travel even further and miss our appointment , Not much
213370,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Many broken things in the bathroom the heater was not working for the first 4 hours of my check in I spoke many as I was really feeling cold the electricity went down and the telephone as well in the 2nd day Lift had broken for 1 day after all this they bring maintenance team to work on floor just next to my room I spent my time in cold weather rather than sitting having headache, The Location is the Only benefit in this Hotel staff is welcoming
213371,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Building work started at 8 We were out late so didn t go to breakfast till 9 15 and was last ones felt in the way as they were clearing up around us Breakfast served till 10 Radiator didn t come on so we had to put air con on high to warm up Room dark Bathroom tiny I assumed it was not their best room as we did it through yourselves so paid cheaper price Only for 1 night so didn t complain any longer I would have, Early check in 
213372,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The fact that I had booked this hotel in January and asked for quiet adjoining rooms with good views and we didn t get any of theses Instead We got one room in the basement witch was very dark as it had a very small obscure window witch looked out on to the bin area that accounted for the smell Witch wafted around the area outside our room this is were the staff had there break who were all very noisy talking late at night I phoned reception to complain about the noise it took them 5 min to answer the phone in witch he left me hanging on the line while he went to tell them to be quiet We could still hear them after he told them to be quiet only they had lowered there voices my daughter was running the London marathon the next day and needed her rest that is why I asked for a quiet room My sister in laws room was much brighter with patio doors witch were a joke as they should of led onto a patio area but there was huge tanks and pipes every were why they would have these doors in this room when you can t even go out side So much for asking for a room with a view Also the next morning I asked if there was a courtesy room for my daughter to use after the marathon to take a shower but they said they didn t have one most hotels do have courtesy rooms not good Will I be returing to the shafsbury hotel no way , The beds were comfy But need to get softer pillows 
213373,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room is tiny We requested for 2 single beds and it was pushed together and the toilet door can hardly open The matteress is terrible too soft , Location near train station
213374,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bottled water on first day only of a three night stay Should have been provided on all nights Water in bathroom taps was warm from both so difficult to brush teeth Room in basement so limited light , Good location Staff very nice Very clean
213375,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I stayed in the room opposite reception and could heat the coming and going of all guests bantering of the receptionists , The location is excellent right by Hyde park and ten minutes walk to Bayswater twenty to portobello market
213376,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I loved my room it was cozy however I did not fit in the shower stall I am broad shouldered and 6 1 tall and I could not even bend over to reach the shampoo bottle Since I spent all day sightseeing I was not that concerned about it had I stayed longer I would have absolutely requested another room , The place was well kept although somewhat dated 
213377,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The lady staffs at the reception are not very friendly 29th of March 1st of April But the porters are very friendly especially the one that greeted us with smile and hello on the evening of the 29th of March around 7 8 pm He helped with all our big luggages from the infront of the hotel to the lobby , Beautiful London building and not far from the Paddington Railway Station and Paddington underground station Good for us from the Heathrow Airport by Heathrow Express Peaceful and quiet We leisurely walked from the hotel to Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and Oxford Street Even the stop for London double decker big bus tour is not far from the hotel Many halal restaurants and gift shops nearby Small room but okay and comfortable Nice decor and I like that our room facing the beautiful quiet road 
213378,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We had to b moved because of a very bad sewerage smell so bad could not stay in room staff brilliant swapped our room went to new room and no heaters work because we were in the basement it was freezing cold after a while we were eventually giving a portable heater again staff brilliant but facilities not so , The bed was comfortable And staff very good

213382,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I stayed in single room at basement I was given a room with no direct access of sunlight so I couldn t enjoy the sunrise set and had to switch on the light at all time , Bed was really cozy and comfy I slept well for my 3 night s stay at this hotel The staff were friendly hotel is at good location convenient of 3 4 minutes walk to Paddington station direct train to Heathrow book early can get discount and access to tube Circle District and Bakerloo line 
213383,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was tiny We couldn t fit around the side of the bed so we had to climb in from the bottom There was a funny smell in the bathroom It was also very noisy Although central I wouldn t stay here again and definitely would not recommend it for friends , Location was good 
213384,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was very small for what was supposed to be a double deluxe room also we were moved to a sister hotel because of rennovations being done which was a little inconvient, The staff were very helpful and could not of been nicer
213385,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very small bed in a pokey room you had to climb over the bed to get to the other side This is not a double room Breakfast looked very good but was only just warm where the mushrooms and bacon coated in something sweet , Close to Paddington Station Shower room was very good 
213386,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Plumbing needs improvement Upper floors are noisy they are doing refurbishment Housekeeping doesn t keep water in the rooms , Staff pay attention to help you out when things are needed to be done Location is awesome
213387,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The plumbing can be drastically improved but I believe they r working on it , Honestly what I love the most about this hotel are the staff they go above and beyond their duty to make you comfortable and at home Ms Olesea from reception was absolutely remarkable at accommodating me in the best room for my needs It really helped color a great stay The beds are super comfortable and the room is spacious compared to London standards I definitely advice of this hotel It is right around the corner from Paddington 
213388,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms were shabby and worn the single room was very small They are having a refurbishment so there was a little noise The room was dark and drab, The breakfast was good but you have to pay
213389,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, First room we were allocated had no window even though I d asked for a room with a view at booking stage One of the reception staff Alice was extremely rude when we requested a room transfer , Good location Clean room Club room we were eventually transferred to was nice Fatima at reception desk was very helpful and pleasant 
213390,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, When we arrived we were told we weren t staying at the hotel and that they d called me and informed me No they never I was really annoyed We had to check in there and a chap took our two bags up Westbourne Terrace and across the road to an entirely different hotel Due to building works apparently Had booked luxury rooms at the booked hotel had little more than broom closets in the alternative offered if we hadn t been rushing to get out for the theatre wouldn t have stayed Our two single rooms were so small they didn t even have a bedside table and that was for my Mums birthday Mothers Day treat sorry Mum Refund please ,No Positive

213778,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I have never stayed in such a small room glad we only had 1 small overnight bag as you would not have been able to fit two suitcases in it let alone open them The shower was like standing in a upright coffin it was that small I couldn t raise my arms up to wash hair and to open and shut the shower door required contortionist skills Don t even think about dropping the soap There was a very peculiar smell and the window was damaged and wouldn t close tight or lock with a communal balcony this made us feel vulnerable If this was the deluxe room , Location was good Staff were pleasant Good wifi

213783,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Pictures of the room are very deceiving Payed extra for a club room but it was really not worth it Shower head was broken and only had half of the facilities in our room that was in the description All in all do not feel it was worth the money , Bed was very comfy

213793,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, when i got there i was informed that i would stay at the opposite building GRAND PARK My room was on the 7th floor but there wasnt any elevator from the 6th floor It was a bit exhausted , the location was perfect
213794,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The fuse blew when we turned on the extracter fan in the bath room but we reported it as it was when we where checking out, The room was very cosy and the staff where more than helpful
213795,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bedroom was directly next door to the front door so you heard everyone coming in at all hours then there was another door leading to the other ground floor rooms so everyone had to walk past me and about six feet from my room was the lift so people congregated outside my bedroom door waiting for the lift I have never stayed in such a poorly located room DO NOT stay in room 2, location
213796,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I came out with a bad red rash all over my body due to the shower gel provided in the bathroom Very inconvenient while travelling Also room was TINY I was travelling alone so more than one person wouldnt not fit in the double room , Friendly staff and clean 
213797,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The double bed was two singles pushed together so there was a hole in the middle if you laid there and it wasn t very comfortable There was no plug in the bathroom so bath wasn t possible , Everything you needed Lovely receptionists and the kitchen was well organised and breakfast didn t disappoint any of the 3 mornings Fab location and value for money the best hotel I ve ever stayed in Will definitely return again 
213798,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Seems a bit more run down compared to last time I stayed Carpets with stains in particular Bathroom really small unfortunately as almost everywhere in London , Really close to Paddington at 85 per night for a double was good value

213802,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was small and the bathroom even smaller the photos of the rooms were obviously taken by a wide angle lens to make them look bigger than they actually were I have stayed in lots of hotels when working away and this has to be the worse one yet I was very disappointed because I had arranged this as a surprise weekend away for my wife and I We spent as much time out of the hotel as possible When we arrived on the 22 01 15 We were put in a room where when you opened the door to the room it hit the wardrobe and the toilet door would only open half way before it hit the bed and this was supposed to be a deluxe double Needless to say I will not be staying in the shaftsbury premier in Paddington again As for value for money it wasn t , The location was near to the tube and train station
213803,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Overall I loved everything nothing to complain about , The hotel was very nice fast and professional check in The room was very compact but I really liked it as it was very cosy great price for the hotel would recommend and will be back in near future Hotel has great location roughly 3 mins walking distance to tube station and 10 mins away from London centre

213806,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room was in basement and though clean was very claustrophobic and as the window looked out on to the metal stairs outside I was woken early on Sat morning by people running up and down and shouting morning greetings to each other outside , Clean and convenient
213807,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Booked sister hotel and they moved me to this one and could not use the fitness centre due to different sister holding and was not able to do so disgusting It was further away than 1st booking Not impressed with the service or information actually lack of , breakfast 
213808,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, It doesn t take a minute for the Reception Team to acknowledge the arrival of new guests just a smile and nod by saying I ll be with you shortly and welcome would be more than sufficient , I liked that I was greeted by the concierge upon arrival like a long lost friend I was assigned a Clubroom and it was cosy and clean it even came with a microwave 
213809,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, on arrival our room was located at the back of the hotel and there was no heating on as it was a very cold day it took some time to warm upoverall very good, food was very good
213810,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was literally freezing there was a radiator in the room but no heat Room 006 is on the ground floor there are gaps in the window frames when I complained I was told that the heating would be switched on from reception I had to use an extra blanket and it was not even warm the next morning There are lights outside the hotel which are on all night The curtains in the room do not not fit the bay window therefore there is light shining in the room all night I was compensated by not being charged for breakfast The TV had to be fixed and set up If it s cold don t have room 006 The next morning when I complained a gentleman who said he was the Manager at the desk said he would inform maintenance There was an apology , The location is right and the deal from Booking com was a good at 76 Good breakfast but should be for 9 00
213811,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Booked the shaftesbury but on arrival was told that I would be in the park grand over the road First room awful noisy and cold Was moved to a lower ground room Very grotty with paper thin walls All you can hear is tv s from other rooms and doors slamming Good luck if you want a lie in as the noise starts from 6 am Very small rooms and very shabby i would never stop there again , Very little staff were polite and friendly 
213812,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was tiny and I had to roll over the side of bed just to get to the closet The mattress felt as though you were sleeping on a portable cot It was not comfortable at all Not much space for anything for the price The staff were deceitful in helping me trying to resolve a refund of one night due to the closing of public transportation on Christmas Day and I would not have had a way to get to the airport I did not know this until I came to London They pretended that they spoke with the manager and that the manager so called spoke with Booking Com It was a lie I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone The inconveniece was not worth the price , Location was excellent for accessability That was the only thing I liked about it 
213813,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Air conditioning was broken Automatically paid before starting and forced to sign credit payment My colleague reserved same hotel but 10mimus drive hotel without any information Worst hotel ,No Positive
213814,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The heating wasn t on in the room when we arrived and after telling the staff it was still cold when we came back from our night out The bed sheets were stained and there were no slippers or bathrobes as was advertised when we booked Very disappointed really , Location was pretty good
213815,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, If you park outside the hotel at night it s 20 so best off finding a single yellow line if possible Watch out for the several steps down as you open the door you think it s only going to be one step but it s several Windows weren t double glazed so it s quite noisy if you re staying at the front of the hotel and if you re lucky like my friend was he was approached by 2 prostitutes as he parked up asking if he wanted any company for the night Good to see Paddington still retains its sleazy side , Close to central London
213816,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Our room 020 was tiny and pretty cold Also it was situated beside a giant generator which was noisy The corridor to our room had a funny smell however our room was very clean and didn t smell, I was happy with the location very close to Paddington station The staff were nice Beds were comfy 
213817,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, On my return the second day I was told there was a plumbing problem and I would have to come back later to be moved to a sister hotel Upon my return they told me I had refused to be moved and had found me a room What I got was a really tiny room Very disappointing I travel to London a lot but will likely stay elsewhere Gloucester Road next trip , I stayed on two different nights The first night check in was delayed but I got the room promised and had a great time 
213818,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The 1st room was electric problem and got moved fast Free wifi good breastfast But it s all about a neighbor hood feeling , It s location and the area easy to get from one place to another
213819,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The T V malfunctioned The shower was too small The wardrobe was too close to the door This meant the door could not be opened fully The door would bang against the wardrobe handles , The staff were always courteous and friendly 
213820,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, This was a very late booking done online only 2 3 hours before our arrival at around 10 30pm but I would have expected that once booking was made that our room should have been prepared for us On entering the bottom corridor that led to our ground floor club twin room 018 it felt very cold and unfortunately the room itself was freezing The heating system didn t seem to throuw out any heat when turned on and then we found a plug in oil filled heater radiator which heated up but the room was so cold I wanted to get into bed to get changed The beds too were really cold the room felt like it had not been used in a long time Further evidence of this was a big cobweb coming down from the ceiling and joining to the scatter cushion on my bed So we went to bed very cold and then woke at 4 am as the room was then too warm with the oil heater on so turned it off If the room beds had been warmed and aired prior to arrival I m sure we would have been happy Didn t stay for breakfast so can t give any opinion on food but the staff on reception were curteous and polite and apologised for the complaint about the room temperature when we checked out I should have complained when we first arrived but we were tired from journey and had an early morning start so we probably wrongly just put up with it No view from room in morning we realised that we looked out onto a blind alley we had asked for an upper floor room but as I said it was a late booking , Location easy walking distance to Paddington station underground
213821,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Hmmm Where do I start After trying aimlessly for over an hour to find the hotel which is set back from the road with very little signage we were shown to a tiny room that overlooked an inner air ventilation system I immediately phone the reception to ask if this was actually a Double Deluxe room We were then given another room that was bigger I wondered why we were not given this room in the first place The room was clean but showed a lot of use and could have had a spruce The glass in the bathroom door was so dirty it looked like it needed replacing The rooms are very dark with very little natural light and poor lighting On our first night at 10 30pm we answered our room door to find a member of staff asking if we requested more water We kindly refused 10 minutes later we had a phone call from reception rudely asking us if we had been smoking in our room and blunting and very accusingly stating that we would be fined 200 if we had Then just as blunt and rude the receptionist stated we would be having a room inspection because there was a very strange smell in the corridor I had also noticed the smell on arrival but it was not in relation to our room I was infuriated at this accusation We are a middle aged couple and not some unrespectful party animals After waiting until 11pm for our very unprofessional room inspection I called reception and requested it immediately We had been travelling all day and wanted our sleep Needless to say the terrible smell was not from us But we never got an apology Maybe the unprofessional receptionist and the tired small and dark rooms why you are asked to pay on arrival You may not want to pay on departure , The beds were extremely comfortable and the breakfast was good value as long as you pre book it The public use areas are well kept and waiting staff are very pleasant The hotel is situated about 1 2 mile from the tube station with lots of restaurants and amenities in the area and on a very picturesque and quiet avenue 
213822,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, It would have been great if we had the possibility for late check out with longer than one hour This was extremely useful given that we arrived very late after 23 00 due to blockage on the motorway but an extension with 3 4 hours at no extra cost would have been really great , Very friendly and helpful staff excellent price quality ratio we could park the car in front of the hotel for 24 h for 20 Really useful and very good Internet connection 
213823,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Small shower room too close to front desk therefore a lot of traffic noise from outside nod inside motel Also front light shone into room causing difficulty sleeping , Staff were excellent
213824,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I did find the rooms a little warm even though it was winter An unexplained alarm did go off in my room at midnight , The location was superb Only short walk to Paddington station direct access to Heathrow Express close to restaurants bars and shops The breakfast was great and good value 
213825,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room 007 should be avoided as staff get changed next to this room and are very noisey especially early in morning you can hear everything they say , Location just 2 minutes from station
213826,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Sewer smell last night we were there and fire alarm went off at 10 pm but was turned off in less than a minute, Quiet room and well stocked with coffee tea condiments and cookies
213827,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The size was too small and description was totally not like i got at the site The price was double compared to nearby hotels and the water bottles were only free for the first day so better to book only one night loool, The staff only
213828,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, This is not a high class hotel so don t have high expectations First room we got was too small and definitely not worth 150 a night Hallways are too narrow and it s quite difficult to move around with big luggages, Got upgraded to the clubroom after complaining that our deluxe room is too cramped friendly and accommodating staff
213829,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very small room Not enough space where to put my lagguage and shopping bags , Close to the underground and easy to find Very clean and cosy Good wifi Good tv stations A Good selections of restaurants nearby
213830,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Lack of parking and parking charge Very expensive A very very small bathroom Uncomfortable bed Temperamental remote control for tv, Close to the underground
213831,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Not really that nice triple room had a sofa bed which was very small and disappointing as we expected 3 single beds TV did not work and they could not fix it Very poor lighting in the room Stayed in much nicer for less cost , I suppose it was very close to Paddington
213832,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Asked for assist in transportation and was summoned a private car vs taxi subsequent ride was overpriced Did not receive wake up call Asked for special accommodations wine when I reserved room on line weeks before trip as was last night in London Never acknowledged , Quiet Near Paddington Station

213840,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, All the rest The firat room I booked had an electricity problem So they move me either to the underground floor or ground floor The rooms in general are so so so small I could t walk in the room since you have only 1 square meter free of space to put your bag and move no exageration You can search hotels at leas at three blocks from this hotel You still are very vlose to the station , Location
213841,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Electrics had failed in the room when I arrived back Went to the desk 3 times before they sent someone The porter to look it was a joke looking for my bag and belongings with a lighter , Nice size first room 
213842,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Male receptionist left an unpleasant door I was supposedly upgraded to a Clubroom The room had the creekest floorboards Luckily I was staying alone There was a sound that was vibrating violently above the bed from the ceiling The staff said it was the main boiler and apologised that there was no room change available Heck down grade me I just want to sleep At midnight I had to play a sound recorded on my mobile and I was reluctantly moved There was another customer complaining It was quiet Floorboard issues again Missing board with carpet over the top This is not a 4 ,No Positive

213854,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Our room was the only one in a vestibule for the elevator and it was frequently quite loud I m sure this is a fire regulation and it was still much better than other comporably priced hotels but get a different room if you can , We booked this hotel at the last minute when our fist hotel turned out to be unacceptable The staff was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage until a new room was available The location can not be beat for sightseeing Several attractions shops restaurants and underground stations on various lines are withing walking distance

213866,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The initial room we were placed in would have struggled to accommodate 2 midgets There was a sign on the door mind the step very misleading as there were about 8 steps and a landing before you descended into another level where the bed resided so tight up against the wall who ever was that side who have had to clamber over the other one to visit the toilet which was on the landing half way up the stairs It would have suited single occupancy only and if we had been unable to change rooms we would have left and demanded a refund , The attitude of the manager when it became apparent we were unhappy with the room His staff we new he said but that does not excuse the attempt to justify the difference between the image on the booking form and what we were offered as a camera angle However the problem was rectified quickly and to our satisfaction and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay 
213867,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Everything else It s by far the smallest room I ve been in my life You couldn t open the bathroom door even half way because it got blocked by the bed The same happened with the closet door it got blocked by the room door The staff looked demotivated The shower didn t work properly It was a very poor experience, The location
213868,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, One thing I need to point out the room was NOT cleaned at the moment we checked in There were pizza boxes hidden in the shelf where the microwave was it was very disgusting Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture or file a complain but this is something VERY SERIOUS and MUST be pointed out Access to the room was not easy but understandable , Great location close to Paddington Station The room is a lot larger than other hotels in this area

213902,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I brought my Mum and Dad away and paid for 2 family rooms hoping they d be beside each other They were on different floors It was badly marked on how to get to each room My parents view was a generator that made a drilling noise across the ceiling all night and they had a bad sleep We called a member of staff up to hear how bad the noise was he said he d make a note of it Our room was v cramped you can t open the bathroom door fully because it bangs off the bed , The location was near Paddington station Beautiful building in a lovely location 
213903,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room and bathroom size are a joke I know it s central London but for 110 the room was extremely tiny even though I m not claustrophobic Perhaps suitable for a 5 year old not for adults For example you can barely sit on the toilet between the shower and the wall and if you want to wipe your behind you have to get up turn to 160 degrees put your head in the shower and then go for it Doors on the corridor have poor shutting system and they slam so hard which makes it quite disturbing when other residents keep going in and out , location of the place very close to Paddington stations high speed WiFi air conditioning
213904,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, the size of the room it was so tiny too small the smallest room I have ever seen , The location was good and there was a lot of little restaurants and pubs very close by to have dinner of a night

213909,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The sign to my room says mind the step It should say mind the STEPS Because i went down seven steps Also the shower cubicle is very small I couldnot bend to clean feet Very narrow indeed , Location was good next to paddington train station

213911,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The breakfast was disappointing food had gone hard overcooked sitting on the hot plate It did take a while for us to collect our stored cases which made it tight for our connection back to the airport , It was close to Paddington Station which has good underground links It was helpful being able to leave our cases to enjoy our last day We all enjoyed the free wifi especially our kids 22 18 11 Close to a great cafe Cafe Dylan Dog 
213912,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I had nothing but bad experiences from this place The rooms are so small like my dressing room Nobody can stay n there By far the worst place that I have stayed , Just the staff that was trying to justify how bad this hotel is

213914,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, the room and bathroom is very small that i kept my stuff in my baggage i found a crawling insect in the bathroom , the Location of the Hotel is very special close to the station and many important sightseeing places 
213915,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We had booked two rooms twin deluxe for our teenagers double deluxe for us The twin room was okay The double was truly terrible nothing more than a closet in the basement Two people couldn t fit in without one staying in bed To call this deluxe is horrendous We refused to stay and were promptly moved to a better room and another the next day Hairdryer was missing in both rooms Access to fitness center in nearby hotel as is stated on booking com showed up not to be available the staff looked pretty blank when asked about this We overheard at least five other guest complaints about the room size while we were at this hotel Stay clear unless you are guaranteed a room on an upper floor , Polite service minded staff very helpful Great location two minutes from underground station Good breakfast options in nice pubs nearby didn t try hotel breakfast 
213916,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, on arrival the reception tried to move us to another hotel no rooms left despite having booked this weeks ago for location the room 308 was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in i measured it it was 2m x 2 3m at the bottom of a very steep stairs within the room the shower cubicle was 2ft x 2ft , nothing

213919,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The unfriendly reception staff don t provide all the information on arrival especially important information such as times for breakfast Be advised that the breakfast is only served from 7h00 Unfortunately there was no view as I was in the basement and this was my first Hotel stay in London , The location to paddington station is the only positive aspect 
213920,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Breakfast was not included so we booked it separately for our 2 week stay We ended up not having it for 5 days but we were charged the full amount regardless for two people despite paying for it separately , Great location convenient stay

213922,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms were very small and could be make to feel larger with a different layout I would not recommend it to anyone above 5 56 feet as your head will hit the shower , It s proximity to the airport express at Paddingon is it s redeeming feature 
213923,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The beds are not comfortables in some rooms smells bad in some floors that they shifted us on the rooms are small and not worth the value that is paid for , location
213924,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, 1st The rooms was small and when i came to do check in they told me there is no room available and they took us to other hotel for one night then they give us too small room for a couple and they change it for little big room but still small 2nd there was no fridge in all rooms even there was no water just for first night , Stuff was kind and the rooms was clean
213925,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The double room was rather small with no chairs We could have moved to another but this was too much bother after we had unpacked and slept the first night , Very good location for getting anywhere in London easily The breakfast was good choice and value 
213926,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, very small rooms and bath I ve wrote a special request in the booking for early check in and no one replied then I thought its confirmed when I reached there and it was early morning the receptionist told me Booking com did not forward your note to us , the location is not bad near to the paddington station car parking available ease access to the rooms
213927,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Overpriced for what it is and I think it s to much for this hotel to have four stars One other thing during my stay one day they forgot to clean my room although I put the the sign of Please make up my room on the door in the morning and when i came back in the evening the sign was still on the door and they didn t clean the room so where were the housekeeping and their supervisors to check after them this what they do in four stars hotels , Location 
213928,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Rooms are very small There is a small table and chair and I would like to know how to get to that chair I was in room 002 , From desk staff were helpful 
213929,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room just had sheers for window covering anyone walking down stairs could look directly into your room Only one elevator which the cleaning staff also used, A block away from the Underground Desk staff very helpful

213932,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We was located by the elevator so was very noisy hearing it and people getting in and out But we was soo tired from out days out that it wasn t too much when we nodded off , Amazing room all necessary facilities Staff very helpful and friendly
213933,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The small room size my sister and I stayed in one room The stairs going down to the room itself was an unusual feature we ve never encountered before in any hotel and sometimes became a hindrance , The proximity to Paddington Station the fairly quiet area despite being near several establishments 
213934,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Poor or broken facilities Dinner non existent TV broken and no effort to be mended during our stay Breakfast definitely not worth the extra 10 00 charge food and service Not the service expected from an AA 4 star rated hotel I would definitely not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
213935,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was far too small for 2 people Nowhere to put our luggage and barely any room to move around the bed , Location was good room was clean modern bathroom 
213936,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The mattress was rather poor and the room was a little small however the price I guess reflected this , The staff were attentive and friendly in their manner Just what I want after a long journey Keep it up 
213937,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There was only 18 between the bed and the three walls Very tiny shower even for thin people like us , Great location Very friendly and helpful staff

213939,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room very small Would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues The two way light switch not working Shower cubicle could do with deep clean , No hassle booking in Room ready at 12 pm ease of walk to Paddington Price 
213940,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, As happened when we visited London three years ago we were told on arrival that we needed to be transferred to another hotel obvious that they had overbooked very poor We held our ground late at night after long flights from NZ and were finally placed in a room On returning 3 nights first then 6 nights after a week away we were promised a superior room which did not happen , Handy to Paddington Station hence this selection 
213941,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I was given a room in the basement of the Park hotel which was dark noisy and very small The small window looked out onto a small yard filled with rubbish However the breakfast was adequate and the staff were polite , Nothing I was transferred to the Park Hotel on the other side of the road as I was told there was a problem at the Shaftesbury
213942,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The first room we were allocated was unbelievably small The second was still far too small but at least on the same level as the ensuite and you could just about get out of both sides of the bed It was not as advertised on the booking site by any stretch of the imagination, The staff
213943,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The staff were absolutely excellent very friendly and very helpful The room was very comfortable and facilities excellent The location was also very convenient 
213944,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bathroom is extremely small Men who are a little bigger than the average size will have problems getting in to and out of the shower stall The room is very small Staff is friendly but their knowledge on how to use the metro tube restaurants attractions etc is pretty limited The breakfast is okay You can probably do better eating at nearby cafes , Location
213945,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The breakfast staff were all foreigners who couldn t speak basic English One asian had a scowl on his face and was pacing up and down making me feel uncomfortable I asked for a cafe latte double shot and got a tea pot full of coffee which was milky and only single shot strength , Room was well laid out and big enough for all I wanted it for Front desk staff were extremely helpful and courteous 
213946,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, room was very small although adequate for a short one night stay It would not be suitable or enjoyable for a longer stay I would be disappointed if the visit was for leisure , Desk staff and breakfast staff very helpful good selection of food during breakfast 7am is a rather late opening time for business users 
213947,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room is very small too small to be comfortable hard to find room for an ironing board or to get dressed without getting in each other s way , Good location 
213948,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Disappointed because of the size of the room It was clean in general but had stains all over the carpet Furniture was old and with many skratches The worst and the most disapproved that made me really upset was the fact that money very few euros was removed from my bed side table with out me knowledge or permition by cleaning staff just with an exucuse that they thought it was for tip I am still waiting for a call from the manager regarding this incident I will never go there again Never They are is no trust , Place was very good next to tube station many busses run all time
213949,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, 1 room was very small hardly accommodating two people not able to sit no chair or walk within room to small to get access to tea table space to squeeze in very small 2 room not cleaned after first night no excuse or apologies offer to replace towels at midnight was probably not the best response to my complain Room changed at 1 am a little bigger but still very small, breakfast was ok
213950,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The friendliness of the staff The receptionist printed off routes directions for us of where we wanted to be going to for all the attractions we had booked for 
213951,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room 505 was very small Hardly enough room to turn around I would prefer a bigger room for my next stay 28 September, Friendly staff Great location Good Wi Fi 
213952,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Breakfast not great value A long way down to underground restraurant Would eat out next time Bathroom fitting shabby but Bathroom on the hole good , Staff Location Room great 
213953,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We booked a deluxe double but there was nothing deluxe or double about the room it was too small and was only suitable as a single room too squashed and the bed not big enough for 2 people Bathroom and rooms very dateddated, The location was fab central and close to lots of things to do and see
213954,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, We had a quiet room with everything we needed small fridge tea coffee making facilities etc Great location for arriving and departing London for Heathrow
213955,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was a little small for what we saw on pictures , Its nice quit and clean plus its not in busy area wich i really liked the location was easy to find staff really good 
213956,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was tiny Looking online all the room pictures looked a decent size however I now realise the pictures do not include the deluxe room which I had booked I think this was really misleading , Location was great Only a short walk from the station which suited us perfectly 
213957,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, First bedroom extremely small window looked out onto roof flashing could not walk around bed wardrobe open next to bed so no room for a door Hotel allowed us to move to a slightly bigger room for the rest of our stay at the back of the hotel nice and quiet but bed very small double , Convenience to Paddington and Hyde Park
213958,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bath rooms very small any slightly fat person can not fit in the shower capsule Pictures of the rooms lobby toilets shown at the time of booking does not reflect what is actual size of room and baths It simply misguidesGood , Excellent location Staff well behaved and helpful 
213959,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very disappointed I already requested a room on high floor in advance However got a basement room which is too small for 3 people with poor lighting very dark Have tried to ask for changing the room but the staff told us that they didn t receive my request and no room is available Won t select and recommed this hotel to my friends , None 
213960,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I had actually booked the Paddington hotel however as they were having a maintenance issue I was transferred to this hotel the single room is a little small I m not a large person but still had to enter and exit the shower sideways , The location in Prince s Square is good for both business and leisure alike the staff are extremely helpful I would stay here again although I would try a larger room 
213961,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The heating was stuck on in room and someone had to fix it and asked for upper floor and got put in basement instead , When booking the room it was a deluxe double and the picture showed you the room to be bigger with a sofa and a bath in the bathroom to which partner wanted a nice soak cause don t get time at home with young child online it says rooms have a iron and ironing board to which it didn t
213962,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Rooms are very Tiny its even difficult to move Bathrooms are also tiny I would suggest to install in their bathrooms bidet next to the WC useful Muslim Customers , The staff is very friendly Very Near to Paddington Train station and Edgware Road Wifi is very fast and you can use it in as much devise you want not like other where they limit no of devices 
213963,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, This is never a 4 star hotel The double bed completely filled the room space impossible to walk round 96 night and 15 for breakfast is a rip off They use private hire taxi s at inflated prices when they could easily use black cabs which are constantly driving past their front door , Location is good
213964,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Quite a small room and very tight shower any one on the large would struggle to fit in The balcony doors couldn t be opened which would of been nice , Location was good very clean room 
213965,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We stayed in a deluxe club room so small that it wasn t possible to walk around the bed to the window I had to crawl over my husband , The Paddington Hotel was having a plumbing problem and sent us to their Notting Hill property so the review is for the hotel we actually stayed in They were apologetic about the problem arranged transportation and comped a very nice breakfast The room had a good view and very nice bathroom and I came to love the Notting Hill location 
213966,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I need more space Although this was pleasant for one night with a small amount of luggage and would be excellent for one person it is not big enough for two With only one bedside table and overhead reading lights I realise we shall need to pay more for the amenities we want , The bed was comfortable and the shower excellent Cleanliness was a big plus as was the desk and chair Location is terrific as it is on bus and tube routes and an easy walk to Kensington Gardens and nearby shopping eating areas in Queensway Praed Street and Edgeware Road It is always nice to have free wifi

214493,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was comfortable but bathroom small and badly designed You could sit on the toilet hate to think if you were a larger person in size, Excellent customer service can t fault the duty manager Alisha
214494,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The noise early morning from delivery drivers The windows in the room were extremely draughty thus making the room cold secondary glazing would cure both problems The extra bed blanket was dirty The automated voice on the lift should also be turned off at night as there is no need for it to be on this would make the hotel quieter , The location and the staff who are very helpful 
214495,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Slow service over 30 minutes to check in Basement room moderate condition of the room Expected better service and better room quality for 4 star hotel , Location only 
214496,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was tiny and cramped with a wall blocking out light infront of window We changed 2nd room slightly bigger but too much artificial light from hotel sign so was like day light at night and bathroom tiny 2nd night we were up graded to twin room by manager Slightly better but disappointing for price, The third room
214497,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, the wall paper and some decor could use updating but that doesn t really detract from such a great stay, Paddington is a great central location I knew very little about London but found it easy to get around being close to a tube station that was so well connected to major lines 
214498,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Upon check in I was told that the room I had booked had some issue with electricity hence I had to be transferred to other Shaftesbury hotel Notingham Hill slightly about 5 minutes away by taxi The room I was given had windows facing a big air condition generator which was rather too noisy Luckily due to lack of sleep on the plane I had fallen asleep but was woken up by the not pleasant noise Would definitely ask for a room with windows facing the main street Also shower cube is too little I barely fit in and I am just average 75kg 175cm so bear that in mind if you are bigger built , I was offered free taxi ride to the other hotel and also free breakfast to compensate the fact that I had to be transferred to the other hotel Very pleasant receptionist at Shaftesbury Notting Hill which made all the transfer rather easier
214499,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Doors slamming view from room 12 was lovely of skip from some sort of building work basically not happy, Nothing The bed was little more than a large single and we booked deluxe double I was going to ask to be moved but after reading other reviews decided it was pointless as nothing appeared to get sorted I think it seemed very hit and miss on which room you had as to how good your stay was
214500,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, no power point in bathroom which was difficult to get ready for a female not enough light in the room to do work window was only source of light and it opened on to a roof of some sort where people walked by and could see it room was tiny could barely walk in it No luggage storage options, location and staff and wifi
214501,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We were change to different hotel from one I looked at Bedroom was very small to what I seen on Internet Had to squeeze around the bed to get in the other side Toilet very small Not 5 star , Staff very friendly Breakfast very good Near to every we needed

214509,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was no bigger than my laundry I am 5 2 and slim build and I had to turn sideways to fit between the desk and bedside table There was no where to put my case to easily access its contents I had to leave the bathroom door open so I had enough room to dry off after showering Very poor value for money Would not stay there again The room was so small I am surprised it meets regulation standards , Location and cleanliness

214512,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I thought the bed was horrible I thought the room itself was nice The sheets fell off everynight so i was basically sleeping on the mattress and it wasn t comfy at all a quality fitted sheet would have gone a long long way to making this better for me , The location right around the corner from Paddington station was ideal close to the trains to get around London Breakfast wasn t bad a lot of fruit which is a plus for me

214514,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very basic facilities in a cramped room We over looked the rear and had black net curtains , Nothing in particular Perhaps the surprise of free water bottles

214525,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Due to the age of the building beautiful old place the floors squeak a lot hard to move around without disturbing neighbouring clients When the next door room began making business deals on their phone at 4 30am and we could hear staff were more than happy for us to shift rooms the next night , We needed to change rooms and that was no problem at all reallly quiet spot Staff at breakfast were outstanding Rooms were clean small very functional Perfect for what we needed 
214526,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, They should not allow 2 people to share a double room the bed was too small and there was literally no room to move around even though it was a deluxe They should only offer double rooms to singles and require a queen bed for those sharing a bed We didn t sleep both nights , Nice staff helpful large choice for breakfast
214527,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was very small but it was ok for one night WE struggled opening the window there was something strange about the window But really we loved it, Loved the halls and vibe of the hotel dark wood trim beautiful Very classy and beautiful

214534,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was very small barely wider than the double bed itself I had to kneel on the bed to access the tea and coffee facilities The wardrobe was only about 15cm deep There were two or three steep steps down to the room from the door which could easily catch you out if not concentrating , Convenience for Paddington station
214535,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room had a staircase into it with the bed taking up most of the space in the room We had to stand up our bags to fit them in and it was difficult for two people to move around at once , The location was good being just around the corner from paddington station The hotel is really nicely furnished and very clean

214538,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Hotel got integrity issue Beware what you see is not what you get They show nice photos of the room when you do the biking but in actual fact what you get is not not what they shown on the photos I booked the hotel through booking com but what I got was totally different from what I have booked The room I got was half the size of what they shown on the photos and the room given to me many issues When I asked the staff why I got the room so different from what I have booked the staff didn t apologized instead she made it sounded that I was the one who was being unreasonable She even told me that the room that was given to me was the same as what I has booked At this point I was really angry How could a room that is half the size of what I has booked was the same as what I has booked After much demand they gave me the room which look the next day If you need to book this hotel because of the location my advise is to make sure you get the room that they some on the website I sincere hope is that the management will stop sucj unethical way of getting business Please show the actual room in the website and don t deceive you customers , Location 
214539,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, shower on the small size Breakfast was a bit on the cold side and no fried eggs to go with that English breakfast Hotel parking was 20 per day a little expensive to say your staying at the hotel , Pleasure to stay no noise off busy roads and only round the corner to the tube station Plenty to offer within easy reach 
214540,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Beginning to look a bit shabby I have been staying here for 3 years I like the area and feel the cost isn t prohibitively high however in the time the rooms have been showing considerable wear and the appointments not repaired correctly nor replaced The service is good but not outstanding I have never eaten here so unable to comment One note The toilet seat wasn t firmly attached may be that way for ease of cleaning but almost slipped off as it tried to come off as I was leaning forward a bit disconcerting this may have been in this room only but for an older person may in fact be dangerous I will still stay here in the future but only if the deal is right , Proximity to Paddington 
214541,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room carpet could use some vacuuming Sound of fire alarm went off more than once in the morning although there was no fire It was really disturbing The location was great Five minute walk from Paddington station , Staff were very friendly and helpful I was given a free breakfast during my 10 day stay at the hotel which was very kind The location was great Only a Five minute walk from Paddington station 
214542,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We booked a double deluxe room but when we checked in it was the size of a shoe box nothing like what is advertised on their website We complained at reception and they advised us that was size of all the deluxe double rooms and some of them were even smaller we were then offered a twin bedded room so I politely advised them that I had not come to London for a long weekend to sleep in separate beds After a lot of talking and a phone call to Booking com another receptionist stepped in and advised that there were no other rooms available for that night but if we could stay in that room for the first night she would upgrade us free of charge to a Club Deluxe room for the next two nights and with a complimentary breakfast after our first nights stay We were shown a Club Deluxe Room before we made up our minds surprisingly the room was what we were expecting the Double Deluxe to be So upon returning to reception we agreed that we were happy with that and we were advised just to leave our bag in the room the following morning and they would take it to our new room and that is what they did They also gave us a bottle of red wine and a platter of fruit as an apology But if it hadn t been for the other receptionist stepping in they would have had two very unhappy people , The beds were very comfortable room was clean lovely bed linen 
214543,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Very disappointed with the receptionist as she didn t honor and acknowledge the booking that were properly booked with notes and request Very upset that I need to double my payment on my first day as they did not honor our prior bookings and we lost money on the first day because we have to pay for another night Horrible experience Never never again to this hotel As a traveler Entrepreneur PR and former news anchor I will never ever recommend this hotel Very upset disappointed and stressed I came from a very faraway country just to experience this kind of customer service , Very disappointed with the receptionist as she didn t honor and acknowledge the booking that were properly booked with notes and request Very upset that I need to double my payment on my first day as they did not honor our prior bookings and we lost money on the first day because we have to pay for another night Horrible experience Never never again to this hotel As a traveler Entrepreneur PR and former news anchor I will never ever recommend this hotel Very upset disappointed and stressed I came from a very faraway country just to experience this kind of customer service 
214544,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, This hotel has cheated us We have paid for a double bedroom The bed size is so small that a normal couple cannot fit on it unless they stick to each other sleep This hotel is a fraud Please clarify there has to be a minimum size for a bed to be called a double bed To the best of my knowledge a double bed cannot be less than 5 feet in width We asked the reception for a measuring tape but did not get one Our assumption is that the bed was about 4 4 5 feet in width Our room no was 12 You can send your rep to verify if this can be called a double bed ,No Positive
214545,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Room is very small limited space for doing prayer Bath room s shower size only fit to the body and very difficult to move It is like bath room in the ship , Location close to Paddington station
214546,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, room for two but shower cap and toiletries mostly for one person supplied , Location reliable wifi all parts of the hotel tea and biscuit supply in the room was also a plus good hotel and great location will stay here again
214547,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Good value for the area but I would expect breakfast to be included when paying in excess of 200 for a night Was not even offered the 10 pre ordered option Didn t bother me too much as I had plenty of time to get breakfast somewhere else Main problems were many of the bedrooms along with the bar and restaurant are in the basement My room was below the tied in the front of the hotel it also smelt damp when I arrived I opened the window and put on the bathroom fan to get some fresh air and it soon went I was awoken at 4 30am by staff carrying items up the fire escape outside my window and loading some sort of truck while the staff attempted to be quiet there was little they could do So while it was an ok stay for the money I wouldn t stay again , Nice well located hotel if working around Paddington Friendly staff and very clean 
214548,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, Excellent presentation cleanliness decor and good selection of foods for breakfast friendly welcoming and helpful staff Received an upgrade which was a bonus Great value a quality place would visit again and recommend to others Is in keeping with high standards experienced previously at Best Western hotels

214550,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Would have preferred breakfast included in price, Convenience of location to Heathrow Express connection to Airport Price was very reasonable and room comfortable 
214551,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The breakfast could have been a little better I would have liked a croissant , The room was really small but we had a good deal to stay in London and we were rarely in the room to be fair Very central and close to tubes 
214552,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bar was clinical looking , A very warm welcome by receptionist and smooth checkout Very comfortable bed and good shower We slept well as it was peaceful We would definitely stay there again 
214553,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Nothing really apart from a fried egg with breakfast but everything was great , they were all so helpful pleasant and made our stay great Couldn t fault it 
214554,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room a deluxe double was very small The bedside lamp wasn t working I reported this and it was taken away but not replaced during my stay The bedside table was so small there wasn t much room for it anyway , Great location beside Paddington station Strong wi fi Clean nice shower Helpful staff 
214555,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was terribly small one of the smallest I have had for a couple Could barely move Stay was spoiled by the policy of the hotel and inflexibility as well as the lack of helpfulness of Booking com I had signalled ahead my girlfriend would book in and I would check in and pay the next day When she arrived they demanded full payment there and then which she couldn t meet so she had not choice but to take a separate new booking of a room for one night and cancelled the old booking completely incurring me a one night penalty When I arrived the next day I had to take a brand new booking How insane is that Lost a whole room night in cost but luckily had not made the whole booking a nonrefundable one , It is reasonably clean and well appointed handy location for shops station Heathrow Express and Tube 
214556,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I booked this for my colleagues to go on a recce to London We operate a holiday resort ourselves At check in they were met with having to pay 594 of their own money to the hotel even though I had pre arranged in my special requests for all payments to be taken from my Company Credit card and given my contact details if they needed further information Nobody contacted me from the hotel so we thought all was well They would not refund my colleagues card or take payment over the telephone I was then asked to send a copy of both sides of my credit card A big no no I will be reporting this hotel to the Payment Card Industry as they are definitely non compliant I book many London hotels every year Marble Arch Hilton Langham Shard none of which have treated us in this way , The rooms were comfortable and the service staff friendly Just the Hotel policy that will prevent me from booking this hotel again No good for business use 
214557,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms I ve been staying in the last 2 times have been super tiny for 2 people travelling from the U S with large suite cases to actually stay in comfortably At one point my boyfriend and I had to stack our suite cases on top of each other to have enough room to get from the bed to the bathroom and we re not large people at all , Location of the hotel is super convenient to the rest of London I have been travelling to London more for work and find that this location is convenient because it s located close to Paddington Station which allows me to get to the other offices in Reading and Plymouth with little effort The surrounding area is very convenient for food pubs walk to Hyde Park 
214558,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I didn t stay here they switched me to the one across the road Park Grand London Hyde Park I wasn t too fussed but I could see that annoying some They re under the same umbrella though Shaftesbury I stayed a few weeks folks and it s a 5 min walk from Paddington station so I was thinking good base and it s so easy to get to I stayed in a deluxe single room now yes it s small but I m not a big person so it was fine for me Bed was comfy and the TV was in a good spot on the wall opposite Bathroom is tinyyyyy the shower is very narrow but great pressure I grew used to it but ended up leaving the bathroom door open every time I showered just me so it didn t matter Criticism would be no shelf for your toiletries there is one directly above the toilet but that s just odd There s no iron or hairdresser in the room and the bar fridge concealed in the desk isn t plugged in The lifts didn t go to my room so it was up two very narrow staircases to it The porter took my case up and down upon check out as it was 25kg and I would ve struggled Put bluntly a massive unit wouldn t do so well in a single room from my understanding the rooms aren t that big anyway but maybe pick a double incase There was room for my suitcase near the desk and I just shoved any shopping or my backpack in front of the window The doors are so loud when they shut Only annoyed me on my last two nights due to new next door neighbours constantly slamming theirs at night The corridors smelt a bit musty but it s an old hotel done up not too badly Overall it wasn t too bad I could see people bulking at the size it is essentially a biggish shoe box but was still doable when I was able to catch up with my man for a few hours haha It ain t 4 stars though No way But hardly a hovel , Comfy bed Good tv Staff made up rooms every day and always replaced linen Porters very helpful So close to Paddington station Hyde Park Kensington Gardens I even walked to Harrods in Knightsbridge Air con unit right above your bed good if you like a fan noise to fall asleep useful in blocking out neighbouring noise 
214559,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Bathroom was almost unusably small You could hardly turn inside No minibar no food to order as roomservice except a pizza delivery that was almost uneatable Hotel OK but property surrounding was run down not refurbished for decades Not 4 maybe 3 , Staff was always helpful Basics clean and room well serviced everyday 
214560,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, nothing that we didnt expect it is not a four or five star establishment and it doesnt pretend that more than budget hotel quaint and just fine would definetely go back, very close once you find the exit from Paddington Station unpretentious outside but inside small lobby rooms were small its London but not too tiny but pretty nice classic dark mahogani style wood beds were soft bit still surprisingly comfortable we slept well Breakfast had a good selection and thought its worth it clean rooms and friendly staff
214561,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The shower was too small Any one size XXL or over would simply not fit in it , The bed was comfortable and all though the room had good standard it was a bit small

214662,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Greeted by a very stand offish Receptionist I m assuming she doesn t have a good command of English as we had trouble getting a clear answer to our questions Also don t appreciate being spoken to rudely after a long day of travelling and all you want is to settle in to your room Other Receptionists were patient and nice i e for checkout and other queries , Bed was comfortable even though second person would have to climb over to their side Bed was against the wall Not far from Paddington station

214669,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The staff behind the desk were very pleasant but a young male at the door was very rude as were the cleaning staff Doesn t cost a thing to smile The room was very noisy as we could hear the people upstairs who were constantly walking around at god knows what time , The room and bed were a lovely size Very good area as on the Bakerloo line Waterloo is only a few stops away 
214670,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, They moved us from one hotel to another The room was ridiculously small for a DELUXE doble room 2 3 days we had to come back 35 min later to have breakfast because there was no space Last day bathroom lights gone loop broken All the experience on it became a joke Noisy room 3 meters from reception If you read this only one advice Move on to another place , The location 
214671,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Extremely small room and toilet Not for claustrophobic and bigger sized people You might not be able to squeezed into the toilet , Location short walk to Paddington station
214672,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room in the size of the bed Not like on the advertising pic No place for luggage To get to the tiny closet I had to jump over the bed Claustrophobic experience , Friendly staff
214673,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I had Booked a Room With a Bath I got offered a Room in a Different Hotel with a Shower over the Road Had to pay the Full Hotel Bill Upfront and They Still Wanted A Deposit as well for Each Night Electricity Problem in Hotel Room Only Half the Lights Worked Television Problem Kept Switching ON and OFF and Finally gave up the Ghost One Day before Checking Out Day After Day Totally New Staff I am Not Surprised , Bar and Comfort Bed and Buffet Breakfast 
214674,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms are very narrow we had to ask for changing the room because it was VERY narrow windy with an old window Actually the only plus in this hotel is the location , The only person in stuff who was really very helpful was Petrek excuse me if i am not right with the name He helped us a lot and in everything he always smiled and was really very polite 
214675,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Our original room was possible the smallest room I ve ever stayed in You have to turn sideways to get out of bed and go to the toilet I also nearl fell down the four steps into the room with the staff failed to inform is about We asked to change room next day and the basement room we got was grand and spacious The lady at reception who changed our room was very helpful but on arrival the staff where very pushy trying to get you to book breakfast and told us it was 7 pounds for a coffee in the area We got two full breakfasts for 12 pounds less than a five minute walk away , Very close to tube station and good nearby facilities
214676,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The heat was not adjustable The breakfast was not good and service lacked horribly at breakfast and we waited and waited for coffee and tea to be served They seemed short staffed The table was wobbly and there could be tablecloths or something to make it more elegant The selection wasn t good I ve eaten much nice breakfasts at even an Ibis hotel , The bed was comfortable 
214677,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Whilst the breakfast was good the service was chaotic The girls would take an order and then nothing would appear The tureen used for the scrambled egs was empty so I left the lid off so the wait staff could see that One staff member saw the lid off and replaced it without replenishing the contents The girls mostly from eastern Europe were most pleasant but seemed to have no system or organisation for dealing with an influx of customers I suggest they keep customers at the door until a table is available take the clients there and take their order their for tea coffee there and then Instead people are finding any table that is empty whether it has been re laid or not and sitting down The system is very inefficient ,No Positive
214678,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, bathroom was very small toilet was not well posistioned difficult to sit on loo wall cupboard over tea making fridge is too low kept hitting my head fridge door is difficult to open it is too near other furniture, breakfast was good but i think more staff were needed they had too many people to look after 
214679,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, We had specifically booked this hotel as it offered a twin room important for us as my husband has a bad back On arrival we were told this was not available and offered a double bedded room with a small double bed or 2 single rooms After explaining our reasons and being quite firm we were finally offered a double bedded room with a slightly larger bed which we had to take Better than the original but not a good night s rest for a higher price than we would have liked , The senior staff member tried to be as helpful as he could when we had explained our reasons for needing twin beds He took 10 from our bill gave us complementary breakfasts and even a free bottle of wine So he tried to do the best he could for us in the circumstances 
214680,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room we booked wasn t available transfer d to another hotel same there Sent back to original hotel the management eventually found a excellent suitable accommodation, Was very impressed with all round cleansines
214681,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Hotel has offered me a room which was absolutely different from the picture shown at Booking com They explained that is a kind of your marketing skill by booking com I was so angry at first impression of the room Take time to clam down even thougth they exchange another bit better room for me ,No Positive
214682,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I booked this hotel but I was told to stay Shaftesbury metoloporis which is 5 mins walk from the hotel because their hot water was not working They arranged complementary taxi and breakfast for us but the reason I booked shaftsbury premier London Paddington is because it s closer to the station even the room charge is more expensive than Shaftesbury metolopolis The deluxe double room was extremely small hall way is super narrow and there are steps and doors that make us very hard to walk with luggage A green light on the ceiling bothered us whole night Moreover when I was checking out at metolopolis I saw the guests are told to stay other hotels because this hotel now has a hot water problem I felt so weird ,No Positive
214683,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, A lot Not suitable for business travel, After many problems staff did try and find a solution but as I arrived late on the first day and stayed only 36 hours it is difficult to understand how so many issues were packed into 36 hours
214684,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, i didht like the breakfast 4 a four star hotel i expected betrer breakfast the quality of food in the breakfast it looks very simple , it was fantastic i like my room the man in receptionist it was very generous i arrived late and he hell me 4 to order food 
214685,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, A few technical hitches with door cards and appliances Arrived late at one hotel and had to be transferred to another This was all done very well and only a minor thing , Very good value for London although we picked up a very good deal The breakfast was very good and the staff very helpful 
214686,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Better service from staff, TV in my room didn t work told staff and they said the would get it looked at straight away No one can to look at it at all during my stay 
214687,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Nothing It was top notch , Super friendly check in Newspapers on arrival Lovely room Particular mention to the lovely receptionist Mariana who was fantastic Gave us a lovely room
214688,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, , The location is great as it was close to both hyde park and paddington station The room is very cozy and clean On a quick note the room might be a bit small especially if traveling with a big suitcase but it is not that bad and it s actually perfect for a short stay business trip 
214689,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was abnormally small It was advertised as a double and I paid more for the size Unfortunately the room was miniscule There is no way two people could even be in the room at the same time This is mis advertising at its worst You literally could not sit forward on the toilet as it was so close to the wall The room was a single at best and should NEVER be advertised as a double I felt cheated and upset There was also a fight in the hall at 12 30 AM Overall I was very disappointed as the room was NOT as advertised , The room was clean 
214690,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The only thing I missed at breakfast was a fried egg not such a fan of scrambled eggs But I am really being picky here , Really close to Paddington and also not far from Lancaster Gate Great breakfast And the staff were REALLY friendly Even remembered my tea choice at breakfast on 2nd day 
214691,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, My initial room was next to the main road and the window doesn t appear to be double glazed so I spent one night not sleeping well They managed to love me , Service is phenomenal The staff have been awesome Alexandra Valeria and the whole reception team including the concierge men Well done 
214692,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Nice hotel however the deluxe room was rather bijoux and there was little space either side of the bed which made it difficult getting in and out of the ensuite as the bed stopped the door opening fully I had my grandson with me who is 3 years old and the difficult access to ensuite proved a bit of an issue , Breakfast was good and the room very clean
214693,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I thought there might be an in house restaurant for evening meals but instead I was handed a pizza takeaway menu I was upgraded to a double room which was appreciated but it was cramped and impossible to walk round the foot of the bed Only way to draw undraw the curtains was scrambling over the bed Admittedly I was on my own but if my wife had been here one of us would have been scrambling over the other Basement room view none Obviously to be expected if you get a basement room , Great staff Bed was comfortable It was peaceful Good breakfast Clean Good location
214694,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The Smell in the corridor wasn t that good It s wasn t a bad one but really it has made unhappy I think strong smell to breathe it, My Room was so clean everything was excellent and comfortable 
214695,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, I checked in very early in the morning and quickly they arranged a room for me without extra charges There were apples and biscuits around so I felt really welcome Staff are helpful too 
214696,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Tiny room difficult to swing a cat but ideal for hobbits We asked for a room on an upper floor but were put in the basement The shower screen in the very tiny bathroom was far too small which meant if you had a shower you inadvertently flooded the bathroom The bathroom door was very weird as it had a transparent panel which meant you could see what anyone was doing inside which is a little odd when staying in a tiny room with your teenage son who s bed was immediately in front of the door Corridors in basement were a maze to get lost in Perhaps some signs back to reception would help , Room was clean Shower was powerful 
214697,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Our initial room was extremely small and not what we were expecting but we would have accepted this but when the TV didn t work we had no choice but to complain, The night manager was extremely helpful when their was a problem with our room We were moved and upgraded without hesitation
214698,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Renovations building work going on so opened the door into my bedroom to see a builder right outside the window Don t let this put you off though they ll be done soon , The room was well stocked with coffee and tea facilities free water and biccies Beds were extremely comfortable the bathroom was very nice and everything was clean Good wifi in the room 
214699,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Nothing could be improved if all the rooms were this small We could not unpack the case I had to climb over my partner to get out of bed for the bathroom The room was so small you could not pass one another The room was dark and it was difficult to read a book or newspaper I feel when you book through you the rooms we are given are perhaps top floor and smallest We literally only slept in the room, We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment 
214700,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Some very noisy guests on several evenings including till 6 30 am one night We didn t sleep much as a result The prices on line were higher than over the counter too , It shouldn t be rated four star it s more like a reasonable three star Basic facilities but adequate 
214701,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The single room was small but adequate hence the reason for the comfort rating , The bacon and eggs were perfect Add to this the fresh fruit etc this was an excellent breakfast Each member of staff was very friendly and a pleasure to deal with If I visit London in the future I will stay at this hotel 
214702,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, It stated that my room would be ready for 3 but when u got there past 6 it still wasn t ready and at first didn t want to give me a different room Didn t like the fact that they actually take two lots of money out of ur bank account and then u have to wait five days later for one lot to return into ur account Just felt like the room was slightly too small and cramped and needed finishing off ie missing or broken bits, They were very apologetic and up graded my room free of charge gave me a complimentary bottle of wine and fruit and breakfast in the morning 
214703,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Lost time because got a room in a sister hotel The first room was very small then i got a better room No Wifi only Lan , Good Location nice helpfull stuff 
214704,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The view However to get a good room with a good view in central London I would expect to pay a lot more than I did so was not an issue , Excellent value for money Odd little thing slightly rough round edges but only if your being really picky Mattress quality was outstanding Room quality over all was exceptional for the price and location Staff very friendly No issues with cleanliness Huge array of free toiletries Would defiantly stay again 
214705,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, I was a little disappointed when I got there to be told I had to move to the hotel across the road and when I got there the room was so small Could hardly turn around Safe to say we won t be coming back ,No Positive
214706,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, On checking on the receptionist tried to move me to another hotel I had especially chosen this hotel for location and I did not want to be moved She was very insistent and I was just about to walk out when she decided I could stay ,No Positive
214707,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The first room had a problem but we were swiftly moved , Very comfy bed room not too hot or cold Stayed in a clubroom Staff very helpful and friendly Good breakfast Would stay there again
214708,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The rooms were small Having a room close to the kitchen and stairs leading up to the dining area was a problem Staff were VERY loud between 5 45 AM and 6 30 AM which made sleeping in impossible , Great location and very friendly staff
214709,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, The room was not big but I didn t expect it to be so anyway , The location was important when I chose this hotel for a night as I knew I would be very tired after arriving at Heathrow The room was clean well decorated with all necessary facilities and very cosy Breakfast was nice as well It is likely that I will come back 
214710,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, 1 Very noisy You can hear the traffic from the street and the hall way You can hear people walking and talking from the hall I had to sleep with earplugs 2 They only gave me complimentary drinking water on the first day Don t know if the maid just forgot or it s how they do it , 1 Good location Close to tube station and national rail station Many restaurants and convenient stores close by 2 Staff is friendly and nice 3 Small but cozy atmosphere Good for solo travelers 
214711,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, rooms absolutely tiny there was not enough room to walk between the bed and the wall on one side and the wardrobe on the other I kept stubbing my toes Tiny shower stall Room more like a prison cell How this place EVER got a 4 star rating beats me,No Positive
214712,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Shower was broken Room was very cold in the night They have a bar but it s never open and it closes at 11pm like all the pubs in paddington I was disappointed with the hotel as its 4 star they should accommodate the guests if they want a drink at the bar Looks like I ll be staying in the Hilton hotel next time , Bed was comfortable 
214713,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, Tv worked for one day out of four in the room even after I asked someone to come to our room to sort it out Our sink was somewhat blocked and when the water did go it came out the shower with bits of dirt and a very strong smell of gone off egg Rubish was left from last month check in recept etc , Staff were always so welcoming and polite
214714,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, There was a lingering unpleasant smell throughout the whole establishment and curiously the worst was the sewage smell in The lift, Thefriendliness of the staff the fast room service the understanding of management that we could not stay 5 nights in a shoe box and gave us another room which was perfect 
214715,Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington,No Negative, The room off reception was smaller than a hobbits house My head touched the shower head fitting the bed was comfortable however I was kept awake by staff and customers talking all night
