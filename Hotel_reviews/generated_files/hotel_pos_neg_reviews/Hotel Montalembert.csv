137169,Hotel Montalembert, N A, Its was my partners birthday they provided champagne and decorated the Room Door it was a very good experience and would definitely recommend The staff were really helpful and friendly 
137170,Hotel Montalembert, In your room one can hear the noise of people from the hallway or the noises of your neighbor opening and closing doors , The staff was very helpful and friendly The renovation of the room was well done much more agreeable than the previous decor 
137171,Hotel Montalembert, Everything was good , The experience was amazing the staff very attentive the breakfast options very nice the room was clean and quiet the location is great 
137172,Hotel Montalembert, We were not able to secure a room with a king size bed We knew this when we made the reservation Not the worst thing in the world , We selected Hotel Montalembert based on the recommendation of a friend who is a frequent traveler to Paris and who has stayed at many hotels there We are very selective as to where we stay On this trip we stayed at the Connaught in London and took the train to Paris The hotel arranged a VIP receptionist and chauffeur Mercedes to bring us to the hotel Prior to our arrival we had corresponded several times with the concierge to arrange restaurant reservations The concierge was exceptional The staff was both friendly and professional One of the best things about the hotel is its location We walked virtually everywhere it is a 5 minute walk to the Seine and across the bridge to the Louvre The neighborhood is filled with great little shops and cafes bakeries cheese shops There are two Michelin star restaurants within 100 yds We highly recommend it Upon our departure the hotel arranged an excellent driver to take us to the airport He also was excellent Navigated around freeway accident and got us to the specal Air France Premiere departure area which saved us at least an hour 
137173,Hotel Montalembert, The room was very small No place to put your luggage properly For a longer stay it lacks the comfort of relaxing in a lounge area which is hardly existent , Quiet room very service oriented staff perfectly located in quiet street at walking distance from Mus e d Orsay and the Louvre Small but beautiful and very efficiently decorated bathroom 
137174,Hotel Montalembert,No Negative, The location is perfect Very close to the Louvre Walking distance to many spots The staff is very polite and try to help out in every possible way I celebrated my birthday while staying at the hotel The staff helped out to put flowers on the breakfast table and arranged birthday cake for the whole family I really really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Montalembert 
137175,Hotel Montalembert, The refurbished suite was wonderful Well conceived clean and nicely decorated , The rooms which have not been refurbished are very bland White walls with plain curtains only one print on walls and tiny bathrooms 
137176,Hotel Montalembert,No Negative, I really like the overall ambiance in the hotel felt like home very friendly people with detail to attention Everybody knows your name Breakfast was lovely Location could hardly be better very close to art and antique galleries 
137177,Hotel Montalembert, Size of room and quality was poor not a 4 star yet alone 5 Also the noise of rubbish removal every morning at 5am was annoying the bathroom was falling apart and the lights were impossible to understand how to use, Reception Staff were impeccable
137178,Hotel Montalembert, Unfotunaley assigned an Unrenovated room scruffy furniture and stains on carpet Not enough outlets for chargers No hairdryer outlet in bathroom Assured this room is about to be updated , Public spaces excellent Staff very helpful Room and bed very comfotable Perfect location Quiet even street side 
137179,Hotel Montalembert, On two different occasions someone knocked and entered my room without even waiting for my acknowledgement They actually walked in on me This was not acceptable and I explained that they should wait until I had opened the door or given permission for them to enter , I have stayed here in 2015 Again it was a pleasant stay I was given one of their newly refurbished rooms with an escort by reception The room was tasteful and beautifully decorated I only stayed for one night but being the last night of my holiday it was a treat 
137180,Hotel Montalembert, The rooms are tired but you are working on that I looked at the rates for June and wondered whether I can still afford coming to stay with you , I love your hotel and where it is the restaurant the atmosphere Not too big nor too small Good service good food Relaxed atmosphere

137183,Hotel Montalembert, The air conditioning could have worked better in our room The front desk said they would certainly move us to another room but we only had one more night so we opted to stay We did however get a fan which helped , We loved the location of the hotel staff very friendly and helpful we would definitely come back to this hotel 
137184,Hotel Montalembert, There weren t too many things at all to dislike No kettle in the room was a little odd and the mirrors all over the gorgeous marble bathroom aren t great when you re sat on the loo Car parking is very expensive at around 40 day but the valet will drive your car to the front door with your cases etc , A true 5 star with friendly staff the type that remember your name a great location between all the main attractions of Paris and very high quality fittings It s a beautifully kept building and items such as the tiny lifts are really interesting We went for a deluxe room which offered a view of the Eiffel tower if you lean out of the window 
137185,Hotel Montalembert, The air conditioner was not working sufficiently nor was the refrigerator in my room Breakfast was also very small and not really very generous at all , Super location friendly staff beautiful building
