203903,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Hotel didn t feel like 5 stars more like medium 4 Lot s of minor shortcumings which add up to a overall mediocre experience , Staff was nice External gym was perfect 
203904,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Beautiful bedrooms and luxury bathroom with a bath and separate walk in shower Excellent food and very friendly and helpful staff Very convenient for transport links with the underground station a 2 minute walk away The area is very quiet on a weekend because most of the square mile closes at a weekend We ve already booked to come again 
203905,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, A very minor point was limited cold water flow in our particular bedroom basin but otherwise hard to fault , This is an oasis of calm in London The room itself was extremely quiet but as soon as you walk in from the street you feel you have left the busy ness behind The staff are very welcoming Site wise you are well placed to enjoy several of the historic aspects of the city We enjoyed the proximity to the river and St Katherine s Dock as well as The Tower 
203906,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, It was all great if I was being very very picky the rooms are a bit of a squeeze and would have liked a bedside cab either side, great location near to everything but relatively quiet at weekend as in city so peaceful A drink on arrival was a lovely touch too 
203907,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Parking is not at the hotel it s 5 min walk away and there s nowhere to stop outside The car park was too small for my car to get in so we ended up a 15 minute walk away and paid 38 00 fo the day Breakfast was 22 each so we went out , Good room quiet and comfortable Good shower 
203908,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing , We loved our room It was so cosy felt homely in a way The bed was so comfortable My photo does not do it justice The staff were really charming Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel in general was excellent Would happily stay there again It s only a 2 3 minute walk from Bank station which is a very central place to be in London 
203909,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing , I got upgraded because it was my birthday and I have gotten a bigger room that their usual standard It was a great surprise treat The room was extremely comfortable and everything was just great 
203910,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, very poor price quality balance room was outdated connecting doors caused significant noise staff did not respond at all to complaints Will not use this hotel again,No Positive
203911,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Having to leave, Everything about this hotel was excellent I have stayed at hotels in London over the last 20 years at least every month This is the most characterful quality value for money establishment I have come across in that time A triumph Well done to all involved with the hotel An uplifting experience A complete pleasure
203912,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Didn t like the breakfast area The bar was very small and felt like a walk through area , Location very convenient Polite and friendly staff
203913,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Wifi bad TV bad reception Had To wait so long for breakfast when it wasn t even busy , Big room we had an upgrade which was nice Staff very nice
203914,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, hotel restaurant was shut at the weekend as are local places to eat due to hotel being in banking district in London, good hotel near public transport
203915,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The water in the shower doesn t get quite hot enough But really the ONLY thing that could be improved , Beautiful space incredibly kind and attentive staff Great food wonderful tea time must be reserved 24 hours in advance Highly recommend 
203916,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Our room was boiling hot and it was pretty unbearable in the bathroom The shower head was blocked and water only came out of the sides We were only there for one night and when I expressed our concerns we were offered a drink Not really very adequate , The staff could not have been more polite and helpful
203917,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Breakfast is expensive, MAin reason for booking was proximity to an event in Lombard Street Big plus was excellent service from friendly and courteous staff
203918,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The one big disappointment was the lovely hot powerful shower was only suitable for person under 5 9 anyone taller has to crouch or continually hit their head It s not as if there was no space above to have the shower head higher , Character beauty of its old life as a bank retained Quiet very comfortable stay 
203919,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Excellent service from all hotel staff Beautiful interior design Understated Exterior Everything looks larger than it does in the website photos Supersonic room service About 90 seconds Beat that Great location Marco Pierre White restaurant in hotel Exquisite restaurant Excellent service from all restaurant staff Located amongst the modern architecture of London such as The Gherkin The Cheesegrater and The Walkie Talkie this exquisite modern hotel is camouflaged by its much older exterior architecture Only a small name plaque adorns the discreet entrance to an oasis of modern luxury and sophistication The perfect environment for the smart suited lady or gentleman to drink champagne My girlfriend and I chose this 5 star hotel as we were attending the ballet and wanted to feel comfortable in a hotel wearing evening dress and we did In a lesser starred hotel in the past we had felt out of place and uncomfortable The Marco Pierre White restaurant being the restaurant where hotel guests eat was a major factor in our choice of hotel Not all 5 star hotels have famous Chefs restaurants The room Our Deluxe Queen Room had a bath and a shower wet room with lots of marble and lovely toiletries Not a large room but not small it was beautifully furnished and was more impressive in d cor and size than it looked in the website photos Everything you need is in the room from robes and slippers to iron hairdryer and mini bar All I needed was ice Room service brought that with a big smile in about 90 seconds Beat that I will certainly return to this gorgeous place Enjoy your stay Mr SuitAndTie
203920,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Attention to detail even the lemon in a little muslin bag to stop the pips falling out wonderful service and food drinks on arrival great location just really well looked after 
203921,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Carpets getting a little tired losing its freshness , Beautiful building provides an excellent ambience for enjoying the stay Cheerful and helpful staff
203922,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, 23 for breakfast is a bit steep Went to Weatherspoons , The rooms were beautifully presented and the staff very friendly and helpful The hotel oozes class and the decor and bar areas are very stylish Not cheap but worth splashing out 
203923,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The bar unfortunately wasn t as efficient as it could have been we ordered a meal which when it finally came 20 30 minutes later was cold the barman forgot to make one of our cocktails Pretty disappointing considering at the time we were the only 2 in there ,No Positive
203924,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Breakfast was too expensive so opted out , Loved everything about this hotel Welcome drinks free water and newspaper Coffee machine in room ice and water left out during the evening in the room by hotel staff Brilliant toiletries big bathroom and comfortable bed 
203925,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Due to our room having an interlocking door which was no longer in use the noise from the room next door did disturb us The toilet paper felt cheap which did not reflect the quality of the room , Room was lovely and spacious the bed was really comfy and the bathroom was huge Nice fluffy towels 
203926,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Small room Not enough room to walk past TV cupboard Breakfast too expensive, The building and location Quiet room allocated as requested Attentive service
203927,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing , Perfect location for the function venue Warm welcome chairs at check in Great decor and ambience Very comfortable and well appointed room 
203928,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Low water pressure in bathroom, Great location very helpful friendly staff Requested slightly later check out time which they were more then happy to do for no extra charge 
203929,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Central location within walking distance to St Paul s Cathedral and London Bridge Quiet and clean boutique hotel with modern facilities and unique cosy atmosphere Definitely worth recommending 
203930,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, One tiny criticism we were asked what type of water in the room said sparkly and still came but it did not really matter too much its a first world issue can think of others to get more stressed about , Great breakfast 
203931,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Breakfast service was disappointing milk served in a teapot coffee luke warm and not enough staff Eventually got a cafeti re with hot coffee and a delicious English breakfast Please sort out the service as everything else is excellent , Friendly staff immaculately clean delicious food in restaurant 
203932,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, We asked reception about find a TV to watch some sport We were directed to the bar which didn t have a TV at all A little frustrating to have wasted our time on this , Friendly check in and huge bathroom wet room 
203933,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, If I have to find fault it would just be that the finish of the wooden bath panel was rather aged and the bathroom sliding door does not close flush to the door so there isn t proper privacy It s these little finishes that you would certainly expect to be of the highest standard from a room that would ordinarily be charged at 485 , The hotel decor and atmosphere was fantastic The food and service fabulous Overall two very happy customers Thank you 
203934,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Honestly I really cannot fault anything I didn t like having to leave , The whole experience was fantastic What a truly stunning hotel cannot thank enough You definitely went that extra mile not sure the care and attention to our wishes could have been any more perfect Thank you so very much 
203935,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Very nice hotel located in the heart of London City A lot of restaurants around like famous Burger ad Lobster which is just in from of hotel and Duck and Waffle in some 400 meters walk Metro station is also in some 3 minutes walk very convenient just taking a central line and going to Oxford street for shopping or any other place Hotel itself is very nice and quiet good breakfasts very clean and room service works very well Considering the location price is OK 
203936,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, The service provided by the front of house staff is exceptional Nothing is too much trouble The ambience of the open lounge area is beautiful particularly when the sun is shining through the glass domed roof 
203937,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, our room was nice but was on the ground floor with windows into a parking garage , The staff in the bar were really nice and the concierge was absolutely amazing She helped us plan our activities prior to coming to London Very helpful 
203938,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Room size was small for a young family with an infant and a portacot , Very close to several historical landmarks and those that weren t nearby were a train ride away from the very well serviced Bank station Building was absolutely stunning with award winning restaurants downstairs and along Threadneedle St 
203939,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Location Drove past it twice No signs or identifying marks No where to park or even drop off our luggage Nightmare on arrival , Great room We had a suite with a huge balcony 
203940,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Staff were courteous and despite arriving early we were offered a free upgrade and allowed access to the room The room was a good size and had all the facilities we required The hotel kept our bag at the end of our stay to allow us further time sightseeing Close to tube station 
203941,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, I can t think about one thing that wasn t perfect , Amazing bed and pillow Probably the best I ever had Very beautiful hotel and great value for your money 
203942,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Not enough milk and no shampoo conditioner but that was rectified upon calling room service, Upgraded to a suite for a nominal fee Beautiful comfy rooms 
203943,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, There was a lot of dark wood in our room which was a bit dated Also there was quite a big gap in the connecting door to the next room we saw the guest next door looking through We didn t have the breakfast as it seemed very expensive, The Lobby with the glass dome is beautiful The location is fantastic
203944,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Not a dislike but had to ask for extra teabags and milk as we had run out on the small supply which the Manager duly provided straight away thank you, Great room facilities staff could not do enough for us even when it was raining umbrellas are available in the room or at the door 
203945,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, We did have to wait a while for our room to become available but I believe that we were actually upgraded due to this , The room was amazing and the staff were extremely pleasant helping me to find my lost phone The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was lovely with a great bath and shower 
203946,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Stayed here for my partners birthday and unfortunately our room was stinking hot which limited sleep we were told the air conditioning was broken and we could move rooms but didn t fancy it at 3am The next night we moved to a lovely room but the air conditioning was really noisy so unfortunately we didn t get much sleep all weekend and felt too tired to do much in the day Really disappointing ,No Positive
203947,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The pipes made a constant loud whistling noise the shower did not have a nicely enclosed stall so water went everywhere and the bathroom smelled like mold You had to remove the plunger from the sink so water would go down , The room was tidy and generally quiet 
203948,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Coffee machine in room didn t work either machine was broken or sockets not working Informed reception and they did not offer replacement we were checking out in 2 hours though , Very comfy bed nice bathroom
203949,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Maybe more choices at breakfast or a small buffet Being very picky the doormen were not very attentive , The check in restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The quality of the breakfast was very good The bathroom toiletries were excellent The room was clean warm and comfortable There was also a nice ambiance in the hotel We will come back thank you 
203950,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Breakfast not good enough for the price There is a pret around the corner , Deluxe room was big with a fantastic bathroom Excellent for central London Evening food in Wheelers was excellent It is 1min from bank tube station and central line Super easy travel and quiet at weekend 
203951,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The room was terribly noisy with the air conditioning on full all night It could not be turned off and we did not get any sleep we were told that we could change rooms but a 1am it was too late Upon checking out we were told that the Manager would contact us after the week end but heard know more I took the trouble to return to the Hotel and was told that I could have the money back from the breakfast ,No Positive
203952,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Bed bugs Customer service slow unprofessional at times Room view Room service menu can be improved Housekeeping cleaning bathroom changing bedsheets, Location interior spacious room and bathrooms Coffee machine amenities food from room service 
203953,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Glass door to the bathroom which would open on its own Nowhere to put hang bathrobe or towel close to the bathtub too big bathroom , Excellent location Design of the room with big comfort and attention to detail The building itself with amazing dome big windows and high ceiling former bank a lot of dark wood and leather armchairs create impressive well established ambience smartly complemented by contemporary design features Great Xmas decorations and gorgeous scent at the entrance area 
203954,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Staff at breakfast could have been more attentive Providing tea coffee and clearing away used plates , Quiet hotel Friendly helpful staff Provided early check in without cost Location in the city which is an interesting area to explore 
203955,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing everything was perfect , Everything This hotel is superb the rooms are fantastic the staff are so charming and helpful and go out of their way to assist Threadneedles is our favourite London hotel and although we have stayed there many times before it never fails to impress it is an oasis in the madness that is London 
203956,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Service for breakfast was unbelievably slow so the charge was deducted from our bill However there was nothing wrong with the standard of the food Apart from this slight complaint I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel , The fact that the receptionist unhesitatingly gave us a different room after we had complained about noisy neighbours 
203957,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The Room Service facilities did not include serving any alcohol late at night and the mini bar did not have a great selection so this was the only downfall for us personally , The location was great a short walk from Liverpool St Station and the Tube station Bank was very nearby making travel around London very easy Hotel felt very luxurious and was very tastefully and lavishly decorated Staff were really helpful and always smiling 
203958,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing, The staff were amazing and friendly the member of staff on reception when we checked in was expectional and very helpful the hotel room was amazing and the hotel was definately Worth its value good Location for all attractions also 
203959,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, We paid for a queen room but was shoved in a disabled room on ground floor Not a big issue but not what we had in mind not like the photos , Very nice hotel and friendly reception staff 
203960,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, Quiet part of London yet near enough to get to key places quickly Beautiful old bank building upgraded and tastefully and creatively reworked into a hotel 
203961,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, small room no buffet breakfast pork breakfast or starving breakfast not a 5 star hotel standard maybe 3stars move on , i dont know maybe to wait for the wrong room until 4pm 
203962,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The staff were unfriendly and didn t make us feel welcome and it went downhill from our arrivial We waited constantly for someone to answer our room service calls and the food was very underwhelming especially the breakfast which we paid 60 for the misfortune of having When we finally got an answer to our calls there was no acknowledgement of the delay and the staff were abrupt in their tone That said the chambermaids were very polite and the most welcoming of all the hotel staff We stayed during 24th 25th Dec and it appears they were understaffed so that might account for the less than 5 experience , Hotel was quiet and clean the suite was comfortable 
203963,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Very busy reception when checking in so slow to be served in and no help offered taking bags to room Details missing in a 5 hotel , Perfect location for a night out in the city Wonderful building and room 
203964,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Maybe the walls could be a tad bit thicker The first room that we were in we could hear everything that went on in the room next to ours We could also pretty much hear everything that went on in the hallway , The staff members were really helpful and friendly Our request for a room change because of a crying baby next door was met with a prompt response 
203965,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, A bit pricey but nice yo splash out on a bit of luxury Beware at weekends very little local amenities open, Lovely decor in a quieter part of London great facilities Very comfortable Main areas of London easily accessible
203966,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, The staff provided an excelent service Arriving late after midnigt we were received by high service and kindness Trip suggestions and an outstanding service was provided by Brenda All in all the staff made the difference 
203967,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Heating in room did not work asked reception to fix it and they came but to did not warm up after they said they had switched it on Instructions for the room heating would have helped They did give us a manual heater which helped , Room and facilities very good and the decor was very beautiful
203968,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Breakfast menu could have provided a wider choice , Reception staff were extremely engaging without being insincere or over the top The room was fresh and spotless with a spacious bathroom 
203969,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Not a 5 experience staff did not make you feel special Restaurant closed both Saturday and Sunday evenings not 5 service Restaurant decor who wants to look at an oversized photo of an ugly chef with a fag hanging out of his mouth Bathroom needed an upgrade Breakfast poor and overpriced waitress picked out the pastries with her hands, Great location near to Bank Station Nespresso coffee machine Staff were polite Reception lounge with an historic dome
203970,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Checking in car parking process is poor Nowhere to park outside yet you cannot get into carpark without a personalised voucher which you can only get when you check in At busy times this means you have to drive around trying to find somewhere to leave car while the other person checks in Not good especially for 240 a night , Staff really helpful friendly Room was beautiful 
203971,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Room was small should remove some furniture and dark VERY close to the next building so one looked right into those offices and vice versa making it necessary to keep the curtains closed Exercise facility is not in hotel but nearby , Location was good for work in th City everything in walking distance Underground nearby 
203972,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, I have stayed a few times before in this hotel and know how nice the rooms are However my Queen Room although heavily discounted but said to have originally been more than 500 per night was somewhat disappointing as it was clearly for a disabled or elderly person equipped with red cord alarms and a seat in the shower and the bed was in an alcove and almost touching the wall I appreciate that I checked in late at about 11 30pm after a long day s work but to be told that that was the last room available was disappointing as my expectations were high ,No Positive
203973,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Not sure what makes it 5 as opposed to 4 The room is average size Views from rooms limited , Fabulous location near Bank Very helpful staff very professional service Comfortable beds Quiet location 
203974,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, The room was OK but nothing more than ok Bathroom cleaning was inexistent Hair here and there and dirty spots everywhere The bed was not made after the first night and the bedsheets have been left more or less as they were Very poor service especially when compared to the ranking of the hotel , The location was convenient for us accessing to Shoreditch and some theaters in the area It is also 5 minutes walking distance from Liverpool Street Rail station where trains from Stanstead arrive 
203975,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, I asked for no feather pillow or duvets as allergic It took 3 attempts to rectify this although already requested when booked months before and acknowledged by reception staff ,No Positive
203976,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Bathroom was very large but not that practical would have preferred the room to be bigger instead Not much was opened nearby on the weekend , Lovely foyer area there were some nice restaurants near by but a shame most were closed over the weekend 
203977,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Nothing really, I liked the staff and the atmopshere in the hotel The location is good lot of nice places in the area as well Never been there and it took my by a surprise 
203978,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Not a big issue but there were occasional problems with electronic keys Breakfast overpriced for leisure travellers without expense accounts, The staff were very helpful and the room had all we needed well equipped Free wifi The lobby area
203979,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, I prepaid my breakfast when booking the reservation When I checked in the staff did not ask me for my selection or remind me that is something I need to decide So I paid money for nothing , The facilities are very nice Close to the office quiet and very comfortable 
203980,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Wifi was not working management was kind enough to compensate with full breakfast and late check out , Good location comfortable bed Shower and bath in the bathroom Decent sized room 
203981,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Bedroom window could not open Bit on the gloomy side in corridors and room, Location
203982,Threadneedles Autograph Collection, Bathroom didn t shut properly , Stylish very quiet very relaxing
203983,Threadneedles Autograph Collection,No Negative, We were made to feel so welcome in this comfy stylish hotel and weee very well looked after
