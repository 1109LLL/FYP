353522,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No airco only a fan with high outside temperatures Would have expected airco in a hotel of that category Double room very spacious and comfortable but the single room with only a slightly lower price per day was very cramped about 1 3 the space of the double room and a cracked floor After complaining this was changed to a room with a good floor slightly bigger but still very small The price for a single room is far too high , Staff very friendly and helpful Glutenfree and lactosefree food items in stock The double room was spacious and stylish 
353523,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No parking place from the hotel The pillows and the covers from the bed are awful and it is a very hot hotel for the summer with no airconditioning or a fan in the rooms , It is a very beautiful hotel in the centre of the pedestrian zone with a very good breakfast 
353524,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Needed a kettle in the room Staff didn t recognise me when I wanted to use the downstairs loo during the day and sent me into cafe next door who made me pay 50 cents, Loved the bathroom and the staff were lovely wish they had a kettle in the room for a cup of tea 
353525,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The parking offer was not possible to be used the parking offered is limited to 1 95m and this limitation was not mentioned until we arrive with a baggage box on the car roof We had no indication where to park the car and we were helpless Fortunately we found another location for parking but this took time in the rain time we paid full price and was not indicated by the hotel I am very disappointed to have so poor service in the car parking area from an IV star hotel in the center of Vienna where all the parking places are red ,No Positive
353526,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, With hot summer rooms should have air conditioning also because keeping windows open you get the noise from the street , Location is excellent and breakfast is fab 
353527,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The hotel doesn t have its own parking you have to park at the nearby u g parkade 25 Day, Best inner city location with access to all major attractions and shopping 
353528,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The room was very warm and stuffy It was difficult to cool it down The fans in the room didn t help We had to open the windows but it was very noisy outside at night late into the night If the evening temperature was warmer one would not be able to get a good night s sleep , The room was spacious
353529,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No AC and ventilation fans in the elevators, Exact center of the wonderful Vienna Near by the tour buses Near by famous shopping brands Near by the opera WiFi with good speed Good breakfast with several varieties Friendly staff Room size was good Room was really quite Toilet was clean and arranged Highly recommend and I will repeat my visit 
353530,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No usefull air conditioning system in the room during the summer period that can be very uncomfortable , Friendly and helpfull member of staff especially Akos who solved my reservation problem very good location 
353531,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, It could have coffee and tea facilities in the room NO Airconditioning makes for stuffy rooms And advertising shuttle transfer is not transparent when you actually have to pay for the transfer , Location and time period atmosphere is the only thing that is great about this 1912 hotel 
353532,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The rooms are quite small The hotel does not have air conditioning in the rooms Early in the morning is great noise around the hotel garbage trucks supply cars builders etc , The hotel is centrally located the most important attractions being accessible per pedes The rooms are not modernly decorated but the bed is comfortable The staff is very friendly The hotel does not have parking but there are several parking nearby 
353533,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The only thing that leaves this hotel down is no air conditioning even though the hotel provided an excellent fan it didn t exactly do the job required if air conditioning was available this hotel would be just perfect, The hotel was old style but a beautiful building The staff were excellent and extremely courteous at all times I was amazed that one of the receptionist remembered my name The bedroom was beautifully laid out with all that was necessary for our 4 night stay with a well stocked mini bar bathroom was very big and had a lovely design with very cooling floor Breakfast wasn t included in our room rate but we did have breakfast at the hotel on a morning we were taking a early tour the breakfast was a typical buffet breakfast that is mostly available in mainland Europe Location could not be better in terms of being right on the doorstep of the main shopping street and next to the palace were plenty of transportation and tours were available 
353534,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Unfortunately due to its centre location there was a lot of early morning noise from the street cleaners and bin men also the building work going on in the city This was made worse because we had to sleep with the window open due to the heat and lack of air conditioning , The hotel is located right in the centre of the pedestriansed area immediately adjacent to shops and eating places All Staff and the breakfast were excellent We booked the hotel car to collect us from the airport cost 50 Other options are available 
353535,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, In the middle of summer no air conditioning in rooms totally unacceptable for a four star property, The rooms were fine and clean and spacious The staff were excellent
353536,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, SUPER HOT IN THE ROOM While our stay it was 30C in Vienna Our room did not have any conditioners There was only one fan that did not help at all Neither did the windows They were faced to the backyard where restaurant ventpipes are located As a result two nights turned into nightmare It would be also nice to warn guests in advance that breakfast is not included in their booking and they would have to pay additional 17 per person per night in case they want to have hotel breakfast , The lication is super right in the center of the city close to all tourist locations and shops The staff is very friendly always polite and helpful The interior of the hotel is very authentic as if you were in 1920s
353537,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The room was incredibly hot even with the fan provided and we couldn t sleep with the window open because of the noisy drone of air con outlets in the courtyard Desperately needs aircon We were disappointed that what was supposed to be a treat staying in this lovely place turned out to be awful We dreaded going back to our room , Wonderful location a block from the Opera and Albertina Good breakfasts and great reception 
353538,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning in rooms The fans provided did not give any relief in the hot stuffy room , Hate to give the hotel a poor rating The rooms are spacious and overall decor of the hotel is very nice in classic Vienna style The location is fantastic But no air cinditioning Which is essential during the hot summer tourist season The staff however was very pleasant and accommodating when I decided to check out after only one night of my original 3 night s stay o find an air conditioned hotel 
353539,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning in the room Ledge German toilet design is a shame , The hotel was very quite guests were mainly senior people The room was facing a pedestrian only street Located in the center of the city close to the main museums and a couple of metro stations away from the Central Train Station 
353540,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Like many other hotels in Vienna it does not have AC Though they provide fan, Very good location right in the city center Friendly staff from the front desk to the restaurant Excellent breakfast The Wifi works
353541,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, A bit noisy as we were right outside the casino but bearable, Very close to public transport lots of cafes and restaurants and places to see nearly everything within walking distance
353542,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Crowd noise in plaza when windows were open No AC, Very accommodating staff Central location close to opera house and several museums Large rooms with high ceilings and big windows Good breakfast for a reasonable price
353543,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No aircon Breakfast very expensive Room a bit tired Vienna is the ultimate tourist rip off worse than any other Capital I have visited and this hotel is symptomatic of this , Location is as central as it could be The main tourist spots are all in walking distance Staff are friendly and helpful 
353544,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, nothing, very good location in the central city it is very conveniently to walk to market university shopping center and park Stuff is very friendly to service and take care Breakfast is very delicious especially a Thai girl who take care at restaurant for breakfast is very nice i m very impression in her 
353545,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Typically four star hotels have bath or disposable slippers This hotel does not have any Also the room has two doors the outside is locked with a key when you leave the room but when you enter does not lock and has another door from inside that locks with a latch It s a little bit I would say unsafe , The room is comfortable also the staff the facilities the cleanliness and the location is very good 
353546,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The bed matrix The btrakfast is not rich no facilities, I like the location is very good also the value for money is excellent The room size is huge
353547,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Except bathrooms rooms have not been renovated for a while , Very good location close to Albertina museum but hotel would need full renovation Good value for money
353548,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Pillows were a bit worn out perhaps needs changing as they are not comfy anymore , The location is top notch right at the heart of city Extremely helpful staff and the hotel makes you feel like you are in a Wes Anderson movie 
353549,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Nothing to complain about , This hotel is a grand old lady well kept and somewhat majestic My room was well appointed with lovely fittings which suited the setting and the plumbing was modern The building itself is impressive and suits the architecture of Vienna but the location is absolutely unbeatable All of Vienna s top attractions were close by walking distance and there are lots of restaurants coffee shops and so on right there Hotel staff were all very attentive friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was excellent This is a top hotel and I will be staying there again when next in Vienna 
353550,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, There was very little not to like One of their selling points was a choice of pillows which I had hoped included down feather but no there were very welcome tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms so often not the case in continental hotels I ve found and I would have preferred milk UHT tubs OK to powdered creamer not nice in tea but a lovely waiter gave me a carton when I asked , Brilliant location a hotel with a sense of history and pleasing art deco touches everywhere We had a couple of Comfort rooms on the third floor overlooking pedestrianised Kartnerstrasse and it was clear that everything had been thought about for the comfort of the guests The staff were unfailingly helpful and charming and all in all we loved our stay there 
353551,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, Excellent location with walking distance to almost everything of sights The staff was friendly and humorous Brilliant breakfast with everything I wanted and a unique and charming atmosphere in the hotel overall 
353552,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No ramp at the entrance making it uncomfortable for entering with luggage push chairs and wheelchairs When I entered my room there was a step there as well Room keys are not digital so you have to remember to lock your room and leave the key at the front desk every time you leave The soap in the bathroom is from a fixed squeeze bottle instead of individual soap bar or bottle The above didn t bother me that much but I hope the hotel takes it as feedback to continuously improve , Amazing location and very helpful staff The room size cleanliness and decor were good The room had double windows which helped reduce the noise from the streets below since it s located in the heart of a touristic city you get many crazy and drunk people screaming late at night 
353553,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Our room was facing inside of the hotel the window couldnt stay open due to the smells and noise coming from a restaurant ventilation Also parking is additional 30 a day Its actually a nearby city parking hotel provides a discounted price , Great location wonderful breakfast with most attentive staff
353554,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The single room was too small It was OK for the purpose of my visit but not comfortable for longer stays or when you tend to spend more time in the room Elevators are stylish but not so efficient I felt that the bathroom was not hygenically cleaned after the previous occupant Also bathroom amenities were not regulary supplied , The location of the hotel is excellent It is just in the heart of the city Staff speakes English All receptionists are very efficient friendly and helpful I found the service professional I will definately try this hotel before looking for others on my future visits to Vienna 
353555,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Rustic Hotel but basics could be renovated without hurting the Hotel style Rooms doors and windows are in a very bad state hardly can open and close Walls are very thin which leads you to feel your Neighboor s in your room , Breakfast was basic and very good Location couldn t have been better in Vienna city center Just in the center Wifi perfect Staff very helpful 
353556,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, hotel needs updating Parts of the hotel are dated and a bit tired looking It s a period hotel which is lovely but it s still needs a bit of refurbishment and updating It s very clean But obviously with being so old there s lime scale around corners of bath etc , Great location
353557,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, Perfect location as it overlooks K ntner Strasse a pedestrian street with lots of shopping options Less than two minutes walk to the Opera House And less than 15 mins walk to the Stadtpark Five minutes walk to Mozart s house in Vienna Lots of things to do within a walking distance 
353558,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The walls are paper thin You can hear everything in the adjacent rooms Bathrooms are adjacent to bedrooms too so if your neighbour is making an early start you ll know when the shower gets switched on Breakfast is chronically understaffed and while this doesn t impact the food which is great you ll find tables uncleared and cups crockery cutlery etc un replenished despite the best efforts of the overstretched team , The location in the centre of town is great We walked almost everywhere but the transport network is easily accessible nearby too Very warm welcome and super helpful formal but friendly staff throughout the whole hotel The hotel is beautifully decorated in a new but old style to be sympathetic to the age and history of the building Surprisingly free of street noise despite the location a room on the side rather than the main pedestrian area helped with this 
353559,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, It is unavoidable when staying in the city centre but it is very noisy late at night noise from nearby bar restaurant casino and early in the morning waste collection and lorries There are also thin walls between rooms you can hear everything It would be nice to have a kettle in the room , Absolutely amazing staff Spacious clean enchanting rooms with comfortable beds Delicious buffet style breakfast with a very wide choice of foods Perfect location right in the city centre Great wifi

353562,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Nothing as such to mention, Location middle of the city centre walking distance from all attractions staffs were also good specially the luggage porter
353563,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The bathroom has been recently rebuilt to a high standard However the central bathroom ventilation system is antiquated and needs a full overhaul and possible replacement in order to avoid the collection of sewer smells in the bathroom from other rooms in the building particularly on the upper floors I can see that absence of proper air conditioning in this venerable building could become a problem on a hot summer s night , Ideal for a central Vienna one night stay at reasonable cost Street noise here is unavoidable and was quite tolerable even on the F richgasse side Early morning garbage collection noise is unfortunately something one has to live with in built up areas and the problem will exist for all Viennese 1st district hotels We breakfasted elsewhere so no comment on that Useful proximity to the underground garage next to the Staatsoper which is available to guests at a substantial discount No reservation possible but I have never found it completely full even during weekdays 
353564,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, First room was across construction work building and it is was very noisy Second room they moved me to was looking at yard with kitchen and huge ventilators it was very smelly and noisy Third room was great and perfect third floor normal and quiet I have never change room two time in my life , Location kind staff speaking exyu language

353576,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, TV programmes did not include any russian channel , Location could not be any better Cleanness of rooms and breakfast were very good That is why that was my second stay in this hotel 
353577,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, Location was fantastic Breakfasts were lovely and a reasonable price The hotel dated however very well maintained and added to the experience of Vienna Staff were friendly helpful and available 
353578,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, For a 4 star hotel that has no restaurant and closes the bar at 3 in the afternoon just not good enough The rooms are poorly sound rated kept awake by next door snoring , Not a lot
353579,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, We don t have king size bed and were sleeping on two separate beds that were put together During the night beds were moving so we can t sleep together , Location is great you are really living in city centre Also rooms are like Austrian style so this is quite good experience

353581,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, My room s windows were opened to Kartner strasse and every morning from 6 o clock lorries are coming and it wakes me up every morning early morning , I liked that it was in the center 
353582,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, If you like the old classical look you ll be fine Not all the hotels should look modern and minimalist and I like the old fashioned look but my opinion is this one could have some upgrades to the room doors and card keys and room furniture just to give a couple of examples , Great location friendly and helpfull staff Rich breakfast Confort room very spacious A good choice

353588,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The breakfast was expensive, The location is ideal for the main sights and events in Vienna and it is quiet A good old fashioned Viennese hotel with no frills but very comfortable 
353589,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The beds were extra firm and the pillows had no loft We all had difficulty sleeping on the mattress and pillows I finally asked if they had a pillow for my neck which was hurting from the lack of support The desk staff was able to provide me with a foam neck pillow which helped a lot Also the room stayed hot all the time We would leave the windows open during the day and at least one open at night We were there in mid November There was no way to control the heat in the room Also the bar was closed most nights Only one evening during our stay was it open so don t expect to come back and have a drink at the bar before going to room , The location was perfect since we were attending an opera and most of what we wanted to do was in walking distance 
353590,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Because it is an old hotel I could hear noises from adjacent rooms and bathrooms I didn t get a view but I got a sitting room with den so no complaints , If you want to feel like you are in Vienna then this is a great hotel It is classy old fashion excellent location great breakfast and great front desk attention Everything you want to see is in a 10 block radious Opera house is one block away All I can say is I recommend it Especially after staying in a bad hotel on my first night intercity hotel in Vienna It was like day and night 
353591,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The toilet is separate from the bathroom This is a terrible layout configuration The bathroom was not being cleaned Breakfast not worth the price , Excelent location

353607,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No AC, I liked everything but I travelled in summer and there was no AC only a ventilator So I got very hot However for any other time in the year it would have been perfect 
353608,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The noise of the bin trucks early every morning This is not the hotels fault It is something that has to be expected in an area of the city that has so many excellent restaurants and bars both inside and out on the streets A good set of earplugs remedies this problem and shouldn t stop anyone from staying in this lovely hotel in a fantastic location with everything on its doorstep And perhaps better bar facilities in the hotel would be good but with so many locally it s not a problem , Hotel has great character Staff are very friendly and helpful Location is perfect to see all the sights Highly recommended We will be back soon

353627,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Being vegetarians could do with some more veggie breakfast options and sliced brown bread , Bed was good I was not aware that this hotel had no air conditioning but upon request the hotel staff provided with extra fan Location was good 
353628,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, We were there on possibly the only day in the year Austria gets summer temperatures in the mid 30 s centigrade and there is no airconditioning , The room we had was very large the breakfast was full and complete the location could not be better 
353629,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The room I stayed have no bath tub other wise it would be perfect 10, This hotel is so great Best place to stay in Vienna Just right at the place near all the attractions tons of food and you may check in early we checked in at 9am They have early check in and check out flexibility as long as there is room for no additional cost This place is definitely recommended 
353630,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning essential in mid summer as problematic opening windows given the noise in the small hours in the busy thoroughfare that is the Kartnerstraase, Location
353631,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, no airconditioner room was 31 C at night they give you a fan which only circulates the hot air it does not cool the room smoking everywhere they permit smoking guests to stand directly in the hotel entrance doorway to smoke non smokers must walk through a massive cloud of cigarette smoke to enter exit the hotel lobby reception staff member on duty Miguel advised me he cannot move the smokers away from the entrance because the smokers choice to stand in entrance is protected by Vienna city law BS they show little care for non smokers they have an excellent location and will always be busy so they don t need to offer any good customer service they support smokers , location check in staff
353632,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, The hotel is central and within easy walking distance to all the major historical sites museums shops restaurants and cafes It was also well located to Karlplatz train station and easy to get to the airport by train The staff were extremely helpful and responded promptly to our requests The room was clean and a good size This hotel was recommended to us by friends who previously stayed there and it lived up to our expectations We would recommend the Astoria Wien to other travellers 
353633,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The hotel is 4 stars but not a real four stars its too old there is no AC and the room is too hot There is only a small fan, Location Just in the heart of the city
353634,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Rooms need to be updated No a c so hot if u have Warm weather which we did Slow old fashion elevator , Location No a c so uncomfortable Rm 334 had lovely bathroom but 1 2 shower door leaked water over floor Asked for quiet rm but had to open windows for air and heard noise from courtyard and baby crying next door 
353635,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Old type small lifts We booked two rooms one was spacious nd the other was a crammed room with windows overlooking the drain pipes Ac Pipes disgusting to open the window even for some daylight, Facilities like kettle n coffee tea sets can be provided in the room at the same cost 
353636,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, Amazing place Staff excellent Special kudos to Roberta She was excellent We had to cut our trip short due to an emergency back in Canada and she was more than accommodating to help facilitate our travels back home Breakfast fabulous Beds comfortable All the amenities and then some at your finger tips Very cool decor throughout the hotel Even a welcome drink Can t say enough about this place and would recommend to any and all Looking forward to staying at their other facilities in the world 
353637,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Quite an old hotel so beware those who look for a bit modern style No bar or nice lounge to spend time in if weather is bad , Location is perfect Right in the heart of the city and walking distance to main attractions 
353638,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The central location might sound a good thing but the room partitioning and lack of double glazing in street facing rooms meant that this was the noisiest hotel we have stayed in for a long time You cannot get to sleep before midnight due to the noise from the tourist street Karntner Str Then around 6 30 am every morning you get a loud wakeup call from lorries doing street cleaning bottle bin emptying and deliveries to nearby shops and restaurants Avoid if you value a good nights sleep It does not matter which floor or side of the hotel you stay in the noise is always there , The location is central it is clean and staff try to be helpful 
353639,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, We had kind of bug biting during our stay and that impaired our entire stay I can t say definitely we got this in the hotel however it was all over our bodies and the hotel room was the only place we were without dress , Location only
353640,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, miss having a kettle and tea bags, location fabulous beautiful hotel and kept well maintained staff very friendly and helpful classic room but big enough and large ensuite with shower two lifts and never a queue for them
353641,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, It would be good if there was a permanent hotel bar there looked like there was a small bar area near the breakfast room but it was closed at 10pm when we went looking for it That said there are plenty of restaurants and bars to suit all tastes a short walk away so it wasn t a big deal , Awesome room in an ideal location the breakfast was brilliant so we put on weight 
353642,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The room was too hot even with the heaters off A key per guest would have been helpful The glass shower curtain didn t fit snugly on the bathtub so water splashed out on the floor , I liked almost everything 
353643,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Only one downside you can hear all of the church bells ringing every hour during the day Not after 8pm though This would be a problem no matter which hotel you stay in If you don t like church bells don t go to Vienna , The location was great with a balcony overlooking the street 
353644,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Breakfast Service weak Needs a serious face lifting I got the impression that many decades not much has been done doors etc It was impossible to get a clean shave the light was positioned only on one side , Breakfast choice good but not excellent Check in Service very good Rooms are as expected for a hotel
353645,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The bar shut at 3 I had to ask for a kettle as there was nothing in the executive room to make a hot drink , My lock was slightly faulty and they fixed it straight away Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Staff were friendly and helpful Room was as expected and spacious bathroom a tad tiny I did not eat breakfast so cannot comment 
353646,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Despite the description on the webpage and also the photograph I have the impression that we were allocated the worst room in the hotel on the mezzanine level with a sole minuscule and almost blind window and as a result no sunlight whatsoever overlooking the air conditioning installations and noisy fans as well as the garbage containers which were noisily emptied at around 7AM We thought we were going for a comfort room with two bright windows Am I to deduct that booking through Booking com guarantees you a stay in the worst rooms in hotels , Location cleanliness 
353647,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The only slight problem we had was the walls being a bit thin so we could hear our neighbors pretty loudly in the morning, The hotel is beautiful the staff very friendly and helpful and the location could not be more central 
353648,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Our room was very noisy at night due to facing the casino Shower screen allows water to go all over the floor which is then very slippery , Rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated in the Austrian style Location is excellent walk to everywhere Nice breakfast in the charming dining room
353649,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, The room was lovely spacious and clean and the location of the hotel was excellent The old style charm of the hotel blended well with the updated facilities 
353650,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, There isn t anything bad to say about the hotel , Right in the centre of Vienna A short walk to the state opera where you can purchase your Vienna pass Quiet street although the Main Street with Starbucks opposite and all restaurants within 5 minutes walking 
353651,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, Everything the location cannot be better Especially amazing stuff and old style European hotel which is maintain in amazing way It is just brilliant and I cannot wait to go back 
353652,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, The hotel is situated in center very close to Stephanplatz The rooms are nice and the personnel very polite and kind It really deserves to choose this hotel for your vacation 
353653,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, IT IS N O T VERY IMPORTANT FOR US BUT MUST INDICATE THAT IN RESERVATION I WAS WRITTEN THAT WE HAVE THE 40th WEDDING ANIVERSARY NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THAT NO ONE MADE SOMETHING FOR THIS OF CORSE THE HOTEL IT NOT OBLIGATE TO DO SOMETHING BUT IS VERY VERY VERY POLITE AND BEATUFULL TO DO THE HOTEL SOMETHING SMALL FOR INDICATE THAT PARTICIPATES IN THE JOY OF CUSTOMERS EVEN WITH A SMALL symbolic gesture WILL SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE OF A GRAND HOTEL NOT SEE THEIR CUSTOMERS LIKE NUMBER BUT AS PEOPLE WITH EMOTIONS OF COURSE WE had a lovely THREE DAYS EVEN IF THERE WAS THIS EVENT, COMFORT ROOM IDEAL HEATING IDEAL LOCATION 
353654,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The only issue was that my WiFI did not work for 2 of the 3 units that I had The main computer would only connect to the internet in the lobby Not a big deal but since you asked I am making this point , Location was perfect Our room was in a very quiet area The breakfast was one of the best in Europe The staff were very friendly and accommodating A very pleasant experience 
353655,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, More toiletries could have been provided as well as bigger towels, Location has to be top of the list you can walk to most attractions and the tour buses terminate at the Opera House just a block away 
353656,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, A step up to the bathroom from the bedroom which could prove a hazard for older guests , A very central location Friendly happy and helpful staff 
353657,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No electricity outlet at the desk Parquet floor in room a little tired Drainage of water from bathtub and sink was slow , Great location a few footsteps away from Kaertner Strasse Opera House and Albertina Gallery Walking distance to all sights in Vienna City Center Hotel preserves the atmosphere of former times with antique elevator gently upgraded and unchanged layout however renovated Room was spacious and so was bathroom Bed was good Last not least very helpful staff at the reception 
353658,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Quite basic considering price paid Not even kettle or coffee provided Quite dated furniture , Fantastic location Really Friendly Staff Comfortable Bed
353659,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Very noisy at the morning from road side Windows and doors needs replacement Expensive breakfast , Very clean room Very good and kind staff Good location except the noise at the morning Good WiFi 
353660,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Bad air in the room we had to sleep with an open window , Fabulous location could not be better Excellent breakfast Staff very friendly and helpful 
353661,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, morning check out front desk person was surly The hotel seemed a little faded Bed and linens weren t very high quality , location was great and the bell person evening front desk staff were excellent 
353662,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The austrian style beds with individual duvets, Perfect location Stylish decoration but very comfortable and functional Large and quiet room Fast and easy to connect WiFi
353663,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The hotel was difficult to find because of the blocked end of the street The hotel address printed on the reservation is the walking only street We drove around the city several minutes before finding the hotel , All employees were most helpful and friendly We were given many great suggestions of things to do while in Vienna The room was very clean and comfortable 
353664,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The pillows are too soft Extra charge for kettle and cups to be in the room Toiletries are limited eg No body lotion and the same liquid is use for shampoo and bodywash Breakfast menu should be varied from time to time We stayed at the hotel for 7 days and got a bit tired of the same breakfast after a few days , The location is fantastic Right in the heart of the city and shopping boulevard All the main museums palaces and churches are within walking distance Room and bathroom are large and comfortable Staff are helpful and polite They will book the tours for you and arrange pick up from the hotel 
353665,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Some things could be a bit upgraded in the rooms My shower was leaking and broken The wi fi connection in my room would not work in the entire room but only in certain spots ,No Positive
353666,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Staff not always friendly or helpful I just assumed it was the Austrian way , Great sized rooms Excellent location close to major tourist attractions shopping restaurants and bars 
353667,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, In the bathroom there was not even moisturiser and other amenities It shouldnot be like this in any four star hotel It was like empty , Location and staff is very good 
353668,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Very old interiors especially doors Cleaning staff is trying to enter your room from 8 00 without knocking happened twice in 2 nights No bar Poor breakfast , Friendly staff on reception
353669,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Old hotel needs renovation Although I had noticed before we got a room with courtyard view , Very good location in the centre of Vienna kind staff 
353670,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, A common Austrian custom is the use of a comforter inside a giant version of a pillow case rather than a top sheet blanket and bed spread So you alternate between being too cold too hot as you can only be totally covered or uncovered No chance of layering by pulling up only selected pieces of bedding ,No Positive
353671,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, They wrote on booking that they have a parking place but you habe to pay 25 per day and it is not in front of the hotel it is under the Opera , It is a great hotel in an old building exactly on the main street next to Stefanplatz and all shops near by 
353672,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning which was just fine as I was able to open the windows and enjoy the fresh air but might have been a big problem if the weather had been warmer , Fantastic room size and the staff were very accommodating Beds very comfortable and the breakfast generous 
353673,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien,No Negative, good Hotel and people what is important when a Concierge knows his job it is the business card of the hotel and they are performing very well chapeau Good Hotel old style Art Nouveau and thats what I like history in combination with a good sense of creativity and also important all is nearby on walking distance this is indeed a Hotel you can go back and where the Concierge remember you by name when you come back a year later remarkable
353674,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The bed was very old and uncomfortable and the pillows need to be replaced Overall the room very dated and needs to be upgraded , The location of the hotel is excellent and the staff were very friendly and accommodating 
353675,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, I had no bad experience at all except that I forgot my HP Laptop Charger in room 211 on 11 9 15 Please recover it and send it to me , Staff are very friendly fair and helpful to the needs guests I will always patronise this hotel in my future visits to Vienna
353676,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, I didn t realize until I was checking out that I had already paid for the breakfast for my son and I for the three days I stayed there When I checked in I was not given any copy of my accommodation so I didn t know that I had already paid for it The room was on the small side but very charming , Staff extremely helpful with suggestions of places to explore off the tourist path outside of Berlin 
353677,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Air conditioning very poor in the rooms aparentely they had problems With the equipment but informed could do nothing due To weekend , Location and if the weather was not so hot perhaps would have a better view of the premise 
353678,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air condittioning WIFI was free BUT was NOT secure so could not use it Bar was not available to grab a cocktail after a long day of work , Location was good as was the staff

353680,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Absolutely no view from my room I always wonder if it is because I book with booking com and travel alone or if it is just the luck of the draw This said my room was still very nice , A great location especially if you like to go to the Opera and visit the Old Town Staff were very nice and always ready to help 
353681,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning system in the room and all common areas Not at all recommended for summer time The room booked through booking com was described as city view In reality I ve got a room looking to hotel back area just above a large kitchen from a restaurant working 12 24 hours As keeping the windows open was a must without air cond and with 30 dgrs outside we had all the benefit of noise and smell from restaurant kitchen No coffee pot in the room Beds quality Bathroom facilities needing some maintenance , Location Staff responses and attitude Hotel style 
353682,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Absolutely no AirCo And the sun was burning hot Employees worked hard to lower the room temperature with fans but it was a lost battle The night time was not easy The WiFi although theoretically available for free never allowed a stable connection , Location friendly employees breakfast free lemmon mint refreshment at the lobby the room was spacious and well maintained the bed was large confortable and the linen was adequate Clean Courtesy Nespresso available for free 
353683,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air conditioning in the rooms which was a shame as it was 36 degrees when we were there , Nice location and pretty hotel It was a bit out of date however 
353684,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, This is a great hotel but it was so hot outside and all we had was one small fan to cool the room which was ok at night but it was still very hot in the room , Beautiful room and bathroom Very clean Located in the heart of Vienna

353687,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, No air condition I don t recommend anyone to book a room in this hotel during summer time Although the hotel provide us with two fans sleeping at night was really tough I always wake up at 8 am because of the heat , Location is prefect 
353688,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, The rooms were hot as there is no air conditioning system in the room a poor desk fan had to open windows but was very load outside They have only 8 rooms with AC and they don t advertise it on any website or even the hotel s website you book it directly through the hotel by special request, The location is more than perfect very close to everything and all attractions are within walking distance
353689,Austria Trend Hotel Astoria Wien, Reception staff that did not care Our son was ill and needed a straw for drinking Their reply was bar is closed Not a single attempt to help At the end of the stay they gave me a wrong parking ticket that made me pay 39 Euro extra for parking Small apology but NO reimbursment Will never go there again Overall impression of a bad 2 star hotel , Location in the centre
