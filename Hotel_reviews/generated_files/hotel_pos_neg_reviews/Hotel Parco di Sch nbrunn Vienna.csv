426503,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The location is not good for family if you want to be in the center It takes about 1 2 hrs to walk to the old city The breakfast was not much to write home about and very sparse There was no tea coffee making facilities in room The description of the hotel mentioned slippers and some other toiletries that were not in the room , Staff very friendly Very clean Shuttle tax was arranged cost 50 Euros one way from airport to hotel

426511,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The east European Serbian Croatian I guess lady in the hotel not sure if it was the owner or manager was quite strange with me a brown skinned Guy I had a pizza box when checking in she shows an outside area and tells me I have to throw the box there I was like isn t there a garbage box in the room Then she says yes but throw in here Then she shows me the room and takes a pillow from the bed and blanket from the closet without asking me if I would like an extra pillow Later I notice the pillow was too thin and had a hard time sleeping Finally in the morning breakfast I finish breakfast as she was also there I greeted her saying bye and see you Bis Sp ter then she asks in broken english Money I was not too happy then Because The amount was already paid But she could have asked differently or later when I checkout Not immediatly after I finish the breakfast P S Someone may think that there was a language barrier there But there wasn t any I was taking in German with her and my German Skills are Sufficient enough for the situation described above ,No Positive
426512,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna,No Negative, Location very close to Schonbrun and close to the center of district very good price an nice staff very helpful The parking is not free it is into a garage located in an other place not near the hotel 
426513,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, We went to have breakfast 20 minutes before closing The cleaning lady kept rushing us She even asked for the keys to our suite even though our check out was scheduled one and a half hour later Because of the hurry we ended up having a haphazard and stressful breakfast , Big suite Comfortable The staff who welcomed us in the evening was very nice 
426514,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Bad Internet signal Tight breakfast room shared with reception hall No internal connection between rooms and breakfast room and reception No Recepcionist on the front door after after 21h Very reduced staff in spite of being helpful all times , Spaced rooms and bathrooms good heating and big beds 
426515,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The internet connection was awful once evening The hotel is quite far from center but near the metro station, Beautiful cosy rooms with old fashionable furniture
426516,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Unpleasent personnel especially I think owner I stayed there two times and no more In both situations I had a problems With accomodation when I arrived hotel was closed nobody was at the reception desk and I had to wait 20 minutes than somebody opened not answering the phone no reaction on ringing the bell they mixed arraving dates and duration of stay with other people total mess Only one lady at the reception was really nice and helpful but other guy total disaster With recieving invoices i tooks 2 weeks to get it And finally with room last day my personal belongings without giving me information were moved to room of my collegue with adnotation please give back the key to the my room on the reception desk but I paid for all night which I spent in this hotel sic no sharing the room Of course I did not give it back before departure BE AWARE OF THIS HOTEL No warm dishes during breakfast , Close to the office 20 minutes walking distance 
426517,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Underground parking is located about 1km away from the property but the hotel driver gets you there whenever needed , Great value for money Exceptionally good coffee for breakfast Staff very very helpful 
426518,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The room was a bit dingy and needed brightening up and re decorating the room light where the bed was located had a switch in the entrance part but not where the bed was located there was no bedside light the shower was a section of the entrance room built from a block wall only half the height of the room the wifi was poor you had to cross a dimly lit courtyard to the breakfast room reception desk the reception desk was not manned at all times the smoke alarm kept beeping all night on the last night but the manager did not seem to understand either what the problem was or that I had no sleep because of the noise did not offer a partial refund because of the disturbance I would not stay there at that price Only a 1 and just pushing a 2 star hotel ,No Positive
426519,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Most of the advertised facilities are non existent or not functioning When we arrived we could not find a sole on the premises and no way of contacting anyone We found our name and a key on the reception desk and checked ourselves in Definitely self serve and with no security whatsoever As for parking it is on the street out the front for which they charge extra Apparently when the pay parking starts between 7 or 9 am depending on what part of the street you park in they will ferry your car to some parking station nearby for a couple of hours until you check out There was no functioning restaurant or coffee lounge on this premises when we were there Perhaps the rooms for these exist but they were not open There was no lift In the room the bathroom was part of the entrance hall and had no separate door Breakfast was very basic and nowhere near what you would expect from a four star establishment Much of the description for this place is inaccurate even to the time it takes to get to the Schoenbrunn palace Google shows it as 23 minutes not the 4 they try to pretend Possibly this is to the back fence but you have to go around to the front gate to get an entry ticket It would be helpful if the hotel is looked at by an independent inspector because as it appears on Booking com its advertising is deceptive to say the least The 8 0 rating is very hard to believe It proved useless to point this out to the manager if you can find her because she is one of the rudest people I have met and of no help whatsoever , Bed was comfortable Clean 
426520,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, When I arrived to check in it was 10 pm There old lady and man waiting for us to check in It was so fast all I need to do was autograph I couldn t ask some questions becuase the old lady repeated good night please good night It seems like she doesn t want to service us no more When I checked the room I found there s no electric kettle We need it for baby milk So I get down to the reception but there no one so I made a phone call The old lady answer the phone and told me it was too late so don t bothering her But it was only 10 10 pm that means only 10 min after I checked in So I asked her we need electric kettle for baby milk But there s no electric kettle and finally she gave me hot water in the vaccum bottle after some arguments and she saying herself hot water hot water seems like she cannot understand why she need to offer hot water to us There s no lid in the bath tub so we had to get only shower but even there s no curtain for shower so it was very difficult to get shower And there s much more , The bed was comfy 
426521,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, 1 Location is questionable Shoenbrunn is NOT walking distance away 15 20 min to the city center by car 2 No parking though hotel staff tells you different They park you at the sidewalk in front of the hotel but parking inspector will be there in the morning expect a ticket 3 NO WIFI yes sometimes you can be lucky to get a very low signal but it is really impossible to be normally connected What I really hated is that the hotel management pretended to call technician after my complaint but in reality they know perfectly well the wifi is not useful and do nothing about it Guys you either fix it or do not advertise having it 4 Breakfast I did not expect much but they succeeded to go below these expectations too Do not count on this meal 5 You need to be ready to climb by stairs to the upper levels no elevator available 6 Somebody here mentioned good service in this hotel I must call it appearance of service it is just a facade I stayed there because of good score on booking In my opinion this hotel does not deserve it , 1 the rooms are spacious space wise no problem to stay with kids 2 good beds 
426522,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The fan was good but air conditioning would have been nice , Rooms were enormous a suite almost Really comfy bed and close to the attractions we wanted to see The breakfast was delicious and generous

426526,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, I had to pay for private parking even if I did not use it because it was full when I came but I booked it online before So do not make online parking around hotel is enough free parking places and you can book it later , Large room and good location 
426527,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Light system not organized to work Please add stronger points of lights system, Personnel kind and ready for each need WIFI strong Room very conforteable Breakfast very reach and tasty
426528,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The girl at the reception was very helpful the woman who was in charge owner not really Metrostation 10 15 min walk with luggage bit far , We had a great room we had booked for a standard double room but they gave us a business suite The room was very big and spotless Very quiet location breakfast ok great coffee

426530,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, The staff tries to trick you all the time We reserved a free parking place Upon arrival the lady said I should park on the street for money As well she insisted we can only have our room at 1PM After I showed our reservation with the free parking place and check in at 11AM we get our room and she asked for the keys of my car to take it to somewhere Next morning she waited for me at breakfast and beforeI could even start to eat she took me to a garage 1 2 kms away to get my car I found out that they accidentally broke my alarm remote control I couldn t turn of the immobilizer She told me that is my problem They neither were able to lock my car so it was there for a full day totally opened in a far location from the hotel Luckily I was able to repair my remote and later I went to my car by foot and was able to recover it After all I said to myself okay we finally could solve all the problem so it s not a big deal She was rude but that happens and she also tried to trick us with the check in time and the free parking but okay that happens as well finally we solved everything BUT after we left booking com informed me that my booking was cancelled the hotel said we didn t show up maybe so I can t even write a review That made me really angry Also you have to pay the full fee in advance , The room was clean and okay After we argued about everything we smiled and she said have a nice travel back home The hotel is in a silent street not really far from the center by public transportation It was cheap so with some friendliness and without the tricks and rude manner this could be a good choice for this price 
426531,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, small missunderstanding with stuff but at the end everything turn out OK, easy to acces and more or less easy to find parking Also it is very near to Sch nbrunn so one atraction can be visited on foot without jamping in car or metro 
426532,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Breakfast was served in the lobby that is also used for check in out A bit of a discomfort Otherwise breakfast offered a large variety of food and beverages , Nicely located near Shonbrunn palace in a quite area Local restaurants nearby We were assigned a two BR suite for a two std BR reservation The suite was large and nicely accommodated our two couples party 
426533,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, Dark narrow street in a questionable neighborhood No elevator No staff to be found when we arrived Tried to charge me upon departure despite the fact that I had prepaid A young man working behind the counter had to explain to owner manager that I had already paid Had to clean a table so we could sit for breakfast Not a great experience Walking to Schoenbrun as advertised would not be an option in this neighborhood Especially toward evening, not much
426534,Hotel Parco di Sch nbrunn Vienna, This hotel is not a four star hotel It may have a leather sofa and minibar in the room but it does not have Reception Anyone who speaks English or German properly Lift Air conditioning Restaurant or bar They will charge you 10 Euro parking but you will park on the street public area The whole staff consist of one russian lady who is in charge of everything She speaks poor English and poor German and is extremely impolite ,No Positive
