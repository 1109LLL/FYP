206625,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The noise from the main road could be heard through the night due to the windows not being double glazed , The staff at reception were extremely friendly and very welcoming The breakfast room was nice and modern and looked out onto the outdoor patio area Breakfast was excellent especially the fruit smoothie delicious

206632,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The room was ground floor at the back with no outlook and too hot A fan was provided but room needs airconditioning It is quite easy to fit an airconditioning unit on a room by room basis For example all USA hotels and motels , Location and general ambiance Breakfast good Staff excellent
206633,The Lodge Hotel Putney, fire alarm being set off at 3 45 am by drunken guests staff at checkout the following day should have made a gesture to make up for the disruption, location and free parking were great new rooms in the extension are very good
206634,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Overall very satisfied with our stay However would have preferred a walk in shower instead of over bath tub Not ideal for older person to climb in and out Unfortunately there wasn t air conditioning A definite must in hot summer conditions So the room became too warm and uncomfortable An electric fan was available This helped a little but obviously couldn t be used through night because of the noise , The Hotel is situated in a good location Fairly quiet and close to tube station and amenities We arrived on a scorching hot day and the staff were very pleasant and considerate providing iced lemon water while we waited for our room to be available The room was fine Very clean Clothing storage was adequate Bedding and towels were spotless 
206635,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Room a bit pokey for the price and had to ask how to use the air con as no instructions air con also noisy , Nice decor and very friendly reception staff Nice bathroom Decent food through room service 
206636,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, The whole experience was very good and the breakfast the next morning was one of the nicest I ve ever had All the staff were friendly and helpful 
206637,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Didn t like that gratuities included as an item on the bills This I feel should be discretionary Lots of choice for breakfast but unfortunately the cooked items were just warm and the coffee was cold You served yourself from a Vacuum pump flask , Very different staff friendly and helpful especially those on reception Building unusual Rooms small but had everything that was needed Dyson air cooler no air con Good coffee machine 
206638,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Nothing , Reception was super friendly and helpful Rooms quiet Nice to have air con iron and ironing board and hair dryer in the room Very much appreciate being able to bring our dog and take her in to breakfast Great value for money Breakfast was delicious Would stay again 
206639,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, Staff were very polite upon arrival Our room although smaller than I anticipated was extremely clean which automatically makes me feel relaxed in a hotel The onsite bar restaurant is fab and I really liked the overall feel and decor of the hotel Would definitely recommend it I also liked that as a genius member I got the perk of having a late checkout free of charge without the 25 late checkout fee 
206640,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Limited parking spaces onsite enough for about 2 3 of the rooms at a guess we found a space but late arrivals may struggle otherwise a perfect hotel, Great service warm welcome and a free upgrade to a small studio suite The whole place was clean well maintained Parking on site and a district line tube station just a 3 minute walk away The area seemed lovely and friendly even when returning after midnight Lots of shops cafe s and quiet bars close to the hotel if you want an alternative to the super facilities offered by the hotel 
206641,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Malbec from the bar was poor quality I don t mind paying 9 for a 175ml glass if it s reasonable quality but this was a little unpleasant Next day we paid the same for a glass of Malbec at the Michelin starred restaurant at the Westbury Alyn Williams and it was far superior , Newly refurbished room Very clean and comfortable
206642,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Air con did not work fans provided still hot in the roof rooms No lift we were up 3 flights of stairs which may not suit all, Staff very friendly and helpful great that there is parking available Good location
206643,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I booked what I understood to be a room with a garden view slightly higher cost but also in the newer building Garden view is a stretch It was more a patch of dirt in front of an impenetrable fence Ultimately it is not a show stopper but either the hotel or booking com has a misleading description of their rooms , This hotel is fine you will be happy here Staff are good restaurant is also good although the wine is a bit pricey 
206644,The Lodge Hotel Putney, We had to change rooms as they put my elderly Mum up three flights of stairs with no lift The bedrooms in the old part of the hotel are very small and airless It was too small and hot for us and we had to change room also The downstairs rooms in the new build are much bigger and better and also 20 per night dearer but worth it ,No Positive
206645,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, The room was very basic not enough blankets and the room was very noisy ovoid hear the phone ringing in another room and people banging around which prevented me from sleeping which was very annoying We checked out very early so we could go home and get some sleep Also the smell in the hotel was awful not sure what it was but not nice at all
206646,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The room was difficult to find right at back of property the late on duty dtaff member didn t seem to want to make any effort to show me to the room Althougb it was late 11 30pm but is it not his Job Breakfast was average not too much choice paying in advance 12 per person or been build on the day as 15 p P is s bit cheeky , The room was nice comfotable clean modern nice to have option of Real coffee Nespresso kettle for herbal teas I think a couple of biscuits would have complimented this Bed comfortable nice linen 
206647,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The door between the bedroom and hallway slammed when it swung closed We had to prop it open to avoid disturbing other guests , Lovely big room very quiet Nice to have a separate dressing room 
206648,The Lodge Hotel Putney, No instructions for fancy coffee machine no instant coffee as alternative either No instructions for air conditioning on one of hottest nights of year Very expensive considering not in central London and no breakfast included Hefty 15 head for breakfast when simple continental breakfast would have been appreciated for price of room, Spacious tastefully furnished room
206649,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, This is great hotel with good facilities friendly staff and located a short walk from the rail network with easy access into The city The free parking was a bonus for a London Hotel and we were allowed to leave the car after the normal checkout time that gave us chance to do more sight seeing 
206650,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Breakfast was not of the standard expected Only one choice of egg fried which were looking like plastic asked for fresh cooked which was ok Coffee needed to get staff to top up container on both mornings Fruit was not good quality pineapple hard and tasteless Service charge in the bar I thought was out of order as prices were typical London prices which were expected but not service charge on top , excellent reception staff Room was comfortable good bed air conditioning excellent 
206651,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, A very comfortable and pleasant hotel The staff were extremely helpful and polite The hotel was far beyond our expectations Very clean modern and comfortable Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel 
206652,The Lodge Hotel Putney, While the breakfast offer was good we thought the coffee dispensed in pump vacuum flasks was rather stewed and fresh coffee would have made all the difference While this is obviously to relieve the staff from serving in an otherwise self service area maybe a self service fresh coffee machine could be the solution For us coffee lovers it would make the breakfast experience perfect , The location was of prime importance direct short journey time rail connection into central London Very pleasant location near riverside walks bars and excellent restaurants Although the property is located on a busy road the South Circular our room was very quiet and overlooked a garden with trees We found the hotel very tranquil and relaxing to return to after our action packed days in town Would stay here again 
206653,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The breakfast staff were quite surly when asked for items that had run out and a request for fresh coffee was met with great reluctance We travelled with 2 suitcases and assorted backpacks all of which had to go on the floor When both suitcases were open there was no room to move , The late checkout was good 
206654,The Lodge Hotel Putney, THE ROOM WAS SO HOT AND STUFFY WHILE SLEEPING OR TRYING TO And the fact it only had a duvetvand no too sheet meant you had to sleep sweating under a pretty warm cover , The hotel location and the ambience was all good 
206655,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Size of the room, We booked a double room which turned out to be extremely small barely had any space to move around with my husband and our dog I would not recommend this hotel or at least not their double rooms Communal areas are nice and clean and the staff welcoming 
206656,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is that our room had the window completely frosted over We thought this might be for privacy but it wasn t particularly overlooked and this can be dealt with by using a net curtain of some sort It made the room feel very claustrophobic especially as the windows only opened partly due to the fact that we were on the 3rd floor , The breakfast was very good It was a helpyourself buffet but very good standard Our room was at the end of a corridor separate from the other rooms on the floor and was therefore very quiet which was lovely 
206657,The Lodge Hotel Putney, People in next room rowing all night even though I rang reception it carried on until they left at 6 in the morning Was offered a free breakfast but unfortunately it was for two my daughter and her partner was staying and we wanted breakfast together shame left me disappointed ,No Positive
206658,The Lodge Hotel Putney, My parents room unfortunately had neighbors who argued and threatened one another all night however their complaint was taken very seriously and a free breakfast was offered which was excellent customer service , I liked the 24 hour reception and staff went above and beyond expectations on arrival to make our stay fantastic 
206659,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Restaurant menu was bizarre Risotto was definitely microwaved as the temperature of it was at a level that you only get from a microwave , They moved me to another room which I actually regretted because it was tired in comparison to the disabled room I just find disabled rooms clinical lacking that homely feel 
206660,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Room service burger was brought after 1 25 hours and although got a call after 30 mins telling me the chef was very busy and my ordered wine would be brought up which I wasn t burger was very good in the end in the morning I mentioned this and my email was taken so half expected some follow up so a nice hotel let down a little by the kitchen , Nice room
206661,The Lodge Hotel Putney, My son and his partner were competing in the London Marathon and requested an early breakfast but the staff said they could not supply it before 7 30 We have stayed in hotels in London before and they have promoted an early Marathon breakfast This spoilt our whole stay as we had to dash out to local supermarket and buy yogurts serial etc for them to fuel up Perhaps you could think again before another year there are 40 000 people competing in this event , Good powerful shower nice to have a fridge in the room 
206662,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Check in even though I had prepaid my stay because I had a new debit card different to the one booked they refunded and then recharged me The recharge would take a couple of days to hit my account which didn t impress me I would have been happier if they had charged me 1 on the new card so that they had insurance backup and not to have inconvenienced me as this took a while to sort out , Well presented 
206663,The Lodge Hotel Putney, You needed a car or taxi to get to the hotel from the train station , The bedroom was well fitted and the bathroom was also well fitted The coffee machine was a nice surprise 
206664,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Unfortunately the door was leaving a lot of noise and light inside the room and the shower was not good I prefer hand showers for personal comfort and hygiene However I would return as a guest and would recommend the property to my friends but the next time I need to make sure to book the executive range , I liked the bed the room and I was delighted of the design and comfort of the room 
206665,The Lodge Hotel Putney, We was woken up by atleast 6am every morning by guests and staff We never recieved half of the facilities stated The staff were very unhelpful when i told them my car had been hit outside the hotel Also got accused of smoking in our room when im 5 months pregnant and the room never smelt , Nothing
206666,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Non feather pillows which were flat hard and very uncomfortable , Lovely boutique hotel Staff fabulous Rooms lovely and fabulous bathrooms Great toiletries and nespresso coffee machines 
206667,The Lodge Hotel Putney, There is refurbishment at the property which didn t disturb us at all However contractors vehicles on site did restrict available parking Although exceptionall clean our bathroom was very small, Friendly staff comfortable bedroom Good hot buffet breakfast Very pet friendly No charges for the dog or car parking 
206668,The Lodge Hotel Putney, initially had trouble parking the car as all spaces were occupied some with contractor vehicles One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was car parking facility Finally had to park outside of a bay very close to the exit almost hanging out over the pavement Bar prices also very steep , Shower and cleanliness of the room
206669,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Only 2 normal tea bags plus 2 green tea Not enough for us even for one night 15 for breakfast was too expensive for us as we were going out for lunch There are plenty of places nearby to get coffee and a croissant , We had a free upgrade to a superior room so probably had a larger room than we booked Lovely and quiet but close to Putney East tube and the shops in Putney High Street Staff were pleasant and friendly but we had minimal interaction as only stayed one night WiFi good in room 
206670,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The tea and coffee facilities were very poor There was no instructions on how to use the coffee maker and no instant coffee to drink as a substitute , The bed was very comfortable
206671,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, Amazing Croissants lovely breakfast Loved that the family room had a separate dressing room Perfect location for using the tube to explore London 
206672,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Noise from planes unavoidable flight paths and guests avoidable notices to remind guests they are sharing the facilities perhaps coming in late etc Will ask for soundproofed aerated room next time perhaps and or comp ear plugs , Being able to leave window ajar for fresh air at night BUT see the consequences in next box 
206673,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Nothing apart from the bar shuts too early for tourists who don t want to go to bed at 11pm , Friendly staff quick check in parking nice and comfortable rooms and pet friendly Location was fabulous too 
206674,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Parking can be an issue limited food selection at the bar or when dining WIFI average at best , Staff always friendly well certainly the afternoon and evening staff always clean and tidy 
206675,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The walls are so thin from 6am onwards we were woken up by footsteps overhead people talking and doors slamming Would not recommend this hotel if you re looking for a good night s sleep ,No Positive
206676,The Lodge Hotel Putney, This time there was some problem with one of the other room habitants They made an awful row during the night There was a police and everything We were not able to sleep Only thing the hotel did was an apologies At least they should have offered us some drinks or free breakfast Some tiny compensation would have been nice , I really like the atmosphere and style of the hotel Very nice and stylish The breakfast is excellent 
206677,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Only minor points here No lift and narrow stairs might be problematic with huge luggage Though the staff offers to help if needed Tube is a bit far from the centre late nighters might find it difficult to come back, Great space tasteful decor Friendly and helpful staff willing to accommodate our needs Free parking and close to tube stations Very quiet and safe residential area around the hotel
206678,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Our room key had to be reset each day which meant a rather long walk back to reception each time We were up two flights of stairs so if you are not very mobile make sure you get a ground floor room , The room was in the new section and good quality Having a Nespresso machine was good 
206679,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Our room was internal so a bit claustrophobic over looked by a hall breakfast dining room so could not open curtains , Love the decor location to centre of Putney the staff are very pleasant 
206680,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The room was tiny and the window looked straight into another room but there were no net curtains or venetian blinds so we had to keep the curtains shut as did all the rooms opposite The floorboards in the corridor and stairs were very noisy and we were woken up at 6am as the door in the corridor made a lot of noise It claims to be stylish but it s a bit less smart once you head down the corridor to the rooms 15 for breakfast is expensive if you only want cereal or toast many hotels offer a continental breakfast for a lower price ,No Positive
206681,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Not a big deal but we got different breakfast than ordered , Underground was close Nice staff 100 professional Breakfast in room for free Free parking 
206682,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Very tight parking form to complete on arrival generally quite noisy ground floor room noise from top floor no soundproofing Very small room bathroom and very small shower cabin No water bottles or water glasses I stayed at Hilton in London for lower price and standard was much higher and breakfast included Breakfast not worth 15 instant coffee toaster wasn t available Only fried eggs I prefer poached Very fat bacon Lots of staff but no table service all self service All small things add up unfortunately Nothing to delight customer quite standard flat approach place , I wasn t expecting anything less but it wasn t exceeding my expectations in any shape or form Quite good bed Very Clean and tidy Good sausage beans and mushrooms plus fresh fruit selection but it could be much improved for this price 
206683,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Nothing to complain about, Location the size of the hotel the nice interior the friendly and helpful staff particularly at reception the setting of the room the corner in the room to work nice table and map the nespresso machine the generous bathroom and great shower nice bath products
206684,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Wordings of minutes from Tube station was deceiving Lodge was located much further took a half hour walk each way Few buses run through the area hence was really inconvenient Pricey for that location and facilities Early check in was promised when requested on Bookin com but asked to pay extra when we arrived Very dishonest we felt So was overall an unpleasant experience , Room was clean 
206685,The Lodge Hotel Putney, No tea making facilities no milk for coffee in the room noisy floor boards and you can hear a lot of the noise from other rooms which is a shame, Nice location and free parking
206686,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Wifi wasn t a great connection , I had a job in the old Library so the location was ideal for me The food in the restaurant was fabulous The staff couldn t be more helpful and the style of decor was also tasteful 
206687,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I was doing work in very center of London Soho so it was a 40 min tube drive in rush hour not that bad for London but if i was a tourist then this would not have been a problem Great hotel , Really nice boutique type hotel
206688,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, Stayed here a number of times and this was definitely the nicest room I ve had not sure if I got upgraded but the room and bathroom were really great In the new wing 
206689,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Dog hair on my bed Requested a pet free room Smelt awfully of the worst air freshener in all areas Truly horrible couldn t breathe Didn t feel safe with window open as it was ground floor and a sash window open to public access area , Good location modern decor
206690,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Nothing, We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel but enjoyed some delicious bar food The staff were extremely pleasant helpful We stayed in room208 which had a comfortable double bedroom with a door through to a twin bedroom Perfect for a family A modern relatively large bathroom with ample towels toiletries We were travelling with our pet dog who was also made welcome Ample free parking for hotel guests We would certainly go back 
206691,The Lodge Hotel Putney, no lift but not mentioned on web, All cheerful n plesant staff New n clean A lady staff knocked n reminded us door not locked properly still left opened a v nice n heartwarming reminder
206692,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I really didn t like the fact that you had to pay for your stay in full during check in I don t remember ever having to pay for a multi day hotel stay in full on check in Normally most good hotels will take your card details and usually block out a certain amount during check in and then you pay your bill on check out but not this one I spoke to the staff about it and they said sorry that s our policy I can only imagine the ownership of the hotel have a low opinion of their guests and they must think their guests will disappear without paying which is a strange assumption given that they take your card details during your booking My position on this is on a point of principle Only dishonest people expect others to be dishonest You have a pretty decent hotel don t ruin the guest experience by tacitly treating guests like scoundrels especially not at the prices you charge for your rooms , It s a lovely boutique hotel close enough to Putney High Street to walk into Putney very easily and even over the bridge into Fulham and Chelsea 
206693,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Some hooks on the bedroom wall would have been very useful , We were in London for our daughter s birthday and she and her boyfriend lived nearby So the location was great The hotel had a quirky charm ad soon ad we saw it The ambience was lively The room was maybe a little small business the bed was very comfortable The breakfasts were very tasty We did not eat a full meal in the restaurant burt on arrival we shared a couple of sit wad easygoing get into central long mall plates which were delicious As well as being close to our daughter it was easy to get into central London We visited Tate modern very easily during our stay There are some great eating places in the neighbourhood of the Lodge 
206694,The Lodge Hotel Putney,No Negative, I stay at this hotel on a regular basis as it s a 3 minute walk from my daughter s flat and provides free parking Putney has lots to offer bars restaurants and shops It s so very easy to get the train into the centre of London or out to Wimbledon The hotel s Garden Rooms are quiet modern and immaculately clean 
206695,The Lodge Hotel Putney, After a long journey being asked to register on the I pad Just not a good idea for our age and eyes at night Just keep it simple , Nice staff Upgraded both rooms We had an executive room in the new building Couldn t fault it Breakfast was good for the 15 For London We were attending a wedding and this hotel worked very well for Wondsworth and Putney Staff were pleasant and very helpful

206701,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I m struggling to find anything The bedroom windows looked out on to brick walls roof but it still had a light and airy feel with fresh modern decor lighting , This is a hidden gem of a boutique hotel in a lovely part of London easy transport links to Central London but in a more suburban area Putney has lots of bars restaurants shops on hand On a summer s day eve it is especially nice down by the river with riverside walks park Putney is served by an overground station into London as well as East Putney Putney Bridge tube stations on the District Line good bus routes The hotel is tastefully decorated to high standards I also managed to book a superior room at a discounted rate making it excellent value for a quality London hotel 
206702,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Tea making facility in bedroom and a bottle of water even if you had to pay for it would be a good thing There is a coffee maker in the room but no coffee sugar milk or cup , Location friendly staff comfy bed

206708,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Ear plugs were needed when staying in room 43 The people above us were very loud chatting and walking on the creaky floor boards until 1am the hotel needs sound proofing , Nice location friendly staff cosy room 
206709,The Lodge Hotel Putney, We had been hoping for a lie in but the fire alarm went off at 6 30am No explanation or apology offered from staff A little more focus on customer service would make this a great place to stay , Great location Comfortable beds and rooms at the back of the hotel are quiet so should offer a good night s sleep 
206710,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Reception staff very good but some restaurant staff not too good inefficient and poor knowledge of the English language We have stayed many times in the main building but were put in one of the new rooms this time and we asked to move because it had one very small window and was dark and claustrophobic , Convenient location as we have family nearby Free parking 
206711,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Wifi very patchy tiny room had cot squashed in was at the end of two flights of stairs even though we had a 6 month old baby you will be charged if you want to check in early which is unusual, Location was great for us parking onsite nice restaurant attached
206712,The Lodge Hotel Putney, We booked the property because it advertise free parking When we arrived there were no parking spaces available There were not enough Parking spaces for the hotel advertise free parking without a warning There was only extremely limited street parking in the area with a 2 hour limit we had to park in a multi storey car park quite a distance away There is no way I would have booked this hotel if I had know there was really no chance of getting parked , Reasonably spacious room decent bathroom and shower
206713,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The fact that you can t order room service after 9 30pm because the kitchen had closed room service should be available until later , Great location when visiting the tennis at Wimbledon 
206714,The Lodge Hotel Putney, As the nights were warm we had to open the windows and the road it s on is very busy with traffic passing throughout the night Very noisy which woke me a view times This is my only negative comment about the hotel, Loved the style of the hotel Great location for us going to Wimbledon

206716,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Overall no problems with the room Was exceptionally clean and had plenty of storage Unfortunately the room was very noisy Sound from the tv in room next door was very loud Not ideal when trying to sleep Also floor of above room made annoying loud creaking noises everytime the occupants moved about Hopefully the staff would have provided a quieter room if I had been staying longer , Lovely hotel set in a quiet area Was exceptionally clean and had plenty of storage The staff were friendly and very helpful A short walk to the tube station made it ideal for commuting Especially to Wimbledon for the Tennis 
206717,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The bed is small OK for one person but small for two , Location is perfect for me and the parking is a real bonus I have stayed a number of times and the new rooms have realy made a positive difference to the hotel

206719,The Lodge Hotel Putney, The space where you got your breakfast , Breakfast was good and fresh but the area where you got your breakfast was very tight for space and we had to squeeze past others as it is such a large dining room the hot tray area and tea coffee should be moved 
206720,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I queried the fact there was only a shower and no bath and was told I should have made a specific request for a bath to the hotel even though my reservation with booking com stated bath and shower I was very unhappy with their response , VERY comfy bed
206721,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Rooms stuffy Windows to a patio smelling of food No air conditioning There was a storm and the electricity collapsed You have to pay in advanced and the staff is very unhelpful A total sham for the price Much better off if you pay for a holiday inn in wandsworth, Nothing

206749,The Lodge Hotel Putney, I would rather have a kettle than a coffee pod machine as I prefer a cup of tea but the pods for coffee are easy to use , Easy parking and location near East Putney underground making it easy to get into central London for a day out

206754,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Didn t think the room should have been called executive more of a standard room there was not a lot of space and it was very gloomy other than the bathroom The water was tepid in the morning due to a fault for which the Receptionist apologised It would have been a nice gesture to have been offered a cup of coffee at least as a gesture There were no instructions on how to use either the phone or the coffee machine in our room , It is in a very convenient area for us and we always stay at The Lodge when we visit family there 
206755,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Noise from road No kettle in room Confusion over booking being cancelled but I hadn t cancelled it , Room sizes cleanliness and staff Location

206757,The Lodge Hotel Putney, First night Room located at the front ground floor very noisy due to traffic Also no cold water from bathroom sink only hot and very hot I explained this to the receptionist on my return 2nd night and after finding another room where the lighting did not work she allocated a room on the other side of the hotel new area which was excellent , Great location and really nice staff
206758,The Lodge Hotel Putney, No phones in newer rooms VERY low lintel in corridor leading to newer ground floor rooms Both my son and I felt the quality of the RSJ we are tall 6 2 and 6 3 but not unusually so these days No options for tea drinkers in the room and no room service option without a phone My grown up children had rm 14 which appears to have a very thin dividing from the room next door having been full audio participants with their nighttime neighbours after dark exercises , Great location with Putney East Station just a 5 min walk from the front door Clean rooms and very nice shower bathroom Staff were very friendly 
206759,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Big family room but small bathroom one at a time Not much screening ground floor room from outside walkway, Parking on site Friendly and responsive staff Style

206761,The Lodge Hotel Putney, Wasn t a bad experience but due to work being carried on hotel the corridors were dusty from work dust and visually not very pleasing We were told that we had been upgraded from Executive to Superior Executive no idea what that meant the room did not warrant being described as Superior Executive XNo bath was expecting one No kettle or tea facilities in the room Bed was extremely HARD , Good location to where we were visiting

206770,The Lodge Hotel Putney, It s was clear some of the staff didn t understand what we were saying which made things difficult Especially when ordering food which always turned up wrong and usually cold Burger first night was extremely undercooked Then pancakes were rubbery and lukewarm but the worst was the English breakfast which turned up completely cold Really disappointing as it s a nice hotel The staff are helpful I can t even speak another language so I appreciate most of the staff trying but I think that it is important to have staff in a hotel in England that can understand English properly , Very clean comfortable and the staff were friendly

206773,The Lodge Hotel Putney, 1 language was something of a barrier and some staff did not understand English 2 breakfast was over valued 12 pounds for continental and 15 for a cooked lot to pay if you just want a cup of coffee and a piece of toast 3 room not properly serviced ie no toilet paper no soap but plenty of shampoo which we did not use and accumulated during the 5 days we were there, The Lodge is an average hotel There wasn t a great deal to like about it
206774,The Lodge Hotel Putney, We have always stay at the lodge when visiting Putney All the rooms we have stayed in in the past have been great But this time it was the complete opposite on this occasion Very noisy from the room above Just foot steps back and forth across the room and planes from early hours of the morning Where the rooms at the front of the hotel are very quite Also a little disappointed about the building work still going on when we were told it would be finished by now This impacts the number of parking spaces that is the most unique selling point to staying at the Lodge with free parking Where we have found the Premier Inn over the bridge for the same price including the parking charge with more parking spaces available , We will always stay at the lodge when visiting Putney All the rooms we have stayed in in the past have been great But this time it was the complete opposite on this occasion
