315636,Grand Hotel Downtown, I am picking hairs as it was fab room slightly small compared to balcony and no teaspoons only wooden sticks, Great balcony with amazing views Modern spacious room Nice location close to town but more local feel
315637,Grand Hotel Downtown, Air conditionning we felt cold even at the max temperature 25 C One of the receptionists gave us false or inappropriate indications, We liked the breakfast The position of the hotel was great several tram lines go through the hotel road If you prefer biking you can rent some in the hotel Reception 24 7 with a lot of services available such as museums tickets tram tickets etc 
315638,Grand Hotel Downtown, Family room beds wasn t ready Super expensive car park and u have to pay for extra for later i think 40 for car park is too much , Good location and clean room
315639,Grand Hotel Downtown, Busy mornings you have to wake up early to get the full breakfast They try to fill the finishing foods but it may be better for such 4 star hotel , Location is perfect if you are aiming to visit the park museums and at the same time close enough to the center of city this is a perfect hotel Rooms are in the first floor since the upper floors are penthouses windows looking for the interior garden Rooms are clean quite and peaceful to rest but just ten minutes walk you are in the center of the city We love that part so much Beds are so comfortable so you can rest the whole day of walking by sleeping at nights Bathroom and shower is also clean new and perfect Breakfast is good enough for such a hotel 
315640,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room was not cleaned on the second day of our stay I contacted reception twice before fresh towels and toiletries were delivered but used towels were left in bathroom and bins were not emptied ,No Positive
315641,Grand Hotel Downtown, It would be great to add a portable ceiling Garden Umbrella on the terrace Penthouse rooms to protect from rain which will greatly allow guests to enjoy the terrace during rainy days The price during high season is just too pricey and it should be reconsidered given that the rooms are getting old and require full maintenance and renovation , Location is great very nice shops and restaurants around close by most attractions Public transportation stops are just few steps away This is my third time staying at the hotel and I would highly recommend it 
315642,Grand Hotel Downtown, Each day we had to ask for tea and milk and our room although was nice enough could have been sorted better TV was not too good , Excellent location 20 mins walk to the Museum Quarter Very good value Would recommend 
315643,Grand Hotel Downtown, The hotel rooms weren t extremely clean the floor was gritty and the room was dusty and the duvets had hairs on them but the room was presented nicely Do not waste your money buying breakfast as it is extremely limited and although the food was in a warmer it was all stone cold , It was modern with excellent Wi Fi and it was very quiet Good aircon in rooms Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating and you could buy tickets for public transport and trips like the canal trips via the reception at discount prices The hotel is a 5 minute walk from 2 main tram lines 
315644,Grand Hotel Downtown, everything ok the location is a bit worse than hotels we stayed previously but also the price is much lower but still everything is in walking distance, nice clean enough space helpful front desk
315645,Grand Hotel Downtown, There isn t really much of a common area Which I think is always a great thing to have , The private rooftop terrace was beautiful and definitely a nice place to get away Bed was comfortable and well suited to our needs 
315646,Grand Hotel Downtown, We booked two double rooms and paid for extra square meterage The rooms were very unequal in size and it was not possible for our friends in the smaller room to be moved to a room of equal size to ourselves,No Positive
315647,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room smelt badly of sewage when we first arrived the air con helped but the windows wouldn t open I think it was a tad overpriced as well for the location , The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very spacious Shower was powerful 
315648,Grand Hotel Downtown, The king bed was actually a queen bed and was done from 2 single beds that were split during the night The minibar was empty at 4 star hotel this is not acceptable at breakfast we arrived at 10 15 when they close at 10 30 and we asked bread and vegetables because there were not anymore and the answer was that they close at 10 30 it s late and they have to check what they have also the bread was mixed from that day and from previous one leftovers Tables in breakfast area were crowded no place to pass without disturbing people that were eating No smoking area you need to smoke in front of the hotel Overall quite disappointing experience , The room overall was looking quite nice and arranged just like in the pictures 
315649,Grand Hotel Downtown, Very small room but perfect for us being on the go most of the day , Was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam Were out and about most of the day so was great to sleep in a comfortable and clean room in the evenings 
315650,Grand Hotel Downtown, Thre pictures show a big hotel but it is just some rooms in the first floor The room was little and cold Bed was uncomfortable and creaked after every movement The cleanliness is in the bottom it smells bad in the bathroom It seemed to us like a 2 star hotel , The only thing to be liked about this hotel was its location 
315651,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room and bathroom are very small and unpleasant poor location It s just a shame that a hotel like this has 4 stars you do not deserve such a 2 star hotel at a maximum a very expensive price , Breakfast good
315652,Grand Hotel Downtown, That was quite expensive 167 Euro per night for such a small and basic hotel , The Turkish receptionist was very helpful The room was a bit small but comfortable Also bathroom was small In fact there is not more things to say about the hotel but it was above average 
315653,Grand Hotel Downtown, Prices for the additional services are unreasonably high breakfast late check out mini bar We didn t have windows which could be opened so it was quite stuffed Bathroom doesn t have a fan so the towels didn t dry at all , The hotel overall and the nearby area is very nice Location is perfect
315654,Grand Hotel Downtown, Our bedroom was the smallest we have ever stayed in we struggled to get our suitcase open to unpack It was a ground floor room but the windows were locked closed so not possible to let any fresh air into the room Breakfast was just Ok not a great variety of either cold or hot food not what you would expect from a hotel with a 4 star rating , The hotel location was very good the area in general was great for restaurants bars etc and only a 15min walk into the city centre 
315655,Grand Hotel Downtown, We had a problem with the temperature in the room Very cold uncomfortably cold the front desk came in and agreed They would not escalate the issue to management We left so they could resolve the issue Instead we got a room heater We used it sparingly In addition the light bulbs were out so it was very dark I felt management missed the mark since a large Grand Hotel was 3 or 4 miles away , The bed was nice as were some of the decorations There was a frig for snacks and lunches The room was well designed Large bathroom Wifi is crucial when you are foreign traveler There were times the wifi was challenging 
315656,Grand Hotel Downtown, I thought that paying 222 per night for a hotel allegedly 4 star rated with no facilities was excessive A specific area of dissatisfaction was having to persuade the cleaning staff to service my room at 5 30 pm and this is something I never encountered before in any hotel, Nothing really
315657,Grand Hotel Downtown, We booked a double room and the bed pulled apart into two twin beds A staff member moved us from room to room several times We also called for an iron which came an hour later and then they had the nerve to charge us more late check out when in fact it was their fault Furthermore there was no supervisior or manager on the premises to deal with our problems Appalled by the service ,No Positive
315658,Grand Hotel Downtown, I have been travelling in all Continents and I really doubt that the Grand Hotel Downtown is a 4 Stars worth The lighting in the bathroom and in the bedroom were poor very poor The size of the bedroom should be informed in detail in advance in the Internet site eg 16 m2 in order to avoid surprises and a bad experience from the very beginning of the stay in Amsterdam The shower was stucked and we had a flood the first morning The speed of the Wifi was slow very slow, The breakfast was OK but never in a range of a 4Star Hotel The young people in the reception were friendly and cordial 
315659,Grand Hotel Downtown, Checkout procedure was awful we were asked to provide a copy of my mothers passport and credit card because she booked the trip despite the fact that she was at work in England this was totally unnecessary given that we had paid in full when we made the booking Not something I would expect for a 4 hotel, Room was big
315660,Grand Hotel Downtown, the beds were really close together , The property was near tram lines that we easy to get around A little bit out of the main area but in a lovely neighbourhood Useful for the museumplein 
315661,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room service was temperararely unavailable which was disappointing as my partner wanted to get me breakfast in bed for my birthday on mo day it instead had to pay 75 for some balloons and a bottle of champagne,No Positive
315662,Grand Hotel Downtown, Small room for a penthouse suite Balcony was not private Tv signal was poor quality on most channels No hotel bar Definitely over priced , Very comfortable bed Great view over the city Lovely all you can eat continental breakfast 12 50 pp 
315663,Grand Hotel Downtown, The housekeeping didn t change the bed sheets regularly as i stayed for 6 nights, The room was very nice spacious friendly and helpful staff The exhaust in the bathroom wasn t working but that wasn t abig deal Good breakfast 
315664,Grand Hotel Downtown, No information about city tax 5 which isn t included in price Too expensive breakfast we used excellent and cheaper breakfast bistro with great local food offer five minutes from hotel , Helpfull staff good place for exploring Amsterdam by walk many attraction is close to hotel or available by walk 20 minutes to Dam square Parking place underr hotel paid but acceptable price 
315665,Grand Hotel Downtown, The hotel is 3 star at best I have never experienced a 4 star rated hotel with such a small room to which you have to go in narrow corridors Breakfast was disappointing little choice no fresh bread,No Positive
315666,Grand Hotel Downtown, Rooms were simply too small the hotel is in no way a 4 star hotel using positive glasses it would be a 3 star hotel The rate per night however corresponded to a 4 star hotel , Location was good 
315667,Grand Hotel Downtown, That I only booked two nights , Love the breakfast although a little more hot food would round it off wonderfully Exceptional view Great staff We will be back 
315668,Grand Hotel Downtown, Asbolutly nothing i would complain about There was a thow blanket on the bed with a stain would have been better to not have it out than stained Not sure I would say it was a 4 hotel honestly but everything was nice and would definitely visit again , The bed was very comfortable and bathroom of a high standard Staff were friendly 
315669,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room sizes are inconsistent and twice I used a free cancellation booking and the property charged my card for a night , I have stayed in this propertyabout 6 times during the past year I like it a lot mainky because of the location 
315670,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room is small there is no window in the room you can t get fresh air Lots of noise from the corridor no sound isolation No room service at hotel except breakfast time Staff were arrogant Not a good value for money , Surroundings are not touristic calm but still not far away from main attractions Bed was very comfy 
315671,Grand Hotel Downtown, D lig frukost lite att v lja mellan ej gr nsaker korvarna och ggstanningen var kalla Inget att v lja p i detta prisklass vad vi fick betala Ingen spegel I rummet bara I toa ej helkropp SMUTSIG TERASS grannens terass var det skr p fr n Mc donalds ingen bodde d r d D lig belysning gick inte att l sa bok , S ngen bekv m 
315672,Grand Hotel Downtown, Our room was on the ground floor its was a little smaller than expected and didn t have any windows which could be opened as a result the room was uncomfortably warm and stuffy Air conditioning was very noisy and not affective , Good location for Dam square Central station Nice staff clean rooms great shower and free wifi work well 
315673,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room was way way too small we were bashing our elbows on the bedside tables and wardrobe Either side of the bed was no more than 2 feet very clostraphobic actually The telephone was fixed to the wall right of the bed as you look towards the bed so when you were laid in bed you had to crane your neck to see it which was poor , room was lovely and clean location was great staff friendly and helpful Great restaurants close by plus all the main Amsterdam attractions 
315674,Grand Hotel Downtown, My one and only complaint was their room service schedule They make the rooms first for new guests first then they do the stay overs We were always in the room getting ready for dinner at 4 30 5 00 when they wanted to come So we never had our room cleaned and had to get fresh towels and sheets from the front desk Room service in the late afternoon is way to late for our standards , View off the private balcony quietness of the room the hotel breakfast was very good 
315675,Grand Hotel Downtown, I thought overall the room was too small and cramped for the price I had payed It should have been labelled Penthouse room rather than suite Our bed was two singles pushed together The bathroom didn t have a fan and all the walls were pretty thin so it s not so private On arrival the room was very dirty which definitely was not a good first impression , The balcony was beautiful you could see the whole city that s pretty much what your paying for The room was well decorated equipped the same goes for the bathroom Overall the room had a good layout and had a nice ambiance however it was nothing spectacular The location on the otherhand is great close to nice Bars restaurants and not that far from the city Tram lines are also close and the Breakfast was decent 
315676,Grand Hotel Downtown, The brown beige wall paper in the bedroom lame reason , Staff were very friendly and accommodating Also the hotel had a great aroma in the reception 
315677,Grand Hotel Downtown, Would have liked a double bed instead of two single beds pushed together also matress was to hard for my liking, Lovely clean hotel with friendly staff who helped with any questions we had
315678,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room and facilities such as the tee bolier and coffee machine was very dirty I put a sign for the cleaning lady asking to please clean the dust and dirtiness but when I came back to room the sign was gone but she did not clean it she left it as it was very disapointing The room was also very small , The location was perfect many restaurants around and connection to the centre by tram or bus The staff is very nice and willing to help and recommend you places to go eat at and visit 
315679,Grand Hotel Downtown, The rooms are quite noisy There are no disturb or make up my room signs on the door so they come to clean pretty much anytime they want Check in time is late , The room is nice and clean The location is good as well The prices are reasonable 
315680,Grand Hotel Downtown, We ordered a small double room with Booking com and you then ticked whether you wanted a twin room or double bed As I was travelling with my partner I ticked a double bed but we ended up with two single beds put together which meant you got a dip in the middle and then you ended up with a back ache I mentioned this on the first morning of our stay and was told they would swap it for a double bed I was then happy When we returned later that night the beds had not been changed so I then went back the following morning to mention it again The Manager then came to have a look and they said they can t guarantee you a double bed as they only had eight double beds throughout the hotel and they didn t have any available so we was stuck with it She said she has never had this complaint before I said that was the options available to us They would not offer a refund but they were very sorry No complimentary water in our room on arrival as stated There could be more choice for breakfast , Staff were very helpful and friendly The room was nice and clean 
315681,Grand Hotel Downtown, I would never recommend this hotel absolutely rubbish Bottom floor with a window next to a park Dirty rooms terrible beds Shower floods , This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at and therefore there was nothing to like 
315682,Grand Hotel Downtown, wifi wasn t great rooms are quite small door lock in the toilets didn t work right Heating system wasn t great was extremely hot or cold at times , Clean Rooms Close to supermarkets coffee shops and bakeries option to store luggage on the day of check out
315683,Grand Hotel Downtown, Breakfast wasn t great at all and bed was extremely uncomfortable, The view from the apartment balcony terrace was amazing and the room was a good size
315684,Grand Hotel Downtown, Breakfast could have had more variety but only slight complaint , View was great staff were friendly and helpful Location was perfect when you know your way Would definitely recommend and come back 
315685,Grand Hotel Downtown, The pillow wasn t the comfiest but that is the only thing I can pick with this hotel , Staff were friendly location was great and rooms were lovely Cleanliness was fantastic and complementary water and chocolate was a lovely touch plus as we stated it was our anniversary the extra touch of heart towels on the bed was fantastic Thank you for a great stay 
315686,Grand Hotel Downtown, Privacy in the penthouse suites is comprised by the adjoining suites balcony offering excellent views into your room the full length curtains do afford some privacy but then the view is lost , View from Penthouse Terrace was great nice little fridge in room Wet room soaker shower and decent toiletries in bathroom Very very quiet hotel and location only a minutes walk from main bus and tram stops though these aren t always necessary though as the park and museums are only a 10 minute walk away and in the other direction the old town is only 20 minutes walk away a walk that takes you along countless canals and bridges My room itself had a canal view the canal being 50m from the hotel 
315687,Grand Hotel Downtown, When we arrived we were due to pay for the hotel which was 387 as we were not able to pay upon booking We got charged over 400 which was a crafty move We also requested a double bed as we are a couple and got two twin beds It was not a busy time and feel this simple request could have been met The room itself was situated on the ground floor about 5 steps away from a school playground We had to get ready in the dark as our curtains could not be opened or all the screaming kids in the playground would be able to come watch us getting changed The lighting in the hotel room was appaling so we were mainly in darkness as we did not want people passing by or the school children peering in The noise was unbearable and the location was awful I would never recommend this hotel The cleaner did not replace the coffee and left cleaning products in the room We felt very undervalued and that we had been given the worst room in the hotel which should not be used I have nothing good to say apart from the reception had a nice smell ,No Positive
315688,Grand Hotel Downtown, i stayed in one room on the ground floor and i could listen the passant people outside also the insulation between the rooms in ground floor is not good, nice location
315689,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room was really very small I ask for adapter for english charger and first time they didnt have and when i asked second time I had to found and adapter didnt work Our room was in ground floor and sometimes people walking around look inside in room So It was not very good , Room was Nice and clean 
315690,Grand Hotel Downtown, This hotel did not have a bar and didn t serve alcohol this is the first hotel I ve stayed in were this has been the case very disappointed , The bed was very comfy and the view from the terrace was amazing Great location too walking distance from everywhere we wanted to be 
315691,Grand Hotel Downtown, The penthouse was a little bit cold on a night time but it was 5 outside to be fair and the staff gave us extra blankets when asked , We have stayed here in the past and we like the layout of the hotel It feels like you are staying in your own apartment rather than a hotel although the staff are always on hand if you should need them The hotel is in a great location 10 minutes stroll of Leidseplein the museums and the great shops on the 9 streets All in all its a great little hotel 
315692,Grand Hotel Downtown, When arrived had to ask room service for extra things as was 2 in a room only one of each items was left also second day when return from day out room was done but no toilet tissue or normal hanky tiessue was replaced so yet again called for more things This I was not happy with but after speaking to manager faiza she was helpful extremely sorry for this But I can t fault how she handled it But there was a few improvements that they could work on in regards to basic customer service like when there was no food on the Monday which bare in mind Mondays they don t serve food there was no help from the lady on reception that day I did explain this to manager wasn t happy to try order everything was in Dutch but there was options for staff to help you but I wasn t offered this that s why I say manager faiza was apologetic , Not all helpful staff but one lady at reception who s name I never caught But was there when I checked in very helpful compared to other members of staff who when I went to order food was told Monday there closed had to spend money on taxi to dam square which is only around 15 mins walking a nice walk but when u go for a break you don t expect to have to do that when I just wanted to relax in my room order room service 
315693,Grand Hotel Downtown, This is a three star hotel charging four star prices The rooms are very poorly sound proofed so you can hear other guests yelling at each other in adjacent rooms and staff yelling down the corridors seriously why is everybody having a 24 7 shouting match in this hotel The blinds don t close properly letting light through all night long So much for a good night s sleep There was an unleasant sulfurous smell in the bathroom and the seal on the shower door is broken Which means any time you take a shower you ll inevitable flood the entire bathroom Lots of other comments mentioned this problem but the hotel apparently can t be bothered to fix this Commitment anyone Staff didn t seem very welcoming at check in They did their jobs but seemed to just be going through the motions The building also has an austere unwelcoming feel which I can t quite put my finger on I really only chose this hotel because I needed someplace to stay for the holidays that was within easy distance of the relatives I wanted to visit in Amsterdam This hotel met those needs but I wouldn t stay there again Even if you account for the holiday season s inflated prices I feel like I paid far too much for what this hotel delivers , Having shops and eateries nearby was convenient The hotel is located close to two different tram stop which makes getting around easy The beds were pretty comfy 
315694,Grand Hotel Downtown, There was no breakfast included option , Beds were super comfy hotel is very modern and chic Quite close to tram station Area is nice and full of cafes and restaurants 
315695,Grand Hotel Downtown, Sheets didn t fit the bed and although freshly changed I felt they still weren t really clean , Location is good peaceful but lots within walking distance Some nice places to eat nearby Great view 
315696,Grand Hotel Downtown, My shower head was very dirty so cudnt use the shower the 3 days I was thier which was a bad experience as its really dangerouse to have such a dirty shower, The bed was very comfortable and clean
315697,Grand Hotel Downtown, Could have been a bit cleaner for example half drunk champagne bottle left outside from previous guests and quite alot of dust in the room other than that everything else was exceptional, Location room bed view food staff
315698,Grand Hotel Downtown,No Negative, Modern room we stayed in the penthouse suite with balcony On arrival we actually had two balconys which was a nice surprise Very nice would defiantly recommend In a great location also Great view from roof 
315699,Grand Hotel Downtown, Check in was slow Room wasn t ready for the 3pm check in Probably a one off , The bed was extremely comfy Great sleeping Views from the Penthouse was amazing Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful Good location close to the main museums but not too busy around it with easy tram access 
315700,Grand Hotel Downtown, Would of liked breakfast to be included in the price as was over 200 euros a night , Lovely hotel large penthouse suite was beautiful with a huge roof terrace located just outside of central in a beautiful location
315701,Grand Hotel Downtown, A dining room for evening meals would have been better Not many restaurants nearby , God size bedroom clean bathroom with good quality towels plentiful hot water with good pressure in the shower
315702,Grand Hotel Downtown, The stuff could be nicer The room is dark Not a real 4 stars hotel, The location is great Near a tram station and just few stops from the downtown and the train station
315703,Grand Hotel Downtown, The ceiling was leaking so we called down reception to get it fix but all they did was wipe the water up with a towel which we had already been doing Made the most infuriating dripping noise when trying to sleep but we were only there for a few more nights and didn t want a different room so we dealt with it, The room was spacious but the terrace was massive Gave me and my sister a beautiful view over Amsterdam
315704,Grand Hotel Downtown, This is not a 4 hotel Poor service after the room had been made up I had to ask for tea milk and toilet roll No facilities you can t get a coffee unless you make it in your room Bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were lumpy and very old Very noisy at night from other guests in the hotel poor soundproofing Door handle falling off the bathroom and fixing in the bathroom fell of the wall , I can t think of anything good to say
315705,Grand Hotel Downtown, Pillows breakfast eggs and fruit were finished an hour before the end of breakfast time Check in is at 3pm , Location and staff very friendly Bathroom was roomy Good size of family room 
315706,Grand Hotel Downtown, Had to wait for check in for 3 hours Flies and mosquitoes in the room The size of room is extremely small No iron desk The staff in the reception forgot to call me taxi ,No Positive
315707,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room was dirty and had huge stains on the ceiling The hotel was fully booked that night so we could only move on the next day We were not granted any discount for that night While moving to another room we forgot two T Shirts on the bed They were never found New room was in better condition but in detail still not good e g heavily torn curtains One single staff member was not capable of replenishing the breakfast buffet even though there was a minimum amount of fresh products , Location is great Easy access by tram Stunning view of the city from the top floors 
315708,Grand Hotel Downtown, The shower could have been bigger , Clean tidy and friendly hotel Welcoming staff Good choice for breakfast Quiet and relaxing atmosph re Convienent for transport to all area s of Amsterdam Would recommend without hesitation Very enjoyable stay
315709,Grand Hotel Downtown, A bit complicated to get in out of the parking , My room was a nice Penthouse not big not tiny either It included a roof deck with furnishings a great view The weather wasn t nice enough to enjoy the deck but that isn t their fault The neighborhood is peaceful elegant about a 15 minute walk to the center THe WLAN is fast free Parking was 25 ok I guess breakfast was 15 You must reserve parking 
315710,Grand Hotel Downtown,No Negative, Stayed in room 106 which was on the ground floor the room was beautiful Lovely layout with everything we needed in Would definitely recommend and would love to return myself 
315711,Grand Hotel Downtown, Every time I re entered the building through reception I was asked if I was staying in the hotel One time I was even grab stopped whilst walking to my room Probably due to my age As I m 21 and from what it seemed I was the youngest staying in the hotel Felt a little discriminated against I had complaints of being loud after only being there for less than 30 mins Also Mondays they do not have room service the one day I was there and was not told of this If you re looking for a balcony you can smoke and relax on cannabis Forget it as you will be kicked out from the hotel according to posters and letters left everywhere another policy I did not know of until arriving I also was told it would be 35 euros by reception when I first arrived for addition checking out time to then being charged 45 euros when I went to purchase , The view from my room 
315712,Grand Hotel Downtown, The bad thing was the room cleaning I arrived in the hotel in the 2nd day at 15 00 and the room hadn t been cleaned The room is small but confortable The pillows must improve In general was a good stay Recommended , The hotel is new and everything is clean Close to Amesterdam downtown and couple steps from Vondelpark Public transportation to downtown in front of the hotel and a lot of restaurants around Breakfast is fair Staff is friendly and helpful 
315713,Grand Hotel Downtown, Large penthouse were a lot smaller than I thought it would be it s more like a normal double room it was a long walk from centre would say to get 1 much closer not worth the price,No Positive
315714,Grand Hotel Downtown, The shower was a bit faulty and the breakfast really was not worth paying for as it was cold the majority of the days we were there We were on the ground floor right next to a college which was quite noisy in the morning ,No Positive
315715,Grand Hotel Downtown, Victim of unfair delivery Blaming games more than recovery Counter claims on the sleepless nights Totally unaccepted situations that was not addressed with calls and even hand written of constructive feedback 1 Twin Bedding 2 Faulty Toilet Door 3 The Shower Bar Dropoff Without words of recovery at all , Not Applicable
315716,Grand Hotel Downtown, Show fitting broken shower pressure too low the room was in the back of the hotel and dark No clean towels provided until asked for Noisy as could hear the doors closing along the corridor Late checkout was disproportionately expensive Breakfast expensive , the bed was very good All facilities provided in the room 
315717,Grand Hotel Downtown, I recently stayed for 4 nights and over all I enjoyed my stay but I would not stay again The first thing and the main problem is the sewage smell in the bathroom that is so bad it stenches through your hotel room and on to all your belongings Having asked about it and waiting for room service I had to reask before someone came to my room Very efficiently they lifted the drains in the bathroom and proceeded to bleach the pipes a common thing they tell me although it isn t stated on their website The smell went but would still come back so rather than uphold my holiday plans any further by waiting I would advise to squeeze bleach or shampoo down the shower grill on a regular basis or you will never enter the bathroom again Even the cleaners were gagging I also wasn t aware that you share the hotel with residents people that actually reside in the building on a regular basis and directly next door is a mental institution so be aware again that when you book you may be accosted by these people on your travels they mean no harm but it is very daunting if you are not comfortable with these situations The hotel offers room service but not with breakfast which I found surprising and as a private person who didn t want to join others for breakfast I could not find any where near that did a good English breakfast However Cafe Bratavia on central station do one to die for you must try it and only 9 50 The room was cold the tv only has Dutch channels very scarce to find an English programme and you only get cushions to sleep on not pillows If we sat on our balcony we could see the people in the room next door use their toilet as the bathroom is directly in the window where we sit I was forced to inform the gentleman that I had seen everything when he went to the toilet It is not an ideal situation and very inappropriate , The blonde lady on reception is very friendly and courteous
315718,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room was very cold No way to turn on heating It comes on automatically in evening Location was ok Thought it was nearer the city centre It wasn t walking distance as described Reception staff not very helpful or friendly Felt they were blunt at times , Nice shower Good wifi
315719,Grand Hotel Downtown, A bit far to walk to anything interesting for my liking However a taxi can solve that The staff and room and overall atmosphere was wonderful nonetheless I will be back soon , Every thing was excellent 
315720,Grand Hotel Downtown, nothing, The staff was amazingly helpful especially the blond girl during the afternoon time I asked to send me to a very nice place with real Dutch food and could not be better Also always telling us the best way to get around Love my first time in Amsterdam and will be back Would stay again at the hotel
315721,Grand Hotel Downtown, One colleague checked in later than myself and the others and the guy at reception just started his shift was presented with a problem someone else had checked into my colleague s room The receptionist was not professional He did nothing to make my colleague feel at ease if anything he gave the impression that this guy had stolen her identity which was incredibly worrying and it took an hour to sort out so my colleague could go to bed in another room having confirmation that her details were no longer associated with that other room that a mystery guy was in , The bed was comfy although the duvet was very thin and the bathroom was nice
315722,Grand Hotel Downtown, The hotel was clean in the public areas but our room was a bit grubby and our beds were never made properly jusy a douvet pull up over a crumpled sheet and the pillows were not even shaken , Location great we were able to walk to the Van Gogh Museum and the trams were very near to travel to the main areas The reception staff and restaurant staff were excellent Polite and helpful 
315723,Grand Hotel Downtown, I travelled with a couple of colleagues and overall it was good albeit the WIFI was not too good in room 102 great in 128 but no real worries , Reception staff are really nice and helpful and I get up very early in the morning and made use of the coffee machine well before getting breakfast
315724,Grand Hotel Downtown, Nothing, Comfortable room Great location Super breakfasts Very friendly and helpful staff Nice neighborhood not too touristy Nice local bars and restaurants across the street 
315725,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room was far too small for two people With less that 2 feet on either side of the bed and a space to squeeze through only for one person between desk and bed and no room anywhere to put suitcases or anything on a table it was more like a large closet than a hotel room so that the room size belies the name of the hotel and for this reason seems quite overpriced The bathroom and especially the shower was very small Also we asked for a wake up call but that request was ignored and the telephone in the room did not work , The room was exceptionally clean and the service staff quite accommodating and friendly The front desk staff were very helpful when we asked for assistance The bed was comfortable and the location is excellent

315728,Grand Hotel Downtown, Thin walls so you could hear the neighbours clearly Underwhelming when paying top prices for a penthouse suite Shower drain clogged Staff slow to respond to call for help of Flood Very slow when checking in even with no other patrons to deal with , The shower in the penthouse was clogged and water overflowed out of the shower We had to fix the problem initially and used all our room towels to sop up the water sabing the hotel operator tens of thousands of dollars They didn t even bring us more towels 
315729,Grand Hotel Downtown, Breakfast could be better with more varieties of fruit Didn t like the cereals available They should have a better quality mix muesli type The hot dishes also should include some bacon baked tomato and mushrooms As hot dishes there was basically scrambled eggs and sausages , Decent room and good confortable bed Location is very good not too central not too far away from the most busy streets

315731,Grand Hotel Downtown, The shower head in Rm 605 needs to be fixed Also the water tens to run out of the shower and floods the bathroom May need better insulation The front desk in the evening was unmanned The receptionist was too interested in his phone , The location of the hotel was great and convenient to getting around The hotel area was clean with shops and places to eat The room was large and the penthouse suite was fabulous The city views were phenomenally uplifting The maid did an excellent job The room was cleaned well Loved the wood floors and d cor of the room It was very eclectic and warm

315734,Grand Hotel Downtown, Not really value for money and tiny room for a 4 star average facilities Staff cold tot very welcoming Air conditioning was very noisy we complained they fixed it they knew about it but not fixed before we checked in When we left we got trapped in the carpark wit several other people for an hour because the gate was stuck reception staff told us to go in the carpark instead of offering some comfort in reception The wifi was not too bad just with interruption and needed to go back to reception a couple of times for new passwords , Just fair 
315735,Grand Hotel Downtown, Well the penthouse isn t exactly a penthouse it is a room with a terrace The room description is somewhat misleading My kettle was filthy dirty it needed a good wash And my shower kindda fell apart but i assembled it It didn t stop working the showerhead stand needs tightening , Location is convenient A walking distance from the centre great views overlooking the city Very friendly staff Quiet property And if you are lucky and the weather is great enjoy a marvellous sunset

315759,Grand Hotel Downtown, It was mentioned that the room is small when I ve booked it But I couldnt imagine that it was so small It was rather single room No space at all for normal size suitcase and small trolley , Very good location close to Museumplein and city center Many nice caffe next door Very clean facilities and friendly personnel 
315760,Grand Hotel Downtown, The booking was not what we arranged and was not happy when we arrived I had cancelled one of the rooms when we arrived the wrong room was cancelled and 4 of us had 1 twin room and a single and the hotel didn t have another room or so they said and the two ladies had to share a double bed, The breakfast was ok

315769,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room was small but you could manage it Also there was low pressure water in the shower , The heated floor on the bathroom and the bathroom was more warm than the rest of the room The staff was very helpful in anything we asked and the location is near the centre of Amsterdam 
315770,Grand Hotel Downtown, Ground floor hotel with rooms facing an internal courtyard which meant that staff were receiving deliveries outside of our room first thing in the morning Having to have the curtains closed all morning wasn t ideal , Great location
315771,Grand Hotel Downtown, We had several problems with the room card key and this happened each day of the trip This meant that one of us would have to travel down to the bottom floor to get a replacement We never received an apology from the staff which made us feel as if we was causing them an inconveinience , The room itself was fantastic and the view exactly what we was hoping for Location was good

315778,Grand Hotel Downtown, Air conditioner didn t work and we spent one night in the cold Only in the morning they brought something to warm the bathroom so that we could take a shower We asked for some compensation to all the problems including pin code for WiFi that was valid for one device and we had two experienced and still waiting for an answer , Nuovo e moderno
315779,Grand Hotel Downtown, The walls were thin which meant we could hear the next room banging doors during the night , Great service from the staff everyone was very helpful and informative We stayed in the penthouse suite and the view of the city was incredible definitely worth the extra money 
315780,Grand Hotel Downtown, The whole parking process is annoying You have to check in before you can park your car in the garage but unfortunately there are no parking slots outside the hotel Leaving the hotel is the same get the car out first do the check out after , Room was clean bed comfortable
315781,Grand Hotel Downtown, The spa facilities should be better suoervised and children should not be allowed at the spa unattended shouting and diving into the pool A spa should be a place to relax not to hear children screaming and having to watch out not being hit by a diving kid ,No Positive
315782,Grand Hotel Downtown, Was charged an extra 20 euro for reason unknown At the time wasnt sure if i had price wrong but confirmed when i checked email when i got home Not a relativly lot but still made me feel ripped off , Balcony connected to room although calling the room a penthouse was hyping it up 
315783,Grand Hotel Downtown, My husband and I stayed in the penthouse The room had a strong sewage gas Oder Someone should have known right from the start and should have NOT have hat room booked The room was dusty I m allergic to dust the headboard had mold and the refrigerator was not getting cold I took pictures My husband called the receptionist right away and they said there was nothing that they could do until the morning My husband wanted to talk to the manager but the manager is not available on the weekends which is ridiculous because a manager at any hotel should be available 24 7 The receptionist said there was nothing they could do until the morning They said they would bring a plumber to check it out That night my husband and I went out and bought candles to get rid of the smell It didn t really help It made me so sick The strong Oder I m actually sick now nauseous fatigued and a high fewer Well my husband called the next morning at 8 30am to see when the plumber was coming 5 minutes later we get a knock at the door from the housekeeper She put some white balls into the shower drainage I took pictures of that as well Then my husband and I get ready to leave early so the plumber can do whatever they needed to do We left the hotel at 9am and got back at 5 30pm Yuck the smell was still there Of course my husband was upset and so was I so he called the front desk and told them we have been gone for a very long time in order for someone to fix the sewage gas leakage He said it s the weekend so it s hard to get anyone but they told us someone would be here they also said someone would be there to fix the refrigerator That didn t happen The nigh before my husband put 2 beers outside our terrace they were gone the next day while we were out My husband and I was extremely upset and wanted to talk to the manager right away , The location
315784,Grand Hotel Downtown, Small room in particular in relation to description penthouse suite Penthouse yes as on top floor but hardly a suite Double room at best ,No Positive
315785,Grand Hotel Downtown, Lack of facilities Staff Ok but not over friendly Room was good but most were on ground floor the bathroom shower only looked very modern but the shower pressure was only good with cold water With warm water it was little more than a dribble To be fair to the hotel we didn t complain when we should have done so that could have rectified it possibly , Decent room Located about a 10 15 min walk from most things to do in the city Decent bar opposite called dapper 
315786,Grand Hotel Downtown, Very poor value for money Fittings towels TV etc all extremely cheap and substandard for a suite room Price for the room is way to high for what it is Noise heard from other rooms Entrance foyer is detached from rooms with an uncovered atrium Service is basic at best , The location is great Close to useful transport in walking distance to a lot of things yet away from the tourist traps 
315787,Grand Hotel Downtown, completley didnt do any of the reservations i requested and they said they would do for me And didnt even try compensate me for this Very disappointed Will not be recommending this Room did not even get cleaned, The room was really nice

315790,Grand Hotel Downtown, Some of the staff could have been a bit more friendly key failed to open room door no apology or even any interest from the chap on the desk cleaners not replacing toilet roll and tissues kettle also had water and tea bags inside it , The location is a good 20 odd minutes from dam square we like a walk and the route we chose takes us past all the main shopping areas eateries Beds were so comfy and nicely designed room and bathroom area
315791,Grand Hotel Downtown, The light fixture above our bed was not working The drains in the bathroom was clogged , The location it was close to our friend s flat We did not do any tourist things 
315792,Grand Hotel Downtown, Some staff could ve been friendlier and perhaps better instructions on how to get into the hotel for a first time visit The intercom system was frustrating when a receptionist wasn t at the desk , Bedrooms were clean tidy and extremely comfortable with flat screen tv and en suite shower Noise levels were kept to a minimum which was great for someone like me who enjoys a lay in Ideal location for Van Gogh museum and the IAMSTERDAM sign with good transport links to Central Station and other more notorious locations 
315793,Grand Hotel Downtown, Shower was dirty and the shower head was flithy Toiletries were sub par and just didnt feel like a 4 star room overall, Penthouse Room offered a nice view with a large balcony Bed was really comfortable and front desk clerk was really nice
315794,Grand Hotel Downtown, shower was broken and falling off the wall Bad sewage smell from the bathroom shower in the mornings , Good location big room with modern facilities 
315795,Grand Hotel Downtown, It was to far away from the dam square it cost us 20 in taxi each way to get the centre a half an hour walk away from the centre which is to long and the staff wasnted very helpful when I asked about the trams The walls are like paper so thin that I could hear next doors conversation and also the cleaners arguing in the opposite room at 8 o clock that morning I ordered a double room and I got two single beds pushed together I would not stay here again , I didn t really like anything about the stay to be honest 
315796,Grand Hotel Downtown, We booked a penthouse suite which turned out to practically be the size of a single room The housekeeping didn t clean the room well There were bad smells coming from the floor also Felt more like a 3 hotel, Location is central and there is 24 hour reception which was good as we were checking out very early in the morning 
315797,Grand Hotel Downtown, Would have asked to be moved up from ground floor if we had been staying longer Entrance lounge was a bit restricted , Helpful staff Room comfortable and gave us everything we needed 
315798,Grand Hotel Downtown, The floor was not mopped it was clean but not spotless and the shower rail moved needs minor fixing, I had a grand terrace with balcony loved it the room was beautifully decorated the shower needs some minor work but overall the room was great would definitly stay again The restuarant downstairs was lovely would also go there again

315805,Grand Hotel Downtown, Nothing A gym in the hotel would be a bonus , Excellent hotel great location very close to lots of bars and restaurants and tram stop to go into main Amsterdam centre Very friendly and helpful staff good wifi Delux rooms are well worth paying the extra for as you get a lounge area and bedroom area Water provided everyday Excellent stay and excellent value for money hotel 
315806,Grand Hotel Downtown, Standard double a little small I would pay the extra to go up to next size which I saw and looked lovely Hot water stopped on one morning but the staff gave free breakfast and it was fixed by evening , Good location and very helpful staff Rooms very clean and well looked after 
315807,Grand Hotel Downtown, Room too small it s very cluster phobic bed wasn t comfy at all also got long blond hair on Smell from the bathroom was like omg We think they have a drainage problems wasn t pleasant Staff was ok just breakfast was ok too just the false flowers in the room was very dusty and was good at all more over I ve got sinus the mini fridge in room wasn t cold and door doesn t hang properly Overall it s like a military camp not a hotel , The view of the city from the penthouse was amazing from the balcony 
315808,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room is much smaller than you d think the name is a little misleading in terms of what you d expect from a penthouse and the check in staff were extremely rude, The room was well kitted out and the view is good
315809,Grand Hotel Downtown, Having paid approximately 650 for 3 nights we were expecting rooms at least slightly bigger than a 10 tent we were staying in last summer Rooms were very very small hard to turn around and fit with belongings we had for these 3 nights and we didn t bring much Which comes as a suprise in a 4 star quite expensive hotel Breakfast was o k although the selection was rather poor for a 4 star hotel but for the last night we ordered a breakfast bag early check out the day before double checking in the evening But in the morninig it turned out that no one knows anything about it and there was nothing waiting for us even though we paid 25 for breakfast during booking I dont complain usually but I would think twice about returning here , Good location cleanliness some not all of the reception staff helpful 
315810,Grand Hotel Downtown, The room was the smallest I ve ever stayed in It cost me around 364 for a 2 night stay excluding breakfast which I felt was over priced Staff were reasonably helpful but did nit go out of their way Would I come back Probably not , The room was clean with good facilities 
315811,Grand Hotel Downtown,No Negative, I enjoyed the location and surrounding area with great little bars and restaurants in particular De Hallen popular on the weekends for it s wide variety of food stalls on cute little market Far better being out of the busy and crowded city center

315813,Grand Hotel Downtown, Nothing, What did I not like Everything was perfect and I honestly felt like I was in a 5 star hotel We got a penthouse and the room was so spacious and the balcony provided an amazing view of the downtown The reception staff we incredibly friendly 
315814,Grand Hotel Downtown, Would be nice if the room sizes were mentioned in the Room description We booked the Standard Room over the Small Room but it also felt quite small Didn t really have space to keep a big bag also It seemed more like a B B place with no Room Service and the most basic amenities The pictures they show on their site are of the complex in which the hotel is present which houses 2 more hotels The windows of the room open on the road outside with everything visible inside The hotel needs to realize that it is booked by tourists from across the globe and not everyone is comfortable with it , Location was nice Close to tram station Lots of restaurants and bars around 
315815,Grand Hotel Downtown, you could hear the people walking about in the rooms next to us on both sides no milk in the room for coffee, the view from the rooftop terrace was beautiful room was clean and very comfortable
315816,Grand Hotel Downtown, The hotel is NOT 4 more like 2 I was very disappointed with the unprofessional staff having burger and chips on the desk as I checked in I paid extra for a penthouse suite but it was tiny and below average the room was stifling hot and the AC did not help at all to cool it down the TV did not work not that it matters much but I like to watch the news in the morning there was hardly any space in the wardrobe the ironing board was like a broken toy the shower was dirty on arrival the worst aspect of the room was the sink shower drains smelt like sewage and because the room was small the smell was also in the room and greeted us every time we walked in , The location of the hotel is good not too central so it s peaceful but close enough to walk most places However it is not worth the money I paid over 1000 euros for 2 nights and expected a little bit of luxury but this was worse than some 2 hotels that I have stayed at 
315817,Grand Hotel Downtown, Breakfast was average and food was often not hot Hotel was in the museum area but a bit far from the centre of town about 15 20 min tram away , Staff in hotel were very friendly and helpful Hotel was quiet and rooms were quite large for Europe Trams were very conveniently located to hotel trams 1 and 17
