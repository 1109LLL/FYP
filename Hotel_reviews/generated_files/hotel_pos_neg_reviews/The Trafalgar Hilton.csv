91169,The Trafalgar Hilton, Lobby under construction, The room size is spacious and bed was very comfortable Staff very helpful and friendly Great location right at Tafaglar square 
91170,The Trafalgar Hilton, We were not aware that the building was being refurbished and so there were no public facities to meet family and friends Also the toilet facility which we used after check out was most unsatisfactory , Location was excellent room comfortable and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful 
91171,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, the hotel was being refurbished No mention of this on booking no bar no lounge no roof top bar room provided smelt bad and had to be switched to alternative room 
91172,The Trafalgar Hilton, That I was not informed the hotel was being renovated , Hotel under construction is only reason I did not give it a 10 Staff was excellent renovated rooms where excellent Location is perfect 
91173,The Trafalgar Hilton, The only negative i can pick out about the hotel is that during our stay the hotel was having a lot of work done This was not mentioned prior to booking the hotel This meant most days there was a lot of noise being made by DIY men who were carrying out work on the hotel and even meant access to the lift was cut off for a short period of time Also the view from our room window was pointless because of scaffolding being in the way Upon checking out from the hotel on our last day we arrived in reception to see the whole of the walls and ceiling being ripped out and re done as well for such a nice hotel it seemed that it was either brand new and not finished or having a lot of refurbishment done this however was the only negative , The location of this hotel is brilliant It is situated right across from Trafalgar Square Charing Cross tube station is within 1 minute walking distance so it is very easy to access the tube line and get to wherever you want to go in London Also because the hotel is based in the centre of London everything is pretty much close by Big Ben Houses of Parliament and The London Eye are all within a 10 15 minute walk from the hotel as is Buckingham Palace so even if you wanted to have a nice walk around nothing is too far from the hotel The room was great and had a very modern decor with pictures on the wall of very British things and London based things which was very nice The room was cleaned daily and was exceptionally well kept The staff were very nice and always on hand to help as well as wishing you a good morning and to have a nice day 
91174,The Trafalgar Hilton, Very noisy due to refurbishment , The new decoration of the rooms and the professionalism of the staff Special thanks to the guest relations manager Suzaan Evans 
91175,The Trafalgar Hilton, Noisy works due to refurbishment, The new decoration of the rooms and the professionalism of the staff Special thanks to the guest relations manager Suzaan Evans 
91176,The Trafalgar Hilton, There was major refurbishment happening and Booking com did not advise of this Had I known I would have stayed elsewhere Some facilities were closed and there was serious hammering and drilling going on in room next to us , Location was great right on Trafalgar Square therefore good and close to theatres restaurants and shopping
91177,The Trafalgar Hilton, This hotel is under total renovation Hilton should be ashamed of themselves for even keeping it open A total cash grab on their part and to make matters worse they charged full rate Booking com also made no reference to the hotel being under complete renovation Again a total disgrace and complete cash grab with virtually no value for the money charged , The hotel was under renovation Which was not identified on Booking com s website The room was brand new and thus great There was no lobby no amenities no gym no rooftop terrace As advertised 
91178,The Trafalgar Hilton, Hotel going through major refurbishment which I wasn t made aware of when booking Very noisy drilling etc started before 9 am on a Sunday , Location
91179,The Trafalgar Hilton, Booking com mentioned the room was 330m2 but for some reasons I was given a room in the corner and it s NOT 330m2 When I mentioned it I was offered to change to another room but since I had unpacked already I could not be bothered I paid the price for this room because I needed a bigger room I find it odd that without any mentioning I m just given a smaller room Also the hotel was under renovation which was not clearly stated in Booking com , Location
91180,The Trafalgar Hilton, We had been told the roof terrasse was closed due to renovation but not that the space on 6th floor were regular occupied by workers who made rather much noise from 0700 AM to 0530 PM every day Considering thar the hotel was hardly filled we could not understand why the hotal had placed us at this upper 6th floor as close as possible to the workers and the noise wonder if this was why we had booked via Booking com cannot refrain from thinking that the hotel range us different from their direct customers despite we even had a h honor membercard in hand rgs jens, Close to the activities of London city
91181,The Trafalgar Hilton, Under renovation This should have been highlighted at time of booking Only one place to eat inside hotel Room size bit small But overall good , Location very good concierge
91182,The Trafalgar Hilton, I didn t like the hidden charge for breakfast off the menu The room was booked as a gift to include breakfast but when booking it wasn t clear that breakfast only included the buffet and that anything off the menu was chargeable Also as the roof terrace was a selling point we were a little disappointed that it was closed for refurbishment ,No Positive
91183,The Trafalgar Hilton, There was no information about the hotel giving discounts for the parking so we paid online before the arrived and paid full price for the car park We didnt realise that a hot breakfast was extra price as this wasnt made clear when booking , The staff were friendly and always spoke The rooms were a lovely size and the beds were comfy The location was a good central location 
91184,The Trafalgar Hilton, Would have loved to try the roof top bar but unfortunately due to hotel refurbishments this is closed We did experience some noise in our room from the building work being carried out , Very good full English breakfast included in the room price a comfy king size bed 
91185,The Trafalgar Hilton, staff were rude and there is not a chair to sit on in the lobby that has plenty of room if you need to wait for you taxi and they refused to arrange a taxi for you bar was closed for refurbishment, location and price
91186,The Trafalgar Hilton, It was a big disappointment that the refurbishment and roof bar was not open otherwise I would have chosen alternative accommodation For the price I paid for one night I felt conned , The room upgrade was nice 
91187,The Trafalgar Hilton, The trendy cosmopolitan styling wasn t really to my liking its a bit edgy and dynamic with its podium concierge desk and open plan nightclub type hotel bar area I really prefer a hotel to be more relaxing comfortable and homely A bit overpriced compared to comparable hotels in the same area I would stay there again but it wouldn t be my first choice , Staff were polite and helpful Place was clean and functional 
91188,The Trafalgar Hilton, Reception staff were rude and not very helpful There were renovations were happening which we weren t warned about prior to our stay and we were woken Sunday morning by drilling We paid for breakfast only to be told we had only got continental and had to pay a supplement for anything hot We tried to have a drink in the bar only to be ignored by a flirtatious barman who was more interested in giving cocktail lessons to a group of ladies Overall really not worth the hefty price tag , The room was nice and clean breakfast was enjoyable and the staff at breakfast were extremely lovely 
91189,The Trafalgar Hilton, Very deceptive There was no spa or gym facilities and the beautiful roof terrace bar which features in all the pictures and was the main reason we chose this hotel was CLOSED for renovations but it never said this There seemed to be a lot of hoarding up inside the hotel for building renovation work ongoing I feel hotels should have to let you know when there is work ongoing as it s a real turn off when going for a leisure break away from the madness of every day life , The staff were very nice 
91190,The Trafalgar Hilton, The rooms could be updated a bit However they were comfortable and clean , The staff was excellent extremely helpful and friendly The hotel was in the best location for sightseeing in London
91191,The Trafalgar Hilton, First room given to us was old Outdated bathrooms After complaining they transfered us to a newly refurbished room , Location Central location and in front of Trafalgar Square
91192,The Trafalgar Hilton, The breakfast was expensive but totally unappetising All items were cold cold beans cold tomatoes cold mushrooms There was an egg station for freshly prepared fried eggs only not omelets or scrambled eggs on offer , Very helpful staff 
91193,The Trafalgar Hilton, Dated in rooms overpriced drinks we paid for upgrade room was not great needs revamp in bathroom Very dark in hallways tourches would be handy Paid for b b but decided to cancel breakfast when checked in but wasn t allowed due to booking with booking com not great so be warned , Location was perfect
91194,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, It was comfortable quiet clean with a great feel to it Perfect location and value for money considering where it is located Hope it keeps this value once refurb is complete 
91195,The Trafalgar Hilton, Roof top bar was not opened and there was work getting done Very expensive for what you where getting Mini bar didn t work told them first day still not working by the time we lefted , Nice and central 
91196,The Trafalgar Hilton, As regulars at this hotel we were highly embarrassed when we recently stayed with family at the hotel We had bragged that the hotel was a fantastic find which they were all going to love How wrong Rooms weren t allocated among our party correctly Far too expensive for size and standard of rooms Hotel needs a refurb rooms are shabby Breakfast wasn t to normal standard cheap produce We had mentioned it was my Mum s 50th and so they kindly left birthday chocolates in one of the rooms but it the wrong room Surely its the hotels job to know which guests are in which rooms We had hoped for views over the square like we normally have but only one room could see a glimpse And to top it off our bathroom floor flooded as the shower doesn t have a suitable draining system Considering we are regulars at the hotel and we booked well in advance I had expected a lot more We certainly would t even entertain the thought of staying here again Don t book keep looking there are far superior hotels in London , Location was great 
91197,The Trafalgar Hilton, Unable to organise a late checkout until the day of departure If you go to breakfast late eg 9 9 30am you risk missing out on popular items as they weren t topped up when they ran out We had a room at the back of the hotel off the main street and it was very noisy , Excellent location Pleasant staff 
91198,The Trafalgar Hilton, I found the price of the cocktails a bit high for in comparison to close by bars, I found every part of my stay was fantastic from the moment I walked into reception until the point I left all the staff were friendly and polite and the place was spotless
91199,The Trafalgar Hilton, No variation of breakfast Additional 60 for what No explanation from booking approximate stay charge, Triple glazing windows excellent housekeeping toiletries well supplied
91200,The Trafalgar Hilton, Check in desk a bit informal You feel like you are entering a restaurant not a hotel When I checked in it was more expensive than I d booked Not told that they take a deposit Went for breakfast was told it wasn t included I knew that was one reason I had booked the hotel as it included breakfast When I queried it I had to show my email from booking com to prove it assured I d be refunded Find it funny I didn t get a receipt Hotel said that s normal , Very helpful as we arrived early to see if we could leave our bags as was off to the theatre check in was in middle of the show They let us check in early as they had a room available Convenient location nice setting
91201,The Trafalgar Hilton, Rooms were a little noisy Could here everything that happened on the streets , Great location Easy access to all of London s major attractions and theaters
91202,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room small and old wardrobes had to order eggs to be cooked for breakfast and would only do fried or scrambled wouldn t do an omelette, Good location and friendly staff
91203,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, Fabulous location Small amount of building work inside but nothing that disturbed us We went to London as a mini moon having only got married on Friday The hotel had heard of our celebration and without hinting had left a very nice and thoughtful complimentary bottle in the room with a congratulations card Thank you Trafalgar Very enjoyable stay and staff were very attentive Thank you 
91204,The Trafalgar Hilton, Slightly chaotic check in with our paperwork emerging from a very dog earred file We couldn t open the windows to get fresh air so ended up with air conditioning snuffle , Great location 
91205,The Trafalgar Hilton, Roof garden terrace Kept awake until the early hours by noisy group of people shouting and screaming Spoilt our experience , great choice of breakfast foods Room very good size 
91206,The Trafalgar Hilton, For early check in I had to pay an extra 40 pounds in the name of an upgrade The room faced a dead end alley early morning rubbish truck noise was extremely annoying , Good location and nice open terrace restaurant with views of Trafalgar square 
91207,The Trafalgar Hilton, Bathroom tiles very slippery No heated towel rail to dry towels for further use , Superb quality breakfast Very friendly efficient and smiley staff Excellent location 
91208,The Trafalgar Hilton, Cost of room service horrendous No plug by bed which always annoys me Very expensive for what you get Paying for location I guess , Location fab staff v pleasant
91209,The Trafalgar Hilton, value for money way off Even though it was a great price for the location it was still 230pounds per night And for that amount of money I expect at LEAST not to hear my next door neighbours chatting at 4 oclock at night they were not shouting or arguing but the sound insulation of my room was worse than the one you find at a chicken shed I suppose I expect a bathroom finished to good standard a socket to charge my phone close to bed and working wifi wifi was actually not working for most of the time and when it did it was too slow Bathroom was poorly finished with damaged tiles poorly repaired as well and plastic part of toilet seat partially broken Not what you expect from a hotel with Hilton as part of its name Disappointed with the room I assume it does not reflect the image of the rest of the hotel but I did not get a lot for my 460pound weekend accommodation I have stayed at much better rooms costing 20 of this one, great location 
91210,The Trafalgar Hilton, Take care of bed linen or carpet acarus insects The rest very good , The service was perfect and breakfast was very nice The atmosphere was fantastic 
91211,The Trafalgar Hilton, On our first morning we waited to be seate ffor breakfast and a girl behind dthe bartold us to go and fid a table of which we did Nobody came across and explained to us what one had to do so we helped ourselves We went for cereal andfounf the milk sour we I form a waitress and she took it away a dcame back with fresh I ordered poa he d eggs a d they were offplus I had to go and collect tjhemwhilst others received theirs at the table Next morning was fine ,No Positive
91212,The Trafalgar Hilton, Internet service was extremely frustrating as it kept kicking in and out during entire stay When I found out I could have booked for over 100 less a night I was subjected to a barrage of Mumbo Jumbo well practiced to confuse and frustrate Few of the staff if any are native English speaking which added to the confusion The roof top viewing area was closed which was not known until arrival All in all there is no good reason to stay there as I feel it lacks too much that you want in a visit to England ,No Positive
91213,The Trafalgar Hilton, Bedrooms are smelly my friend s as well because of the old dirty carpets Found a nail file when I entered the bathroom Old room with old furniture , Breakfast was one of the best I had in London nice location 
91214,The Trafalgar Hilton, Breakfast was a bit of a challenge No table numbers allocated and wasn t advised of a table number which was required when you placed your requirements to the chef who was cooking the eggs Even the waiting staff had difficulty in locating the right tables On hindsight we would have booked Room Only and taken breakfast elsewhere , The location of the Hotel was perfect for our trip The Hotel and room was clean 
91215,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room was tired Bathroom light switch on opposite side of room to bathroom Air con only gave cold air and this was late October To compensate the cold water in sink and shower was hot so hard not to scald ourselves Toilet roll holder hanging off wall and sealant looked like it had been done by a child , Location was excellent and the bed and pillows comfortable Good range of toiletries in bathroom 
91216,The Trafalgar Hilton, The bed was uncomfortable it was like there was no pillows they were that rubbish I had to push the bottom one in to an all to get some lift to get a sleep, The staff were so friendly and helpful
91217,The Trafalgar Hilton, Waiting for the eggs to cook at breakfast was slow but they were fresh, The location was excellent and the staff couldn t do enough They were very friendly and made us feel very welcome
91218,The Trafalgar Hilton, Even though the hotel already had my bank details they took a 50 deposit without warning On leaving 5 days ago they informed us that they would refund my deposit Still waiting ,No Positive
91219,The Trafalgar Hilton, Building works were going on in around hotel and I would like this to have been mentioned before my visit I arrived to have a relaxing afternoon in my room pre my evening engagement but could not due to the noise , The overall hotel is fantastic Bedrooms spacious beds very comfortable Everyone in the hotel friendly and helpful
91220,The Trafalgar Hilton, Place is being rennovated so they are running annoying jackhammers in there all day long and that was a little trippy after jet lag you can not get a nap The room was nice but not painted it looks like someone painted it with primer 1 coat and never finished , The people were all Amazing never seen a better trained hotel staff 5 Star Experience 
91221,The Trafalgar Hilton, Dripping tap handle in bathroom staff very apologetic , Amazing selection of food for breakfast Great location in Trafalgar Square Staff friendly and helpful Free slippers Cosy bed and pillows Would recommend 
91222,The Trafalgar Hilton, Essentially None , Concierge at night especially helpful Dining hall manager and attendants all attentive Location is really great Just a few yards from the square National Gallery and blocks only from theaters 
91223,The Trafalgar Hilton, Old bedroom furniture Tired worn carpet in room Room thermostat in room not working , Great location Fantastic view from the rooftop bar Quick check in out
91224,The Trafalgar Hilton, Lured in by the images of the roof top bar but far too crowded to actually enjoy that Had I known that I would not be able to get a decent seat at that bar then I would have chosen somewhere else to stay as there are better places for the money IMO Sadly that is the lasting memory I will take away from the experience ,No Positive
91225,The Trafalgar Hilton, Breakfast not included in the room price and the Vista bar closes at 12 00pm , Lovely modern room great location for central London the west end Bag storage service after check out allowing you to carry on site seeing and return later to collect bags 
91226,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room was not as nice as demonstrated in the pictures Hotel food and drink insanely expensive , Staff were so friendly attentive and extremely helpful and obliging 
91227,The Trafalgar Hilton, the bathroom was very tired it looked like they had tried to modernise it on the cheap the in room entertainment consisted of asking for a sheet of paper with a list of old dvd s on which we could call down for Also breakfast was served in the bar which seemed very strange as it felt like we were having it in the foyer , The staff were lovely the room was a decent size and the roof top bar when open was very impressive 
91228,The Trafalgar Hilton, There were not enough toiletries for two people in the bathroom Also I expected complimentary bottles of water but none were provided The room lacked personality very sparse The couple in next room arguing noisily all night So rooms not well insulated , Staff very friendly breakfast service very good 
91229,The Trafalgar Hilton, Concierge said he could not get us a driver to Wembley and to pick up after It took me 10 mins to sort out myself and I have no contacts or knowledge of London Poor for a hotel of such a standard , LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION
91230,The Trafalgar Hilton, Bar Prices were far too high even for London and would have loved to have got onto the roof terrace bar for one drink but was always full due to being open to non residents , Staff wonderful Breakfast great Location great 
91231,The Trafalgar Hilton, We asked to move rooms due to the first room being very run down and miss used t he second room was more to our liking , I really liked the selection at breakfast Including the omelette bar We had a good view of the London eye from our window 
91232,The Trafalgar Hilton, I didn t think the room was good value for money I paid 215 for a room with no view its all very well charging for the location but if the guest can t see the reason for the location I think that should be reflected in the price The walls were lined with the wires for the light fittings but there was absolutely no attempt to make them blend in which made the decor very ugly The television had basic Freeview I have stayed in cheaper places that offer Sky at the very least The bathroom was lovely apart for the fact that the sink was enormous so it took ages to fill , I had a wonderful welcome which included a free drinks voucher because the computer was slow at check in The bed was very comfortable and I had an excellent night s sleep 
91233,The Trafalgar Hilton, Access to rooftop bar limited due to private bookings this isn t the problem The problem is that there were no notices declaring this Therefore we missed an opportunity to see the view of an evening , Great location Quiet room considering the busy location 
91234,The Trafalgar Hilton, Kettle had to be filled in the bath as it didn t fit under tap in the sink, Bed was very comfortable and breakfast was excellent Lift was the best ever Rooftop bar was great too 
91235,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, Location was great The theatres shopping and covent garden were all in walking distance which was really important as it was mum s 80th and she wouldn t have been able to walk long distances Rooms were great and beds really comfortable
91236,The Trafalgar Hilton, Didn t care for the pillows the side of the tub was very high I as an elderly person found it difficult to get in out of , Bed was very comfortable room was spacious 
91237,The Trafalgar Hilton, Bit rushed and stressful breakfast for a Sunday buffett jam packed and queues and staff clearing very quickly as more and more people came down , Room nice smellies in bathroom the best Noisy with traffic and all outside Cocktails superb 
91238,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, We had a very comfortable stay right in the heart of Trafalgar Square The staff were extremely helpful and friendly The location was convenient to West End Theatres Covent Garden and a two minute walk from Charing Cross Tube Station We didn t eat in the hotel but sampled the many options available in close proximity We had a lovely breakfast at the Cafe in the Crypt in St Martin in the Fields a 5 minute walk away I would recommend this hotel unreservedly and will definitely stay again when next in London 
91239,The Trafalgar Hilton, my room was directly opposite an office block anyone could see straight into the bedroom hence curtains always closed so room very dim , the bed was comforable room service good and food enjoyable
91240,The Trafalgar Hilton, Would have been nice to have breakfast in a separate room not where people were arriving departing with their luggage , Staff exceptionally nice especially one of the bar men on the roof top bar who despite our late arrival still made us cocktails 
91241,The Trafalgar Hilton, Nothing, The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble The brought us a table to sit at when the bar was full They brought us complementary cakes to celebrate our anniversary We would recommend this hotel
91242,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room cleaners were a bit sloppy forgot to bring towels or toilet paper etc Had to ask for some things every day , The room was quiet bed was good to sleep and the roof bar Vista was great 
91243,The Trafalgar Hilton, Staff varied somewhat between very helpful and a bit too official Slow service at breakfast Rooftop bar not open when it mattered to us , Great location in Trafalgar Square High quality London hotel looks the part feels premium but not ostentatious Comfortable room great shower and a good night s sleep Great welcome with complimentary champagne from a member of staff in the lift 
91244,The Trafalgar Hilton, We had quite a lot of bother in the lift as some men had been drinking a lot from the bar on the 6th floor And being very rowdy so we got out of the lift early and walked down the stairs Maybe the lift needs to be monitored , The location was brilliant
91245,The Trafalgar Hilton, Some of the staff were not very knowledgeable about heir hotel Also maybe not at the staff expected level for a 4 star, The location is second to none easy car park behind Step out the hotel and you are in Trafalgar Square Roof top bar is amazing
91246,The Trafalgar Hilton, Hotel d cor is tired room very average whole place feels dusty Carpets in breakfast area need a good clean , Location good close to West End theatres Westminster etc Staff friendly and helpful 
91247,The Trafalgar Hilton, Would have loved to have had a choice of having a pot of coffee or tea at breakfast and a full English breakfast Couldn t get to have a drink on the roof terrace one reason for us booking but we will try again next time we book in , The hotel location the bed was very comfy food was lovely would stay again for sure and would recommend it to my friends and family a BIG THANK YOU to all the staff xx
91248,The Trafalgar Hilton, Tiles around bath need regrouting and there was no quiet lounge as ground floor was used as a cafe bar , the location and the helpful friendly staff
91249,The Trafalgar Hilton, View from room but understand not all rooms can be on the front, Location and staff were excellent We had a issue with our booking but this was resolved quickly and very helpfully
91250,The Trafalgar Hilton, I preferred the breakfast downstairs with the menus etc this time it was on groundfloor with no menus it was ok but better downstairs , I love this hotel been a few times now the staff are so polite and helpful 
91251,The Trafalgar Hilton, The USP of the hotel is the rooftop bar but we weren t told when we checked in that you had to book to go there So we weren t able to visit the bar that evening as we would have liked ,No Positive
91252,The Trafalgar Hilton, Couldn t use roof top bar was asked to leave as there was a private party Most disappointing as one of reasons booked , Brilliant location friendly staff comfortable bed spacious room 
91253,The Trafalgar Hilton, The 3rd floor room was baking hot we couldn t open any windows and the AC didn t cool the room The furniture was aged and the carpet was ripped The view was an office block We didn t get to the roof terrace as they recommended booking , The location is great we were able to walk to Buck Palace and the Theatres with no problem 
91254,The Trafalgar Hilton, Guest areas Bar breakfast room not good Breakfast was poor Toilets not clean So disappointed as it was my husbands first time in London, Room was comfortable Good location
91255,The Trafalgar Hilton, There was nothing that i disliked Hotel was pricey but i suppose thats what you get being in central london, Breakfast was good Staff were tremendous couldnt do enough for you Location couldnt be any better
91256,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, the staff went above and beyond it was my husbands 50th and they came up to the room with a happy birthday written in chocolate on a slate with two little cakes and some fizzy water They also booked us a fantastic table at the open top bar right at the front views were fantastic
91257,The Trafalgar Hilton, Would liked to have had a room with a view instead of looking at the back of adjacent offices but there are renovation works going on to the external facad of the building facing Trafalgar Square, Good location for tourists tight next to traflgar square and great for restaurants and shows
91258,The Trafalgar Hilton, The V bar is a different company and they refused to bring a coffee up from the main hotel I pay money for the hotel and I am happy to pay for a cup of coffee I was expected to fetch my own coffee down to the main concourse and then up in the lifts Not what I would expect from a Hilton Hotel Music in V Bar and the lifts repetitive and too modern for clientele V bar prices very inflated even for London Also Booking com should make it clear on internet bookings that your head office is in China A lot of confusion was caused at booking in due to t he fact that my address was down as a Chinese Mansion Staff not very good at dealing with this issue , Good breakfast comfy beds and good location
91259,The Trafalgar Hilton, Having to pay for snacks with drinks most hotels offer these free , Easy check in staff very friendly helpful Comfortable bed great breakfast 
91260,The Trafalgar Hilton, Questionable of the room Wasn t a deluxe quality room as booked Complete front of hotel covered with scaffolding and dust sheets Put at rear or hotel facing office buildings Wasn t a dining room more like a bar with tables Breakfast was poor choice and had to complain to get used dishes removed from the table Does not live up to the Hilton brand , Location was very good Numerous members of staff willing to help 
91261,The Trafalgar Hilton, Disappointed to find lots of maintenance work going on The nice bar downstairs doubled up as a breakfast room and smelt like it Whole place was surrounded by scaffolding Should have been told about that beforehand Not good enough at that price,No Positive
91262,The Trafalgar Hilton, I was very disheartened to find on arriving that the hotel was having external building work and had scaffolding and tarpaulin covering the whole of the outside I was not advised of this at any point from booking I did not appreciate looking out of the window to see nothing but the inside of a tarpaulin sheet , The location was really good and the staff were all very attentive 
91263,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, Fantastic location Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfasts really tasty especially the individually prepared omelettes Roof top bar a real pleasure 
91264,The Trafalgar Hilton, I ve stayed in this hotel several times during about 10 years and I loved it earlier it was my favorite in London Unfortunately I have to say that they are just not trying anymore Some things are starting to look and feel like in a 3 star hotel The hotel is still nice but not worth the money anymore Wifi is a joke It basically does not function at all , The location is perfect close to everything and the hotel is easy to reach from Paddington from Heathrow and Victoria from Gatwick Cab to Paddington is 10 mins and 10 pounds The hotel has personality and it has always had warm atmosphere Nice and cozy but chic and cool Breakfast is good but the staff is too busy elsewhere to clean the tables 
91265,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, This was a very nice clean hotel It was very convenient to every place I wanted to visited I would walk anywhere The staff was very polite and helpful with any questions are concerns I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is interested in visiting London 
91266,The Trafalgar Hilton, The hotel facade was being cleaned it was covered in scaffolding not a pretty sight which red out the view I had anticipated and which I considered when I was booking, To step out and find yourself opposite Trafalgar Square the buzz lovely Restaurants breakfast at the hotel was quite good value staff were extremely pleasant and helpful
91267,The Trafalgar Hilton, The hotel had a facade of scaffold and sheeting meaning the room felt dark with no view from the window The much advertised roof top bar was closed and we were not informed of any of this at the time of booking Our room had a adjoining door that had no sound proofing and we could hear the guys next door clearly giggling and chatting The bar area was dark and felt dull with no atmosphere at all Its such a shame for what should be a lovely looking hotel it was poor However I guess this was all mostly due to the referbishment works , checking in was very quick and the guys on reception seemed very helpful 
91268,The Trafalgar Hilton, We didnt have a great view from our room just a backstreet buildings and a skip As it was my partners 30th i chose this hotel as i thought it would be perfect sitting on the roof bar in the evening having a drink and looking over london lit up but unfortunately the roof bar wasnt open which was a bit of a let down , The Hotel was absolutely perfect the rooms were beautiful beds super comfy with beautiful soft sheets and the breakfast was the best ive ever had Its in the Perfect location The Staff were amazing and even left a lovely treat in our room for my partners 30th birthday Thankyou Trafalgar Hotel 
91269,The Trafalgar Hilton, Exterior renovations resulted in rooftop bar being closed during our stay We had really wanted to enjoy a drink and the views from it but unfortunately were not able to experience it this trip , The location was incredible It was an easy walk to most of the major sights in London and very centrally located for sight seeing 
91270,The Trafalgar Hilton, We booked the room with the view Got the room with no view but it did not matter because hotel never bothered to tell us that they are in the midst of renovation of facade Hotel was covered in schafolding and protective netting so you couldn t see a view anyway , Location was superb Walking distance to everything
91271,The Trafalgar Hilton, Very expensive food and drink No firm pillows Decor was very dark No access to roof top due to facade cleaning View of adjoining offices, Location is excellent right next to Charring Cross station Included breskfast was good and all staff here were good
91272,The Trafalgar Hilton, roof top bar closed only opened seasonally disappointed as booked hotel because of the bar and location, location robes slippers and free bottled water reasonable breakfast good choice of food
91273,The Trafalgar Hilton, I booked as a surprise gift for my my daughter and her partner for one night what clinched the decision to book at the Trafalgar was the view from the rooftop garden most disappointed when me daughter told me it was closed this really should have been mentioned on website unless I missed it which is quite possible otherwise everything ok thank you , location and staff were excellent in my daughters words phenomenal 
91274,The Trafalgar Hilton, The scaffolding on the exterior of the building I would ve preferred to have known about this prior to booking It was an eyesore I was visiting London for a family event accompanying my Aunt who had not been to London for many years so it was a shame that the building wasn t looking it s best but everything else was wonderful , Excellent friendly and professional staff 
91275,The Trafalgar Hilton, The building is undergoing external cleaning and so is presently scaffolded and shrouded The roof bar is closed for the winter which was disappointing as it was a key feature for choosing the venue for a family reunion , Good location for central London
91276,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, The hotel is very nice and clean the team was great helpful and very kindly Help us evrything what we needed the hotel is in the center in very good location We had very good experience with the hotel We strongly recommend 
91277,The Trafalgar Hilton, Nothing at all , It s like home Whenever we go to London And we go very often we stay will stay at Trafalgar Hilton This time we were there celebrating our son s birthday In our other stay we mentioned about this and then forgot it totally When we came to the hotel this time they prepared a wonderful surprise to us they upgraded our room prepared baloons champaigne a very nice birthday cake and here is the most important part a hand written birthday card signed by all the staff of the hotel So that s why I say it feels like home when we stay at Trafalgar Hilton And the lovely Reseption Manager Aurore you re the love of my son Bora Thank you for preparing all these surprises to us Hilton is really very luck to have you 
91278,The Trafalgar Hilton, We did not like the plastic cladding all the way around the hotel to the extent that you could not see out of the windows Also the roof top bar is not open until the spring We did not stay , Although we did not stay at this hotel your staff were most helpful and we were moved to the Waldorf Hilton Which was first class 
91279,The Trafalgar Hilton, Rooms very dated holes in net curtains made it look quiet run down wasn t informed there would be scaffolding outside Windows, Great location staff and breakfast was great
91280,The Trafalgar Hilton, I didn t like the fact that when we booked we wasn t informed that the whole building was covered in scaffolding and white sheets This meant that the view from our first room of Trafalgar Square was blocked and we just looked at scaffolding Would have been nice to have been told when we booked as the whole reason we booked was for the lovely views and the roof top bar which may I add was out of use too , The rooms where very clean and the staff were very helpful
91281,The Trafalgar Hilton, No view of Trafalgar Square due to scaffolding and sheeting , The friendly and helpful staff really made this stay stand out We regularly stay in London hotels Hilton Park Lane St Martins Lane the Westbury etc choosing different ones each time and this rates as one of the best stays because of the fabulous staff Any problems were rectified quickly It was my partner s birthday and they kindly put out a plate of sweet treats for him We will most definitely book again once the scaffolding has gone and the outdoor bar is open The location is fabulous cannot get more central 
91282,The Trafalgar Hilton, The bed was extremely uncomfortable so much so each morning I woke with painful neck and back We were not advised prior to arriving that hotel was covered externally in tarpaulin No idea what works were being carried out but looks very unsightly I understand works are required but I wish I was pre warned about it , The location by far was the best part Breakfast staff very helpful and friendly 
91283,The Trafalgar Hilton, Initially we couldn t find the hotel and then realised its because it was the one covered up in scaffolding boarding and plastic sheeting meaning the kerb appeal was gone Whilst I understand the need for improvements to be made it would have been nice if perhaps the hotel could have called or emailed us just to let us know about the works so we were at the very least expecting them Down points were no view because of the scaffolding and we couldn t open the window for fresh air On our arrival day everything was clean but on day 2 the maid must have been having an off day as dirty glasses and cups were not swapped coffee was not refilled bed was made up but not very well and bathroom sink had not been wiped around We had 3 mornings worth of breakfasts there was a good choice on all 3 days but only 1 was great Day 1 the scrambled eggs were chalky and lacked taste day 2 I was waiting 20 minutes for my poached eggs and bacon when it still hasn t arrived I went to the chef to check he hadn t forgotten he told me he had done them and given them to me I think I would have remembered eating my breakfast Another disappointment was regarding the vista bar with the great view This to me was the selling point of the hotel and it was the wonderful photos showing the bar that made me book I booked through booking com and paid immediately with no refund option so imagine my disappointment when I checked the reviews on Trip Advisor early January to see it was closed for winter Really the pictures should not be used to advertise this and there should certainly be a warning on all the sites they sell through that this is a seasonal bar , The arrival itself was very good The staff were very welcoming friendly polite and nothing was too much of a problem We noticed how good the reception and door staff were throughout our stay and this made us feel valued as a guest I wish to mention a certain male who I think was called Carlo He was the greatest of helps and always smiley and cheerful it was the little touches he gave like offering an umbrella in the rain showing us directions helping with bags and holding doors open The room itself was nice average sized for London and had everything we needed I have such mixed feelings about this hotel so can only rate it in the middle where they exceeded expectations in some places in others basic standards were not met and we certainly didn t get the hotel that we paid for 
91284,The Trafalgar Hilton, The Breakfast was just OK all 3 days same food The top floor Bar was closed but when we booked the Hotel it did not mentioned anywhere Rooms were just OK the basic set up of room and bathroom was not upto the mark, location
91285,The Trafalgar Hilton, The rooftop bar was closed from October till March and we didn t know booking com didn t let us know we feel we were cheated as it cost us a lot of money and it was a special occasion as it was my husbands 60th birthday felt very let down , The location
91286,The Trafalgar Hilton, The room not as requested and over detail of staff constantly asking is everything ok, Room with a view at front booked instead ended up at back as the hotel was covered in scaffold
91287,The Trafalgar Hilton, No Wifi in room No hair dryer in the room for an expensive room 214 euros Very standard room for that price , Location Nice view on the terrace Nice breakfast
91288,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, The staff were all really helpful and were especially nice to my daughter who is 7 She particularly loved her breakfast waffles Thank you all for making it a great stay We will be back very soon 
91289,The Trafalgar Hilton, Nothing at all , The Staff is so friendly so helpful so extraordinary especialy AURORE My son Bora really loved her and she bought him a Santa Clause chocolate when we were leaving that he would never forget When we re staying at Trafalgar Hilton with my family we really feel like we re home Lovely hotel with lovely personnel That sthe Hilton difference 
91290,The Trafalgar Hilton, Was not signed as the Hilton was obviously being renovated, Friendly staff and we received bonuses we think because of the renovations which was appreciated
91291,The Trafalgar Hilton, The sky bar was hired by a private party meaning we couldn t see the New Year s Eve fireworks from the roof like we had initially intended to do , The rooms are very nice luxurious and spacious The staff were absolutely fantastic they really helpful and friendly and were willing to go out of their way on more than one occasion to make our stay better The bars were very friendly and the drinks were good We had an entire function room to ourselves on New Years being waited on by a friendly and attentive member of staff 
91292,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, Great room spilt level overlooking Trafalgar Square The bathroom had a good sized bath and a seperate shower cubical shame we were so busy to take a long relaxing soak 
91293,The Trafalgar Hilton, Poorly serviced breakfast I had to inform staff that they had ran out of various breakfast items Not good for a 4 hotel In fact not good for any hotel , Location 
91294,The Trafalgar Hilton, Bedrooms need revamped Room failed to meet expectations Service and availability of food at breakfast fell well short of the minimum requirements Value for money very poor , Professionalism of reception staff
91295,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, The staff were fantastic and they seemed to care that you had a nice time Breakfast was really well organised and a really lovely space Room was really nice too 
91296,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room was a tad disappointing on a furnishing point of view but comfortable hotel very modern but rooms a slight let down, Location is central and perfect for a London experience
91297,The Trafalgar Hilton,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Location right at the square with a bus stop at the door and Charing Cross 5 mins away Rooms relatively big considering its a central London hotel 
91298,The Trafalgar Hilton, Nothing except horrible coffee in room , Brilliant location really nice staff The concierge helped me to stop a taxi on the street in the rain Can t be better 
91299,The Trafalgar Hilton, Although I was a single business traveler I was put in a room with an interconnecting door to a family with small children this was not sound proofed and I could not work due to the noise At night I was woken up by the Father snoring The bed was uncomfortable hairs in around the sink Heating aircon sounded like an aircraft taking off This was the worst hotel room I have stayed in for years and I managed very little sleep, The staff were genuinely friendly and the breakfast was good
91300,The Trafalgar Hilton, A very small dislike was the room was a bit tired old Could have done with a freshen up on some of the decor Be wary of travelling in rush hour by road as Trafalgar Square gets jammed , Location is fantastic for central London Staff are very helpful check in and check out was easy Bathroom was well stocked
91301,The Trafalgar Hilton, Location of toilets confusing not helped by the colour of the doors The lighting in the area is not particularly bright and it is difficult to see which side of the door to push Breakfast very average with poor selection of fruit , ideal location and the staff were universally charming
91302,The Trafalgar Hilton, Thought the hotel was too expensive for room only No breakfast and the room needs a facelift seemed a little dated Had to pay for WIFI Ridiculous , Location was superb Staff very friendly and polite Got upgraded on arrival which was very nice Received complimentary strawberries and chocolates for our wedding anniversary
91303,The Trafalgar Hilton, A hair dryer would have been useful Although the breakfast was great baked beans or cooked tomatoes were missing , The staff were very friendly and helpful 
91304,The Trafalgar Hilton, Nothing its fab, This hotel is in amazing location for many attractions The rooms are spacious and welcoming with comfy beds Noon check out is also good Staff are friendly and attentive Will definitely return 
91305,The Trafalgar Hilton, Moved breakfast room to main reception Not enough tables self service even for a cup of tea not good for hotel at over 320 per night and want 15 each extra for self service breakfast If you walk in off street and order then you get waiter service in same area We have stayed here many times and the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant was excellent I say this as a Hilton silver member, Excellent location
91306,The Trafalgar Hilton, This hotel is obviously focused on the downstairs bar and roof terrace bar not staying guests As a result of the bar the reception is squeezed in the hallway Anyone off the street going to the roof bar can access the room areas and as we found out set off fire alarms at midnight Hallways are very dark including breakfast area when you want it bright and airy no breakfast in room option no cooked breakfast and a condescending message as to why not message we are managing you and have decided you ll eat healthy no ventilation in rooms so big smell of damp furniture smelled of wet dogs moved rooms and the same after air freshener had worn off Great staff and location but terrible hotel for 255 a night, Great location and helpful staff
91307,The Trafalgar Hilton, Tiny room very dark and noisy towels that were old like sandpaper with holes in them Breakfast was like being in a cafeteria get your own cutlery serviettes etc I felt for 325 a night it was poor value will never use this hotel again , The location
91308,The Trafalgar Hilton, The room s furniture ad fixtures were a bit worn however price location and staff more than compensated for that , Location was absolutely great and the room was silent in spite of facing a big junction 
91309,The Trafalgar Hilton, If you want an english breakfast this is a bad choice Good selection for continental style breakfast but just bacon and pitiful sausage available and eggs to order no mushrooms tomatoes etc Also breakfast is served in the bar area at the front of the hotel not in a dining room So bear this in mind , Staff very friendly 
91310,The Trafalgar Hilton, The internet was very very slow and did not allow me to conduct business video meetings as needed , The staff was very helpful and gave us a nice upgraded room 
91311,The Trafalgar Hilton, The walls are paper thing Could hear next doors conversation at 1am We were disappointed that when we came back at 2pm our room had not been cleaned especially since we d been out since 9 15am , Location
91312,The Trafalgar Hilton, Breakfast fairly standard served in ground floor area people walking in from the street so rather draughty if seated near the door , Spacious room very quiet Comfortable bed Bathroom with bath and separate shower Great position close to Trafalgar Square Piccadilly Embankment restaurants and some theatres
91313,The Trafalgar Hilton, I guess booking out could happily have stayed for much longer , Close location to theatreland and shops along with superb views particularly from roof top bar In addition the staff made our stay outstanding Nothing appeared to be too much trouble for them and having discovered that one of us was celebrating a birthday they signed a card and placed a lovely gift in our room 
91314,The Trafalgar Hilton, Price facilities second lift not working obscure signs for do not disturb no signage for Hilton outside roof bar closed to guests due to private party , Location
91315,The Trafalgar Hilton, I specifically booked this hotel for the Vista bar On the first day we sent our food back and on the night the power went off to the heaters so we couldn t stay On our second day they closed it at 4pm for a private party of which we were not informed When I challenged this with hotel management they stated it is a destination bar and not owned by the Hilton This is not the impression they give on the website and use is as a marketing tool Overall extremely disappointed in the reaction of the staff and the service In the main bar a waiter spilled a glass of wine which resulted in a small measure He served it anyway without topping it up Not good , The location central to everywhere we needed to be
91316,The Trafalgar Hilton, The carpet in the rooms looked tired used slightly grubby , The open air roof top bar restaurant was fantastic on a good weather day for meeting friends socialising with some great views across London 
91317,The Trafalgar Hilton, Not really bad but would have preferred a street view rather than the office blocks Made the room a bit dark but for one night it was ok , The smartness and general decor along with the attention to detail and attentiveness of staff loved the ambience of the roof terrace The breakfast was excellent with a lot of choice 
91318,The Trafalgar Hilton, Room was a bit dated as was the furniture it also looked out on an office block and car park Did not consider it to be a deluxe room , Location roof top and staff excellent 
91319,The Trafalgar Hilton, The only hotel on my trip through Europe and UK that did not provide free wifi I pointed out to the girl on reception it was advertised as free wifi on booking com and she very reluctantly gave me a password to use in the downstairs bar area only but she was not very nuce about it at all My room also overlooked the office block very close next door so I could not open the curtains in my room for privacy reasons, Great breakfast 
91320,The Trafalgar Hilton, We booked this hotel for the rooftop bar expecting a nice chilled drink looking over the Square We went up before going to bed only to be met with a private party in section of roof with a view then were sat in middle of roof with no view at all Drinks also seemed overly expensive which i wouldn t have minded had we had a decent view It all seemed very pretentious and not what we expected at all , Reception staff really helpful Great location 
91321,The Trafalgar Hilton, One staff member at rooftop bar said we needed a reservation although we were staying at the hotel Then rushed us saying how long we were going to be, The rooftop bar Really like the staff offering blankets later in the night Like the drinks and mini bar charges charged to the room was posted in envelope under door Easy to sign and hand in
