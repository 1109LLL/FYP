498994,Vilana Hotel, The location is a bit far away from the centre You have to walk for a metro about ten minutes and then with metro about 20 minutes to get to the centre , Nice and clean basic hotel 
498995,Vilana Hotel, 1 Sound proof was t good 2 There s no conditioner in the bathroom 3 The clean lady knocked my door at 10am not the check out time TWICE for no reason I was at a good dream but hardly to fell asleep again after that I told the reception but he just say apologize and explained the clean lady was new 3 In the beginning I noted I need a room with bathtub but they gave me a room without that They did fix it in the end but I would say they should be able to pay more attention on customer s request , Staffs from reception were friendly always with smile Single room was stylish Underground is a good place to relax very pretty 
498996,Vilana Hotel, The hotel is a fair distance away from the heart of Barcelona so if exploring the city is the key then some place closer would be better , The room was very comfortable and super neat House keeping did a wonderful job during our stay The staff were very friendly and accommodating The hotel is located in a residential area and is quiet There are quite a few restaurants and bars a short distance away The metro stations were a 15 minute walk away and very convenient Wifi was fast and easy to access 
498997,Vilana Hotel, Website suggests there is a pool sadly not , Great location in fancy neighbourhood Being a bit further out means you get a lot nicer place for less money Staff were helpful Hotel was clean and quiet Safe pretty neighbourhood Close to public transport Small but good gym and if you re fitness minded good area for a run 
498998,Vilana Hotel, Nothing to report here, The staff were friendly and very helpful We were visiting friends living in the area This area is clean and safe and the food shops were excellent Also close to great restaurants and the Sarria area which is a wonderful place to explore early evening Have a drink and tapas in Sarria Caught a taxi to the Gothic area and explored the city centre and visited the Picasso museum Found taxis good value 
498999,Vilana Hotel, The bathroom is a bit outdated, Air conditioning was good made the room nice cool and comfy quiet and beautiful neighbourhood bed and pillows were comfy and even though it is about 20 mins away from the city centre the public transportation bus and connection to a metro and timing were reliable that it did not matter to us
499000,Vilana Hotel,No Negative, I have reviewed this hotel previously as I was in and out of this little gem several times over my 5 1 2 week visit to Spain I spent a total of 18 nights at the Vilana It was close to my daughter s dorm and was very convenient for me The staff was wonderful friendly and helpful I stayed in three different rooms and each one had a nice view especially room 11 Lots of electrical outlets a little refrigerator hair dryer robe and slippers Comfy beds and pillows This isn t a posh hotel but I rated it as excellent because it is clean and comfortable and exactly what I was looking for The hotel is in a beautiful and safe residential neighborhood but close to restaurants banks shops and markets It is a ten minute walk to metro and 15 20 minutes on metro to Pla a Catalunya the hub of Barcelona The bus runs along Bonanova which is a half block away I enjoyed getting away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas at the end of the day to the peace and quiet of the Vilana neighborhood Airport cab fare was approximately 30 35 each way Fares to most popular venues my daughter and I visited was 10 15 but I usually took metro Also convenient for those needing to be near Teknon Hospital I thoroughly enjoyed the Vilana 
499001,Vilana Hotel, The breakfast could be improved Had lunch there once and the overall quality wasn t excellent either , Overall a good place to stay I was attending a conference at the Congress centre which is easily reachable by taxi and avoids some Barcelona traffic by not staying in the city centre Having a balcony in the room was great
