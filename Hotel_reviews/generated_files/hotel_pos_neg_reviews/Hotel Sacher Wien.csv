404000,Hotel Sacher Wien, Climatisation wasnt strong enough we felt hot in the room when outside was 32 degrees and breakfast wasnt very special, We had beautiful suite with classic furniture it looked like in old castle bathroom was also large overall very luxuriously looking suite
404001,Hotel Sacher Wien, The Sacher Hotel is beautiful but over priced I think that the mini bar in the rooms should be free because of the high cost of the rooms and breakfast There was no drinking facilities in the room A couple of dirty marks on the carpet valance sheet and curtain The hotel is a luxury 5 star hotel and therefore should be totally spotless If i pay for a excellent hotel i expect high standards in every area However on the whole it has been a fantastic city break , The location of the hotel was excellent The staff were outstanding very friendly and helpful Everything in walking distance The Spanish horse riding school and the Golden concert Hall was between 5 to 10 minutes on foot The main shopping centre was 5 minutes on foot Lots of restaurants and small cafes to choose from Vienna is a brilliant City very vibrant If you are a Mozart and horse fan and love beautiful buildings Vienna is the place to visit The city is very clean and people take pride in the city

404009,Hotel Sacher Wien, Dinner meal in restaurant can be improved , I stayed in Sacher and Imperial hotels and no doubt Sacher is the best in Vienna as raring They offered me the best room overlooks the square it s stunning and beautiful The front desk assistant was so polite and professional He is very good Another black long hair gril in breakfast was so sweet and caring The restaurant are very beautiful Just a little compliant that the dinner is over price and not so delicious The next day the restaurant manager immediately regenised me and quickly appologised to me Overall the best best hotel in Vienna no doubt

404017,Hotel Sacher Wien, We asked for an early checkin in which did not happen Actually our room was ready 30 min after the normal check in time Staff asked us to wait in the lobby for an hour and completely forgot us and only checked us in after we reminded them Other guests were shown the facilities but we did not get an introduction to the restaurants and where the breakfast locations is Credit Card terminal did not work and other guests had the same experience Finally the third credit card terminal worked It was a very bad start , Very comfortable rooms with and extraordinary great service The breakfast is the best in the world The service in restaurants is unbeatable 
404018,Hotel Sacher Wien, The hotel restaurants should give priority to hotel residents We could not reserve a table in one of its 2 restaurants in a whole week whether lunch or dinner , The location was great The hotel is a gem of a property The decor of the place is beautiful and tasteful The staff are very helpful and polite It is a very comfortable hotel 
404019,Hotel Sacher Wien, Though I enjoyed the breakfast on the first day I found a hair in my eggs the second time I visited the restaurant The staff seemed oblivious about my complaint and asked me whether I wanted another set of poached eggs But I was just so turned off by the attitude I politely declined and left the restaurant I also requested a King size bed but was surprised to have two single beds joined together Some of the staff seemed pretentious which was a disappointment It wasn t at all comfortable for the money they charge , Location is perfect and the historical references within the property is amazing Opera house is next door which is nice if you re planning to watch a show Rooms are classy and well maintained 
404020,Hotel Sacher Wien, A cheap coffee and croissant breakfast option rather than just an expensive all you can eat hotel buffet , Staff were really friendly helpful and capable The location is excellent and the decor in keeping with the style and ambience of the hotel Great view of the Albertina from our bedroom window 
404021,Hotel Sacher Wien, Nothing to mention , My husband and I picked this hotel because we love history and beautiful properties Little did we know we would be also treated like royalty at this stunning property Our experience was fantastic from check in process until the end of our stay four nights later Hotel has remembered that we were celebrating and have prepared lovely surprise for us see pictures with heart on the bed and delicious treats I visited spa almost each day and it was a treat on its own Pictures dont do this hotel justice It is so well known in the heart of the city We would stay here again Many thanks go to all concierges They took such care of all our needs and questions We did not have to worry about making or cancelling reservations it was done all for us My special thanks goes to Marie Zerno Husband and I had to leave in a hurry and I left few items behind I communicated from the airport with Marie and she took care of everything from finding each item to personalky calling me znd informing me of everything along with shipment of items which were received the very next day I am so grateful to her for extraordinary care Thank you for everything Hotel Sacher we will be back 
404022,Hotel Sacher Wien, Everything was great , Everyone is wonderful there the concierge was very helpful and got us tickets to a Mozart concert the same night and the other staff including those in reception were great The hotel and the rooms are superb and you can t beat the location next to the opera house where we saw Lohengrin we bought the opera tickets ahead of time The food was also superb Room service was great This is the best hotel we have stayed at in the entire world 
404023,Hotel Sacher Wien, I liked everything but perhaps an extra covering for the bed would have been a bit more comfortable the evenings were getting chilly, Elegance with comfort and relaxed atmosphere
404024,Hotel Sacher Wien, The only little thing I didn t like is that the breakfast closes too early 10 30 AM Normally people go on vacation to detach from work and early wake ups Breakfast closing at noon would be much preferred , The hotel is Excellent and Luxurious Everything was pleasant location bed breakfast cleanliness and the interior royal historical architecture 
404025,Hotel Sacher Wien, room service after midnight is very very limited menu nothing available i ask for frute salad at 2 am its not available really i dont like from room service my room was 105, every thing
404026,Hotel Sacher Wien, There was one lady member of staff at the reception up on my arrival who was not listening At Sachers at the fees you charge a customer does not expect you to be good expects you to be excellent That lady was definitely letting the team down Your staff need to listen , Well this is Sacher of course there is a lot to like you have a good name elegant interior design some polite staff Cakes and pastry is always very good One of the best breakfast buffets 
404027,Hotel Sacher Wien, Staff should be able to identify famous people who appear in the photos, The room was very quiet there were cakes in the room the room was beautifully arranged in the evening my wife received a birthday gift from the hotel

404029,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, The hotel is an excellent location and rooms are luxurious The food is great especially the dinner More over my 8 years old daughter who has travelled with us more than 40 countries and stayed in the top most hotels around the world also want to stay here again 
404030,Hotel Sacher Wien, Too many smokers on the streets of Austria Time for Europe to wake up and realize that smoking truly kills and spoils the environment for nonsmokers as well , Excellent location in magnificent Vienna 
404031,Hotel Sacher Wien, Quite expensive The steep sided bath had no handles to help with entering and exiting , The food was excellent both for breakfast and in the Anna Sacher restaurant The staff were attentive and chocolates and a card were provided for special occasions The provision of maps and directions and the offer of a fixed price limousine to the airport were also welcome 
404032,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, We spent a perfect week end at this hotel in Vienna Excellent breakfast very beautiful suite with amazing view calm excellent service in the room great comfort we appreciated a lot 
404033,Hotel Sacher Wien, Electronics very heavy and clunky hairdryer room key leaking shower sliding door scuffed furniture average breakfast not that helpful concierge poor value extremely formal atmosphere but it s Vienna , Good location in the middle of the town Interesting decor comfortable bed mirror walls bathroom design waiters at the restaurant
404034,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, The service and more importantly the attitude toward service was exemplary We really liked the room and how carefully it was engineered to provide the best comfort using every little space and loading it with something extra We loved our room overlooking the Opera House And how close it was to just walk to the Opera for a performance We loved the extra special delivery of sweets frequently to the room and the lovely lamb cake and chocolate eggs for Easter It was very festive Although many of the staff were superb Sabrina was outstanding and really cared a lot about our stay The Blue Bar is chic and elegant The Anna Sacher restaurant was exquisite for our Easter dinner The food was excellent and the restaurant has an extensive and good wine list 
404035,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, This was our second stay at this luxury hotel The hotel offers sophistication comfort and relaxation Rooms are elegantly decorated and quiet Attention to detail and constant interaction with guests set this hotel apart from the others and make for a pleasant hotel stay Dining in the hotel s restaurants is always a real treat the food and wine are exquisite and service is excellent 
404036,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, Luxurious aristocratic hotel with amazing interior decoration Back to the XVIII XIX century The whole staff were really attentive and professional Every moment was stunning 
404037,Hotel Sacher Wien, Gym was small Rooms vary greatly so images in booking com do not necessarily give a good idea of the actual accommodation one will have , The staff were very good Georg on the front desk went above and beyond to help me find the best room for us among those available I was looking for a specific arrangement and he could not have been more patient or helpful The room was lovely and the whole ambiance of the hotel was one of elegance Dinner in the Red Bar was delicious two nights Best of the three hotels we have stayed in near the Vienna Opera 
404038,Hotel Sacher Wien, None at all , We had a perfect wedding at Hotel Sacher Salon Maria Theresia From the very beginning the level of attentiveness and respect of the staff exceeded all expectations Our requests were promptly fulfilled flower arrangements catering signage bookings etc were delivered without fault After the wedding we had a photo session in the hotel s magnificent settings with the staff guiding us through some of their historic rooms The next morning we had a delicious breakfast in the room and watched ballet dancers rehearse on the top floor of Vienna State Opera We also loved the spa and the bars at the hotel Definitely an experience to remember thanks for making that day so special for us 
404039,Hotel Sacher Wien, The furniture in the top deluxe room is a bit outdated We asked for anti allergic pillows and duvets and it took quite a long time before the housekeeper came she just left them and took the other ones without making the bed again The majority of the guests are 65 years old maybe not a really comfortable feeling for a family with a toddler , Beautiful hotel in the center of Vienna Great location Most of the staff are very friendly 
404040,Hotel Sacher Wien, We were not offered a top deluxe room with good view we had made reservation for Instead the offered an old degenerated suite with a small window against a wall We had to wait to long to get our room Delay 1 hour , Close to the Opera 
404041,Hotel Sacher Wien, The only tiny irritation was that there was no tea or coffee facility in the room Other than that perfect , An excellent hotel in a prime location in the centre of Vienna Exquisite room with large bathroom and shower facilities Everything to the last detail was perfect The Hotel is one of the best in Europe Excellent service from Receptionists waiters bar staff chamber maids

404046,Hotel Sacher Wien, Meeting of European ministers regarding Syria took place during that weekend so too much security and police everywhere also at the hotel lobby, All was great nothing to complain about 
404047,Hotel Sacher Wien, I wish there was a coffee machine in the suite the concierge staff were not friendly I greeted them most of the time but no one greet back while they should star with greetings or at least smile the pillows were low which was not good for neck support heating wasn t good enough in the suite Although it was fine in the living room but was bad in the bedroom the bed was not a king or queen size bed but was two joined single beds the receptionist who handled our check out was cold not friendly but to be fear she wasn t rude , the location is excellent although it s noisy The upgrade to suite because we were staying for 7 nights was great and my thanks to Tamara from reservation for that The suite was comfortable although its decoration was very classic The bellmen were very friendly and helpful The receptionist Manuel was very welcoming and friendly 
404048,Hotel Sacher Wien, Perhaps the breakfast even though it s really good could improve a bit We understand there s a lot of guests but something could perhaps be done about the presentation We would also prefer a bit more quiet environment But please understand these are small things , As close to perfect as you can get The staff is exceptional The blue bar the green restaurant Anna Sacher and the beautiful room all was absolutely perfect 
404049,Hotel Sacher Wien, I thought my Bookings price included two breakfasts but breakfast was not included in the Bookings price , The hotel was the second best of all hotels I have visited and I travel over 100 days per years fro the last 5 years The hotel is expensive but more than worth it and the breakfast is the best I ever had The staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful The location was perfect and the comfort supreme 
404050,Hotel Sacher Wien,No Negative, Hotel Sacher Wien offers the accomodation everybody woud love but not everybody could afford On my vacation I have travelled and stayed on all continents I prefer to stay at the best hotels but the Sacher Hotel was still something special The service and the rest were second to none I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody looking for the memorable stay The Sacher Hotel maks Wien even a more desirable location
