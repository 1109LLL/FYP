209596,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The staff were rude and inconsiderate waking us up at 7 am during our stay demanding payment despite making paying upfront for the 1st night The following morning the manager even came up knocking on our door with security demanding payment and that we pay in the next 5 minutes she did not even allow us time to freshen up Imagine being 2 young women in a foreign country being antagonised by hotel staff When I explained the situation she did not offer any any apologies for humiliating us and making us feel like thieves only that she cannot take our word for it and will liaise with her colleague who took the payment She also questioned us as to why we look dissatisfied and shocked Apparently being woken up at 7 am to loud knocks and being met by security for no valid reason is supposed to be normal Although it was all rectified from their end in the end they did not apologise for the error and the inconvenience they caused us for no good reason Avoid this hotel at all costs , Although small the room was very clean 
209597,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, No satellite tv in rooms not good if you don t understand French and some off the reception staff sometimes pretended not to understand the English language let me down at the end when the taxi I ask them to order for me never turned up at the time I needed it PANIC set in as I had to catch flight home , only thing which was worth going to France for was the food

209621,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, Very poor access to eletrical outlet just one and had to lie on the floor with a torch to access it under a shelf room too small and over heated and air conditioning adjustments made no difference breakfast not taken as too expensive no fridge or plates cutlery had my own , Close to frequent public transport garden friendly staff opposite good brasserie wifi worked room quiet even with window wide open didn t use pool as we had cold snap

209628,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The breakfast could of been better as it was worth 17 euro and there wasn t many options It was also very hard to get the shower at a good temperature, The hotel was only a two minute walk from the metro station It had a beautiful pool The rooms were spacious and very comfortable
209629,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, I would have loved a mirror by the table so I would do my make up in there while my boyfriend was showering All the staff members were amazing expect one lady at the start when we checked in she wasn t the most friendly which didn t give a great impression and she took a while to check us in and as it was 12 00am I did just want to go to sleep after such a long time travelling , I loved the room and everything looked so adorable I really enjoyed my stay everyone seems to complain on the reviews about the room size but we thought the room was a great size I can t wait to go again but for longer to use all the facilities

209631,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The Spa was nice but could not find the sauna and the steam room was not hot enough by far But let s face it that is a tiny issue that had no real impact on a good stay , Great sized room with lovely shower Comfy bed too Nice little pool for a morning dip Good choices for breakfast The staff were very helpful and they excused my shockingly bad French 
209632,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, If a comfortable bed is your thing then I think this hotel is not for you I ended up with a really sore back after 2 nights here There are simply not enough pillows and when I asked for more only 4 pillows supplied in a suite for 4 people there were no more available I was gobsmacked The staff told me that due to the hotel being full and other guests having stolen pillows they were not able to supply us with anything more than some towels sheets to try and lift the height of our pillow That didn t really do the trick so sadly comfort gets a low score from us it really did let the hotel down The jacuzzi was broken during our stay this was explained to us as we checked in and due to the bank holiday it would not be fixed during our stay Not a major problem to be honest but a little disappointing , The location for the hotel is great easy walking distance to the metro making sightseeing around Paris a doddle The hotel was nice and clean breakfast was lovely with a good selection and the parking facility albeit a bit of a tight squeeze if you have a bigger sized car was convenient Staff generally very friendly and knowledgeable 
209633,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The location is not that appealing However it s close to a metro station and if you are ok being far away from the touristic crowds you come to appreciate the area It also provides for finding good and much better value for money restaurants close the hotel The hotel in terms of room furniture and overall facilities does not give you the impression of a 4 star hotel Though the staff and breakfast make up for it , Staff were really nice and helpful Rooms are small but the receptionist was kind enough to give us a bigger room as we were traveling with a toddler The breakfast was also really really good 
209634,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, A lot of external noise during the night including laundry machines Basic room with no mini fridge or coffe machine No bathrobe and slippers for the swimming pool Massage not available due to quitting masseur Very small garage not included and very expensive We were given an invalide room ,No Positive

209639,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, Think breakfast should be included 36 euros for two is expensive The cleanliness of the bathroom was poor dirt and hair around the silicone in the shower Changing in pool area should have a few lockers for valuables The room was also very hot even with the temp on as low as it would go , Location is great very close to the metro line but far enough out of the centre to be quiet Nice pool and bar good size rooms for city hotel 
209640,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles,No Negative, Very comfortable and clean room Secure off street car parking with instant access to hotel so getting things out of or putting them back into the car again was easy Very short walk to Port De Versailles exhibitions location plus Metro system tram right outside foyer also handy for car exit entry to main circular road artery around Paris Efficient taxi calling too and bar What more does the Business Traveller need 
209641,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The description of the room is blatant false advertising I booked a superior room To me superior means just that a step above the basic grade I agreed to pay a little bit more money than other hotels were offering rooms for on the basis that this was a superior room When we got to the room it was tiny The photos are very deceiving I rang down to reception to ensure that we were in the right room as I had booked a superior room I was informed that all Paris hotel rooms are small and that superior is the lowest grade Firstly I purposely went that little bit outside the centre and spent a bit more to avoid the tiny rooms and secondly there is no way that superior should mean the lowest grade of a room Not at all happy with this Were not offered any upgrade even though hotel was very quiet Dissapopointed in this as I paid a lot of money for waht I thought was to be a superior room which was instead very basic Would not recommend people to stay here A bottle of water was left in the room for each guest Over the three days the room was cleaned every day and the empty bottles were let at the beside and were never replaced even though when we passed the trolleys on the corridor there were plenty of bottles Not great service Overall quite disappointed , The hotel has good facilities such as the swimming pool and bar The location near to the metro station was useful Staff were quick to respond to e mails requesting directions from airport etc

209644,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, Small living part in room Too expensive for value Do not provide simple facilities kettle etc Parking is expensive 3 hour or 20 day , Awesome swimming pool spa bar In room bathrooms are very confortable Very good Wi Fi connection A bit outside from Paris but well served by public transport 
209645,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles, The room was a little small but it didn t matter as we didn t spend much time in there , The location was fantastic The facilities at the hotel were really good especially the pool and spa after a long day walking around Paris We had bar food every night and the food was exceptional the staff second to none We d definitely stay again 
209646,Oceania Paris Porte De Versailles,No Negative, on arrival staff very friendly maintained finish throughout my stayI like the fact that we had a separate toilet to the shower room relaxing in the Jacuzzi and swimming pool and steam and sauna
