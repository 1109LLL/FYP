356072,The Toren, We liked everything I would add that the stairs are steep being Amsterdam but there is a lift if you need it We drove to the city and although there is some parking near the hotel it is extremely expensive and I would really advise against taking your car into the centre We parked in a Park and Ride on the outside and took Tram 14 in to Westmarkt which is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel, The Toren is in an excellent location beside a quiet canal It is comprised of 2 canal side houses a few metres apart The staff are extremely efficient and friendly Our room was in the annexe building a couple of minutes down the road we had a great view on to the canal The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the room was quiet due to the double glazing We had a large Jacuzzi bath as part of the room but it could be curtained off The breakfast was excellent value for money good buffet and hot food to order served in a beautiful elegant room which was also a nice relaxing bar in the evening They also have a courtyard garden to sit in at the back of the main building The hotel made our trip
356073,The Toren, The massive bicycle jams and discourteous riders You take your life in your hands just crossing the street from the bikers not from any cars , The Toren Hotel is in a quiet neighborhood right on a canal but 5 minute walk to main transportation Reception staff was excellent Helpful in locating transportation to various sections of the city excellent advice for dinner and making our reservations Especially grateful for staff s recommendation of Apple pie at Winkle s Excellent collection Dutch gins in hotel bar and period lounge to discover them with guidance of evening bar keeper 
356074,The Toren, Breakfast is not included It would have been helpful to know that before we ate , Fantastic hotel in a great location Wish we could have stayed longer We ll be back 
356075,The Toren, Since the building like the area was old certian accommodations to the historic nature of the property were necessary Like stairs where you would prefer an elevator Overall quite acceptable , Very modern in a very old area Exactly the right area to stay in while visiting Amsterdam
356076,The Toren,No Negative, We stayed here for our honeymoon and everything at the Toren was amazing There was a bottle of Moet and Chandon champagne and strawberries waiting for us in our room I had also ordered flowers in our wedding colors to be placed in the room and the arrangement far surpassed any expectations I had It was gorgeous The room itself was absolutely beautiful we stayed in the Garden cottage which is actually in the courtyard I loved being a little secluded and looking out the window to see the beautiful flowers in the courtyard The main building for the hotel is also stunning The bar was incredible The staff were extremely accommodating and kind One of the best hotel experiences I ve ever had 
356077,The Toren,No Negative, Rent bikes from hotel on first day it s a must Everything is amazing there Room 107 is superb Private garden for smoking and relaxing Bar tenders are great too 
356078,The Toren, Rooms are small it is an old building Great place for a couple not sure about more that two people , Our first stop on our two week trip to the Netherlands and it could not have been abetter place to start our explorations Classic boutique hotel in a older building decked out in dark boudoir style Lovely view out over the roof tops Full jacuzzi in our room even always nice after a long flight Comfortable furnishings but rooms are not huge which was fine Special bonus the sounds of the WestKirk bells on the quarter hour Gentle on the summer breeze Delightful 
356079,The Toren, Hotel undergoing renovation without notice arrived after 26 hour flight from Australia little opportunity to relocate renovation noise above bedroom did not cease until about 7pm each night access via tiny lift requiring extra stairs to be negotiated with suitcases narrow corridor bedroom small shabby cluttered with outmoded and unnecessary furniture minimal storage nowhere to unpack or store suitcases need I go on I am amazed that this hotel has such apparently excellent ratings Not borne out by our experience , Staff pleasant and reasonably helpful 
356080,The Toren, Breakfast was fancy but really pricey We just got cappuccinos from the bar and walked nearby for waffles , The staff were amazing and the room itself was so nice Intricate lighting comfy bed whirlpool bathtub we wish we there longer 
356081,The Toren,No Negative, Very friendly staff in a beautiful bohemian setting The hotel is very well located and most all the sites and venues you would want to see in Amsterdam is within walking distance 
356082,The Toren, View non existent a window up above looked into our room so curtains had to remain Closed, Comfy bed small room wasn t as small as expected breakfast tasty
356083,The Toren,No Negative, Our stay at the Toren was quite possibly the best hotel experience we have ever had I travel internationally for business and pleasure often so I ve spent time in many hotels and the uniqueness of the Toren stood out The staff was amazing friendly and quick to act if you needed anything The location is amazing beautiful and quiet with tons of a great restaurants in walking distance We walked everywhere Nothing was longer than a 25 minute walk If you are tired of typical chain hotels like Waldorf Astoria or Hiltons and Marriotts the Toren is the perfect hotel I cannot wait to return 
356084,The Toren, The only thing which is out of the hotel s control is that about 7 8 AM every day there was some construction work going on outside our hotel right under our windows It woke us up but it was not that big of deal , I love the hotel it was very unique in that it still felt vintage but modernized The staff was so incredibly kind and helpful They went above and beyond to make our stay special I would stay there again in a heartbeat 
356085,The Toren, brackfast not much should increase many kind of food friut bread, Staff very intelligent And good service I like nespresso coffee jagucci in room i can relax after travel so much It like this place and will come bk again sure

356087,The Toren, Free water in the room is the only thing I can think of , Breakfast was excellent Room had luxurious fabrics and style Location and view of canal was great Big jacuzzi tub in bathroom Bath shower toilet in separate rooms spaces was great for 3 persons to share Staff could not have been nicer 
356088,The Toren, Property was under construction My room was loud during the day , Great breakfast service and location Hotel was under construction with scaffolding all over which was disappointing Room was pretty good though loud during the day The people were great 
356089,The Toren, Bartenders really just the very tall one would take your order for one drink then let you rot for the rest of your time in the bar while talking to friends So bar service was clearly below par Plus you had to get up and find him to pay your bill Also the card keys would stop working 1 2 times per day I made 6 trips to the front desk to get working card keys Crazy , Good buffet breakfast with nice woman making it
356090,The Toren, chairs for breakfast meal Had to sink too low into very comfy sofas Okay for evening bar and relaxing but didnt really work sitting at a table for breakfast My son and girlfriend thought that the room meals were bland , Very comfy bed Choice of breakfast Decor Pleasant staff 
356091,The Toren, The bed was quite wobbly to my liking and alittle bit high aother than that everything was awesome, THE staff was really helpfull i got sick during the trip but the staff help me alot with setting me up meeting with the doctor and the reception ladies was lovely and caring thank you so much
356092,The Toren, Location room very small and in the back and I have to take the stairs down to go the elevator and again up to reach my room with bags very uncomfortable, Wifi

356099,The Toren, Nothing , Great hotel Wonderful friendly staff that helps in anyway Impeccable service Gorgeous rooms decor and lobby dinning bar area made our stay so much warmer and fun We had great drinks at bar at midnight chatting by the fire place Location is perfect in a middle of shopping area and not too far from the train station Amsterdam is a walkable city so we enjoyed walking a tons and we re always happy to be back to our beautiful place If you want to enjoy your stay in Amsterdam look no further We will be back for sure Thank The Toren

356102,The Toren, Our room was not actually located in the main building but in a separate building not far from the hotel No major hardship but the separate building didn t feel quite as luxurious and it meant we had further to go after our night cap to collapse into bed , The Toren is in the beautiful Jordaan area of Amsterdam just a couple of minutes from Anne Frank s house making it an ideal base for exploring We stayed in the Special Deluxe room which was wonderful Super comfy bed and the fabulous bath was just what we needed after a day traipsing around in the snow When I informed the staff that it was my partner s birthday the owners very kindly surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolates and strawberries The bar is stunning and the G and T s a must

356106,The Toren,No Negative, Amazing place The staff is really dedicated and helpful location by the canal could not be better very enjoyable stay Delicious breakfast Decoration tasteful and classy We will certainly come back 
356107,The Toren, It worked out really expensive when comparing the quality to other hotels I have stayed in at a similar cost , The staff were really friendly it was in a great location to Jordaan and the train station and the bed in the cottage was really comfy with blackout curtains 
356108,The Toren, I didn t like that I had to leave so soon , The staff upon arrival do everything to make you feel welcome and at ease So friendly and helpful The room was stunning and the bathroom so up to date and classy Cannot fault this place one bit The bar tender was a gent full of Whitt and humour and the staff did everything they could to provide timetables and even book us a table in a fine restaurant I ll be returning soon
356109,The Toren,No Negative, Wow what a place I don t know how we will ever be able to stay anywhere else in Amsterdam after staying here Hot tub in our room was fabulous staff friendly and willing to do anything to make our stay better and the decor is beautiful Stay here if you want a luxury night away 
356110,The Toren, The only very minor complaint is that the bathrooms don t have good ventilation so they steam up quickly and with three people showering the last person can t see their hand in front of their face Other than that no complaints , The rooms were stunning kind of like a classy 1800 s boudoir Comfy beds very nice bathrooms with Rituals toiletries and fluffy towels excellent coffee Really loved the whole experience staying here from the friendly customer service very funny bar man who made me the best elderflower g and t I ever had and location that is literally right around the corner from the Anne Frank house Wish we could have stayed longer

356118,The Toren, There was nothing not to like , From our reception to our departure the staff could not have been more pleasant or accommodating In addition to that our room was comfortable and cosy and the lounge warm and inviting Also the breakfast provided a perfect start to our day Coupled with the location being perfect this was the perfect boutique hotel for us 
356119,The Toren, Breakfast food selection limited More of a continental breakfast , Setting is sumptuous The decorations are extensive and interesting The setting close to a canal is lovely 
356120,The Toren,No Negative, Staff were so welcoming and happy to help with absolutely anything The hotel bar is possibly one of the best bars we ve been to with the bartender even managing cocktails they don t sell Great location in the heart of Amsterdam and within walking distance of almost everywhere 
356121,The Toren, Nothing I did not like , the bed was a cloud The decor was tasteful and luxurious Appreciated the Nespresso machine in the room And being unfamiliar with its operation the staff immediately came to the room to help out We were in the main hotel and the acoustics were great Love the bar and its atmosphere Every
356122,The Toren, Elevator to room floors but still a fair number of steps, Friendly and helpful saff Very efficient Very customer focused Room was very comfortable spatub was wonderful 
356123,The Toren,No Negative, we came here for our honeymoon and stayed at the superior suite The room was spectacular very modern with unique facilities and very clean Staff were very friendly and always willing to help out with any queries or recommendations for sight seeing restaurants etc Nothing to complain about and will definitely visit again 
356124,The Toren, Only issue was the raised floor area which was black with no way of seeing the edges particularly in dark cannot see and results ed in one or toe stubbed toes , Attentive staff always helpful Nice room luxurious bath
356125,The Toren, Massive unnecessary tour of the room which was the small canal view so tiny 3 of us crammed in while it was explained what towels and dressing gowns looked like Awkward We also filled in the hotel review with the promise of a VIP pass for our next visit This did not arrive , Location beautiful neighbourhood
356126,The Toren,No Negative, The staff were incredible Everyone from the receptionists the barstaff and even the friendly chap who ordered us a takeaway pizza in the small hours long after the restaurant was shut and brought it to our room complete with dinnerware and sauces it s the little things Love love love this hotel 
356127,The Toren,No Negative, The Toren made my first experience in Amsterdam memorable extremely comfortable This was my first trip traveling alone there couldn t be a better place to stay than the Toren The location was perfect for familiarizing myself with Amsterdam The Toren was very clean and the bedding was fantastic slept very well Stay at the Toren 
356128,The Toren,No Negative, We only stayed one night but the staff was great and the room was very nice The hotel is close to the center of the city and the next time we go back to Amsterdam we are definitely booking here 
356129,The Toren, The lack of a view we faced a wall with windows which was unpleasant and not private if the curtains were not drawn Book directly through the hotel for better choice , The location and the staff s hospitality were outstanding Our bathroom was exceptionally modern and well appointed Room was small but typical We did not have any view but many rooms do The breakfast buffet was not included but was lovely The willingness of the staff to help with reservations transportation etc was incredible Would highly recommend 
356130,The Toren,No Negative, This was my second time staying at the Toren and I love it The staff is so accomadating and will do anything for you The rooms are small but so nicely done I would stay here again Love it 
356131,The Toren,No Negative, charming room with view closely overlooking the canal wonderful on a very rainy day great bar service and the most stylish gin and tonics Generous and amusing 
356132,The Toren,No Negative, Fantastic location very close to Anne Frank house 10 minute walk to Centraal Station and 25 minute walk to museum area Very helpful and knowledgeable staff Excellent breakfast in comfortable dining area Comfortable beds clean bathroom good in room amenities 
356133,The Toren, The decor will enthrall some and turn off others Though I am certain they were going for eclectic opulence it seemed odd Walls of faux snake skin faux alligator faux corrugated steel and uniformly black paint were unique but simply not my style My wife found it less of an issue i may have been additionally put off by the light switch panel with a dozen plus buttons which frustrated me as I spent several minutes just trying to light the bathroom Oh that was a seperate switch elsewhere Why I was the one tasked with adjusting the lights is another discussion One of the NASA inspired switches scared the bejesus out of me when it made a string curtain close over a wall behind me why So there would be strings over the wall I guess This isn t a bad place to kick back after enjoying Amsterdam but just not to my taste If you re there for the coffee houses it might be more to your liking I should say it was relatively affordable and if this is your bag baby go for it As another reviewer said the place is actually much darker than it appears in the photos , Location was good and the hotel as a whole was fine 
356134,The Toren, Didn t really appreciate the sight seeing tour of the hotel after a full day of travelling No room service Room full of gadgets Just wanted a kettle and a tea bag rather than a coffee pod and instructions of use Unable to turn off the tv it was continually advertising viewing packages The room was compact which appeared to be dominated by the large screen tv which one could not turn off , The very comfortable bed Air conditioning Lashings of hot water and good toiletries The breakfast was adequate self service with a choice of continental or cooked which was kept warm in heated containers 
356135,The Toren, It wasn t paid for by somebody else , From the moment I stepped thru the front foor I realised I had won This place was a total flawless victory Everything was on par within the foyer staff were polite friendly and efficient Appearing open to all reasonable requests The Sauna was awesome too 
356136,The Toren,No Negative, The canal view room was splendid We really loved the little details such as the chandelier in the bed and the colour changing bath Everything was to immaculate detail 
356137,The Toren, Breakfast could of been complimentary at this price , The staff at The Toren are without doubt the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at and that includes some big name 5 especially the bar staff Not cheap but you have to pay for what you get in Amsterdam 
356138,The Toren,No Negative, The staff went above and beyond in my opinion They were very helpful and arranged museum tickets found us great places to eat and they always seemed to have a genuine smile on their faces 
356139,The Toren, Nothing really , The staff is extremely friendly and helpful Kars Gert Jan and others the location is perfect Our Superior Deluxe room was not very large but very well furbished and quiet ours overlooked the garden at the back The bed was very comfortable Excellent breakfast in the morning and bar service in the evening All in all a very pleasant stay 
356140,The Toren, Only downside was the steep stairs , Canal view room with spa was excellent Service in the bar was great and the staff was very friendly helpful We ate at two of the recommended restaurants and they were both excellent 
356141,The Toren, Couldn t fault our stay We didn t experience noise or disturbance from our canal room and the stairs were fine as we are mobile We had two beds which made the room small but we were told about this in advance and it was fine for us , Great location superb room with Nespresso spa bath best bed ever lovely breakfast in delightful setting helpful staff 
356142,The Toren, That I could not stay longer , What is there to not like Hotel was in a great location good decor rooms were clean bed was comfy had great decor plus Nespresso machine bathroom has a tub and all amenities bar was excellent shoutout to the great bartenders there I have to say though that the best part was the service The hotel s team are so friendly and not because they had to be and went OVER and BEYOND what was expected of them Special mentions are Melanie Marjolein Kas and the rest of the team Kudos to all of you and thank you sooo much Will be coming back to Amsterdam soon 
356143,The Toren, Nothing it was perfect x, Everyting The Toren is a perfect hotel wonderful location beautifully decorated very romantic quiet and personal Would 100 stay there again and recommend it to all couples its beautiful xx
356144,The Toren, They have a separate part of the hotel that is a short walk down the same street I was unaware of that separate part of hotel rooms and although beautiful would have preferred to be in the main building , The staff went the extra mile in trying to make sure I was satisfied with my stay beautiful boutique hotel enjoyed the breakfast buffet each day was thoroughly pleased and would gladly stay there again whenever I return 
356145,The Toren, Very expensive compared to other hotels I ve stayed in with better facilities The coffee machine in the room was a nightmare to work out and the room itself was small although we were told about this at the time of booking No view at all Only small quibbles A good trip was had by all, Lovely little boutique hotel with excellent service in a great part of the city We had a good stay here and I would be happy to recommend to a friend 
356146,The Toren, That I didn t get to stay longer seriously a wonderful hotel , The thing that separates The Toren is the people that work there very attentive and seem genuinely concerned that you are having a fabulous time staying with them without being over bearing The breakfast is a must as well as Gin and Tonic at the bar I just can t express our pleasure with The Toren a phenomenal hotel that will make you glad you chose them My go to hotel when I go to Amsterdam again Perfect in every way 
356147,The Toren,No Negative, We loved everything about staying at The Toren All of the staff were great and even helped my husband make an emergency dental appointment when he had a tooth break during our first night there The bed was incredible and wished I could take it home They offered a great breakfast great bar service and worked very hard to make us feel at home Would stay there again 
356148,The Toren, Nothing to dislike about this unique hotel only sad stay was only for a weekend , The staff couldn t be any nicer or more helpful at this stunning hotel Great location will definitely be coming back 
356149,The Toren, The decor tries too hard to be different edgy The result is a rather dark gloomy almost bordello atmosphere No doubt that is what they are trying to achieve After all it is Amsterdam I prefer a bright cheerful aspect I was in a room in a building a little down the road I would have preferred not to have to walk the street to get to from the main hotel , Fine big room with jacuzzi bath which I did not use 
356150,The Toren, Cannot take a drink in the garden Comparable quality boutique hotel 2 doors down at half price Small public rooms, Friendly generally helpful staff Well decorated and comfortable room with a tiny bathroom The room did have a Jacuzzi which we did not use but others might find useful Great location 
356151,The Toren, Our stay was too short We did not have time to try the breakfast , Our stay at this boutique hotel was very enjoyable We had two rooms in the annex building which is several doors down from the main building We did not hear a peep from any other guests during our stay 
356152,The Toren,No Negative, I travel a lot and this is by far my favorite hotel in the world The location is excellent the hotel is beautiful but the staff are what make this place even more amazing Everyone was so nice and helpful I truly felt like a guest 
356153,The Toren, Can t think of much Room was a little small for the rate , Hotel was in a great location The staff were very professional helpful and warm We had a very early morning departure and they had coffee and a cab waiting Would highly recommend this hotel 
356154,The Toren, No complaints , Very nice boutique hotel in the Jordaan great locaton Small but extremely comfortable room with plenty of amenities Breakfast was very nice good coffee Staff were very accomodating to any request Gin and tonics were beautifully crafted and delicious Would definitely return 
356155,The Toren,No Negative, The staff concierge could not be more helpful and friendly The made suggestions and ticket arrangements for for us on the spot They had suggested a restaurant they we loved Excellent location within walking distance of all tourist attractions 30 minutes Would stay there again when in Amsterdam
356156,The Toren, There could have been more storage space for clothing, Outstanding staff excellent location room with view over canal very quiet peaceful area Superb breakfast 
356157,The Toren, The style a little old fashioned and stuffy room rather small the service was a bit overdone , Excellent location elegant style great coffee machine in the room nice deep bath tub 
356158,The Toren, Can not think of one thing, Staff was very pleasant and extremely helpful Very friendly and convenient Breakfast and bar were charming No need went unmet 
356159,The Toren, Nothing at all I highly recommend it and will be back when I next visit Amsterdam , In addition to a perfect location and deeply comfortable room the Toren staff are unbelievably well informed hardworking attentive and thoughtful They even persevered until they sourced tickets for the Ann Frank house until they found them for me They cheerfully booked taxis a canal cruise and brilliant local restaurants they recommended In a foreign city for a short time this is exactly the expert team you want on your side ensuring you make the best of your time Make time to get a cocktail or delicious gin and tonic in their outrageously flamboyant bar 
356160,The Toren,No Negative, The rooms were stunning The wirl pool bath was huge a really luxurious The staff were really professional but still relaxed and fun There was no problem asking for anything The location is really good too Close to lots of nice places bars and restaurants yet on a quiet location 
356161,The Toren,No Negative, We loved the decor of the hotel as well as the room appointments The location was central to the heart of Amsterdam and close to sights restaurants and shopping 
356162,The Toren, There is a 20 charge per day if you wish to watch TV Not a great choice if handicapped Have to walk u stairs to get elevator, Staff friendly helpful Great location Beautiful rooms and bar
356163,The Toren,No Negative, It s dark and sumptuous interior are gorgeous to recline into especially with their fantastic Gin and Tonics but the staff are the best feature they are so welcoming friendly informative and helpful They even celebrated our engagement with us with a complimentary bottle of bubbles I don t think I could stay anywhere else in Amsterdam now 
356164,The Toren, For the cost of the room I feel the breakfast should be included The suite we stayed in only had a thick curtain to pull across to separate the bathroom from the bedroom It would be important to check with the hotel to make sure you are getting what you are expecting , The deluxe suite was beautiful The amenities were outstanding and the staff was extremely polite and friendly My stay did not include a breakfast but I grabbed a bowl of fruit and they did not charge me I thought that was very sweet I would definitely stay at the Toren again 
356165,The Toren, No mirror above dressing table to dry hair apply make up Bathroom lighting was very dim also unable to apply make up using bathroom mirror, Bed was fantastic Bathroom was beautiful
356166,The Toren, The smokers who smoked in our non smoking room before we checked in , Location was perfect The staff were very accommodating and helpful Great atmosphere The bar was the best 
356167,The Toren, Nothing , Everything was perfect for us The staff were all very friendly and helpful will definitely return to the Toren next time we come to Amsterdam 
356168,The Toren,No Negative, The best hotel I have ever stayed in The staff are great So helpful And not to forget Great cocktails in the bar The location is great too So close to everything only a few minutes walk to the dam square I would definitely stay here again 
356169,The Toren, There is no restaurant at the Toren only a limited bar menu The red and black design aesthetic was a bit like a bordello not really my taste , The staff was friendly and very helpful The location was perfect 
356170,The Toren, Makeup mirrors lighting in bathroom, Elegant and comfortable the most amazingly nice people run this place and go over the top to please their guests charming bar and breakfast area great food and super bartender the receptionists and front desk people were wonderful in providing directions even printing out walking maps and providing tram and train info to keep us oriented and the concierge knew everything about how to get things done even tracking down and getting my lost iphone returned From a taxi driver
356171,The Toren, Our only niggle is our room was a little noisy from the housekeeping staff whose storage room was very close to our bedroom However when we mentioned this to reception on leaving our comments were taken very seriously and relayed to the owner We couldn t ask for a more positive response , The hotel staff both reception and bar are extremely helpful The location is very central for all the major sights boutique shopping and bars or restaurants The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and the facilities in our bedroom were excellent 
356172,The Toren, Slippery floor in shower lack of drawers in the bedroom, Stunning bar with great d cor very friendly and helpful staff and no problem was too difficult for guest relations to solve
356173,The Toren, Can t think of anything , The staff were all friendly and very helpful Their suggestions for places for dinner were spot on and they made the reservations for us 
356174,The Toren, The only thing that would have been better is that we could have stayed longer , The most genuinely friendly and knowledgable staff I have ever experienced Beautifully appointed and comfortable rooms Fabulous location so convenient for exploring the city views luxury charm and did I mention beyond amazing staff the perfect combination for a place to stay Such a treat to be there Can t wait to come back to Amsterdam and it is in good part because of how welcome The Toren made our whole family feel and my kids are tough critics 
356175,The Toren, Room service food was limited, Loved the staff they went beyond what is expected of normal staff Everyone seemed to care about our well being this is special The bar lounge was incredible Location was perfect 
356176,The Toren, Nothing it was a fantastic stay , The Staff at the hotel was super friendly and able to answer any questions we might have The location of the hotel is fantastic close to the Anne Frank House and the Tram lines Room service at night was very quick to deliver our orders Given the opportunity to return to Amsterdam I would stay here again or recommend it to a friend going to Amsterdam 
356177,The Toren, Bigger bed but next time we ll book a different room, The service was exemplary such lovely staff Nothing was too much trouble Arriving late asking if they would still serve food and getting the response anything you fancy we will get summed it up The hotel is very beautiful and we felt relaxed immediatly
356178,The Toren, Lack of telephone notepads and pen pencil That s it , Very warm atmosphere friendly service probably the best bed I have ever slept on excellent breakfast
356179,The Toren, Smoking area has not enough ventilation which makes you go and smoke outside where most of the time the weather is not good As well we found breakfast buffet too poor for such a high leveled hotel , Great service amazing environment very cozy place and friendly people Very unique hotel in its way If we go again to Amsterdam we will definitely stay in THE TOREN again The management of this hotel is amazing they are engaged to their job Well done everybody Great team 
356180,The Toren, Given the price I think breakfast should be included in the rate Other than that I couldn t fault the place , The staff were friendly and very helpful The room was lovely and the bed very comfortable Also loved the spa bath Hotel within walking distance to everything we wanted but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the bars 
356181,The Toren, Nothing at all, The staff were amazing I wasn t well when I checked in and they made everything easier and room service and housekeeping were also great 
356182,The Toren, That the staff came to our room due to a complaint even though we were in bed al night Sunday then on the monday they moved us to the out building which was cold then they got 6 police officers because we slept in on Tuesday an hour by checkout which they then took our detail trying to find out what happend then let us go an other half hour later as we only slept in which caused us to miss our flight home would not recommend for young couples for a romantic break as their not interested in your version of the story and when I say young couple we are 28 we will not be back to the torrent hotel we had to book new flights n hotel for one night which cost us an other 500 really unhappy as we paid a lot of money in th first not worth it to be treated that way , The hot tub in room was good to just chill
356183,The Toren, Having to leave, Everything Perfect You feel as if you re the only person staying in the hotel their attention to you and everything about your stay is utterly charming From the moment you arrive to the second you leave they treat you as part of their family and everything you ask for or enquire about is treated with the utmost importance politeness and affection Everyone we met there left an indelible mark on us and we cannot thank the hotel enough for making our special weekend to Amsterdam unforgettable Thank you thank you thank you 
356184,The Toren, be lovely if this hotel had served lunches and if it had spa facilities , Fantastic gothic decor in rooms and in central areas Wonderful bar great breakfast extremely friendly and helpful staff fantastic location in great area of Amsterdam
356185,The Toren, Our first room 106 was quaint and welcoming However the time we spent in our room was disappointing due to the loud noises we experienced including banging doors when the day staff left the sound of broken glass people stomping up and down stairs and a high pitched sound elevators or washing machines , The staff could not have been nicer more informative or approachable 
356186,The Toren, Nothing, We left an awful hotel and came here it s an instant relief walking in The staff are so friendly and happy to help The hotel is clean and beautiful We were apologised to because we were in a small room with a small bed It was perfect and the bed massive They have high standards and it shows We didn t want to leave one night wasn t enough 
356187,The Toren, The lift is a bit cramped and juddery , Gorgeous quirky hotel with good sized rooms and a big comfy bed Good location outside the centre but still within short walking distance of most of the major sites Would definitely recommend 
356188,The Toren,No Negative, The hotel staff were extremely welcoming The hotel didn t disappoint It was amazing and the bed and bath were great The best nights sleep ever I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I was sad to leave You must visit here The hotel staff have kindly just messaged me also to let me know I left my purse there which I think is pretty great 
356189,The Toren, Very small and not acoustic you can hear people breathing when they pass by your door and this was very annoying and sleep disturbing, Well decorated and located Good staff and good food
356190,The Toren,No Negative, The staff where so very friendly interested and service minded Room was tidy classy and the beds really comfortable I especially liked the option to completely turn off ventilation and instead open the window Do not miss the bar I really liked the historic setting and how interesting the room has been handled with lighting and furniture I would recommend to try the many different Gin Tonics although you may regret that the morning after But then you may soothe yourself with the freshly pressed orange juice at the excellent breakfast also served in the lovely bar 
356191,The Toren,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and welcoming and every effort was made to ensure we had a wonderful visit It was clear this hotel strives for perfection in all areas I will definitely return

356200,The Toren,No Negative, The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Amsterdam It provides an easy access to the main attractions in the city The Anne Frank museum is just steps away The city center is a 5 min walk The rooms were appropriate for staying in the heart of Amsterdam While the photos of the hotel on the web did deter us initially from making a booking in reality they do not reflect the warm coziness that we felt once we were there This was due to the truly great service we received at the hotel Upon arrival the staff were very helpful in unloading the bags While our rooms were being prepared they ensured that we could enjoy your bar with the freshly brewed coffee The freshly brewed coffee was incidentally one of the best we have tasted During both days the staff at the hotel were always ready to help they never ever declined any of our requests The breakfast has just perfect Our stay is characterized by superlatives And so our visit to Amsterdam left us with wonderful memories 
356201,The Toren,No Negative, The Toren had given me a unique experience When I arrived at the reception I was immediately welcomed by the staff that would be taking care of my demands all over the hosting The kindness and the intention to help out are noticeable about the way the guest is spoiled with any requests or just with the attention of always leave fresh and chilled water at your disposal The room was very well decorated using an Amsterdam atmosphere and obviously some details can not be missed like the Nespresso coffee machine with some great coffee blends and the incredible sheets that helps the bed be more comfortable and perfect than ever The bathroom is another experience by itself as the floor is warm and the bathtub controls the scene with a full clean warm water jet and a perfect relaxing bath completed by lily and fluffy towels The breakfast is a unique experience pleasing to international taste they dispose many options fresh fruits cookies coffee tasty assorted breads and the service is located at the charming hotel bar making the experience even more authentic and enjoyable Well I don t believe is possible for me to written all the details that this pleasant experience in this hotel because the true experience is a great feeling that is a hard task to put into words Great work Toren Team Keep that way 
356202,The Toren, Stayed in the annex which mean t having to walk to the bar and breakfast in the rain No restaurant facility in the evening , Excellent friendly helpful staff very comfortable cosy hotel
356203,The Toren, Nothing , A perfect hotel in every way From the fantastic decor to the friendly attentive staff who can t do enough for you to the beautiful breakfast selection Nothing in this hotel disappoints Fantastic location on a beautiful canal walking distance to the museums and resturants and all the sights I would reccomend this hotel to anyone wanting a hotel in the center of Amsterdam that makes you feel like you are somewhere special

356207,The Toren,No Negative, Me and my two friends in our twenties stayed here to celebrate the new year We found this hotel to be the best we ve ever stayed in and would definitely come here again Location It is in an ideal location just down the road from the Anne Frank house There is a tram stop at the end of the road about a 2 minute walk away which tram 13 or 17 takes you directly to central station in under 7 minutes Also next to the tram stop is a handy supermarket There was peace and quiet at night time which was ideal Hotel The hotel itself is stunningly decorated We were welcomed to a bottle of moet champagne The bedroom was roomy and the bed was the comfiest I ve ever slept in There was a posh coffee machine which was great as well as a fridge although the snacks in there you pay for but we used it for our own food drink The bathroom had the most amazing tub and shower and the Ritual toiletries were complimentary and gorgeous You get given cosy robes and towels are changed each day Very impressive Staff Absolutely amazing staff So helpful and patient explaining directions and providing their top recommendations The hotel contacted me before arrival with tips on restaurants so helpful Special mention to Roxanne who me and the girls found to be so helpful throughout our stay You must try this hotel you will not be disappointed 
356208,The Toren,No Negative, very convenient place to access to all sightseeings Hotel is very clean and have all needed for relaxing clean rooms with good facilities breakfast with good selection good bar where you can relax after sightseeing Everything is good

356210,The Toren,No Negative, Beautiful small charming hotel with wonderful staff from the moment we arrived to the moment we left from the housekeeping staff to the reception staff and the barmen Nothing was too much trouble we were made to feel at home only better The location couldn t have been more perfect either Travelled with friends and five children 8 to 16 years Thank you for a great start to 2016 We ll be back 
356211,The Toren, If there is anything thing I could be fussy about the Toren I wish the makeup mirror with lights could also be adjusted up and down as it is too low for me think I have a pretty average height of 5 4 , The Toren is an excellent hotel and exceeds our expectation The charm of its facilities with lots of history behind its buildings plus its friendly and professional staff really made our stay memorable 
356212,The Toren, Not cheap but hey you get what you pay for , Such lovely place set in the most fantastic of locations The staff are so sincere and genuinely want to make your stay at the hotel Amsterdam better if they can A wonderful experience 
356213,The Toren,No Negative, I cannot speak highly enough of the Toren the location the cleanliness of both the communal and private facilities the bar and bar food the quality of food for breakfast and most of all the fantastic team of people that were the most pleasent attentive helpful and competent that we have had the pleasure to stay with in Europe 
356214,The Toren,No Negative, Had such an amazing time from the minute we arrived the staff were helpful kind gave us suggestions The room was perfect cosy clean the bath was the best asked for a pizza at midnight after the kitchen was closed and twenty minutes later a knock at the door Had beautiful and generous sized gin and tonics at the bar by the fireplace I requested a treat for my girlfriend as it was her birthday and we were welcomed with a happy birthday letter moet and strawberries Honestly the best hotel I ve stayed at and I ve travelled too many destinations all over the world We are so grateful and thank the toren immensely for our stay 
356215,The Toren, Nothing , Your hotel was recommended by a friend and I will do the same and hope to be back some day Friendly helpful staff great bar wonderful breakfast and very comfortable room 
356216,The Toren, There was very little not to like about this place Our fabulous room was in their annex building which is a few canal houses along from the main hotel This gave the feeling of returning to an exclusive apartment at the end of the day rather than to a fully tendered hotel Some may feel a bit disappointed by this but to be fair this fact was very clearly and repeatedly pointed out and every stage in the booking process so we had no false expectations , The room we stayed in was absolutely exquisite and despite being so wonderfully spacious it was also extremely cosy and intimate a difficult combination to get just right Each individual member of staff at The Toren from reception and bar staff to housekeeping seemed to take personal pride and responsibility for ensuring our stay was absolutely perfect in every way The team spirit and quality of staff training was clearly visible The specialty gin cocktails in the opulent bar were quite simply to die for and the breakfast was outstanding The fabulous decor and attention to detail in this hotel is totally sumptuous Overall we left feeling we had been truly and utterly spoilt We will certainly be returning 
356217,The Toren, Really nothing, The location is really great walk to pretty much anything The quaint bar is nice to have late night cocktails Bartenders are awesome Rooms are on the small side but everything you need is right there Toiletries are great Be careful walking up and down the stairs as they are narrow and wind around so if you are not paying attention or had too many cocktails cannot say anything about the breakfast as we would head out and grab something on the go but it looked good Also we had 2 rooms one with a canal view and one without we slept with the windows open curtains drawn but you can hear the street noise below just a factor of being in a good location The other room without the view was very quiet beds were very comfortable 
356218,The Toren,No Negative, Loved the look of the room Quiet and comfortable The jacuzzi bath with colour changing lights was fab Staff very friendly and knowledgable giving advice on eating out and places to visit

356225,The Toren, They ask for feedback but didn t write anything down when we gave it We felt they were a bit smug and that the hotel had a higher opinion of themselves than the guests had , Centrally located and quite a nice breakfast

356230,The Toren, The beds are really soft so it s not very healthy for your back and I wish the duvets and pillows were filled with natural feathers Elevators do not exist Burgers are defrosted and can only be ordered medium well with buns so hard one might be killed by it if thrown at him from a distance Loud air con in the rooms , Very friendly staff at the bar walked the extra mile to help also everyone at the reception seemed positive Beautiful interior in the hotel Helpful staff in general
