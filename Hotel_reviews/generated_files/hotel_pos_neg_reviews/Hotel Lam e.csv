435824,Hotel Lam e, Some of the staff could have been a little more helpful although the girl who checked us in was very good , We loved the decor the position and the rooftop bar The views from the roof were amazing and it also had a small but enjoyable breakfast menu The bed and pillows were also very comfy We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends 
435825,Hotel Lam e, Very expensive parking, Excellent location in the heart of Vienna Friendly staff tasty breakfast Very nice rooftop bar with a stunning view of the city center 
435826,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, Beautiful boutique hotel located in the heart of Vienna near St Stephen s We could walk almost everywhere in 10 minutes Our room was very well appointed and spacious The bathroom was huge The staff was great and helped us booking concert tickets We enjoyed relaxing in the street level bar cafe after a day of site seeing 
435827,Hotel Lam e, TRANSPORTATION NOT AVAILABLE YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BUS EVERY 30 MUNITES BETTER TO TAKE RENT CAR, VIEW OF THE HOTEL WAS AMAZING AND THE PLACE WAS SO QUITE AND ROMANTIC
435828,Hotel Lam e, The smell of horse pee in the nearby streets from all the horse and buggy carts , Extraordinarily elegant and comfortable room Fabulous views of the city from the chic rooftop bar Best location in the heart of the city with lots of restaurants cafes and shops in the vicinity One block from St Stephen s Cathedral and the grand shopping promenade leading to the Opera House 
435829,Hotel Lam e, The room was very small I had a superior double room booked but it seemed a standard room , The location was great I have a small baby and having the supermarket close was helpful I could find the food pampers etc for the baby at Bipa market only 2 min walking I didn t pay for the breakfast Only 1 min walking there is a shop of croissant where 1 costed 1 50 euro and you could eat it in front of the cathedral which is very close The staff was very nice and helpful I asked for a boiler so I could warm the milk for the baby and they brought it in the room in 5 minutes 
435830,Hotel Lam e, The only thing i did not find convinient was the location of the mirrors in the room and the A C was not cold enough, Everything i needed was arms length and hotel staff were very helpfull
435831,Hotel Lam e, everything was excellent but quite expensive especially the room upgrade , The bed was very comfortable and the shower excellent Best of all is the central location 
435832,Hotel Lam e, Curtains trim paintwork etc showing signs of wear and need repair but still ok if you squint Normally I don t care so much but this is a design oriented hotel Wifi VERY erratic it went off all weekend with no repair , Excellent location can see roof of st stephen s cathedral from happening rooftop bar and walk everywhere Staff gave helpful suggestions on what to do on Monday when many museums palaces are shut Bedding towels clean 
435833,Hotel Lam e, The decor is a bit stuffy I m not a fan of having a big window but little day light in the room doesn t make for a very attractive environment for working There is also no wash basin in the toilet one has to walk across the room to wash one s hands The breakfast was quite pricey for its content , The hotel is centrally located and if one is into dim decor the room is nice 
435834,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, Raining is 8 3 as I had to rate the facilities low as there is only a bar your rooms and a tea and coffee area There are no other facilities gym spa etc The plus Beds are so comfortable Location is perfect A few negative things happened but the front of house manager more than made up for it with her polite manner and solution 
435835,Hotel Lam e, Nothing , Beautiful decor the best staff service I ve ever experienced at a hotel superb location in central Vienna Nice little touches like macaroons upon arrival and departure fruit bowl I didn t get a chance to check out the roof top at but it seemed great 
435836,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, When arrived hotel to check in tell us to be upgraded to a small suite very happy with friends do enter the room after the more happy there are independent small balcony you can see the streets and the opposite of the cathedral The staff is very friendly help me draw the various places of the attractions Next time will choose the hotel 
435837,Hotel Lam e, Bathroom lightning was quite dark i e bathroom needs more lamps Pillow was extra soft you basically sleep on a mattress Five star hotel should be able to offer guests two different pillows soft and firm so that they could choose which one they like more Minibar should be equipped better more still water more drinks to choose , Location is amazing Room was quite spacious and comfortable 
435838,Hotel Lam e, The A C was off since they consider the season as winter one , The staff were nice and friendly The best thing about this hotel is the location It is near by most of the famous places in Vienna for tourisim The wifi is free 
435839,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, The junior suit was beautiful friendly staff nice breakfast good location in center and walking distance to train station and tram stop Everything worked well 
435840,Hotel Lam e, A reasonable room rate that included breakfast would be good We did not eat in the restaurant it look great as it was over priced and there are tons of cafes and alternatives around , The location just near the cathedral and metro was excellent A good base in central Vienna to do anything from We had a top floor room that had a good view of the cathedral so it was quite magical The bed was extra comfy too When we arrived the staff member that checked us in was efficient offering us a drink and was interested in what our plans were so as to offer help in organising our Vienna visit We didn t need any but it was good that he asked 
435841,Hotel Lam e, Our lights kept going out room smelt musty no facililities apart from a small reception area and apart from one lovely lady the staff were brusk and unreliable , Great location with just a short walk to most things in central Vienna 
435842,Hotel Lam e, The staff were awful Especially the cleaning team Just walk into your room at 8am without knocking very unimpressed This happened two of the four days we were there No compensation or apology offered I won t stay here again , Location
435843,Hotel Lam e, There were a number of mechanical problems in the room The good news is that each was fixed as soon as reported The manager was interested to hear details and had the attitude that she would act to improve inspections , The attentiveness and service from the staff was impeccable New Year s celebration on the roof top bar was excellent vantage point to watch fireworks 
435844,Hotel Lam e, Parking fee was extremely high room service wasn t that good the carpet wasn t clean and they didn t put toiletries everyday bathroom design was a bit annoying as there wasn t bath tub or bath tray it was plane or flat ground which kept the bathroom totally bathed with water after taking shower, Location staff were helpful
435845,Hotel Lam e, Our key cards were not working for 4 times and we had to get down to the reception 4 times to get new ones plus they made it seem like we didn t do something right Not such a big room for such a price and quiet a cold room after 3 complains we got a heater , Great location 
435846,Hotel Lam e, 1 The restaurant could have better breakfast options 2 DONT FORGET TO MENTION THE EARLY LATE CHECK IN CHECK OUT WHEN YOU ARE BOOKING which happens at some nominal charges OR ELSE YOU HAPPEN TO LEAVE THE HOTEL AT A TENSED STATE It happened to me and it was really a bad feeling as the hotels in Europe has a check out time at 3 pm and if you have a flight at 9 or 10 pm then its kinda discomfort But again you can spend those hours exploring the place and that will compensate for the stress 3 The rooms does not have a lock system per se so that you are not disturbed inspite of the warning signs left at the door handle The cleaners have access and they tend to enter the room and that might be discomforting at times However they are doing their job of keeping our rooms clean and they are really nice to the guests always acknowledging and conversing with a friendly smile , The location of the hotel is in an awesome place Excellent ever smiling staff who is ready to help you out at any time of the day A classic boutique hotel with awesome interior designs Hotel is in the city centre amidst good restaurants and shops Has a grocery store nearby so dont worry about the personal things that you need and can buy at any time Located near the famous cathedral and opposite to the well known ZANONI CAFE closed during winter where u get mouth watering ice creams pastries and coffees A walk in the alley in front of the hotel just makes your day and night go bright by seeing the beautiful and friendly people restaurants shopping centers etc Will get a taxi right in front of the hotel and have a metro station at a walking distance from the hotel The tour buses start from the Opera House that s nearby You need to be there to enjoy all these that I have just mentioned Will surely return to Vienna again and will stay in the same hotel too 
435847,Hotel Lam e, Airco a bit cold during he night Noises in the street during the night but this is of course the price to pay to be in the very center of the city , Very stylish hotel nevertheless a cosy atmosphere 
435848,Hotel Lam e, The hotel deceived me by crediting my account with the bill i payed months in advance then recharging me on my arrival thereby increasing the sterling cost of my stay considerably I will not be using booking com again if they do not resolve the issue ,No Positive
435849,Hotel Lam e, The room was a bit small the air condition unit located in the room hide but made slight noises the price was too high to my point of view as I couldn t effort to include the breakfast , Outstanding location wonderful staff kindly and friendly Clean rooms and quite rooms 
435850,Hotel Lam e, Tatty and tired not sufficient wardrobe space woken up at 8am by housekeeping room cards didn t work locked out of hotel no night concierge roof terrace closed aircon froze us and wouldn t switch off HEll , Bedding was good 
435851,Hotel Lam e, Nothing They have pretty much nailed it , Everything though I can t comment on the food as I didn t try it The staff should get a particular mention Nothing was to much trouble and indeed they went above and beyond the call of duty 
435852,Hotel Lam e, room furniture is unpleasent pretenious but not luxurious Too dark and soon outdated Marble bath tub in the room I could have done without this Incoherent furniture organsization Veneer partly dammaged Difficult to maintain Just bad design Faux leather night tabels breakfast room is totatlly unorganized and unpractical , central location quiet
435853,Hotel Lam e, Nothing , Everything was fantastic with the room staff and location all being perfect for a city break The check in process was very easy with the staff offering great advice in what to see in Vienna When we arrived in the room after being out for a couple of hours there was even a personalised note welcoming ourselves and a pair of complimentary macaroons to enjoy a lovely touch The room was a high specification and the shower alone deserves a 10 10 rating All in all perfect 
435854,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, The room was wonderful much bigger than other places we stayed in the area Breakfast was incredible try the goat cheese scambled eggs Staff was pleasant and very helpful recommended a great restaurant for us to try during our stay Absolutely wonderful 
435855,Hotel Lam e, There was no television set in my room and I was a bit taken aback by that However there are so many sights in the city I realised that you really do not need a tv An iron and ironing board would have been great , Great location It s in the midst of all the historical buildings Stephenplatz and the cathedral is a stone s throw away The Vienna opera house is few minutes walk away There are lots of amazing eateries nearby catering to all palates The staff are very friendly helpful and informative The wifi is very good 
435856,Hotel Lam e, the bed was too soft for my liking, the breakfast option was very good the roof top bar was excellent offering fantastic views of Vienna great location for exploring the town
435857,Hotel Lam e, The room is not as big as we thought but overall we had a great experience, We love the location it is very strategic we could basically walk to most of the places we want to visit and the staff were also very helpful 
435858,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, What a surprise This is a fantastic hotel with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on for eons Our room had a bath in the room and the shower was over in the wall with the loo tucked nicely in a little hide hole It was compact but it was funky and fun with lovely chocolates to taste Rooftop bar is a must to have a drink and see the views Cafe downstairs and great coffee Will stay again for sure 
435859,Hotel Lam e, Nothing of any great significance The only minor note is that the shower bath wash basin and bed were all open plan although the toilet is separate There was only one lift and as the rooftop bar was very popular at times the lift took a moment or two to arrive Mostly we used the lift at off peak times so was not a big issue for us even though we were on the 6th floor , The hotel is in a great location ideally situated in to heart of the inner city The room was very comfortable and quiet The staff were friendly and helpful 
435860,Hotel Lam e, Breakfast was expensive for very little to eat Toaster was apparently kaput and everyone seemed to crash and scrape every available chair and plate Plenty of breakfast options within 20 paces of hotel , Location Location Location View from upper corner room to die for Room was a bit Retro but good anyway Literally right next door to the most amazing 3 storey deli supermarket with EVERYTHING you could ever want Try nearby Aida ice cream restaurant for decadent deserts 
435861,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, The rooms are beautiful big the bathroom is a good size too love the Molten Brown amenities The staff is very helpful prompt they were very accommodating too The hotel is located right next to St Stephens cathedral many sites restaurants are close by It has a roof top bar which is quite nice 
435862,Hotel Lam e, Modern TV but in an old piece of furniture with a complex system, Excellent location beautiful terrace with view on Stephen church and confortable bed The staff was very kind
435863,Hotel Lam e, Nothing, The staff were great the porter Joseph was great and very helpful at all times the front office staff were also helpful in helping with transport Location was great right in the business district
435864,Hotel Lam e, The staff didn t confirm the price with us before temporarily taking money from my card Ended up taking to much Once we realised it was resolved quickly , Perfect location you could see the cathedral from our room on the 5th floor We were also upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice surprise Excellent rooftop bar
435865,Hotel Lam e, The building needs at least an extra elevator since the hotel has quite a popular rooftop terrace and therefore there is a lot of traffic besides the hotel guests As a consequence the staff is wasting a lot of time waiting for the elevator but I guess nothing can be done now in this matter , The location is perfect Very nice room we booked a suite with a generous terrace the perfect spot to have a glass of wine after a long day super comfortable bed large shower and bathtub The staff was friendly and prompt 
435866,Hotel Lam e, You don t expect to see wall to wall carpet in such a cool hotel Rooms were new and looked fresh in general except the flooring Also I could not a find the TV in the bedroom I guess it was somewhere because there was a remote but no idea where it was , Staff was very polite and helpful The rooftop bar was an excellent venue for an after work drink 
435867,Hotel Lam e, Erratic servicing of room different days different towels toiletries coffee teas Not important but odd , Excellent room with balcony terrace Very central yet very quiet Great roof terrace for breakfast 
435868,Hotel Lam e, Air condition was not working Most likely such a beautiful and warm weather wasn t expected during the first weekend of May , 5 min by feet from the Dom Very close to the city Super location 
435869,Hotel Lam e, The bed was a bit too soft but it s a matter of personal taste I believe Once a room service decided to walk in despite the DND sign The room has a Nespresso machine but the capsules are only refilled once in two days , The location is amazing in the hart of the city yet is 15 minutes walk or 5 minutes drive from the city airport train station Well designed and cozy room Not as big as one expect it to be in a five stars but still decent size Breakfast is 7 11 so it s convenient It s pretty good as well 
435870,Hotel Lam e, Floor cleanliness needs improvement Breakfast is overpriced , Front desk staff is outstanding Suite with view was great Location Location Location Can t wait to return 
435871,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, Excellent few days at hotel We got there at 11am they upgraded us to a better room free of charge the room was ready for check in from the moment we arrived the staff was very friendly and professional Excellent location right in the heart of Vienna and the bed was absolutely heavently soft very comfortable 
435872,Hotel Lam e, Roof terrace was closed An additional chair would be very welcome and could be accommodated if TV on the wall , The location was excellent for sightseeing and proximity to restaurants All of the staff were very friendly Loved the big bathroom too 
435873,Hotel Lam e, Walls in the room need fresh paint Also the water in the shower pouring out under the glass and flooding all over the bathroom floor , Very comfortable bed also we enjoyed breakfast very much Hotel staff was friendly and helpful Perfect location easy to catch a taxi if necessary everything is in walking distance 
435874,Hotel Lam e, The smell of cigarettes late at night in the room Presumably from the roof terrace bar , Great staff really helpful and friendly We got a room upgrade 
435875,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, The room is beautifully decorated the view over Stephansdom is sensational The shower and Molton Brown toiletries are top quality We ordered ahead a Sachertorte chocolate cake and wine to our room and it was very tasty The staff is also very nice and helpful 
435876,Hotel Lam e, Now the bad bits we upgraded to master suite on top floor with clear view of the city however we had two flat screen smart TVs that were not usable due to fact there are no English channels and no English translation option and smart tv function was disabled the only channels available were 6 news channels The hotel interior is starting to show wear tear in the room and else wear the Windows in bloom were poorly cleaned and there were smears and most surfaces including Windows there were several details that need attention to bring it up to standard things like old stickers there have been removed and glue still remain cracked tiles in lift And no information in room on how to call down to reception Shower door needs attention I must say overall we were 90 happy with every , Location was amazing The room that was offered was ok but view was not as described on website so we upgrade at a extra cost staff were very good throught 
435877,Hotel Lam e, Tiny thing pillows too soft but that s just personal taste And stairways very warm , Room fabulous Very stylish and modern Shower AMAZING Molton Brown toiletries were lush Staff all lovely 
435878,Hotel Lam e, There wasn t a breakfast menu and so we made choices in the limited information the staff gave us We discovered by watching other guests that there was a lot more on offer , The location was very good for us to get around The rooms where clean and of a good size 
435879,Hotel Lam e, The room was very warm and the thermostat could not be reduced below 19 degrees , Location could not have been better and staff were very friendly and accommodating 
435880,Hotel Lam e, The hotel did not have any facial tissues in the room when Hollywood stars need to wipe off their mascara The breakfast was really nice and the selection was acceptable however more fruits and vegetables and cheeses should be added to the tray, The hotel has an amazing eclectic design inspired by 50 s Hollywood that reflected in every detail of the design The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
435881,Hotel Lam e, failure to comply with of orders room ready until 16 00 missing cot attempted fraud be billed included breakfast breakfast will be billed a child one year old wrong information receptionist , location near the square
435882,Hotel Lam e, Almost all Price is enormous for that room the parking was not for free and not told us before using the parking They claim also 40 euro for parking The rooms looks as peep show rooms , The location
435883,Hotel Lam e, My only complaint is that the room had a few features that were tricky to figure out the light switches could be finicky and we had to have the staff fix the switch that controlled the lights in the bedroom There are electric blinds that took some practice to figure out how to use and I never figured out how to turn on the AC It was actually a little warm at night in the room even in October Overall great experience however , Location We stayed in a suite and had an amazing view of St Stephen s cathedral The staff were incredibly helpful they had excellent recommendations and never hesitated to accommodate any request that we had The bed was very comfortable 
435884,Hotel Lam e, Single elevator for the entire hotel including the terrace bar which got VERY busy at times Some staff were a bit stand offish Bath arrangement is odd commode and lavatory are on opposite sides of shower , Hotel is well located very clean 
435885,Hotel Lam e, A little disappointed that rooftop bar was not really open weather was colder than usual but could have more heaters, Tremendous bed great shower good location
435886,Hotel Lam e,No Negative, We loved our stay at the Hotel Lame Located in the city center of Vienna just down the block from St Stephan s made walking to the opera historic sites and restaurants incredibly convenient Close to the underground so ventures further afield were also convenient For the quality of the hotel the comfort of the room and the location it was a great stay 
435887,Hotel Lam e, walls were dirty glossy curtains look cheap noise from the street rather 4 stars ugly bold corridors no decoration at all , very good location close to everything nice rooms good taste comfy beds nice furniture nice bathroom
435888,Hotel Lam e, Water pressure in the bath was very poor it took 45mins to fill up , Bed was amazing very quiet room no street noise shower was fantastic Staff very polite and helpful TV Wifi were excellent Great location 
435889,Hotel Lam e, If we have to say something then it is for pillows Too soft for us , Very central The stuff kind and helpful The room comfortable and clean We were upgraded and we enjoy that We will return for sure 
435890,Hotel Lam e, The front desk kept our luggage but gave us someone else s when we returned which was concerning Room they gave us the key to had the bed turned upright and the pillows and doona were thrown on the lounge Clearly a misunderstanding as the room was upside down and not ready but it was late and when we came back down with photos the front desk quickly upgraded us and sent us back upstairs to a new room , Fantastic location nice bathroom terrace comfortable room
435891,Hotel Lam e, Very poor breakfast If you book through booking with cancel policy when paying at the desk they take money twice first pre autorisation than final payment Be careful , Location location location
435892,Hotel Lam e, There is no free parking and they cost you 40 per 24 Hours for the parking No one helps you for your bags and stuff Also there are no english TV chanels most of them European chanels , The WiFi is so fast Location is amazing The Bloom Caf is wonderful I liked the hotel and I recommend people to stay on 
435893,Hotel Lam e, Hotel staffs were very weird they don t help at all and when you try to ask them they replay with short answer and making the atmosphere tension I mean they make you feel that you would never ask again in addition they have no parking for the cars you would go around for Long time to get the chance of finding a space whichs other five stars hotel do have as the mentioned hotel calmed they are five stars to sum up I would never go to that hotel again I ve been in Vienna many times the time I really hated it when I had to experienced that type of hotel, Nothing really
435894,Hotel Lam e, Very small rooms I ve booked 3 deluxe rooms which is bigger than the superior rooms and I was shouked by the size which is so small No loopy only small place for the reception Because of the small colidores and the small rooms and the small reception area and no loopy u can t feel or engoy the nice decoration of the hotel, Perfect Location in the city centre
435895,Hotel Lam e, Very bad experience from Bloom bar with breakfast We have been there maybe four times but actually there is new staff without any training or experiences Everything was really bad everybody was upset by waitings cold eggs without bread and salt no list in english and staff also didn t speak english very unprofessional , Location comfortable bed walking distance from many famous places
