192591,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, Amazing staff
192592,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing , Staff cleaned and location The library room 
192593,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The lounge very dark No tea making facilities in the room basin did not seal wasting water bad design with no overlow A stupid design , The staff very helpful and friendly

192595,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The Hotel was perfectly located for our needs while in London The staff was always gracious and helpful The rooms were very clean and totally functional Overall it was a fantastic stay 
192596,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Booked booking through agent booking com Unfortunately this meant breakfast wasn t included but wasn t made clear upon booking or arrival It is just expected that where ever you stay it is followed by a breakfast to complete the experience , The blind spot bar A great night whilst in the hotel
192597,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, 1 Bar has no energy My local friends don t like going there 2 Cleaning staff left their cleaning cloth in the room twice by mistake may be, The energy
192598,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The curtain in front of the safe box should run in the other way since you will normally approach it from the bedroom plus the safe box was placed on or near the floor which forced me to get on my knees to open it , The bed and sheets were very comfortable The shower was pleasant 
192599,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing this hotel checked all the boxes , The location couldn t have been better the gym next door was amazing the blind spot bar was a hidden gem Loved the turn down of the beds every evening and seeing what color lighting they chose 
192600,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We liked everything , The service was excellent staff are very attentive Room was clean smart and comfortable A la carte breakfast was very good we really enjoyed our stay We are going again in August 
192601,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing would have been nice to have had breakfast included perhaps next time, The beautiful well equipped room funky hotel with gorgeous smell in reception we had a great time on the Saturday evening drinking cocktails and dancing in your hidden bar
192602,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Bed wasn t particularly comfy bit firm but slept fine No real view from our low level room and a long walk from the elevator Lock to our door failed and we had to wait for security to replace the lock battery but it was all done speedily and apologetically , Great location modern funky hotel relatively spacious room for a hotel in London Friendly staff and easy check in and out Nice bathroom with great water pressure in the shower 
192603,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, NOT A THING, As in the past I like everything about St Martin and cannot think of any thing that I don t like The staff is incredible and all should be commended for their GREAT attitude and always making you feel very special
192604,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Lovely hotel great location staff great I fount the perfume in the foyer way too strong I asked for a quiet room and moved because of the noise for the 2nd night and this room was much quieter Had to pay for a tea in the morn
192605,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Staff are average at best and the breakfast has declined in quality again The hotel experience is generally inconsistent , Spotlessly clean as always Love the blind spot bar and the location of the hotel Recognised as repeat guest 
192606,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Hotel restaurant a bit pricey , Location is fantastic Right in the heart of the theater district Lots of interesting restaurants and bars within short walking distance Near R Opera House and museums Staff very friendly and helpful 
192607,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Would have liked a bath and not just a shower , My husband and i stayed here for my 50th Birthday Staff were very helpful and always cheerful Bed was really comfy Location was so handy for the Theatre and resturants we could walk and no need for a cab We will return 
192608,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, There was nothing to NOT like , Quirky comfortable rooms with all the extras we needed The staff went all out to be helpful good service everywhere good breakfast with excellent la carte Close to public transport The Royal Opera the NG major theaters good restaurants and shopping GREAT 
192609,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, good things dont come cheap in london, lovely boutique hotel with excellent location in Covent garden and 5 minute walk to china town complimentary use of gym next door 
192610,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Would have liked coffee and tea facilities readily available in the room I had ring for them to be delivered Service was extremely slow during dinner at the restaurant noticeable to a solo diner wanting to finish in time to get to the theatre However when this information was shared with reception on check out the cost of my room service breakfast was made complimentary , Comfortable room nice toiletries very friendly staff at reception 
192611,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Just a perfect hotel in a great location with friendly staff The room we stayed in was spotless we will most definitely stay there again when we next go to London
192612,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Literally nothing could be better, Staff are incredible place is incredible room is incredible everything was perfect Super fast room service and even included a romantic decoration touch for our anniversary LOVED this hotel 
192613,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Couldn t find a hairdryer in the room which would have been helpful Our room wasn t ready by 3pm check in but staff were very apologetic and recovered the situation very well thank you , Beautiful light comfortable room amazing bathroom friendly and very helpful staff 
192614,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We were charged 7 for a snickers and a Twix even at London mini bar prices we thought was a bit over the top Also we paid for a deluxe room and thought that breakfast was included but turns out it wasn t We were happy to pay the room price but may not stay here again because if breakfast not being included , Location is perfect for Theatre Land and other iconic London places easy walking distance of the popular locations 
192615,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Breakfast not included in price No facilities to make your own drinks Not including the foyer we found the other public areas very dark and depressing especially the Blind Spot which looked seedy and not the type of place for women The cost of ad hoc items very expensive e g a small glass of wine was 12 , Bed and pillows very comfy Room was very light and airy with great views over the city Great hospitality for my husband s birthday Extensive mini bar Fantastic location to sight see 
192616,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I had room 137 left side of the hotel on a Monday next to an alley where probably was a club so the isolation of the window was so bad that I was waked up two times at 01 30 and at 2 30 am by a conversation of people witch I worldly could follow I slept like a rose in hotels next to an airport and had no problem with noise or sounds At hat price range I was very disappointed cause all the rest was ok ,No Positive
192617,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, As neither my boyfriend or I are fans of lifts the lack of accessible stairs the staff were excellent however and escorted us to and from the room using the emergency stairwell A slight disturbance at 1 am with an unexpected visitor trying to gain entry to the room a mistake I m sure , Great room gorgeous bathroom with an abundance of complimentary toiletries contemporary decor and very friendly and helpful staff Bags were stored for us on both day of arrival and day of check out meaning we could continue our trip without hindrance of luggage Great location 
192618,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The bar made me 2 drinks with far too much lime sent these back and got given same But on check out everything was knocked off I didn t complain just notified staff , Fruit platter with happy birthday in room on arrival staff wished my gf happy birthday very smiley and remembered our faces
192619,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The water tank a bit noisy at times but not a major issue as only in certain rooms We stayed several times and only once occured , Loved everything from the luxurious scent in the lobby to the freshly baked bread at breakfast 
192620,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room smallish , Well lit rooms Big mirror And lots of charging points Coffee facilities on demand Cool bar if a little e X pensive Excellent restaurant with great vibe 
192621,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Even for the really fantastic location the price was quite high, Lovely bath room with proper storage space and well planned details e g not only nice soap but also a soap dish I never understand why most hotels force you to need up the sink instead of providing a dish Very well maintained room and friendly staff Despite the location it s very quiet during they night 
192622,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We struggled with the lack of internal stairs as one of our party is unable to use a lift and had to be escorted through the trades areas to service stairs and we were left waiting several minutes outside in the cold as security staff never had a key on them to let us in via the fire escape stairs But if you are fine with lifts it is a great hotel , The Location Staff Restaurant and Cocktail Bar were excellent Car park below the hotel was an added bonus 
192623,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, only two things really 1 the room had lots of nice facilities but no tea coffee we would have foregone the robes slippers ironing board mini bar etc just to be able to make a cup of tea 2 maybe we just didn t find it but there didn t seem to be a direct link from the car park to the hotel which would have saved some leg work with heavy bags, great location beautiful room friendly staff wish we were staying longer 
192624,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The best location In the middle of everything Got a room with a bath Room over the entrance Some sounds from outside especially if a van was parked for some time with the engine running But I had asked for a room this side so expected some noise Did not hear anything during the night because I slept well I prefer the mattress a little softer but that s me Breakfast very good Their granola the best Perhaps the main reason I had breakfast there more than one morning Staff very kind and helpful Had a little problem with the regulation of the temperature Solved instantly when mentioned They cared about their guests 
192625,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Being from the North Newcastle we find the price of the cocktails mind boggling The room we had this time had a view of a brick wall through the window See attached photo, The rooms are very comfortable and user friendly the staff are efficient helpful and very friendly All round service is exceptional Just love the Secret Bar 
192626,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, It was a beautiful hotel with lovely helpful staff the only thing I disliked was the room service some of the food was cold and some was just not nice at all
192627,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The staff are by far the reason I stay there they have become family away from home The rooms are a small even for london standards Perfect hotel for a business trip that you re spending your time out most of the time and the hotel is EXTREMELY central 
192628,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, I messaged ahead to say we were staying for a special birthday for my husband and the staff arranged for a messaged birthday cake to be made and left in our room
192629,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Bed too hard no tea or coffee facilities in room I know you could ask housekeeping but when we booked it said we already had these facilities in place I couldn t be bothered to ask so was disappointed as im a coffee addict , Decor shower the gorgeous smell as you walked through the revolving doors the quirky ness 
192630,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Didn t see the note about about getting tea coffee from housekeeping until we had got up and were leaving to go out and get a coffee Was given a crap table in the restaurant for dinner , Nice modern rooms Low lighting in bathroom no need to light up 1000 watts to go for a pee 
192631,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The heating I didn t find a control and didn t bother to ask , Nice comfortable hotel excellent location spacious room with a little private garden Food in Asia de Cuba is unparalleled Very nice staff Be ready if you ask for any service response is usually instantaneous 
192632,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The room looked clean at first but on a closer notice there were glass marks on the table and spots around the toilet The room service didn t really cleaned but only rearranged the sheets and got new towels The room design looked cool and flashy on first sight but the bath and toilet were in one space with no tight door towards the bedroom just a bulky wall piece to close with a magnet lock For a 2 person room it was very inconvenient to hear and smell what happened in the toilet The shower was large but without proper tilt to the drain the water flooded the whole bathroom each time someone took a shower The sink was placed in the middle of a wooden table nice optics but you could see the recurring contact with the water from the shower damaged the legs which wasn t very pleasing to look at The rooms were very poor isolated from each other you could hear everything your neighbor did particularly the slamming of the magnet lock of the bedroom door The windows were only very narrow to open natural light or air was scarce Air conditioning was very loud but otherwise functional The hotel floor was sometimes dirty especially around the elevators and smelled occasionally , Location was top Staff seemed nice had very little contact to them can t say more TV and Wifi worked properly as they should nowadays so I don t know if it could count as a pro 
192633,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room service was severely disappointing The much touted food from Asia de Cuba arrived cold One fish dish was badly undercooked and made us feel ill but we didn t fancy the long wait if we sent the food back One of the forks on the tray arrived dirty Frankly the room service not what you d expect from a 5 hotel especially for food at this price , Apart from that the room was great for a short stay small but perfectly formed One of the best bathrooms of any London hotel lovely bath products 
192634,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Slightly strange lighting choices in the rooms and corridors not ideal for older guests Also it would be useful if the rooms had an extra chair and included tea and coffee facilities by default these were available but you had to ask ,No Positive
192635,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Bit confused about car parking but the concierge guys were very good and parked the car , Staff very efficient and friendly decor The Den and location Offered us late check out with no extra costs which was great and very useful 
192636,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Cost was very expensive But the biggest thing that annoyed me was the fact that the hotel did nothing special for my good lady on her birthday no free upgrade or even a bottle of champagne even thou I told them it s her birthday and she even wore a happy birthday badge , The staff are very friendly The location is great And the food was amazing 
192637,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Breakfast a bit too pricy Nespresso machine in the room would have been even more comfortable , Location is just so perfect we couldn t get used to it Bikes included Design Beds very comfortable Quite room Gym if you have the discipline Lovely staff
192638,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Great location we were attending theatre and it was very convenient Wonderfully attentive staff answered any and all questions and requests promptly and cheerfully Great concierges they went above and beyond 
192639,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Staff were always ready to help Hotel was great in terms of atmosphere and comfort especially with two teenagers Rooms are bright and well equipped and our rooms had a great view down the Lane it is a fantastic location for shopping sightseeing and theatre but at heart of the business centre so we were all catered for Customer service by managers was superior to most of the other hotels we have stayed in in London
192640,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, London prices 8 for a pot of peppermint tea from room service , Excellent location stylish design spacious rooms comfy beds brilliant and discreet customer service delicious food and great views from the bedroom 
192641,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Windows not very well isolated street noise very loud during night hours Annoyingly long check in time , Perfect Location 2 minutes to Leicester Sq From our room we had direct view to London Eye and Victoria Tower Staff extremely friendly 
192642,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, Everything about it The warmth and kindliness of the staff the style and design of the hotel and the bar the light themed rooms the location 
192643,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I wanted to stay an extra few days but couldn t get rates as competitive as when I booked they had sky rocketed so I checked out earlier than I would have , The location is superb right in the centre of London and close to many transport links tube as well as overground stations Waterloo St Pancras Euston The hotel is modern and stylish My room was well laid out and quiet which I appreciated Staff was friendly and helpful especially the doormen And I loved having access to Gymbox which is quite an experience in itself 
192644,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, A chair to relax in in the room would have been better As an old man I found the light switches irritatingly complicated , Style location and staff were excellent Everything worked well 
192645,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Very disappointed with the breakfast that was delivered to our room The first bacon roll that arrived was charred and inedible when we reordered the next one was not cooked and also inedible A shame for a 5 star hotel ,No Positive
192646,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Group booking system is always a pain in the arse The check in for more than one room is always slow and cumbersome this applies to all Morgan hotels in London , the team are brilliant the care they take is exemplary however they are let down by the company systems and lack of flexibility

192704,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Great location for us we booked here as it was close to the London coliseum literally 2 min walk 
192705,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Minimalist decoration excellent cuba asia restaurant very close to all cultural locations
192706,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing not to like , Fantastic location and modern trendy room 
192707,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, It was fantastic location and staff were outstanding 
192708,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The staff were amazing and were very attentive to my requests It s my home in London and it s perfect 
192709,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Wasn t informed that I needed to pay 100 holding fee for mini bar meals etc, Lovely rooms super comfy beds and pillows Great lighting in the rooms Fantastic location 
192710,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The corridor to the hotel room smelt of cat wee which was quite unpleasant and you couldn t turn the window blinds so there was no privacy unless you closed the curtains which on a lovely sunny day evening was disappointing , Loved the decor staff were great location is perfect and bar was good 
192711,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We had a garden room but was a little noisy from club music downstairs till late But going into the club was a good solution and all the other was excellent, Super nice room and service
192712,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Comfier seating in reception The hotel is lovely and modern but seems a little bare , The location was excellent and staff super friendly My husband is on crutches and struggles to walk far but everything you need is right there on the door step A nice touch was prosecco and cake for my husbands birthday brought to our room as a surprise
192713,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Cost The room was by the lifts which was quite noisy during the early hours Although the room had floor to ceiling windows the view was of other roofs and sides of buildings so rather wasted , I was given a spacious room although I had only booked a standard room I was in an attic I think they called it on the fourth floor Very well equipped 
192714,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Parking was expensive but it is central London and we did opt for valet parking, Stylish Rooms Great Food great guest services valet parking great shower Pre theatre menu was good value 
192715,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, TV at an awkward angle Breakfast room service was unimpressive , Amazing location Great restaurant Big bathrooms Super cute balcony in garden room Convenient USB plugs for iPhone charging Prompt service Helpful accessories everywhere in the room umbrella soft slippers etc 
192716,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, actually i cant think of what i didnt like, yes the property is near to everything restaurant theater walking distant to most of tourist attraction the staff are all friendly lovely like Tunde the spanish waiter i just dont get the name they are like family away from home the room is always cleaned very nicely 
192717,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I highly recommend the larger rooms We were offered an upgrade when we arrived a larger room that was ready at 10 am and we jumped at the chance Their large rooms are positively luxurious Our room was on a high floor away from the elevator on the back of the hotel and it was quiet but the location is as buzzy as it gets for London , Staying in Convent Garden is the best Loads of restaurants theaters shops surround the hotel Easy 3 minute walk to Charing Cross Tube 15 minute walk to Thames riverside 15 minute walk to St James Park Lots of bike stations around 
192718,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The sound proofing in the room is very bad I could hear people next door in the corridor and the floor above me especially when they were walking on the tiled floor at the entrance The water pressure in the shower is so low and I had to stand very close to the shower head but then kept knocking onto the tap lever which was located exceptionally high , Excellent location still feels New after so many years 
192719,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The hotel made my birthday extra special with an unexpected complimentary gift Staff here was very kind helpful and friendly The hotel was beautiful and a great place to take some good pictures due to their chess themed props 
192720,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, rooms are very small probably ideal for a singleton or cosy couple but I guess that s the charm of London I would love to smell a candle that was for sale in the room before buying it Maybe you could offer a mini sample in the room matchbox no mini danish pastries at breakfast buffet only regular size croissants and pain au chocolat available I would love something tiny to bite into with your coffee something small with lovely marmolade in or a fruit conserve etc I received a phone call at 9 30pm from reception concierge asking questions about the room etc I was actually asleep jet lag only arrived from Dubai so I found it disturbing then someone was knocking at the door I don t think that was necessary Receptionist apologized for this misconduct in the morning ITV player catch up TV didn t work and other channels were loading for a long time I am sure its not hotel s fault but worth checking connections etc Minor hiccups didn t spoil our overall experience though We love this hotel and have been returning at least once a year whenever in London , Fancy lights in the bedroom my daughter called them disco lights beautiful set of body care products in the bathroom shower gel soap conditioner wonderful aromas modern design delicious farmhouse bread in breakfast buffet I wasn t charged for my daughter at breakfast which was a nice bonus We didn t go to Asia de Cuba for dinner this time but this is one of my very favourite restaurant in London and where the memories were made when I was dating my future husband 11 years ago 
192721,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, Great room with lots of well thought out features Secondary door to keep out corridor noise Plant in the room for the Feng Shui Unusual additions to the well stocked mini bar Hangover kit and emergency vibrator 
192722,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, No complaints , The staff was great We were in London because my partner was running the London marathon and they brought him a gift bag the night before with snacks and a good luck note We had to change rooms right after check in because a light in our room wasn t working and they gave us drink coupons for the very small inconvenience It is a great hotel 
192723,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, I travelled to London from Somerset to meet a friend We are 2 mothers having a bit of break from our kids The Deluxe room we had was just right for us We were out of the room most of the day The location is fantastic really glad we stayed here The staff were all very helpful and friendly 
192724,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The only thing I missed where heat in the bathroom floor , The bed and the room in general was super comfy We could also regulate the temperature at the room They cleaned the room every day and even foulded the clothing 
192725,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, There wasn t anything not to like , The staff are just wonderful from checking in to check out Had a room on the 6th floor which was wonderfully quiet a haven from the busy roads of London It s a quirky hotel with lots of surprises I won t spoil them for those who are intending to stay We will be back again In fact it is now going to be my go to hotel in London 
192726,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The room was not ready when we arrived and we had to wait until 4pm to get into the room when returning to the room the next day we had to wait for 40mins whilst housekeeping were I the room toilet rolls could have been more luxurious, Excellent facilities bed was extremely comfortable staff very attentive and polite location was superb
192727,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We would have liked at least one comfy chair in the bedroom , The garden suites are to be highly recommended The bathroom facilities are well thought out The breakfast was fabulous The staff are very attentive without being obsequious 
192728,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, thought the rooms could have had some drawers and more hangers in the wardrobe, the staff were fantastic and the bar was great Location in the middle of everything so close to Covent Garden and Leicester Square
192729,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The staff could have been more friendly It s not that they did anything wrong but the first thing I of is not the staff when I think of the hotel , I chose this hotel mainly for the central location and its style It s very modern and comfortable If it was a little cheaper I would stay here more often 
192730,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing at all it was spot on , The location of the hotel is superb with all the main attractions on your doorstep As always the room was immaculate and the beds and pillows exceptionally comfortable We went in to Asia de Cuba for pre dinner drinks and the service was superb and then in to the club after the theatre which was just a great atmosphere 
192731,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Very noisy but was weekend so you ve got to expect that Bathroom was lovely but we had a room for 3 and ran out of loo roll which wasn t replaced , The room was really comfy and had a nice feeling of luxury without being over the top 
192732,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Lack of tea and coffee making facilities in room No spa facilities even though it was booked at reception Had to travel across the city Bar staff very slow , Reception staff lovely decor lovely 
192733,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, When trying to check in at 2pm we were told our room wasn t ready yet because official check in time is 3pm We could however upgrade to a larger available room for and extra 50 night We ended up doing this but felt a little like we were being scammed Also during check in we were specifically asked whether we wanted a newspaper delivered in the morning which we did The newspapers however never showed up , Fantastic location Nice and bright room with a large bathroom The beds were very comfortable and the complimentary bottle of water every day was much appreciated 
192734,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The rooms have all one needs but don t give you much space , One of our favourite hotels in Europe The location is absolutely perfect The staff is friendly extremely efficient and know their stuff The concierges get you tables at the good restaurants and help you get tickets The breakfast buffet has most of the food one might want and more dishes can be ordered a la carte Room enough and quiet enough for a meeting over breakfast Not much more one could want 
192735,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Everything was spot on , I love the warm welcome from the Concierge and Reception staff and walking in to the hotel always feels like such a treat As always rooms were perfect service was impeccable see you in two weeks

192737,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing , Our stay was faultless The staff were very friendly and professional particularly in the cocktail bar The Blind Spot The room was a good size the bed very comfortable and the fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were of very good quality 
192738,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Shower head isn t functional without water flowing out of the shower Lights in console didn t work properly Loud Thin Walls No Starck furniture in the age of Philips Hue Lighting the color changing lights are a lame gimmick Overall it was too sparse and basic for the money , The lobby and the hallway bathroom were nice but both looked worn 
192739,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room was on floor 1 When we opened our windows you could smell cigarettes coming in from the workers outside Also we booked a table at the bar waited 25 minutes for our drinks before we decided to leave , Fantastic location
192740,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, When booking via booking com we noted the number of people it suggested a room which we paid for but then later notified by the hotel that the room wasn t big enough for 3 and we d have to pay extra for a larger room Although the room given was with two large single beds rather than double so not worth the Price IMHO , Lovely gesture of cookies and personalised note left for our son in theverything evening 
192741,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I d like a kettle in the room please with tea coffee , As always the welcome from the Reception team was superb the room was great although smaller than we have previously stayed in and the location is perfect for us

192747,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The only thing I wasn t keen on was you had no tea and coffee facilities in the room but the hotel has already addressed this and I think they are putting them in all rooms within the next few months, The bed was one of the comfiest I ve slept in
192748,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The weather , Fabulous location Five minute walk from the Savoy Theatre Staff were extremely helpful and booked restaurants for us within minutes Faultless

192751,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Hospitality tray should have been refreshed with supplies daily Only one hand towel for two people Only one complimentary bottle of water for two people Small issues however considering the cost of the room it would have been nice However I have stayed in this hotel a few times and definitely will again , Excellent location Enjoy the minimalist modern style of hotel Lovely scent in all corridors and public spaces Very comfortable bed Fabulous shower Extremely helpful and friendly staff

192756,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing could have been improved upon , The attention to detail and ensuring that we were all happy was amazing Bella was engaged in conversation with us as soon as we booked in and was amazing 
192757,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, No recommendations really , Fantastic setting marvelous decoration I ve been here before and for sure I will be back The bars and restaurant make this experience complete 
192758,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Value for money and poor buffet breakfast friendliness of staff was average and not as attentive as my first visit some years ago, Design and funk of the hotel 
192759,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, No tea coffee facilities in room so had to pay which is little unfair considering what your paying for the room, The room was beautiful very modern and extremely comfortable bed
192760,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Overall feel of the entrance lobby is getting tired and is definitely ready for a refurbishment The quirky design now feels out of date, The cocktails and bar staff were attentive
192761,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, No easy chair in the room The plug in the wash basin not able to use it, The ambience and the furnishing of the room and the public areas Quick response when the kettle did not work Easy to use TV with subtitles
192762,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, No tea and coffee making facility in the room , When you walked into the room and were met with the warm glow of the special lighting and pristine whiteness you knew this would be special and it was 
192763,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, A modern quirky hotel in a fantastic location Everything close by theatres pubs galleries shops restaurants attractions etc Plus it has its own great restaurant and bar 
192764,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, this is a very expensive hotel 500 per night the actual hotel is not of the standard charged the hotel interior is quite dirty public areas very dirty in parts but hidden by mood lighting the window blinds the and room main lighting were not working room too small couldn t easily walk around the bed which if you have get up in the night is a problem Breakfast very basic not matching the standard the hotel purports to be no in room hot drinks facility yes you may call for a tea in the morning but again expensive room service for a warm tea virtually every thing in the room is for sale seems more like a gift shop than a relaxing hotel room , location very central to every thing
192765,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I didn t like the fact that the receptionist welcomed me back to the hotel as supposedly I had stayed there in October I have never stayed at this hotel before and won t again as I had to try and explain this to my wife Fortunately for you she found it quite amusing however could you imagine would could have happened if she hadn t,No Positive
192766,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We stayed in room 315 The bathroom was for a disabled traveller as had rails no bath and had a large shower room with a powerful shower that pointed at the shower door The shower door was not sealed and the water ran out at a great rate on to the floor of the bathroom getting all my clothes really wet We needed to use 4 towels to soak it up The basin was a joke The tap just went over the edge of the basin bowl so you could not wash your hands completely just your fingers Really poor design and function When we complained and asked for a new set of towels I felt it was brushed off as a small issue this is not what I would expect from this standard of hotel in London , Spacious room Clean and well designed bedroom 
192767,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I could not find your front door Might I suggest you put the hotel name on the revolving entrance door , I was impressed by the quality of the food The bacon in my club sandwich and at breakfast and the fresh fruit salad at breakfast which was perfectly ripe often in hotels it s not The staff were all very friendly and helpful 
192768,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Covent Garden is my favourite part of London so the hotel was in a great location The room was spacious and very comfortable we had one with a little garden patio area and as the weather was good it was a great addition to the room Well worth it highly recommend this hotel 
192769,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The bar service itself was good although we waited 10 minutes for one of my guests drink to arrive before I had to ask again It had been overlooked We were offered no apology only confirmation that it wasn t our waitress that took the order so not her fault , The bar was exclusive and very smart with table service 
192770,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Found mark on bed sheet No Shower Robes for the price shoud have been included Our Breakfasts were cold on our second day , Location View Room well designed 
192771,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Breakfast was a bit ordinary, The staff were really accommodating service was excellent and response times very fast The gym next door is also a great bonus
192772,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Saturday evening concierge for cocktail lounge frankly rude pompous and dismissive really let the hotel down and would of expected better , Wonderful location Housekeeping and reception very welcoming and friendly
192773,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, We didn t have breakfast in the hotel as felt that it was a bit too pricey but there are masses of restaurants and coffee shops serving breakfast in walkng distance , Our beautiful room no 205 We considered upgrading but when we saw our room were very glad we hadn t It is a corner room with full length windows on 2 sides so great views All room facilities are superb 
192774,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The view from our first room but we were given a room on the top floor shortly after calling the reception , The location was great Friendly staff and excellent service overall Very satisfying and would highly recommend 
192775,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I was unable to turn the air conditioning off and although it was a very low noise I was still able to hear it Why do so many hotels have the volume set so high when you turn the television on mine was set to 43 so each time I had to turn it down to 6 so it was at a comfortable level to hear and I did not disturb the rest of the floor For a 5 star hotel I normally expect to find a robe and slippers available but there were none , The receptionist was very accommodating when I asked for a quiet room as I do not sleep well The room was clean and the bed very comfortable The shower and bathroom were a good size 
192776,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Lovely big bed very helpful staff and great room service We loved being so central yet feeling tucked away in our garden room Great for theatres restaurants and touristy things if you re that way inclined 
192777,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing , Location was excellent Staff were very friendly and went the extra mile Beds were very comfortable and two double beds for a twin room rather then 2 singles
192778,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing to moan about , Staff super helpful decor serene and quirky beds a dream to sleep in excellent shower which is a must Great location for theatre 
192779,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Only niggle is the lousy bluetooth in the rooms could do with a standalone bluetooth speaker amp as many other hotels do , My favourite London Hotel Oh or maybe the Sanderson oh yes they are the same group 
192780,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Breakfast was way too expensive for anyone staying a few days , Our de luxe room was great Despite being in the centre of London it was so quiet and the bed so comfortable I slept really well 
192781,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Just for improvement because I know you guys read all the comments Room cleaning was too late Sun Oct 23rd at 5pm and not up to standard same day desk tap , Central location excellent service super friendly staff nice room very good value for London Will certainly recommend and come again 
192782,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The cost was astronomical for what you get The view was poor considering the onus on light and full length windows , The room was clean and very comfortable 
192783,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, Couldn t fault it Loved the thoughtful little extras in the room Loved the design ciool bar loved the roving jazz trio doing requests Asia de Cuba not bad either
192784,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The standart room is veryp small , Location is great servic is exelent everybody is smily and helpfull The room was big we had a loft The standart room is small 
192785,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I was woken up earlier than wanted but some works across the road but that couldn t be helped , The bed sheets and pillows were amazing Stay in London a lot but never stayed here but will definitely return next month 
192786,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The size of the room , Location location location It s in the middle of the theatre district Close to the tube station Walking distance to tralfalgar sq picadilly sq Coventry garden and many more attractions 
192787,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing it was perfect , Everything was simply amazing The friendliness of the staff at check in who upgraded our room the room itself the comfort of the bed the toiletries and the central location This hotel isn t 5 Star it is more like 6 Star We even loved the smell in the lobby and corridors Those that have stayed there will know exactly what I mean It was a birthday treat for my partner and they even popped a bottle of fizz in the room They d thought of everything to make the stay magical 
192788,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The location is close to Covent garden there are a lot of restaurants and cafes near by but it s not very good for old ppl, great comfy room and friendly staff
192789,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Having to leave , The location is superb the decor ambience the quirkiness of the Brand eg the messages on the keycard envelope and the service at front of house We just love it here 
192790,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The gym next door while great closes early, The staff are excellent Only my third time staying and received an automatic upgrade to a suite Early check in without having to ask I could not ask for better service
192791,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Location for going to west end shows and for being near the subway system is the key feature of this hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was nice and comfortable 
192792,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room was freezing upon check in They should really set the AC to room temperature No slippers or shoehorn I believe these are trivial features in a 5 hotel Somewhat late check in, Loved the location and the staff Excellent room design very convenient I would visit this hotel again
192793,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I can t fault the hotel facilities or staff , A great hotel in a perfect location The staff were incredibly welcoming and nothing was too much trouble 
192794,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, in booking com it says they provide extras bed when we were there they said we are not responsible about whatever writen in booking com stuff was unhelpful shower was bad water will go out during shower bed uncomfortable breakfast very poor, didn t like anything in this hotel if it s in Dubai it will not be more than 3 stars
192795,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The Asia De Cuba Restaurant was fantastic Service and food both top notch The late bar was very classy hidden away so feels secluded The room decor was very modern and comfortable to stay in The staff were very friendly and accommodating The location in terms of locality to Trafalgar Square Covent Garden Embankment The Strand and Leicester Square was great 
192796,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, I absolutely love design but this is in a very unpractical and cold manner It looks like a complet stanard chain hotel The light is terrible in the room as in the common areas The location is great but that s about the only positiv thing to say about this hotel I will never go back and certainly not recommend this hotel to anybody 
192797,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, Its a beautiful hotel Really lovely staff and quirky decor Great location meant we walked everywhere and didn t have to use the Tube at all Could t recommend it more 
192798,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room is a little too minimalistic for my taste but overall was fine There was kind of a weird smell in my room like the carpet was recently shampooed with something strong , Gym was awesome 
192799,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Can hear people in the other rooms and in the corridor However luckily at night this didnt bother my sleep During the day as well I could hear construction or drilling which was annoying when I took my afternoon nap , The bed was comfortable the room is spacious and very clean the view is execellent the bathroom was also spacious and clean The services like room service and house keepinf were friendly and attentive Location was excellent I could walk to all the places I needed to I appreciated the free gym pass to gym box although i didnt use it 
192800,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Grumpy staff who don t to help Practically sent to bed as its not possible to continue to socialise after 1am For central London and a supposedly cool hotel being told to just go to your room with clients and use your minibar is ridiculous They were more concerned we were in the way of the night cleaners Pretentious place w staff who think they are too cool to assist with anything , Location is great Inside is pristine but soulless 
192801,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, A great hotel in a great location Staff were amazing especially the concierges Diogo and Mike who made our girls weekend with their recommendations 
192802,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, A double room should have two complementary water and would be nice to have tea coffee in room rather than have to call for it Minor gripes only , Bed very good Good shower room with high quality products and towels 
192803,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Room service choices for food were good but quite pricey even for London Full English breakfast over 20 plus 12 5 gratuity plus 3 delivery seems a bit steep , Proximity to West End theater and Piccadilly Line tube stop make this a great location for a London stay Room was lovely service excellent and staff quickly responsive to any requests I would definitely stay again 
192804,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Nothing, The staff were really friendly and helpful the towels were changed after evening shower before the morning the bed was comfy the breakfast was lovely The location was perfect 
192805,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Tea coffee making facilities in room rather than phoning reception , Lovely fluffy towels crisp white bedding Large bathroom great toiletries Mood lighting brilliant Very nice touch with cake beers for my sons birthday 
192806,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The only thing we didn t like was the bed as it was a little firm for us but that is only a personal preference , Clean bright modern room Staff were extremely helpful and friendly We both absolutely loved the decor and the mood lighting in the room was a nice touch Location is perfect for sight seeing and there are many theatres near by 
192807,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Blind Spot was a bit dark and the dj music too loud for our liking but that may just be our age , Really comfy beds with lovely bed linen Rooms are so stylish with fabulous furniture and fittings Loved the coloured mood lighting 
192808,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Most annoying thing was that we had opted for a deal that was supposedly Best Price Guarantee However after booking through booking com I looked at the hotel s own website it was cheaper there and included breakfast Overall this made a difference on a standard room of 150 on a three night stay Annoying and when tried to resolve this with the hotel was just made to feel uncomfortable and like an idiot for asking Room was quite tight on space but what you would expect of London I felt like I was in a hermetically sealed box with no obvious way to amend the air conditioning Oh to open a window Bathroom water smelt very much like pond weed , Bed was comfy sheets were nice and crisp room was bright Location great for West End stuff 
192809,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, room service could improve a request of several undred pounds deposit for extra is not acceptable , well located comfortable Manager in charge very helpful

192816,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I had to leave after one night , Absolutely everything The staff were superb the hotel itself is quirky and tasteful and smells beautiful bed was comfortable shower was great etc etc etc We particularly loved the Blind Spot hidden away behind the hand Loved it and will definitely be back 
192817,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, i m not fond of the food available for room service , location and gym are tops there are a few amazing breakfast alternatives just a few blocks aways 
192818,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Larger fridge to store fruit or own drinks Ideally a 2 sink bathroom it was a bit of a queue in the mornings Slow service in the restaurant to refresh drinks Soy Flat White Coffee was undrinkable that said the desk credited it without question, Staff fixed up the kids beds in our suite with so much care the attention to detail was awesome Upgrade offered at a good rate we were happy with the deal Porters were fantastic deserved their tips
192819,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The room was very compact but it was only for 1 night so not problem for us I would want a bigger room if I was staying for a few days , The location is just spot on and the room was very clean with helpful staff 
192820,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The rooms were beautiful and so cool and inviting They have the best beds I have even slept in and the staff were marvallous couldn t do enough for you nothing was a problem 
192821,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, St Martin s In The Fields is not the nicest part of the neighbourhood Avoid that area and staying at Morgans St Martin s Lane hotel is perfect , Spacious room Comfy firm bed Luxurious bathroom Exceptional service from all staff throughout 
192822,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, It was great weather and it would have been great to have access to some kind of outdoor space Really though there was nothing to dislike , The room was the best part Beautiful and very large for the centre of a major city 
192823,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The staff in the bar restaurant could have been more attentive in their service , Amazing location The staff at reception and the concierge were most helpful attentive and professional The room was exceptionally bright and airy I had the BEST night s sleep

192826,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original,No Negative, The staff are the best most helpful staff I ve ever come across Nothing and I mean nothing is to much trouble from the door men to reception and from breakfast to bar staff all smile and offer great hospitality The most pleasant helpfull member of the hotel staff I come across was a lady working in the little coffee bar area called the Den Her name was Inesa she made or trip The first time I stayed near this hotel I asked the doorman where such and such a hotel was which I was stopping at he said it s just up the road and then picked up my back and carried it to the other hotel for me First class staff a credit to the hotel and its management A smile cost nothing Tony Timmins
192827,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Just a few too many finger marks But a lot of glass to keep clean , Reception staff and concierge and porters as good as any 5 establishment Very chic and nicely understated
192828,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The standard room is very small and for some obscure reason I paid more for that on the first night than for the loft on the remainder of my stay I wouldn t book the standard again , The hotel always deliver a very good experience as it is a tranquil haven in the middle of Central London It delivers the expected comfort level and is very tastefully done What makes it really stand out is the service level I really want to thank Bikin the Concierge who was always there to assist and advise me on things to do Professionals like him make the difference 
192829,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, The bathroom and I could adjust the temperature of the room to how it suits me Everything was very clean and staffs were excellent , Very good hotel Although more of a 4 star than a 5 star But can t complain 
192830,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, What made this a very problematic experience for me was that the hotel withdrew 500 more from my account than the statement I had signed at check in had said they would leaving me with an overdrawn bank account and no way to buy anything for the last days of my trip I complained about this at check out and I was simply told they withdraw an extra 100 night as a deposit and that while it was too bad I hadn t been informed of this at check in and that this had caused me trouble it was basically my tough luck This basically destroyed the final days of my trip and very nearly stranded me sans money or any place to stay And while I understand that this was probably in the terms and conditions and that I should ve read those more carefully I m just not used to having the wool pulled over my eyes when patronizing 5 star hotels the staff failed to make all this clear and then they didn t care when that caused me a problem I will not be staying here again , St Martin s Lane Hotel has decent facilities I booked last minute and got a queen room which was fine if small The bed was comfortable the bathroom was basic but passable and the view was quite nice It is worth noting that everything in the minibar was EXTREMELY old the chocolate was all white and hardened But on the whole the hotel was very underwhelming for the price I ve stayed in far better London hotels for far less 
192831,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, I thought the prices for the mini bar were very expensive I didn t like that there was no kettle in the room and the mattress was very hard , The shower was great and the natural light coming into the room was amazing Wardrobe space etc was very good 
192832,St Martins Lane A Morgans Original, Only niggle is that there should have a good quality bluetooth speaker unit in the bedrooms eg Geneva Harmon Kardon Marshal etc others in the Morgan group do an omission here and connecting to the TV media unit is not the same sound quality at all,No Positive
