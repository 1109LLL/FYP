255024,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The room had a washing machine but the hotel wasn t able to provide a rack to dry clothes we either needed to use a tumble dryer not suitable for all clothes or try to find room to hang up clothes around the room Staff were not the most friendly typically Parisian but were able to get things done when requested , Rooms in very good condition and a nice size for Paris especially good for families with small children Convenient to have a washing machine in the room and the sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable Also useful to have a kitchen to prepare breakfast and basic meals had a few microwave meals from restaurant Monoprix supermarket convenience store down the street Good location in a nice area minutes away from the Eiffel Tower It was convenient to have access to a computer and printer for guests in order to print pre boked museum tickets boarding passes etc 
255025,La Clef Tour Eiffel, All perfect, The hotel was in a great location and very nice rooms and facilities The highlight for us however was the friendly staff I would like to say particular thanks to the young lady working in the Hexagon bar sorry we didn t get her name she was so helpful and kind on both evenings she even lent my daughter in law her own scarf when she was getting cold outside and we we very impressed when she warned us about a particular taxi driver that appeared to be unfit to drive when he arrived to pick us up Very special weekend made even better by the amazing staff we will return Many thanks from Mike Suzanne

255028,La Clef Tour Eiffel, There seems to be a design flaw with the glass partition in the bathroom that is supposed to prevent water from splashing to the floor Even moving the shower head away from the center and trying to not spill didn t help It s a minor issue that shouldn t deter anyone from staying here , Great place fantastic location friendly service clean room and interior Convenient access to Trocad ro Metro station grocery stores and French bakery in walking distance

255045,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Breakfast seemed a little pricey for bread and yogurt but seemed to be on par with the local restaurants, The staff were all amazing and very helpful The perfect location being walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the arc de triumph Clean friendly and very accomodating would definitely come back to this hotel 
255046,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Lack of power sockets next to bed a real issue for the digitally connected Sound from corridor much less soundproofed than I expected You can hear bags rustle Otherwise a marvellous hotel , Loved the spacious room bathroom internal decor in rooms and in spacious common areas Location adjacent to key sights and CiteChaillot architecture museum was great Trocadero metro within 100 metres so hotel accessible to anywhere in Paris Loved the bed one of the best Wide range of TV channels was terrific Great range of L Occitane accessories much appreciated Staff really nice really friendly 
255047,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff was excellent very helpful and sweet The rooms were fantastic Location could not have been better and the entire building was beautiful For the price this property is a steal 
255048,La Clef Tour Eiffel, While the washer dryer was great we never could figure out how to operate the dryer The instructions were clear So either it was broken or we missed something If it wasn t our last day we would have had someone come up and show us how it operates , The one bedroom apartment was wonderful with a view over the street The walls and windows are so well insulated we did not hear a sound even on New Years Eve Staff was attentive and kind 
255049,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Breakfast selection is a bit small for the price and could be improved, This is the second time we stayed at the hotel We absolutely love it The location is perfect It s very close to everyone by walk but far enough that it s not in a noisy neighborhood There are several supermarkets pharmacies restaurants metros etc around the hotel All within a short walk Staff at the hotel are very helpful as always The helped us with many requests and reservations for several things 
255050,La Clef Tour Eiffel, We arrived little bit earlier than the check in time and we had to pay a lot more than expected for early check in I asked for anniversary arrangements didn t find even one flower in the room they probably forgot I didn t feel special or they cared, The room was neat and clean liked the room and the view the location is really nice close to Eiffel Tower 
255051,La Clef Tour Eiffel, We had a great room Very large and beautifully decorated The bed was 2 twins together Not ideal for a couple , We didn t have breakfast but the tea in the afternoon with Macaroons was lovely 
255052,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Breakfast is very expensive at 25 euro, Large apartment well equipped and beautifully decorated Nice view on an inside garden and the location is great just off Trocadero Staff brought my bags to the room and was very helpful with any kind of request 
255053,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Room was a disappointment We were upsold several categories because it was a special occasion Our room was on the top floor with low ceilings and partial windows and it overlooked the busy Ave Kleiber so there was a great deal of noise I can t imagine a less appealing room in the hotel although they must exist because we paid significantly more for this room than other options presented to us , Great location with easy access to Trododero Place Victor Hugo and Champs Elysees Pleasant staff and very nice facilities with tea and coffee games and a nice lounge area 
255054,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Couldn t fault it , The staff were wonderful very friendly We had some very special touches for celebrating an occasion and the attention to detail is fantastic 
255055,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Our room had no view outside although windows were huge , Everything was pleasing during our stay The hotel is on a nice district of Paris Metro is a few steps away Lots of points of interest are within walking distance The room was very spacious clean and comfortable 
255056,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing really Bit of a Metro ride to some key attractions but as the service is excellent not a problem , Superb room very comfortable and well equipped Breakfasts excellent and in our case free Attentive service They really spoiled my partner on her birthday Highly recommended 
255057,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, A beautiful hotel in a central location Our visit from start to finish was first class The room was amazing and the staff could not do enough for you The best hotel I have stayed in for a long time 
255058,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Like many hotels the air conditioning was too hot when we arrived and the coolest setting hardly required bed clothes yet there was a very warm duvet and no separate upper sheet , Awesome shower comfortable bed mini kitchen Well equipped with power sockets 
255059,La Clef Tour Eiffel, We were relocated to another room when our AC broke down The other room smelled like sewage The breakfast selection was very limited Room service food all came in a jar which didnt look or taste very appetizing , The location is amazing Room decor was beautiful 
255060,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Staff at the reception treated you as part of their job only Where is the hospitality A big disappointment We were travelling with children and were given 2 rooms located far apart accessible by different elevators , The proximity to the landmarks i e Eiffel Tower 
255061,La Clef Tour Eiffel, They should work more on cleanliness of bathrooms and carpets , Welcoming and nice staff Comfortable bed Great air conditioning Perfect location close to the Eiffel Tower 
255062,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, This hotel is so beautiful and central but what made it really special for my husband and I was the staff The were incredibly nice and helpful and not it a false way that I have encountered before They truly were a breath of fresh air I will 100 be returning and reccomeding 
255063,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Friendliness competence at check in was not good enough Air condition couldn t get adjusted just on off Shower fluds all bathroom Overall rather cold atmosphere, Location room comfort design is nice
255064,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Brilliant value for money The location is superb 5 minute walk from eiffel tower and arc dear triumph The staff were excellent nothing was too much for them they were friendly helpful and spend time showing us the maps and metro routes to make our trip so much easier 
255065,La Clef Tour Eiffel, none to mention, the staff are amazing thanks to all of them and the location of the hotel is great as it is close to all the attractions definitely will stay again when visiting Paris in the near future 
255066,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Visited for my birthday and the staff kindly upgraded us Was a wonderful experience from start to finish my partner especially enjoyed the complimentary macarons for afternoon tea 
255067,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Odd room service no facilities eg pool, Staff were excellent Though the hotel has an odd way of arranging room service were you fill out an order form which they collect before getting the meal delivered some time later So allow lots of pre notice before you eat Also room service closes at an early 10 ish So not ideal for a romantic get away But the hotel is stunning the location is perfect The staff do a good job of being welcoming efficient 
255068,La Clef Tour Eiffel, i dont have negative to say about the hotel am very happy and will endorse your hotel to my friends , the location is very accessible the staff are very hospitable and the facilities fabulous i love the room 
255069,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The shower was small and leaked water on to floor from door The aircon didn t work properly after many times of complaining nothing seemed to be done about it , The location was fantastic Close to Arc de triomphe Eiffel Tower and lots of restaurants The bed was comfy and the room spacious 
255070,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Bad communication with reservation about breakfast being included The hotel should have assisted me better and offered some compromise Nothing was offered ,No Positive
255071,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Balcony door did not open to outside side street even although I booked in advance breakfast NOT included in price Shower leaked onto floor, Big bedroom with balcony Firm king bed v comfy Nice bathroom fridge and kitchen facilities
255072,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The room was lovely when I arrived I got a free room upgrade at no extra cost which was great The room had a lovely balcony and all the things you ll need to enjoy your trip very spacious and comfortable 
255073,La Clef Tour Eiffel, We infromed the hotel about our early check in but we had to wait for about 3 4 hours until we were checked in , The location of the hotel is just perfect It s about 10 min walking distance from the champs elysees and about the same distance to Eiffle Tower It is located on a main street close to resturants cafes shops and an underground metro station 
255074,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The rooms werent cleaned well Housekeeping wouldnt put more tissue if its finished or remove the dirty towels they kept running out of water which is something ive bever heard of before , Staff were nice and location is great Breakfast is the best meal and you can have coffee anytime of day or juices or water in the lobby 
255075,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Stunning hotel in a great location just over the river from the Eiffel Tower Friendly staff offered us a free upgrade to a suite as it was our first visit Would defiantly recommend la clef tour eiffel I will be staying there again 
255076,La Clef Tour Eiffel, there was no in house restaurant for daily eating Also for the choice at breakfast was not worth the 25 per person I stay at hotels for the whole experience unfortunately this wasn t the case this time Physical standards are great but personal services need addressing Thank you , The fact they met my special needs as a disabled person I have problems with walking and balance
255077,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was too basic, I really love the gym there the location is perfect it s central to all the major landmarks of Paris The room I had was amazing room 717 I highly recommend it It s like your own penthouse
255078,La Clef Tour Eiffel, No real concierge service but the front desk receptionists were very knowledgeable They were not able to provide the requested roll away bed despite Booking com checking with the hotel before I arrived and verified that special request , Staff was accommodating and friendly 
255079,La Clef Tour Eiffel, I booked a double room and when we arrived it was two single beds seperately We asked for this to be changed when we went out and it still wasn t done when we returned meaning the staff had to change it while we were in the room This was annoying as it was a treat for my girlfriends birthday and our first holiday today you hope everything is perfect The champagne I requested to be in the room on arrival the reception team asked about this Infront of my girlfriend on check in If we still required it sadly spoiling the surprise for my girlfriends birthday When they brought the champagne up it was the wrong kind too However very kindly they agreed to give us this bottle complimentary and bring up the correct one too which I really appreciated Also breakfast was given complimentary for the last morning of our stay due to the issue with the beds again much appreciated , The breakfast buffet was a very extensive selection and of high quality I do think 25 pp as I was quoted by reflection is a bit expensive but we very much enjoyed the food when we took complimentary breakfast on the last day The staff are friendly just sometimes it seems communication was lacking 
255080,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Concierge staff needs little improvement as some time they do not know that much other than that everything was perfect , Location is amazing staff are really helpful 
255081,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The bed too small for a couple The pillows too hard No windows inside the rooms hot water not working et les lacabots The worst is that i have informed the reception during the checkout they said that they they will inform the personin charge , Nothing No windows No hot watter 
255082,La Clef Tour Eiffel, There was a strange odor in the room not a big turnoff but my wife was not so happy about that , The hotel is placed very close to the Eiffel tower walking distance In general good service and nice people working there
255083,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing that i remember of only the breakfast is not that good , Great location Comfortable bed and big room Next time also i ll stay at the same hotel 
255084,La Clef Tour Eiffel, the bathroom is oddly constructed old gives an uncelan feeling and using the shower sets the whole bathroom under water, great location great connectivity room size big rooms
255085,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Everything else besides breakfast and location was okey not great just okey, The location is great Breakfast was great The room was very spacious but of course we paid for it 
255086,La Clef Tour Eiffel, the service was so bad staff not friendly i had do not disturb sign but the room service went in and cleaned without my permission No respect for privacy the toilet was broken and dirty most of the time, The room size was good
255087,La Clef Tour Eiffel, No activities for kids No swimming pool Booked thru booking com got automatically cancelled though booking com confirmed with hotel that my booking is on but while check in the hotel did not had confirmation and they said they have not got our booking amount That process wasted our good 3 hours at the reception , Staffs were helpful Good location near Eiffel Tower Spacious one bedroom apartment 
255088,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Finger prints are noticed on the flushing button of toilet Room cleaner is expected to pay more attention to such small detail , Both Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe are just a few minutes away by walk Hotel lobby is much more spacious and comfortable than many other five star hotels in Paris and the room is also nicely renovated Hotel staff are friendly and helpful ready to provide assistance at all time 
255089,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Water is leaking from the shower cabine to the bath room floor The water temperature is fluctuating from hot to cold and back Breakfast is expensive and not included into the room price, Location room size silence
255090,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Room temperature could not be controlled did not work room was cold All windows in the hotel and in our room were not able to be opened Room design idea is cold business style During check in we were told that drinks in the lobby were for free but this was only true for drinks at the restaurant not at the lobby So we were presented an unpleasant extra bill during check out ,No Positive
255091,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The smoke detector alarm has activated for no apparent reason which resulted in a loudy alarm sound When called the lady at the reception told us it was just too sensitive , Room number 627 that we chose was HUGE with absolutely fantastic double bed incuding uncountable number of pillows modern furniture and spacy bathroom with both bathtub and a shower And you can see the top of the Eiffel Tower behind the window It was t cheap but this was the best quality choice when compared to other hotels in the area Very close to the Trocadero with a number of shops and restaurants in the area 
255092,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The bathroom is in the bedroom and has a glass door so using the shower after someone is sleeping in the bedroom kids or baby in crib is disturbing due to the light coming into the bedroom , Great to have the fully stocked kitchen in room 
255093,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Bed is a bit hard and shower experience is not as good as bath in that room , Location and hassle free check in process An eary check in 12 00 is possible Room is big in Paris standard 
255094,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Blackout curtains didn t help sleep few hours after sunrise A C was blowing hot air and there were no openable windows , Great staff Early check in great location Very spacious clean room with huge bathroom Complimentary hot beverages available 24 hrs in the lobby Good free wifi Soft comfy bed 
255095,La Clef Tour Eiffel, I did not like that the air condition did not get cold at all It stayed at room temperature the entire stay I believe it is like a one all air condition for the entire building , The staff was very nice and answers any questions you might have at anytime They treat you very well and the bed and location is always clean and peaceful I would recommend this hotel to anyone ever visiting Everything you want and need to see is in walking distance The 100 sightseeing bus even comes and pick you up directly from the hotel verses a meeting location 
255096,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The room lacked some attention to detail with cleanliness but nothing overly problematic , The staff were amazing So helpful polite and friendly We got an Eiffel Tower view which was delightful mid to top of the tower visible from window due to other buildings in the way but still very special Very tasty little pastries macaroons and croissants put out during the day as well as coffee and an honesty bar to boot Very gorgeous hotel location was great perfect for what we wanted 2 min walk to the Trocad ro then a further 5 min walk to Eiffel Tower About a 10 15 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs lys es The hotel was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and would definitely return 
255097,La Clef Tour Eiffel, I asked for a quiet room both before I arrived and when I checked in I ended up next to a room being used for storage for an event Hotel staff were slamming the door going in and out all day long When I complained politely the staff were extremely rude , The room was large and clean with a comfortable bed Great bathroom 
255098,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, One of the best places to stay if you travel to Paris Everything was literally amazing From the location to the stunning view From the stuff that is always willing to help you to the comfortableness of the room We will definitely stay there again in our Next Trip 
255099,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The breakfast choice for hot food could have been better but that is being picky, The staff were very friendly and helpful The terrace outside our suite where our group had lunch on a nice afternoon was great The constant availability of coffee in the comfortable lounge area near reception was a nice touch and a nice way to start and end the day although traditional teas suited to the English palate rather than more glamorous varieties would have been nice Would certainly stay again 
255100,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing, The staff are very kind and helpful and provide any guidance and assistance you need The location is great and surrounded with many cafes and restaurants The lobby and lounge are very well decorated and have a pleasant atmosphere The suites are very clean and spacious with many places for your stuff 
255101,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Room allocation Although I requested an exterior room I had been allocated one overlooking the interior atrium and was given an option to pay a supplement for a room with exterior view , espresso coffee maker good wifi
255102,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Room could have been a bit more luxurious Only one chair decor in the room is not in keeping with the rest of the hotel it feels cheaper Breakfast was included first night but not the second for this price it seemed a bit much , Great location just around the corner from trocadero and Eiffel Tower Nice foyer 
255103,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing , Everything was fantastic and surprised us with its beautiful comfort and friendliness of staff We will definitely be back and we are telling as many people as possible about our fantastic stay 
255104,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Excellent all round The location is quiet and you feel like you are away from the tourist belt although the Eiffel Tower is just a short walk over the river Staff were friendly Deluxe Room was lovely We didn t have breakfast so can t comment on it The Frog XVI over the road is good for a drink and American style food Restaurant Jamin just round the corner has excellent French food and service at very reasonable prices Uber to tourist spots like Monmartre averages about 13 Euros Would stay here again 
255105,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Highly recommend for traveller likes quiet location but in walking distance to those famous historical spots Comparatively big room Staffs are very helpful If you are Chinese don t miss the sour and spicy soup in this family run Chinese restaurant nearby unexpected good taste
255106,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Parking is valet not really directly on premises Breakfast is moderate value for money, Very quiet comfortable hotel with basic facilities Modern interior pleasant luxurious atmosphere

255109,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Very small room for a 5 star hotel No internet working during our hole stay If you make a shower there is no ventilation in the bathroom so all the room becomes very humid and is imposible to stay in the room , Good location Concept of the business 
255110,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The ventilatiin is noisy and not way to change it The shower head was not flowing correctly because of bad maintenance The douche of the bathtub was not working At last why are there still rooms with twin bed and no king size beds , Location is perfect big rooms
255111,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Very good suites hotel for families with little kids Location facility service very good except that ordering food to the room took a long time street noise could occasionally be annoying 
255112,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, I just returned from a 6 night stay at Citadines Suites Arc Dr Triomphe Paris and their attention to detail and the treatment I received from the concierge to the housekeeping staff was phenomenal They really cared about making my hotel stay as comfortable as possible Housekeeping made sure my room never lacked of nespresso coffee and clean towels I definitely appreciated the complimentary large bottle of water waiting there after a long flight and the l occitane toiletries Their gym facility is also very impressive The hotel can easily rival any 5 star hotel in my opinion 
255113,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights the staff was so friendly and helpful and the hotel is amazing clean big rooms and only a stones throw from effel tower and a metro
255114,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Perfectly presented hotel in a great area by the Eiffel Tower Staff very friendly and extremely helpful They even went and collected my wallet for me which I had left in a cafe and sent it back to England for me 
255115,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Whilst the location is amazing be prepared to pay a premium for food and drinks in the surrounding area There are much cheaper places if you are prepared to travel , This hotel was great we were seriously impressed with the location and the facilities were amazing All topped off with staff that were always happy to help 
255116,La Clef Tour Eiffel, I booked a room with the view and I didn t get it there was no toilet paper in the bathroom the Paris Map was completely cut I could just see the adverstisment around the map The cleaner tryed to come in my room at 8 30 waking me up I had the worse experience ever the staff told me the manager would have call me the day after to propose me a discount for next time but it didn t happen ,No Positive
255117,La Clef Tour Eiffel, variation between same rooms No bar Limited eating facility within hotel, Fabulous location Beds pillows etc exceptionally comfortable Good size rooms with tea coffee facility
255118,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Rooms were large and clean very good location and the staff were very efficient and very friendly nothing was a problem for them they even allowed us to check out late 2PM with no extra charge and stored our luggage securely until our pick up at 5 30 Would not hesitate to recommend them
255119,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff were gracious and helpful amazing location near Troxadero and Eiffel Tower we had a partial view from our room The suite layout very comfortable and clean which is important when staying longer Lifts to all floors Supermarket nearby and great restaurants for dinner or lunch around in Rue du Longchamp 
255120,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Staff great and helpfull Top security Location near trocadero caf s 3 minutes walking champs elysees 17 mnts walking Super market Washing machine in suite was really great 
255121,La Clef Tour Eiffel, No thing, Staff are more than great location every things near by super market trocadero cafe just 100 meter walk Champs elysees 17 minuts walk Love the hotel especially the security for entering the hotel and rooms Cant change to other hotel
255122,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Aircon malfunctioned Response from management took a very long time Technician when he did come was very efficient and fixed it in no time He also obliged to arrange for toiletries to be replenished which house keeping forgot , Location 
255123,La Clef Tour Eiffel, When we checked in we were told that Booking com didn t pay the city taxes even though Booking com gave us paperwork saying we had paid the taxes and the hotel told us we had to pay the taxes in cash Weird , The bed had a great mattress cover soft cushy the most comfortable bed in 4 countries that we slept in Staff held our luggage after check out while we explored They were very nice 
255124,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Breakfast could have more variety and it should be more French style , Spacious room although it was just a standard double nice bathroom excellent location very polite and helping staff 
255125,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Room service is poor you ask for something and the waiting game begins and usually they just forget about you and never call to update you if it s not possible to meet your needs asked for bathroom slippers for whole stay later when I insisted they said out of stock lol Staff have big smiles unless u ask for a 1 hour late checkout you get the No with a smile I would appreciated better communication skills Plus they keep putting blame on their busy and room shortage and it shows online they have plenty of ready ones to be booked Weird attitude Rooms are a bit old with stains on the floor Pictures and square meters doesn t match When we left I had to put my luggages in the car by myself And believe me when I say my discontent is only reflected in here I wonder what type of service I would had if I would asked for basics of a 4 star hotel , Location Size of room becomes good if u argue enough and you get rid of their kitchen I arrived 8 am and they let me in 10 30am which was the only good thing I had of that staff 
255126,La Clef Tour Eiffel, This was no suite You walked right into the bedroom and then there was a small area with a kitchen and a table with 2 dining chairs Ridiculous The bath was large and had a separate tub and shower but the shower was dangerous as you stepped out onto wet marble Plus I have never seen a shower that had NO place to put your soap and shampoo except on the floor Did I mention that the paint was peeling in the shower And then there was this lovely terrace without a stick of furniture I guess we could have taken the 2 kitchen chairs outside Finally the staff had a wonderful ability to not understand or care about our issues or needs , Location near Tracadora was good The room I refuse to call it a suite had a large bathroom and a big terrace 
255127,La Clef Tour Eiffel, We felt slightly ignored by staff sometimes as we were a younger backpacking couple , The location of the Hotel was excellent and the nearby restaurants were great 
255128,La Clef Tour Eiffel, nothing but I suggest them if they could have a small bar within the breakfast hall , location you are close to everything you need supermarket many restaurants bars metro station bus station all with less than 100 m walk 10 minutes walk from Eiffel tower 15 minutes from Champe Elysee staff was very friendly all the time 
255129,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The price for breakfast 25 EUR The quality was excellent but price to high Fixed windows in the room not possible to open them although air conditioning was working perfectly , Excellent location Very confortable and nice room 100 mts from Trocadero and Metro different alternatives that allowed us to move easily 
255130,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing particular , The room was spacious enough as a Pari s hotel room The location is good and convenient for my own purpose Good access from CDG 
255131,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Fitness center could not be accessed Security was lax Replaced a lost room key without ever asking if I was a guest No doorman Anyone entering with a key card lets everyone in , Staff was professional and courteous 
255132,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Unfortunately we were in room 132 which is a lovely room but directly above a sliding glass door opening to reception It was also directly above a night club I would request a high floor , The room was lovely and the location was great 
255133,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Only about 3 restaurants within walking distance but they were good enough , The bed was very comfortable the room was beautiful great washroom layout the location to get to shopping and Eiffel tower was good 
255134,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The hotel service was just ok we would request things they would forget we asked if they could organize tickets to Disneyland they said yes then when we came to collect them they said they couldn t so we would have to get them at the gate Little things however they could have been better Overall I would stay here again , The rooms were a great size we found the location convenient Walk to Arc Eiffel supermarket local restaurants Would recommend this hotel 
255135,La Clef Tour Eiffel, housekeeping the do not clean very well and don t bring new staff for the room such as tea auger etc, Hotel was very good in overall and from the one of my best
255136,La Clef Tour Eiffel,No Negative, loved the manager s special touch when i mentioned that we are on our Honeymoon Entire room was decorated with Rose petals including the bathtub there was a bottle of Champagne and chocolates for us Really sweet of the Hotel Manager to make it more special Its just 5 mins away from the Eiffel tower which made this stay much more memorable 
255137,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Understaffed specially concierge and valet drivers has to be an independent team rather than shared with concierge which is already limited to 1 2 people at most , Concept of suites is convenient for families traveling in bigger number of people as all suited comes with sofa beds kitchen washing machine etc

255140,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The picture on booking com website gave the wrong impression that the Eiffel tower could be viewed from all the rooms in the Hotel However this turned out to be a myth Was a bit disappointing However the location is beautiful , Nice location and the hotel is beautiful too

255142,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The bed in our suite was a bit uncomfortable Two single mattrases put together to create a kingsize bed but the mattrases kept moving apart , Staff facilities location was fantastic 
255143,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Shower leaked all over bathroom floor Not good with toddlers Couldn t guarantee cot reservation until check in We had to just hope there would be one Valet attendant didn t start work on time and so we had to collect our own car from the parking facilities at 6am However car was in one piece and off the road , Location was excellent for the Eiffel Tower and Arc du Triomphe Nice restaurants cafes on avenue Kleiber Bakery on the next street serves breakfast packages Opens at 7am 
255144,La Clef Tour Eiffel, The breakfast price is a bit steep however as with Paris plenty of alternatives on every corner , Excellent location and very very comfortable Having the suite really felt special

255146,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Exceptional gymnasium Some hotels get away with saying they have a gym and it turns out to be a small airless room with a decrepit bike and an old treadmill Another plus was the coffee and tea plus afternoon cakes and papers available 23 hrs so hospitable And free use of a washing machine and dryer After a months travel this was a real bonus Exceptional Hotel
255147,La Clef Tour Eiffel, Everything was really nice but when we decided to extend by an additional night we encountered problems Door keys and Wi Fi stopped working and it became an irritation to get it sorted out Cost of the breakfast is not great value for money, Great hotel great location and friendly staff
