273733,Cram,No Negative, Lovely hotel great value for money with attentive friendly staff It was around 27 euro in a taxi to and from the airport A leisurely stroll takes you to gothic quarter and las ramblas
273734,Cram, It was on a very busy road so we couldn t have the door open, Breakfast great Staff really friendly and helpful Helped that they spoke English as we do not speak Spanish Roof top terrace fabulous and a lovely view of the city there Lovely touch of a bottle of champagne as we were there to celebrate my husbands birthday 
273735,Cram, The room Horrible AC small dirty Manager never called me back after 4 days of trying No where to put your luggage Staff couldn t recommend anywhere to eat in the neighborhood Bathroom had too much mold , Rooftop deck
273736,Cram, No tea of coffee making facility and they would not provide a kettle so had to go and buy one for 15 euro s The pool area was a little tired and could do with some new furniture This hotel was a bit too far away from the beach and the main area s for us mostly due to the very hot weather , Modern hotel room nice little pool on the roof with a bar Good wifi and excellent air con
273737,Cram, We asked booking com to request adjacent rooms important On arrival that was not detailed on the Hotel register took some time to organise time was precious and finished four rooms apart We also requested quiet rooms one was next to the lift but it did not cause any noise , Nice Hotel very good air con Staff attentive Location was booked to suit our requirements Effectively one day in Barcelona to attend a Masters Graduation ceremony If we were holidaying in the Barcelona area we would book near or on the beach which is no criticism of Cram Hotel 
273738,Cram, Bad service at det rooftop bar The Bartender could not serve several drinks on the menu pina colada strawberry daiquiri and the aperol spritz did not taste good Did nt help that he was moody , Clean room great bathrobe and complementarities in the bathroom was missing conditioner though Nice bed and all in all very satisfied Nice location could have been closer to the city centrum about 10 minutes walk and It was real easy to get around by foot 
273739,Cram, Sometimes there are flies outside the entrance going into the hotel , I ve been to the Cram many times and the people and service is excellent This is truly one of the best hotels in Barcelona I highly recommend it 
273740,Cram, Wished there had been a complimentary breakfast It was very expensive , Great location Not as Touristy which was nice If you can walk it s a good location 
273741,Cram, A bit pricey although May break drove prices in whole city and rooms are not brand new but not desolated too External pool could be heated , Very nice bathroom with walk in shower
273742,Cram, Tried to order a sandwich one night was told it would be 40 minutes Sometimes you couldn t find anyone to serve a drink at the bar or you got told they would be with you in 10 minutes We thought the bottles of water were free in the room but at the end of our stay we got a bill for over 20 euros for 8 small bottles , Staff were friendly helpful room was clean comfortable 
273743,Cram, Pricey but good , No breakfast at the hotel Had met up with family who liked to walk before breakfast so we would return to one of the many excellent cafes that served breakfast in the vicinity I
273744,Cram, plastic sheets on mattress Beware the parking garage if you come by car the intercom to open it is on floor 2 and the door swings inwards and doesn t have a working sensor to detect cars we learned this the hard way , Staff were very friendly and helpful Modern clean room and hotel lobby Nice area of Barcelona to walk through not too touristy but many cafes and restaurants notably in direction of Casa Batlo 10 min walk from hotel 
273745,Cram, The upstairs terrace wasn t lit up and the bar wasn t open It was out of season march but we would have loved heat lamps for the cooler evenings and nights, Nothing was too much trouble for the staff All of which were very friendly and polite Hotel was amazing and very clean comfortable Breakfast was delicious and we looked forward to it every morning
273746,Cram,No Negative, Good central location near enough to a metro stop and the university of Barcelona Breakfast was ok but variety was limited The reception area and bar near the restaurant is cool and beautiful but while modern in layout the decor inside the rooms is a little frayed around the edges will need a make over in time Overall good value though
273747,Cram, Nothing could have been better , Professional fantastic staff Nothing was too much trouble I was un well during our stay and they were very accommodating thank you
273748,Cram, Room was small and did not like the poor privacy of the bathroom glass door Also room was not very practical , Liked the comfortable table and roof top
273749,Cram, Change the channel on one tv and either the other tv turns itself on or also changes channel Had to change rooms because of a fault with the patio door which meant it couldn t be locked at night , The bed was fantastic and the house white wine in the bar was nice 
273750,Cram, All was correct and what we expected , Great location The bed was lovely and very comfortable The room was quiet with good quality windows We had breakfast included and it was very good great selection and the coffee was very nice difficult to find in hotels nowadays Staff were very helpful and polite We really enjoyed our stay Recommended 
273751,Cram, No coffee tea making facilities and only one plug available in the bedroom The lighting in the room was clever but impossible to control without making mistakes , Friendly and helpful staff and good location 
273752,Cram, I wish rooms were slightly larger or there was a designated space for suitcases and I wished bar was more crowded on October time, Fantastic friendly accumulative staffs at front desk modern room and facilities had all sorts of facilities for a comfortable stay however who stays in a hotel in the great beautiful city of Barcelona
273753,Cram, The room was smaller than expected for the price , Very friendly staff great location very comfy bed The roof terrace where breakfast is served is gorgeous 
273754,Cram, The prices are a bit over the top for food and drinks Cocktail lounge was never manned and never looked open , Rooms are excellent very clean and super quiet Also very good staff 
273755,Cram,No Negative, Loved every minute of our stay We were on our honeymoon and the hotel staff left a bottle of champagne for us to enjoy in our room The reception staff were very friendly and helpful The room was also cleaned everyday and we had fresh towels each day too was great Very central and Didn t want to leave 10 10
273756,Cram, Since this was a 4 hotel me and my partner assumed the service etc would be excellent especially in light that we had the best suite in the hotel However we were treated like we could not afford the room hotel and was looked down on by the majority of the staff When we went to the hotel restaurant a main reason why I booked the hotel we were ushered out with no alternative for dinner Many items in the room were broken for example the phone did not work and had come off of its stand which meant we could not call for room service Even when we went to ask for breakfast to be delivered to our room we were just told to get breakfast and carry it down by ourselves defeating the point of room service We found several birthday decorations in and under the bed from previous customers which would be disgusting to find in a cheaper hotel never mind this one There were also many scuffs around the room bathroom and jacuzzi bath in the suite and the shower had a very poor drainage system which meant our clothes got soaked in the bathroom Very little care had been taken to the small details in the room This hotel would have been somewhere we went yearly if it wasn t for the absolutely astonishing staff and customer service , The hotel was in an amazing location and the view from the terrace was absolutely beautiful The hotel was modern fun and seemed to have everything you would need and more There was one member of staff working on the terrace bar while we were there who was particularly lovely She did not look down on us because we were young she treat us like any paying customer and she should be praised for her wonderful customer service 
273757,Cram, The room wall not protect the sound noises The pool very small The furniture is good and Smart TV in the room There is no bussiness center or sport club, The staff friendly cooperative
273758,Cram, I didn t like the fact the the hotel didn t have ice available The air conditioners don t get cold enough and that the first room I was provided with the TV didn t work and the shower drain was clogged resulting in a flooded bathroom , I enjoyed the location The roof top bar and it s view of the city The bathroom were also great with an excellent showet
273759,Cram, Shower leaked onto the floor so had to be careful you didn t slip getting out of the shower but no big deal , Roof top patio and breakfast were excellent Staff were very friendly courteous and helpful and the bed was very comfortable Room was extremely quiet and afforded a great nights sleep nice air conditioning after a hot day of trekking around Barcelona Would definitely stay here again 
273760,Cram, Didn t like the glass door on the bathroom toilet and our inability to shut the door Excellent hanging areas in the cupboards but no shelves which made our lovely room look a tip with both suitcases and our clothes on display the whole time, Lovely bedroom design roof top pool deck chairs and breakfast area Charming staff who were a real pleasure to deal with Very comfortable bed and good air conditioning
273761,Cram, There are some minor details that could be improved There s no place to hang your towel near the standard shower so had to place it in the sink One of the slabs on the shower floor is often loose It s a bit confusing to know which button control which light There s a power socket only on one side of the bed or on the opposite wall , I stayed at Cram and had the chance to experience both standard and superior rooms There s a very nice bed in both and it is really huge in the superior room The other addition are a pair of soft chairs and a table and a bath in the superior room There s a nice balcony facing the street even in standard rooms 
273762,Cram, The hotel doesn t provide complimentary water coffee and tea in the rooms nor even a boiler for our private use Other than that everything was great , The location was great and the staff was brilliant and helpful We want to especially commend the hotel on their staff member at the reception Mr Adriano We have never met such a knowledgeable and friendly receptionist in all our travels There was not once that we sought his advice or recommendation without being greeted with a huge grin and the words Of course I know and his recommendations were always just perfect We congratulate Cram on recruiting such a valuable member on their team We will certainly come back Sincerely Mohamed Yehia Ahmed
273763,Cram,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to be helpful The swimming pool and bar were fantastic Our dinner in the Restaurant was the best in our five weeks of travelling
273764,Cram, There is nothing I did not like , Staff in reception was very professional and super friendly Always smiling and helpful We really felt welcome there Location was also good Breakfast on the roof terrace gave good start for the new day 
273765,Cram,No Negative, Service when we arrived was fantastic and continued to be throughout our stay We were greeted by Alejandro and he made us feel at ease and gave us advice on places to visit in Barcelona This was our first holiday abroad so we really appreciated this 
273766,Cram,No Negative, Perfect location Wonderfully comfortable with cheery helpful staff great facilities Will definitely book again can t recommend highly enough 
273767,Cram, Breakfast staff didn t speak English also breakfast price was expensive There was a small pool on the terrace Maksimum 3 or 4 person can use swimming pool at the same time , Location was perfect 
273768,Cram, The lack of ice readily available was a bit of a nuisance Although we only had to use once it was annoying to have to go to the pool level to obtain ice from the bar , The best feature of this hotel was how helpful and friendly the staff at the front desk were They answered any and all questions that we had I can t overstate how much we appreciated their help 
273769,Cram, having to request the handle of the balcony door each time I wanted to open or close Complete lack of storage space in room smallish rooms tiny balcony small pool, getting fed up with booking com reviews of hotels They only paint a good image of each hotel and not the true story It seems that the prime function of booking com is to represent the hotels interests and not that of the consumer The hotel is a four star hotel but in truth it is only an average 3 star Its saving grace was the excellent friendly staff
273770,Cram, Rooms are a bit tired Technical solutions in the room were very modern when they were made and even now they look unusual however it can be clearly seen that the room have served quite a lot of guests Prices could be more friendly , Nice location personnel room view Equipment in the room is interesting Lobby bar and floors interior look bright and welcoming 
273771,Cram, The Wifi had a minor issue at the very beginning of our stay but it was cleared up very quickly by the staff That was basically the only thing that we had trouble with , Amazing hotel great location very friendly polite and helpful staff clean brilliant facilities and a warm comfortable yet slick and sexy feel to the place I loved it 
273772,Cram, 4 star hotel You expect certain items included in the price There wasn t any kettle tea or coffee included in room Nor was there any bottled water Unless you take from the mini bar 1 60 per small bottle Hotel is really nice although is starting to look worn in areas however nothing major rooms great and staff excellent Pool would have been much better if heated as no one could use it due to it been far to cold Heaters on the Roof Top Terence would have been a great touch and made the evenings more enjoyable while relaxing before heading out went last July and the evenings were warm so it was noticeable then however May the evenings was still rather chilly , Rooms great shower excellent bathrooms nice clean and tidy throughout the hotel roof top Terence great with excellent views over Barcelona Staff excellent and friendly Great location Check in and check out again quick and easy 
273773,Cram, Only one little fault your pillows are not very comfortable and maybe the see through doors in the bathroom could be uncomfortable for some people, Just back from my trip couldnt recommend ye highly enough we had a great time lovely hotel very helpful staff and lovely city we will be back 
273774,Cram, the control panel of the air conditioner in the room is annoying It was making big noise during the evening and woke us up for several times , great location 10 mins walk to casa batllo and 20 mins to placa de catalunya 
273775,Cram, The bad smell from the toilet goes inside the room which i did not like at all You need to walk 10 to 15 minutes until you reach the Catalonia , The closed balcony inside the room was good and the terrace upstair was also nice 
273776,Cram, The safe in the room was completely useless as it was easy to pick up and take away It must be fixed securely to be of any benefit Toilet paper was dreadful too thin and narrow Air conditioning clicked so had to be turned off at night because of the noise , Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable room and bed Good bathroom 
273777,Cram, Noise from the street which can t be helped If u don t like traffic don t visit a city Bathroom was a little dusty in places but it was clean overall , Beautiful room great balcony Spacious for being just a double Great friendly staff as ever Didn t use any facilities The bar make fabulous cocktails really nice to sit in the bar and relax Very welcoming and well situated close to everything

273785,Cram, Like many good hotels in Barcelona the level of street noise in the room is very high even with windows closed For those who are not used to it gets hard to have a good night of sleep In addition pay over 100 Euros and have no breakfast included is certainly a down point , Excellent Location modern hotel style cleanlinesses
