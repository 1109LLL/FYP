185602,41, There wasn t a thing that we didn t like , Its central proximity close to all services and restaurants The staff were amazing the best anywhere in the world More than stars Complimentary treats from pantry and a wonderful breakfast best scrambled eggs ever had We will be back 
185603,41,No Negative, Great location walking distance to many tourist spots Staff are friendly helpful and discreet Rooms are spacious in London standard Decor is mainly traditional British style with a slight modern touch for comfort 
185604,41, Details of room Hard to get to plugs shower is like a flood on your head The staff should stay in the hotel rooms for a few nights to see how they could improve the rooms Desk chair legs are old won t move you trip over them Light bulbs out very old blow dryers for hair Small details I m only noting because they say they re a 5 star hotel Feels like less Did not like the hotel being so small Hotel is actually only on one floor The 5th floor NO real lobby or bar area Breakfast lunch dinner cocktails all served in executive lounge Small narrow halls to rooms Overall a bad value for the Will probably try a different hotel next time , Excellent location Attentive courteous staff 
185605,41, Minimal wifi in the bedroom , Amazing attention to detail Our stay was made special Food was 5 friendly helps full staff that can t do enough to help you 
185606,41,No Negative, It was perfectly set up for business or pleasure The staff were superb helpful resourceful and friendly It seemed as if everyone who stayed was made to feel welcome and special 
185607,41,No Negative, This was our second visit here in a year It is a small hotel in a great location very luxurious and has everything we enjoy in a hotel Some nice extra touches and the staff are just brilliant and that makes it an extra special place to visit
185608,41, nothing at all, If you stay in London stay at Hotel 41 from the greeting of complimentary champagne to the honesty bar snack bar there is everything you could every want here The staff knew your name and engaged in all conversation at every opportunity We loved this hotel just wish it was a little cheaper and we could stay longer The bottles of water snacks and hot chocolate by the front door was a simple but excellent little touch 
185609,41, Nothing everything about the hotel is exceptional, The staff are so friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble they remember you by name which is a personal touch and one you do not get with a larger establishment The hotel itself is beautifully furnished with lots of extra features that make it memorable the Pantry and Ice cream that you can help yourself to and the honesty bar make a very homely and relaxed feel The breakfast was excellent and the bedrooms are beautifully decorated and spacious by London standards 
185610,41, Flawless, Once stepped into hotel porter receptionists all wearing smiling faces though it s early as 6am Offered breakfast at executive lounge standby room for taking rest leaving luggage as room not yet ready so early Both waitresses serving breakfast are lovely and attentive Delicious BF crispy crossaint Complimentary drinks snacks ice cream at lounge Everyday tips for travel next day Impressed by excellent service 
185611,41, Only stayed one night not long enough , Excellent hotel with superb and very friendly staff The concept of a executive lounge with this level of service is very well thought out and a pointer for returning 
185612,41,No Negative, The executive lounge and snacks provided were amazing The staff were extremely lovely more helpful and warm that any hotel staff I ve ever encountered They went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable despite my early check in providing a temporary room till mine was ready So impressed Even though they don t have an onsite gym they give the option of giving you an excercise bike yoga Dvd mat 
185613,41, The king mattress we had was firmer than we would like and we typically purchase mattresses rated as firm rather than plush , Staff was exceptionally accommodating The complimentary snacks in the afternoons and evenings are of excellent quality Buffet breakfast fee was delicious and worth the expense The location was also very convenient to the Underground Victoria Station 2 blocks We happened to have stayed at the Ritz Hotel in London during our trip and think the overall facilities and services included at Hotel 41 make it the better choice 
185614,41, We really could not think of anything we did not like , Could not say more about the staff They were pleasant and hard working tending to our every need The extras were terrific even a lit candle at the sink instead of a night light They remembered what drink you liked after the first time We will spread the word Definitely be back Perfect place to stay Small boutique and quiet 
185615,41, Leaving , Everything Best hotel and staff ever They are attentive and accommodating Wonderful place to stay if you are in London We absolutely loved everything about the hotel and wonderful staff Food was fantastic and rooms were cozy comfortable clean and well appointed 
185616,41,No Negative, I planned a quick trip to London to celebrate my 50th birthday and my daughter s golden birthday In order to make the trip seamless so that I could hit the ground running since it was such a short stay I contacted guest services a month in advance Marlen was exemplar and superior She facilitated all of my theater plans tour plans and transport needs I valued her effort to assist with the planning of the trip just as much or even more than the stay Upon arrival I had a fiftieth birthday cake and a personalized card When in a pinch Lauren arranged for some of my shopping needs to be met while I was out on a tour Lauren went the extra mile The wait staff was unusually kind and made us feel like guests in their homes 
185617,41, There was no knowledgeable concierge Each person assigned that position for the day looked on the Internet for the information I could have been the concierge as I knew more than the staff I got incorrect opening information which could have sent me out 2 hours early before Fortnums opened Luckily I waited and went to a museum instead on a Sunday morning This is called a luxury hotel You pull up to the hotel in a taxi and nobody opens the taxi door and if somebody is on the phone you must wait for the front hotel door to open as they are involved in conversation Sometimes the staff from the Rubin s comes out and opens your taxi door You also don t know when you have to pay for a cup of tea and when it is included as there is an abundance of free food almost all day long I admit my comments were listened to and this situation may be amended by now Never have I had someone personally listen to my comments as they did here and that is really noteworthy , There is a lovely champagne greeting There is food available most of the day for munching and the staff is always smiling and ready to help 
185618,41, 1 I had been introduced to some benefits that were not clear such as complementary access to food and beverages in the executive lounge Although they said it was free I was astonished that they charged everything to my bill 2 there are NO Arabic TV channels in the room , I felt just at home
185619,41, The only problem we had was our taxi driver He didn t know where the 41 Hotel was and went around the block four times The 41 said they hear that a lot Taxi drivers need to find out where one of the best hotels in London is located , We loved the hotel from the minute we arrived The young people on staff were professional and a delight They made us feel like family We were always greeted with a smile and great respect A wonderful home away from home 
185620,41, The price is high of course but you absolutely get what you pay for This place is amazing , This place is just top of the line in all areas The staff is incredibly welcoming and ready to take care of your every need The rooms are very nice and the beds are exceedingly comfortable The location is also perfect being so close to Victoria Station I have zero complaints about Hotel 41 We will most definitely be back 
185621,41, A minor issue is the check in desk not affording any privacy should you require it Not an issue for us but it could be for others , A wonderful boutique hotel in on the doorstep on Buckingham Palace The staff are friendly and interested and will do anything they can to assist you and make your stay more pleasant The all day buffet of sweets snacks and ice cream by day and hot and cold dishes by night is a delightful touch and the champagne trolley on check in is second to none The atmosphere is perfect Relaxing quiet and comfortable and my family loved it I won t dream of staying anywhere else when I visit the capital from now on 
185622,41, Perhaps things like coffee could be complimentary for guests and maybe a house wine perhaps considering the prices for the rooms , The staff really were excellent and the food that we did have was good nice touches with the complimentary bits on offer throughout the day
185623,41, That we had to leave , Beautiful hotel gorgeous decor but what makes the hotel superior is the staff We cannot say enough about how welcoming helpful and sincere each employee we made contact with was 
185624,41, nothing could have been done better , superb everything from the moment you walk in there is an evening turn down service so that when you return in the early evening from your sight seeing the fire place is turned on classical music is playing there are treats on your bed to snack on and there is a hot water bottle in your bed to warm it up before you turn in You do feel like royalty 
185625,41, nothing could have been better It was the best stay ever , It was like being transported back into history and being treated like royalty Everything you could have wanted was waiting for you at Hotel 41 comfort food ambience 
185626,41, Nothing could possibly have been better , This was a stay for my mother s 85th birthday and she stayed for two nights with her best friend The attention to detail the friendliness of staff and the facilities were wonderful The whole of my family is wanting to find an excuse to go now 
185627,41,No Negative, This is the most divine hotel we have stayed in The staff were incredibly attentive and we were made to feel like we were the only people there Fantastic location and worth the money We will definitely stay here again 
185628,41, Having stayed at many top hotels in London overall found this hotel a disappoint for all the rave reviews Room was very poor dark basic and the TV was really far away awkward angle from bed Also not given any sweets complimentary snacks like the description suggested No one informed us breakfast was complementary Also room service ordered was cold and croutons stale , Staff very good on arrival Made to feel very welcome The lobby area was very nice 
185629,41, Absolutely nothing my stay at Hotel 41 was simply perfect and wonderful, This hotel is a fabulous hotel The staff are wonderful and so friendly and can t do enough to make your stay perfect The attention to detail throughout the hotel is exceptional I have stayed in several 5 star hotels in the past but Hotel 41 is he best As it is a small hotel it is just intimate and a wonderful place to stay and relax The plunder pantry is topped up throughout the day with lots of goodies and also adds something special I can not recommend this Hotel enough I will definitely stay again without a doubt If you choose this hotel you will not be disappointed I promise you 
185630,41, Lack of view from room Although probably not possible given the location , Excellent service They consistently over delivered beyond our expectations The atmosphere in the lounge was very relaxing Would recommend to everyone 
185631,41,No Negative, If you are seeking a unique intimate experience with impeccable service this is the hotel for you A world away from your large impersonal hotels there is a very special tranquil feel to Hotel 41 We will be back
185632,41,No Negative, Everything The staff could not do enough for you Very polite and ready to be at your service whenever The staff made my husbands birthday extra special Thank you for all the extra touches

185635,41, The view from our room was awful We didn t sleep due to constant noise , Staff were friendly nothing was too much trouble There was an abundance of complimentary champagne Lots of nice touches such as candles and music playing when we returned after a night out 
185636,41,No Negative, Everything about our stay at Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations The staff was wonderful and very helpful We felt like royalty during our week at the hotel and will definitely continue to tell everyone about this hotel 
185637,41, Squeaky floor boards but that was a minor in comparison to everything else , We loved that it felt like at home Very relaxed and it had everything that you would need The complimentary food that little extra touch that made the whole experience a delight
