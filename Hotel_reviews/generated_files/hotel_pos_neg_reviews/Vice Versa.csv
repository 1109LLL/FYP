106081,Vice Versa,No Negative, Nice but very small room In my personal opinion it was 3 not 4 hotel I don t see any particular reason to score it so high Nevertheless very nice place for couples 
106082,Vice Versa, IT is simply the worst hotel ever Had to check out after a few hours On top of that was charged at the hotel as well as via booking com I want a refund The manager gave me a mouth full and told I was an idiot etc etc No ONE should say anything wrong about his hotel he said I was lost for words Checked in a Four Seasons afterwards Only reason for booking the hotel was that it was close to the Expo I was attending What a Cardinal mistake ,No Positive
106083,Vice Versa, The room allocated to us was very small , The wifi facility was good The theme of the hotel was amazing The honesty bar was nice and good set up The staff was really helpful and nice
106084,Vice Versa, Could have been cleaner on arrival room was much smaller than the photos suggested very expensive for what you get room service mini bar massively over priced, Comfy bed good size bathroom and shower good standard of housekeeping
106085,Vice Versa, Bad services particularly by night as the concierge was very rude and unhelpful rooms are very small and not comfortable the kinky decoration is ok but doesn t present any interest very bad hotel and bad experience overall, Nothing great here bad hotel and way too expensive for what you get

106090,Vice Versa, Prior to arriving I emailed the hotel twice to confirm that I had booked a twin room which they replied yes However after checking into the place we found that this was not the case and the room was so small you could not actually move the beds apart or walk around the room The staff subsequently could not relocate my friend and I to another room due to the hotel being full The shower was dimly lit and with close inspection you could see mold that could easily be removed if cleaned properly Under the bed looked as if it had not been cleared for the past 5 years They could also do with spending of money on new pillows Thought the copies and money notes glued to the ceiling was really tacky along with the red light in shower My colleague commented that it looked more like a room you d book by the hour than the night We both felt completely flogged off and would have changed hotels if I could have found another local hotel with a vacant room Have no idea how this place got its 4 stars ,No Positive
