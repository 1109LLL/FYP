143975,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, As above Breakfast was included in the price , Unfortunately we were not able to have any breakfast as we were catching the Eurostar and had to be at St Pancras by 6 30 am The front desk tried to be helpful and hoped that we could be given a croissant etc if we went to the kitchen any time after 6am This we did but all we were given was a packet of Fruit and Nut Cereal and Alpen each Not a lot of use without milk 
143976,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, the stench in the breakfast room the mouldy smell and dirty carpets in room, space room size and helpful staff offered me an extra bed without further charge 
143977,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Understand that space at a premium but bathroom very small for family of 4 , Clean and very comfortable beds Well equipped kitchenette Very convenient for Eurostar 
143978,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Expensive but we needed to be close to the train station , Location location location Close to trains restaurants shopping Staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to help out with our extreme early checkout so that we can get something to eat before leaving at 6am Just pricey for one night but again cant beat the location cleanliness and hospitality 
143979,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, breakfast could have been better and more varied, beds v comfy aircon good v clean booked for access to trains which is excellent breakfast OK Has good TV wifi etc we booked a suite which is great for sharing and has the kitchen Will keep using 
143980,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The bathroom had draining issues slight water coming up though the tiles I believe they are trying to fix but would have liked to be advised on check in When I told the front desk staff he said I know , Convenience location comfortable beds our room was a great size for the 3 of us Good kitchenette Great simple Breakfast was all you need toast cereal yoghurt pasteries juice and coffee 
143981,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, We were beautifully looked after and nearby building works did not cause us any noise or inconvenience , The hotel is very very convenient to bus and trains with plenty of places to eat but if looking for good pub food the Skinners Arms in Judd Street recommended and basic pub food at McGlynns just around the corner in Whidborne Street with a lot less hassle and cigarette smoke The counter staff and kitchen staff were friendly and helpful and both times we stayed our rooms may have been a little unusual this is an old building but they were very comfortable and quiet and they have a LIFT We travelled by cab if unsure of direction but the buses generally were easy to follow The tube is good once you know your way around and the direction you want to travel A great address from which to explore London 
143982,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The room for the parents does not have ventilation natural light and it is terrible for somebody who suffers claustrophoby , The design of the room is perfect for a family 
143983,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras,No Negative, Staff at reception super friendly and helpful Small breakfast room which was superbly clean Room was a great size with nice facilities Bathroom a little on the cozy side Nice that there was a c and a separate double bedroom attached to the main triple bedroom 
143984,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, directions to get there i am always lost to know what direction to leave underground stations to find my way , location close to kingscross pancreas stations little English pub aprox 100m up the street to the right with excellent home cooked cheap food etc 
143985,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Nothing , Fantastic location in terms of accessibility to St Pancras station Within walking distance 15 minutes of UCL Great sized room contained 2 single beds and a double Microwave fridge iron ironing board hairdryer all provided Good selection of continental breakfast choices 
143986,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, A full english breakfast as a selection and orange juice was not available , The room itself was so spacious I didn t expect a double bed and 2 singles The staff in reception were excellent Very clean and tidy Great selection at breakfast Good value for money Excellent location Will definitely stay here again 
143987,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, There is another comfort inn a few blocks away this can be a bit confusing for cab Drivers and tired visitors Not the most attractive area for a long London stay The elevator stop one floor down from our room top floor but staff very kindly helped with bags I just wish hotels in London where a bit cheaper as I could come more often , This hotel was perfect for a short stay in London that involves taking the Eurostar and traveling with people that want a sure level of comfort and no surprises We 3 adults certainly appreciated the big triple room No one had to share a bed or sleep on a convertible sofa And There was space Not beds squished together Room was also very clean and all the staff attentive and pleasant Having a good breakfast included was a real plus I find every thing in london expensive so I did feel that value for money was pretty good Being close to kings cross and saving the sweat of haulingbags long distances and the stress of catching trains on time due to trafic was worth the cost 
143988,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Thought it was a horrible room as it was below street level so no windows Also thought advertised picture of room accommodation misleading as picture was really of the breakfast area No microwave even though this was an advertised part of the accommodation They were unable to provide a microwave which meant the kitchenette was not very useful The price of the accommodation was a bit expensive , Location only 
143989,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Suite I had was on basement level ie down 1 from reception round corner from kitchen Had a window but view only to little area below ground level , Location was primary selection criteria and was perfect from that point very short and flat walk from St Pancras Kings Cross Stations Building is an old terrace very nicely modernised modern fit out good sized lift excellent facilities in room inc kitchen which would be excellent if staying several days Bright clean kitchen and good continental breakfast Don t know if all rooms the same but booking was for double suite which ended up coming with double bed and 2 singles when all I needed was a double bed given primacy of location in selection and space quality of fitout didn t matter 
143990,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Poor Wifi in bedroom , Very conveniently situated 3 minutes walk from St Pancras station Met the expectation I had when I booked Nice staff good value for money Quiet comfortable clean 
143991,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, There was really nothing we did not like except the fact our room was in the basement and a little claustrophobic for me This was a minor thing , Proximity to kings cross station is great Easily found Good breakfast in the morning
143992,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, It is just tiny Reception was tiny Lift was tiny Room was tiny Toilet was tiny But it was clean and the right price for a one night visit , In all fairness this was booked solely for its location near St Pancras train station for ease of train travel the next day It was a place to sleep It met that expectation 
143993,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Family room on the top floor elevator stopped the floor below We had significant luggage and it was awkward to bag drag after the elevator only one floor but just a quirk of the layout , Excellent Value for the money Family room accommodated 3 adults nicely Easy location near Kings Cross Tube station Very clean 
143994,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Room was quite small and bathroom was very small but shower was a decent size The bed was a double and not very comfortable didn t sleep that well for all of the 3 nights , Extra sink fridge in room microwave and tea and coffee facilities
143995,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, We booked a double suite expecting this to be a double bed extra seating relaxation space A double suite turned out to be two bedrooms only limited seating a small dining table chairs for 4 people , Close proximity to Kings Cross easy to find
143996,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The water pressure of the taps and shower was poor , Modern feel in an old building comfortable beds Black out curtains and blinds air con tv in both rooms kitchen area with microwave 
143997,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Generally People on footpaths smoking and in doorways you have to go through on way to buus n tube , Great staff Convenient to transport dining You do need to under stand direction for travel on bus n tube We are aussies n made a couple of mistakes but all part of our stay When used to travelling by car it takes time on buses n trains but you see more 
143998,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Small rooms and tiny bathroom Too pricey for the room size , Stayed one night because it was a location close to the train station We came in from Paris and left for Heathrow the next morning The rooms and bathrooms are small The continental breakfast was good and convenient 
143999,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Probably more variety for breakfast , The apartment is located really near the underground station Reception counter was also really friendly and shared about interesting places to visit Overall a good experience 
144000,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, We would prefer the upstairs room that was more spacious and looked out to street the groundfloor room was noisy as it opened onto reception and was and was smaller than upstairs, great position to catch Eurostar and handy to tube station and easy eating places around the staff were very helpful and pleasant at all times would recommend this hotel
144001,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, many of the USB plugs were broken the shower drain was pretty clogged so the water didn t drain properly ankle deep on one day the cleaning staff left a totally dirty towel they used for cleaning on the floor in the kitchen area , the room was a good size the staff were kind and helpful Location was perfect 
144002,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, the breakfast sucks I would have expected an english breakfast Insted there was bread and butter WITH NO HAM or SALAMI Some bananas milk This is NOT a real breakfast IT s a JOKE VERY VERY POOR Everything else was excellent , The staff was super friendly And professional No noise perfect for resting 
144003,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, We had booked a suite which we understood would have 2 rooms 1 with a bed and the other with a couch es We needed the extra room as we were traveling with a small child so we would have space for the crib and playing The room came with 2 large beds in each room and one single bed in the larger room The beds essentially filled the room so we were just able to squeeze the crib in between one of the beds and the walls There was very little space to move around I had read reviews prior to staying that people had difficulty with a suitcase and can definitely see how this would be an issue with a single room The room was located right off the foyer so we could hear louder guests but this was easily remedied by closing the fire doors between our room and the entry way , The location was convenient just a few minutes from the train station The room was clean enough and front desk staff was friendly It is a great hotel to stay in if you only need a place to stay and will spend the day out The breakfast is free and was ok It was convenient to go downstairs and get a cup of coffee or toast before starting the day If I hadn t been traveling with a small child my rating would be higher 
144004,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, N A, I missed breakfast as I was bit unwell with tummy upset The bed is comfortable The kitchen is useful with small fridge for us to bring some foods 
144005,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Having a reliable internet connection is the most important thing for business trips I had to go to my office at 11PM in the night given the WiFi just didn t work all through my stay And the staff just didn t seem to be taking my request seriously Won t recommend again ,No Positive

144010,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Some rooms are a bit noisy especially if close to the reception Breakfast could be a bit richer , Amazing position just few steps out of King s Cross train and Underground station Extremely cleaned rooms very good free WiFi Kind staff 
144011,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, not much actually maybe the stair to the upper floor not a problem for us but if you have big luggage isn t the best , The staff were really nice and helpful room are clean and with enough space for the 3 of us Breakfast was good and again staff very nice i will surely return to this hotel It is close to underground and train station just perfect 
144012,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Breakfast selection was limited good for wheat eaters and non dieters Suite 6 is very small with a smallish bed would be fine for single occupant travelling light No space for a chair in the room not much space for luggage Other suites are bigger Slept ok but woke with a sore back Rudely awakened at 6am on a Sunday morning by very loud TV in our room I guess the time was set by the previous occupant but didn t see any info about setting alarm on TV , Nice to have minikitchen fridge and microwave Decent quality crockery and cutlery Pleasant staff Breakfast pastries looked good Good location for Kings Cross St Pancras which has a mall and great restaurants if pricey

144014,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, My suite was located just next to reception and I could hear every customer and every sound from any device This meant that I slept very badly during the whole stay The staff were kind enough to try to locate me to a different room but because the hotel was full it was not possible , The staff 
144015,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Damp room with a clear smell of mildew mind you my room was in the basement but otherwise it was clean Very thin walls and the internet was spotty I had some uncommonly loud neighbors that broke the rules and smoked in the hallways who did not make the stay restful but I cannot blame that on the hotel , Staff was very friendly and accommodating
144016,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Heating was off room was cold and once the staff got the radiators working it took about an hour to heat up No lift to the top floor awkward with suitcase up narrow stairs, Room clean and well laid out 
144017,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Lacked a settee but I used the bed to sit on watch TV do work, Excellent Location only a few minutes walk from Kings Cross Station approx 7 minutes from Euston Station Ideal if using underground to travel around London Rooms clean comfortable There is no living room area had 2 bedrooms kitchen area Would use again due to location

144019,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The room was advertised as self catering but there was only a small microwave kettle and sink in the kitchen area I was expecting at least one hob ring and one saucepan There were no bowls etc for heating food in the microwave only two small cereal type bowls and two small plates Everything else was excellent although best get down to the breakfast room early before all the nice things go , Comfortable bed Clean towels provided daily Room was reasonably well insulated against noise from the rooms above and below when compared with some others that I have stayed in The staff were very friendly and helpful especially the young lady who manages the reception The room was nice and warm early February and there was a thermostat in the room so the temperature could be increased or reduced as required There were loads of channels available on the TV The bed headboard had excellent reading lights built into it 
144020,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Nothing, Just flown in from America and very tired Staff were very welcoming and helpful Room was a good size and toasty warm on a cold February evening Slept like a log room was really quiet as hotel is down a side street away from London noise Breakfast was a good continental and as much as you wanted Kings Cross station was at the end of the road so no need for taxis Brilliant 
144021,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Overrated and overpriced This should be in the category budget hotel I was told that my room was upgraded but I was put in a basement small room with no window I asked to change it Carpet in the room old looking dirty Lift not reaching the last floor 2ramps of narrow stairs ok with no luggage Breakfast very poor , Location

144023,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The air in the room was really stuffy not best for the people with asthma The air conditioning was really difficult to use so the temperature changed a lot in the room Some employees seemed a little confused about our questions and we had difficulties to get answers Some were really helpful for example with the air conditioning , Breakfast was ok We were really pleased that we could take breakfast with us when we had to leave before it began 
144024,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The shower toilet was off of one of the bedrooms so the person sleeping in the other room could not visit the loo without going through the other bedroom Fine for us but may cause a problem for others The grill function on the microwave is abysmal so kitchen facilities really only suited for simple tea coffee and warming up a ready meal etc , Close to Kings Cross St Pancras Nice clean apartment room Had a mini fridge combination microwave kettle and cutlery crockery There was not a full kitchen setup like other apartment rooms this was just a kitchen area as part of one of the bedrooms Please note there s no proper oven or grill Seemed to be in a nice street despite people warning me that Kings cross can be a little bit dodgy

144071,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, The so called breakfast concists exclusively of cereals long lasting fabric bakery and plastic wrapped cheese and marmelade All is ok but the personal touch lacks completely Even the avilable eggs are green coocked I would suggest to invest a little bit more to this part of the service This is not about costs rather it is about interests and skills , Small well located and recently renovated hotel Simple facilities

144074,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, We were told that someone would be on reception all night but when we got back to the hotel at 2 30 it took a lot of banging on the door and calling the hotel to get someone to let us in Maybe just unlucky as there was a guy there but just not at the desk Also the suite was nice and really clean but it was meant for 4 of us and would have been cramped if we had all been there , The guy on reception was really friendly and helpful we had a good laugh with him And the Hotel is literally just outside Kings Cross Station so great location if you are travelling to from there 
144075,Comfort Inn Suites Kings Cross St Pancras, Firstly we arrived outside the hotel with 2 young children age 6 4 our youngest being austistic we were locked outside of the B B no one was at the reception and we were locked outside for over half hour no one answered the door or phone which made us increasingly upset as we didn t have anywhere to go and had to battle with our children and loads of baggage as they tried to run towards the road When someone finally arrived to let us in as apparently she was elsewhere at a sister hotel and left this accommodation un attended We were then put in the basement which was awful It was small and did not appear to have an adequate fire escape Our window handle was broken and led to a disgusting area which there was no way we could have escaped from the the even of fire and the fire door outside our room was also locked with a combination lock which we had no details for In addition the fridge in our room was filled with someone else s half eaten food which was disgusting and there was only 1 towel for all 4 of us in a family room to share when showing We tried to complain to 2 members of staff who said they could not help us and would get a manger to call us but until now they have now This hotel is a disgrace and should not be advertised on booking com When we complained they had the cheek to offer us 25 old our next stay with them As if we would ever stay in the hell hole again We would STRONGLY URGE anyone reading this to book ELESWHERE there are some lovely budget B B s in the area such as premier and some other guest houses on the same street DO NOT STAY in a place which treats its customers like animals Awful disgrace and will now be reported to trading standards , Absolutely nothing rude arrogant people who run a complete dive should be shut down
