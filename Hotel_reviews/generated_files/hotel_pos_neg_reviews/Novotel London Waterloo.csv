36359,Novotel London Waterloo, Parking very expensive 24 per night plus congestion charges around 11 50 a day So be careful if renting car Weekends no congestion charges or if you drive back after 6 pm , Best location kids are welcome Nice breakfast n good staff Bus stop just in front 
36360,Novotel London Waterloo, The property was nice and comfortable However being a 4 star hotel there was no concierge facilty which was a big disappointment , Location n cleanliness 
36361,Novotel London Waterloo, I can t say that there was anything that I didn t like The premises is positioned fantastically for access to all of the attractions that London has to offer and is also very close to all public transport facilities for those attractions that aren t so close by , The staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful to deal with 
36362,Novotel London Waterloo, Where do we start Very disappointed after staying here a few years ago Staff had no idea when asked about London twice sent us on a wild goose chase to nowhere They all seemed to be from europe had no idea about london Keys to room deactivated every night staff kept blaming us when they worked all day other guests had same problem Rooms were extremely ordinary for the price The pillows were disgusting they were all so old i would have put them in my dog kennels at home they were that bad We stayed for 5 nights requested new one s but they were just as bad Hotel is very tired for the price Only good thing about this hotel is the location but stay around the corner google it as there is a better hotel overlooking the river around the corner worth paying an extra few dollars , Location
36363,Novotel London Waterloo, Had to go down to reception when got back to room as no replacement milk tea from room maid , Rooms comfortable and large Toilet liked that it was separate but was very difficult to fit in due to the door too close to the toilet 
36364,Novotel London Waterloo, Tiny 375ml water bottle charged at 2 75 pounds , Room has view of Big Ben and London Eye Short walk to Thames and Westminster area Close to Waterloo station 
36365,Novotel London Waterloo, Breakfast was really poor like in most hotels in UK It was very limited choice and ingredients were of very poor quality i e scrambled eggs from powder not eggs,No Positive
36366,Novotel London Waterloo, The breakfast is expensive we went to an excellent cafe on the corner of Hercules Road take a right after leaving hotel cross the road and a 3 minute walk brings you to the cafe with roadside dining breakfast 5 , Very central location right beside the Thames and near all the sights e g Westminister etc From Victoria Station the 507 bus from Victoria terminus brings you to within 100 m of hotel The rooms were big and an excellent shower
36367,Novotel London Waterloo, No slippers provided even if you request and the bathrooms For my room the toilet seat and shower are in two separate washrooms So to wash your hands after using the toilet you have to come out and go to the other bathroom For me this was very inconvenient and unhygienic Added to this they were very small and there s not enough hooks to keep your clothes , The rooms were very clean the staff was friendly and the breakfast rate was very reasonable The location is a 10min walk away from London Eye and other key monuments
36368,Novotel London Waterloo, very highly priced for the quality of room and service they are way understaff checking in the hotel took 2 hours any room service will be charged at pound 5 or we have to do self service air conditioner not working and cleaned , good size room and nice extra bed for the kids which was comfortable
36369,Novotel London Waterloo, Very basic room Sofa bed was boney hard and springy to sleep on Very uncomfortable not worth the value of the price charged Room key doesn t work Slow service very inconvenient and time consuming , Good selections of breakfast Friendly staff but forget to serve our orders 
36370,Novotel London Waterloo, Renovations on hotel were so loud After a 20hr flight we just wanted to sleep but couldn t with the work going on When we complained they did offer us free breakfast though but would ve been nice to know about renovations, Great location easy to walk to main loavtions
36371,Novotel London Waterloo, the new bathroom facilities in the room when travelling with friends or family having the all glass walls were uncomfortable upon check in I was told we have you in a beautiful renovated room with a view of the London Eye yes newly renovated but our view of the London eye was less then a quarter of the attraction over the top of roofs best seen at night when it was lit this was disappointing especially after being told i would have a view when i checked in , clean modern excellent breakfast very helpful and friendly staff 
36372,Novotel London Waterloo, Was stopped after breakfast on my way to lift and asked how I wanted to pay It was a little embarrassing in front of other guests as I had paid in advance for two nights accommodation including breakfast when checking in , Comfortabl bed got good nights sleep 
36373,Novotel London Waterloo, It is the first hotel as have ever stayed in that did not ask for any form of ID other than verbally giving name on arrival It was more like an airline check in or a bank enquiry at a branch experience , Room was quite spacious It had plenty of power points to charge the essentials USB ports by the bed were a bonus Location is relative It was the most reasonably priced hotel near the Trafalgar tour office for an early morning departure 20 min 25 minute walk with luggage 5 minutes by car taxi 
36374,Novotel London Waterloo, No satisfying places to eat nearby , The rooms looked new because of the recent renovation Wifi speed was good Location is a good choice not too far yet not too near for tourists Easy to call cabs 
36375,Novotel London Waterloo, The first room I was given was totally unacceptable The note left in the room which said please be understanding we are doing renovations was not helpful when you have especially chosen your hotel expecting it to be the same standard as the one in Auckland I m sorry to say but it looked tired old and very uninviting , Felt safe and comfortable as I was travelling alone Great location easy walking to where I wanted to go Staff were helpful when I was disappointed with my first room and quickly changed me to a much superior room on Floor 5 modern and clean very much the same as the one I had at Novatel Auckland NZ airport and had expected to have in London 
36376,Novotel London Waterloo,No Negative, Location was great Front desk staff friendly The house cleaning staff left something to be desired We stayed a week and I had to leave a note asking to get the room vacuumed Ran out of tissue twice I had a cold and leaving the empty box was not enough to get more I needed to go down to the front desk Both our cards kept demagnatizing despite the care we took to prevent this Same thing happened to our friends 
36377,Novotel London Waterloo, The first room we had was designated as a family room although the sink was right in the middle of it and the walk in shower was separated by partly transparent mirrored door without the possibility to leave your clothes inside so it was almost impossible to have a shower when the child is in the room We asked for a replacement and fortunately the staff were ready to help Everything was much better when we got a room with a decent bathroom , The Thames is 3 minutes walk from the hotel You can see Big Ben as soon as you turn round the first corner Fabulous view The bus stop is 30 meters away from the entrance so you can easily get to the center of the City 
36378,Novotel London Waterloo, Breakfast was great but could have been better if with variations daily Just a suggestion, Commending for the extra mile service given by your staff particulary when my daughter with special need sneaked out of our room and could not find her way back She was carefully handled by your staff on early morning duty of April 10 particularly by Eddy and his co worker Please send our sincerest appreciation to them Special mention to Eddy and companion April 10 and Alfonso Looking forward to staying in your hotel on our next visit Mrs Encarnacion
36379,Novotel London Waterloo, There were hairs in the bathroom NO BRUSH in the toilet in neither toilet they don t have as they said breakfast was lousy not clean all the time plates and food missing a mess in the service crew everybody helped the other one and nobody did his job,No Positive
36380,Novotel London Waterloo, The beds were hard as concrete and the receptionists need to stay behind the reception desk Being treated and made to check in standing around in the middle of the foyer is a stupid innovation , The breakfast and bar staff were great
36381,Novotel London Waterloo, Long wait for lifts Cooked breakfast could be better , Room comfortable Everything worked in the bathroom for once no leaks no problems with shower heads or drainage effective shower curtain Excellent 
36382,Novotel London Waterloo, Insufficient supply of toilet paper I wonder how much one can save on 2 rolls of toilet paper and a plastic cup at the rate of 200 per night One irritating thing was that the room offers NO possibility of hanging winter jackets outside of wardrobe or hanging wet towels bathrobes With 3 people in the room we were all the time at loss what to do with them , The hotel is localized within a short walk to London Eye and Westminster Bridge We had a lovely view of Archbishop s palace gardens The double rooms are big enough for 3 and the kids stay for free which is great The reception staff was always friendly and helpful thank you Sergio and colleagues the parking reasonably priced and the breakfast very good good choice and good service Any minor problem or complaint we had was immediately addressed I would definitely recommend this hotel 
36383,Novotel London Waterloo, I would have liked a better view we only saw a big building out from our room 537 , Food novotel hamburger and steak was excellent Bathroom and the bed was very good and comfortable The staff was very polite 
36384,Novotel London Waterloo, There wasnt anything i i didnt like , The Staff was very Friendly welcoming The Room was amazing and the Bed was so comfy We Wished we could of stayed more then one night had we not had plans 
36385,Novotel London Waterloo, The newly refurbished room was aethestically designed very well however much it was totally impractical The only mirror in the bedroom had been mounted in a corner so that my wife had to lean across the bed whenever she needed to use it In the bathroom the large basin was shallow and did not have a plug so that to use it you had to run the water constantly to perform any function Any mess created had to be cleaned up after finishing as otherwise it would have remained in the shallow basin The shower tray was also very shallow and when a few people have used the room any detritus in the form of hair etc build up in the drain will most certainly end up by the shower tray being flooded remember the room was brand new Hotel services guide nothing in room The room service was poor in that the room cleaning was ay best perfunctory with bed looking as if it was almost still unmade The size of the plastic bag in the room bin was too small so as soon as anything was dropped into it the bag collapsed Tea and coffee making would ve been fine except the few teas sugar and milk sachets were not replenished Although we asked for more the reception staff hand them out as if they were on ration My wife reported twice that the one bed side light was not working but was not fixed before we left Each of the two mornings we were informed that breakfast was not included in our booking I asked at reception and was informed that it was but on the second morning once again the restaurant manager said it was not included If I had been staying on business this could have been embarrassing When I went to settle the bill the helpful Duty Manager said that I owed 65 80 for the four breakfasts my wife and I had As you will see from your records I had already bothered to send an email asking to verify the booking included breakfast Fortunately your reply confirming this had just arrived before checking out , Breakfast was excellent Reception staff pleasant and helpful Bed was very comfortable
36386,Novotel London Waterloo, The bed was so hard my husband left in the middle of the night to another hotel The door keys kept stopping working frustrating when travelling with a baby The bathroom wall is glass why On arrival we were stopped in the middle of the lobby so they could check us in with a tablet Apparently this is supposed to be more intimate but is actually both impractical and annoying Had to change rooms because we were out next to a room that was being renovated , The burgers were very good 
36387,Novotel London Waterloo, Location is off the track but it didn t deter Little bit pricey considering location and lack of transportation means , Bed was very comfortable Wish I had it at home
36388,Novotel London Waterloo, nothing really , staff were extremely helpful and friendly location great for our meeting and just off the embankment which was lovely Lambeth palace as a view was an added bonus

36390,Novotel London Waterloo, layout to new rooms is very unfunctional makeup mirror for the ladies is set for a six footer mirrors in wrong places plug for hardryer in wrong place sink in middle of room is a joke as it it 1 deep with no plug Designed without a single woman on the team , shower

36395,Novotel London Waterloo, Little plastic milks Did ring down for a small jug of milk for own morning cup of tea but was brought more plastic milks Also my sister fell over on the mat at the front entrance door she was very hurt especially her right hand both elbows and knee It may have been the mat that caused her to fall and the staff took it straight up The mat may have been put down as it had been raining that day , Very polite and friendly staff Room was very modern and upto date and had everything we needed The sofa bed was very comfortable 
36396,Novotel London Waterloo, The bed and pillow were both very solid and not really of the standard I would expect in a 4 star The shower itself was good but there was hair left in the bath , The location is excellent just a short walk from both Waterloo and Westminster

36405,Novotel London Waterloo, The fridge in the room had crumbs of food in it plus kept giving electric shocks and did not keep drinks cold large shower head did not work, Room was a good size with a large double bed and a pull out sofa bed
36406,Novotel London Waterloo, Not just yet but in the near future the room needs some TLC tender loving care , The rooms were quiet considering so close into the city and the staff were very helpful 
36407,Novotel London Waterloo, fitcentrum is only after 18 until 22 by the special order breakfast good but poor, reception staff is very professional bus stop next to hotel close to bridge
36408,Novotel London Waterloo, ventilation was switched off during the night which resulted in waking me at 04 00 due to a very stuffy room Corridors very warm and stuffy During breakfast almost walked over by staff 3 times In their enthusiasm they didnt noticed customers walking with their plates Well meant with helping other guests although no eye for other guests walking around in the restaurant , location and friendliness of staff
36409,Novotel London Waterloo, The only thing I wouldn t recommend is purchasing the breakfast through the hotel While we did eat there one morning it is not worth 16 pounds per person You can get a better breakfast within a 8 min walk for half the price The breakfast buffet is really delicious but overpriced , I just loved everything about this hotel The location was perfect only a 10 minute walk to the London Eye The bar area was really nice and all the food was very good We had lunch there and I didn t think it was overpriced We frequented the bar and was too shocked by the prices there either The staff was super friendly and called for taxis whenever we needed

36421,Novotel London Waterloo, The so called Yorkshire pudding on the menu was over cooked and tough It may have been warmed up in a microwave which would have done this It had very little likeness to a true Yorkshire pudding , The staff were generally helpful and friendly but not pushy The hotel had an aura of tranquility within the busy city perhaps due to its proximity to the grounds of Lambeth Palace across the road 
36422,Novotel London Waterloo, needs to improved the place looks like dirty needs to repaint the whole place the carpet needs to be replaced the bathroom needs to be upgraded the staff who welcomed us was not that friendly and has a attitude, location is great 
36423,Novotel London Waterloo, Our room was booked for 3 people but the room was only set for 2 people sofa bed extremely uncomfortable it was not worth the money we Paid There also needs to be more selection for breakfast scrambled egg looked like paste We forgot to bring toothpaste and the hotel could not offer us any I would of thought a hotel and chain this size would have had some kind of kit for guests who are staying with them or at least some kind of vending machines like most hotels have where you can purchase anything you have forgotten,No Positive

36437,Novotel London Waterloo, Breakfast was ok but not international 4 star level also in relation to its price There was no toilet brush in my bathroom allegedly due to hygienics but for me it was disgusting Reception aera looks more like an open space office its design could be more welcoming and overseeable, Westminster is just around the corner in walking distance International reception staff from various EU countries how much longer after BREXIT There was always a taxi available in front of the hotel Some details of electronics equipment in room USB and other connections Free computers including printer in the foyer
36438,Novotel London Waterloo, The hair dryer didn t work I think the price of breakfast was costly even for London , The beds were very comfortable and we were very pleased with the size of the sofa bed The room was amazingly quiet We loved the location and walking along the Thames into the city 
36439,Novotel London Waterloo, Organisation at breakfast time Often no glasses bowls or small plates Very slow to offer tea or coffee and top ups also sometimes no milk on table Staff were very nice but didn t appear to have had much training in the ways of serving hot drinks often stretching across the table , All Staff were very nice and helpful from concierge through to cleaner

36444,Novotel London Waterloo, The first room we were given was awful we were three friends travelling and had booked a triple room The second bed was a sofa bed which was unusable the mattress was less than 2 inches thick and the springs could be felt through the duvet The only solution we were given was an offer of extra duvets until I asked to speak to the manager who then found a room change for us , The duty manager was extremely helpful and supportive and the breakfast receptionist was lovely 
36445,Novotel London Waterloo, The danger of theft is enough to put anyone off I was really shocked by the standard of security at novotel considering it is a four star hotel We placed all our valuables in our luggage and locked it before we left our room There was a safe in the room but we thought that our measures were enough this is novotel And our luggage is locked plus the door should have been securely locked as well When we came back we found our luggage zip broken and all the items inside thrown out with all our cash inside stolen We immediately notified the manager at the reception who sent a technician up to check the card access records on our door Both of them affirmed that burglaries are rather rare at the hotel and because of that they are inexperienced with dealing such things According to them there was nothing suspicious regarding the entry records and called for the police to handle the matter In fact when we met with the police the next day the officer in charge told us the exact opposite of what they said Apparently it was not the first time this has happened at this particular hotel many times in fact and they are investigating the issue seriously right now After going through the access records we found out that there was another card which did not belong to us which was used to enter the room According to the police there was a request for replacing for a lost card when we were not even in the hotel at that time It is outrageous to think that anyone can waltz up to the reception and ask for a replacement card so easily We are currently still corresponding with the police regarding this issue The hotel staff was rather cavalier about the whole issue No one came the day after the burglary to speak to us about it nor did they offer any further help we had to go to them ourselves to remind them we need to check out later due to the investigation We are not pleased with the manner the hotel handled this situation , Good location quiet rooms 
36446,Novotel London Waterloo, probably because of my late booking and short hotelroom supplies in the area but I found the cost out of proportion even to a regular London traveler , clean no thrills rich breakfast GBP 16 5

36452,Novotel London Waterloo, Poor service in the dinning room Gave up waiting to order for my sweet course for dinner in the evening and at breakfast at 6 30 very little food was out and nothing hot The second morning I was informed grumpily when I came down slightly later that breakfast was not being served until 7 00 There was no notification of this and the front desk seemed surprised Having stayed at Novotels in France as my preferred choice for many years on various trips I was surprised at this ,No Positive
36453,Novotel London Waterloo, Room was small for the price beds were uncomfortable bathroom was likewise small Carpet was lumpy felt like the floor was uneven , Breakfast and location were about the only things I can complement about this establishment There were plenty of breakfast items to choose from and they continuously filled empty trays Location was excellent walking distance to major attractions

36458,Novotel London Waterloo, As we were going to an evening concert the restaurant opening time of 6pm was a little late for us so an earlier time would have been helpful for us , We found the hotel to be very comfortable and relaxed with good facilities and very helpful and cheerful staff 
36459,Novotel London Waterloo, High chairs for the babies were a bit outdated and not very safe as they were on none lockable wheels No option to fit travel cot or bed guard to the beds , Lovely breakfast huge choice so suitable for all tastes We have used the same hotel for the last 4 years this was our first year of bringing along 3 under 2s staff were very friendly with them and very understanding 
36460,Novotel London Waterloo, Food on the dinner menu was disappointing Works started on the roof at midnight we were very surprised to have been given a room when the staff knew that work would be undertaken that night and that room would be affected No prior explanation was given This property seemed to lack overall management of operations , The location was excellent very practical for our plans The bed was comfortable and the breakfast buffet was very complete 
36461,Novotel London Waterloo, Room was too warm even with window open Compared to another hotel Premier Inn for example the value wasn t as good The breakfast was good although again quite pricey , Good location for where I needed to be Quiet enough at night 
36462,Novotel London Waterloo, The breakfast was very poor Inedible bacon rashers welded together and rock hard Sausages non descript Toast was chewy where it had clearly been kept warm for a long while Having looked forward to breakfast in my room and having paid 3 extra for the priviledge I was disappointed , Location suited me 
36463,Novotel London Waterloo, A more comfortable sofa bed would have been lovely , The friendliness of all staff and the relaxed atmosphere created by them The environmental efforts taken with the key cards etc The location and the quietness 
36464,Novotel London Waterloo, The shower head was all scaled up and the shower screen had a rubber missing and leaked all over the floor Also the window was not that good could quite clearly hear the road And they said been up graded to a room with a view that you normally have to pay for Luckily I did not as it was a back road,No Positive
36465,Novotel London Waterloo, Parking was expensive The only thing I would comment on is for the prices of the breakfast toast tea and coffee should be brought to you and not self service , On arrival we were checked in efficiently Really liked the hotel Room was clean and beds were comfortable 
36466,Novotel London Waterloo, not quite close to an underground station far from supermarkets and restaurants , clean and quiet room excellent breakfast fast and stable wifi connection friendly staff 
36467,Novotel London Waterloo, One of the elevators was not working so the remaining one was full and busy By the way the stairs case was not easy to find , Convenient location and super friendly staff 
36468,Novotel London Waterloo, room lay out was no easy with getting into bathroom and though the toilet was separate from the bath which was good then getting into bathroom after was a bit of a hassle and not hygienic , comfy beds no sounds from outside despite being central london well situated able to book in 2pm and leave before 12 am
36469,Novotel London Waterloo,No Negative, The atmosphere in the hotel was calm and friendly the staff without exception were outstanding their customer service was excellent they were so professional The food and the atmosphere in the bar and dining area was lovely We will return 
36470,Novotel London Waterloo, We were happy with everything so for us it was perfect nothing we didn t like , The kids section is small But extremely useful for small children The staff were more than helpful 
36471,Novotel London Waterloo, The price of the breakfast if not included in room price is very expensive approx 50 00 for 3 It was not possible to have just a light breakfast for less The room was at times excessively hot and could not get the air conditioning system to work Finally the booking detailed a double sofa bed but the bed was actually a very narrow single this needs to be clearly stated in the room description , The location of hotel was brilliant as was the view from the room The interior of bar and restaurant stylish but very relaxed and the staff were very approachable and friendly 
36472,Novotel London Waterloo, Train stations were further The view of the room was not nice Had view of old dirty roof of other buildings , Location was in the area which we needed Bus close by
36473,Novotel London Waterloo, the decorating in the rooms very poor colour paint splashed on to the white paint looks like a person with a roller did it as quick as possible tv signal very poor flashing and loosing pic seats in bar really uncomfortable very modern but with no backs like sitting on a stool when you go for a drink in the bar its nice to lay back in the chair and relax very short on T bags and coffee just enough for one cup of each and the smallest biscuit they could leave these are all small items but they do add up and the cost of the hotel was above average, good location for what we wanted modern hotel with carpark helpful staff good size room very comfortable bed
36474,Novotel London Waterloo, My room was near a lorry depot revving up and unloading loading all night I therefore couldn t open the window as I prefer it to air conditioning , Very friendly staff
36475,Novotel London Waterloo, Payed for full breakfast and only got cereal and fruit before everything was taken away, Hotel was brilliant with everything needed and great location shower was cool with the push button glass frosting system 
36476,Novotel London Waterloo, Extremely disappointed for the room sizes and configuration This seemed to be the style and configuration of the ibis budget hotels I frequently stay in hotels and the Novotel on numerous occasions This simply did not have the same look and feel as the rest of the Novotel chain I was really disappointed when we had a late lunch in the restaurant My food order was completely wrong and part of it didn t even show up so I asked for it to be cancelled and taken off the bill in the end I think there was a communication issue as the staff did not understand English very well I wouldn t expect the overall level of service from a Novotel chain , Location and price were good value on site parking was ideal for London
36477,Novotel London Waterloo, Delayed checkin due problem with reservation but this was sorted out quickly and resulted in an upgrade of room , The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful Food was good and a reasonable price Room was very clean and tidy The bed was comfortable 
36478,Novotel London Waterloo, The bedside lights in our room and bathroom lights in my daughters room were faulty Nothing too drastic as there was plenty of light anyway, Very helpful staff always friendly A nice quiet part of central London Small spa gym area but clean and nicely equipped Breakfast was included in our tariff and the buffet was quite extensive Easy connections to both Victoria and Waterloo stations
36479,Novotel London Waterloo, We stayed here in January It would be nice to have a heating system that worked our s didn t and I reported it twice a member of staff came to our room and agreed it didn t work and promised us a portable heater which didn t turn up We checked in at 18 30 and was offerred an alternative room at 23 45 At the hotel reception they advertise rooms with a view of the London skyline so I asked for a room view this view to be honest I didn t expect a great deal but a view of scaffolding and three tower cranes wasn t what I anticipated , It s location is perfect for seeing central London
36480,Novotel London Waterloo, The lights on our bed were a little broken and the lights in my daughter s bathroom flickered both fixable problems, Nice clean rooms with a spacious and very comfortable bed Nice and quiet location even though it s a little off the beaten track it s not really that close to Waterloo despite the title Friendly and helpful staff who were always very pleasant Lovely breakfast buffet which was well stocked
36481,Novotel London Waterloo, I paid an awful lot more to stay there because of New Year s Eve which is fine but we had a massive building site a smashed down building dead outside of our window which was not mentioned on the website when I paid If this was mentioned I definitely would not of paid I would of went somewhere else Also the towel rail was broke in the bathroom and also the handle on the bathroom door was snapped , Bed was big and comfy Had a really nice sleep
36482,Novotel London Waterloo, Lack of good English skills from staff Heating didn t work and very skimpy on complimentary tea coffee sugar etc cost of on site car parking 25 per day with no discount infact very little understanding from staff with regards to asking about discount neither did they grasp the fact we had problem with heating Purely the language barrier and lack of basic knowledge, Style location room service
36483,Novotel London Waterloo, Breakfast was very disappointing I stay here regularly and usually don t have breakfast here This time I booked breakfast in advance Shan t bother again , Good location and charming staff View over Lambeth Palace very nice 
36484,Novotel London Waterloo, I did not like the fact that that the bathroom and toilet were separate Mattress was also very farm and would have preferred medium At the end the manager managed to fix something but still the problem was there and i did not sleep well , Location was quite central I was expecting more from Novatel hotel despite been rated 4 star 
36485,Novotel London Waterloo, The breakfast arrangement was very haphazard not enough bowls plates etc in the right place very poor quantity and quality of tea and coffee in the bedroom cheap nescafe and not enough of anything more than having 1 cup each for the entire stay, The room was clean and quiet
36486,Novotel London Waterloo, The parking set up was awful there was no provision for taking your car out and returning it during the night Payment was expected every time the car was removed instead of a set charge on checkout The power went off halfway through the evening , Location
36487,Novotel London Waterloo, staff at time had a lot of problems when booking in extra nights cleaners didn t seem to be very good plus we found a baby cockroach in our room , very nicely decorated
36488,Novotel London Waterloo, Location a bit far from tube stations It is a bit difficult to communicate with some staff as they do not speak English well It is very costly , Cleanliness room is spacious especially the sofa bed 
36489,Novotel London Waterloo, Charged me 30 pounds which is 50 00 I ve stayed at a Novotel 3 times in the last two years but probably won t stay again 50 00 is insulting for a 5 minute Local call , Nice staff good location 
36490,Novotel London Waterloo, The bathroom was separate from the toilet and after using the toilet you had to open another door before you could wash your hands One of the light units in the bathroom stopped working There was no waste bin in the room just a small bin in the bathroom View out the window was a mixture of construction site and nearby buildings not much to see , Location perfect for our needs The breakfast was very good and the staff friendly and helpful 
36491,Novotel London Waterloo, cost of car parking spent over 1000 for 3 rooms bar etc on a business trip and hotel still wanted to charge full amount for parking eventually managed to get some discount but feel after spending that amount car parking of 48 00 should have been complimentary , excellent location for oval cricket ground and central London eye etc
