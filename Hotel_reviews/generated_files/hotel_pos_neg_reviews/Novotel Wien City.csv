274963,Novotel Wien City, There was nothing we didn t like but since you asked please provide better choices for breakfast although breakfast was fine , We loved the room that we had It was super comfortable and it met our needs in every way We loved this hotel Thank you Novatel 
274964,Novotel Wien City, Restaurant kitchen closed early and we were left with no choice but go out for dinner with two young children since we wanted more than snacks , Very family friendly facilities and staff Good breakfast Good location 
274965,Novotel Wien City, Staff at reception were unpleasant unhelpful poorly behaved and simply rude There was one man in particular who was unprofessional and rude because the room card was not working to get access to the lift In front of lots of other guests in he reception area he gave an attitude and with an intimidating tone said the lift would work only if you know how to use the key He knew very well that I went to reception repeatedly after attempting at least 4 5 times and had asked someone to check the card and needed help as I had a flight to catch Rooms were tiny and toilet was separate from the bathroom with no washbasin No proper wardrobe in the room glad that I was only stayed 1 night The buffet breakfast was awful and did not cater for those who were strict vegetarians or for religious reasons could not have pork For example the vegetarian foods were kept next to pork and so other guests were using the same servings spoon for pork and vegetarian dishes The pork i e pork sausages were getting mixed with the veg dishes Although it is not strictly the staffs fault but if the food were kept in separate areas then it would have prevented guests from mixing the spoons of spilling dropping pork sausages on vegetarian food In the end I ended up walking 0 5 miles early morning to have breakfast at Hilton The hotel has no concierge or anyone to help with the luggage when checking in or out This really is a budget hotel which I am not used to because apart from staying at Novotel Wien City in Vienna I have always stayed at a 5 star hotel So it was a real shock to what I am normally used to I only stayed at the hotel because I wanted to be close to my friends who were also staying at the same hotel If anyone is considering this hotel be prepared to sleep in a tiny room with very little space around the bed and the awful staff at reception It is not good value for money , The the wifi connection was good 
274966,Novotel Wien City, The weird extra half door to the bathroom Not very private when sharing , The location was close walking distance to the city Prayer and public transport 
274967,Novotel Wien City, The room was filthy and not prepared for us I have no idea why it was called executive as I could see no extra benefits Restaurant staff very slow If you pay for breakfast through booking this will not include coffee We had to wait for it for ages and remind the waiter The waiter when talking the dirty plates away removed the used fork and nife and put it back on the table ,No Positive
274968,Novotel Wien City, Nothing, We booked two rooms for two nights The rooms were spacious and clean the mattress and pillows were soft and comfortable We had requested for early check in prior to coming to Vienna which we got The air con was fine The bathroom was clean with a good sized shower The hotel was 4 mins walk to the nearest train station Lots of good restaurants near the hotel Also there was a hotel nearby where you could do your own laundry which we availed The breakfast was included in the room charge and they had a very good variety of food All in all avery good place to stay Will recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Vienna
274969,Novotel Wien City, The pillows were very uncomfortable and reception couldn t provide a different type I don t remember this being a problem on previous visits , As above
274970,Novotel Wien City, Everything was perfect, The location was really good and easy to get to every part of the city that is all the sites and the other parts of the city and also the metro station as well Not too far from the airport too Service was good and the stay was very good and comfortable
274971,Novotel Wien City, Room size could have been better especially when traveling with kids , Pretty standard hotel small rooms Traveling with kids and felt very stuffed in the room extremely small size Location is close to metro but quite a distance from all the landmarks Breakfast and service were good and front desk for helpful with providing tourist information
274972,Novotel Wien City, Behaviour of the front office other staffs I did the booking for 2 Adult and a child however the front end staff said that the booking they have only for 2 adult So they charged me extra for the child , Breakfast was good One of the front office was very good and of helping nature 
274973,Novotel Wien City, money were not worth the room we got, Hotel located in a good position even though for the same money we could have booked in an hotel even closer to the city center
274974,Novotel Wien City,No Negative, Hotel position is very good 10min walk to city center Very clean and tidy good wifi Very good breakfast with lot of different food Stuff were friendly and polite
274975,Novotel Wien City, The hotel charged me EUR 4 50 for something I didn t use they charged me money for a bottle of a water which wasn t in the room I hated the way they did it with me and I ll write me the complaint so they give me back my the EUR 4 50 cause I m not going to make the hotel fool me , The hotel location is fine just 5 minutes walk from the city center and main attractions The staff are good and helpful in the European standards 
274976,Novotel Wien City, Staff offering cappuccino s at breakfast but not making it clear that it is an extra charge , The property was conveniently located just a short walk to the underground railway main train station and the centre of the old town Renovated room with modern bathroom and separate toilet 
274977,Novotel Wien City, There are several small things to complain about Taken together this is not a 4 Star place , The Place was clean and the City Center was reachable within 10 min walking
274978,Novotel Wien City, Breakfast menu is very compact not many vegetarian options bottled water in the room is charged it s usually complimentary in most hotels , Clean place very accessible good neighbourhood lots of restaurents supermarkets nearby metros trams and buses just a few steps away from the hotel 
274979,Novotel Wien City, Wifi was rather slow which hampered fluent online working The front desk personal sometimes lacked a smile but was generally polite , The hotel has an excellent location in between the city center and the Austria Center Vienna It provides value for money and a very nice breakfast buffet 
274980,Novotel Wien City, The staff could have given us a map at check in we had to ask for basic Vienna information that we felt should have been shared on arrival , The staff was friendly and helpful for the most part Would definitely stay again 
274981,Novotel Wien City, The location is outside the city center and you dont really get the vienna vibe from here Although it is near metro stations which you can take to get into the city or walk 20 minutes , The hotel staff and room were all great Good amenities 
274982,Novotel Wien City, nonfunctional bathroom small and crowded cannot open the windows in the room, Location is good close to a u bahn station the hotel si very clean the breakfast and restaurant area nice
274983,Novotel Wien City, The staff could be more helpful and two economic things 1 I book through Booking a room for two adults an one 13 year old but at the hotel we had to pay an extra EU30 per night so that we could be upgraded to a room for the three 2 Breadfast was not included which we knew but the price was the highest we saw in comparison to the other hotels we stayed in EU16 per person , The hotel was neat comfortable and with a very good lacerion about 15 minute walk to the city center 
274984,Novotel Wien City, The sound isolation of the rooms is far from being perfect given that the windows go to a street with a lot of traffic this is a minus The emergency cars with sound on were waking me up few times per night The blankets were overly warm was hard to sleep , Good room service and cleaning Quite positive and helpful staff at reception Breakfast was pretty nice Air conditioning in the room Big shower and bathroom 
274985,Novotel Wien City, no one time toothpaste and toothbrush, great location very close to downtown Encouraging to have a walk for shopping or viewing some great places of interests 
274986,Novotel Wien City, Some of the cheese in the breakfast looked very sad to say the least , A little stressed staff in the morning but we were probably messier Great to check in in the middle of the night and the staff also let us check out later than planned which was very kind of them considering exhausted kids 
274987,Novotel Wien City,No Negative, I stayed at the Novotel 2 times this year I can easily say thay I ll stay there in the next time again There is no luxury things but they have very clean quite and comfort rooms Personnel are friendly helpful and also can speak English well Location is very good There is a subway station close to the hotel and you can also go to the center stephan platz etc by walking 
274988,Novotel Wien City, The breakfast was expensive 16 per person , We had a great accommodation the hotel was near the center in good and quiet location It was very clean The staff were really polite and helpful every time we needed something I absolutely suggest it 
274989,Novotel Wien City, The bathroom door it was kind of weird there was no defect but the door didn t close completely The room access card system had a problem I had to reset my card at the reception almost daily and it was a drag since in the elevator it worked but when I got to my room door it didn t quite frustrating , The food was pretty good and the location was close enough to the metro and you could walk 15 min to a shopping venue As a funny side note the bathroom had a speaker that was paired with the TV or radio you could paired it with your phone also i find it funny to listen to the TV while inside 
274990,Novotel Wien City, No one use hotel slippers offered There were small scratches on room wall, Friendly and polite staff nice breakfast room service Good location centrally located 1 minute walk from metro station 10 minutes walk from schwedenplatz Surprisingly good gesture on behalf of hotel management to find in our room on New Year s Day a warm wishes letter and two branded happy new year tokens 
274991,Novotel Wien City, dinner at the hotel was a disaster not enough staff and as an ex silver service waitress I knew the minute I sat down that is was not going to be good, it was like feeding on the serengti with all the animals trying to get to the water hole first not enough staff 
274992,Novotel Wien City, House keeping took over 24hrs to fix clogged sink obviously stained bathroom towel mat never replaced Executive room not that executive when 2 adults and 2 small kids Just 3 4 sqm bigger than standard , Location just outside Ringstrasse 5 from UBahn station Truly complete Breakfast buffet modern interior clean

274994,Novotel Wien City, Room failed to supply bath products such as conditioner and body cream when bottles ran empty Carpet was very dirty and used Room size was small for price Cleaners failed to do room service on one occasion and we had to call down to lobby Quality of hotel restaurant was rather poor , Location was good near a metro and relatively close to city centre
274995,Novotel Wien City, There was a strange humming noise at night coming from a shaft or some engine room It s just a Novotel and it s good value for money being in Vienna but usually one expects a little more from a 4 star , Basic hotel situated in a good location considering the price Very near to U Bahn station and also to airport bus station The heart of the city is a 15 minute walk away 
274996,Novotel Wien City, My carpet had seen better days An extra door beyond mine grouped my room with another Someone in the other room filled the shared area with thick cigarette smoke Not pleasant , Comfortable and efficient Good location 
274997,Novotel Wien City, Cleaning in breakfast room Needs a lot of improvement Clear guidance about parking facility and arrival recommendations There is no temp parking in front of the hotel to unload your luggage , Good location same distance to Stephanplatz as well as to Prater 
274998,Novotel Wien City, free wifi had no password protection and check in staff were dismissive of questions about whether there was any safe wifi basic wifi was absurdly slow and so in fact had to buy super fast wifi for streaming even just to send an email so wasn t free wifi milk capsules with kettle and coffee station in room were off room was cleaned but dirty cup left on bedside table really a mediocre experience from a chain hotel that should do better , great location 
274999,Novotel Wien City, Wifi wouldnt work for me We got a wheelchair accessible room and hadnt asked for it Everything was very low and when we showered the entire bathroom floor would get drenched which wasnt ideal, Staff were lovely rooms were very clean and the location is also great

275060,Novotel Wien City, Very small room for 4 people , Great place to stay Not in the middle of Vienna but minutes away from all major attractions but for business traveleres I guess its not a key Minutes from all public transportation Very friendly and helpful personnel Great briekfast When I booked the room I was sure I am booking a room with 2 rooms for 2 adults and 2 children but when we checked it it was one regular size room with 2 beds one standard and one sofa bed Both very comfortable but for 4 people the room was very small We spent most of the time walking around and were coming back late at night just to sleep so it wasn t that bad but just keep in mind when you are booking the room for 4 people if you want more space standard room is a very small option Overall great experience
