337823,Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane, We had to change rooms due to a leakage in the room underneath ours and this was quite inconvenient as we practically had to do it immediately upon notice On the other hand the hotel compensated it by giving us a very nice upgrade for the remaining 5 days of our stay and additionally offered a 50 discount for one of our nights After this event they really tried harder to please us in everything really nice staff and management When changing the rooms they packed our things for us and I think they forgot to pack my heart rate monitor from Garmin I still have to contact them to see if they have it in their lost found One other thing I didn t like was that some of the guest were auite noisy during breakfast and in one of the evenings in the hotel bar when I went for after dinner drinks too many business people int he hotel , The way the staff treated us all the time and always tried to excell in having us satisfied The concierge team was always helpful and gave us great restaurant suggestions even when we asked in the ladt minute The breakfast in the room as after a couple of breakfasts downstairs we preferred to have it in the room When they got to know what we were doing in a day e g going to a show in a theather they would prepare something related to it for when we were back to the room Another example is that the concierge arranged a nice alternative city tour for us as we were with the kids and the nice tour guide took a picture of our family When we got back to the hotel they had the picture framed as a surprise for us
