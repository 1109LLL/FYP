260857,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Toilet chair being isolated far from bathroom is not good Bathroom was separated from sleeping area with steel with glass wall which is like you sleep in a blacksmith workshop And the blue painted wall not comfortable I think it was over priced , Tha big bathtub in Romantic room is nice Staff are nice 
260858,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The spa massage wasn t great My partner had a better experience but my masseuses seemed inexperienced and I was counting down the minutes for it to be over not ideal when you re trying to relax and indulge , Loved the location It was quiet and romantic and the decor was so charming It was our favorite hotel of the trip 
260859,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette,No Negative, The location was wonderful The staff were very friendly and attentive The hotel is tastefully designed my room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom is spacious The spa and the pool facilities were wonderful 
260860,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, It was understaffed tried to order cocktails at the bar which would of neen great to enjoy the atmosphere but had to get concierge to order and send to our room , Very stylish and comfortable enjoyed our room The cocktails were great and unique Breakfast was good with varied selection and good produce 
260861,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The bar is open only till 10 30 for breakfast and then only from 3 p m so you can t have breakfast a la carte in the bar that is disappointing , Very stylish hotel in a quiet safe area Very nice bar in the hotel with terrace Clos La Belle Juliette with good selection of Italian snacks wine and cocktails 
260862,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The room wasn t as advertised and it was very noisy throughout our stay with the cleaner banging doors from very early and then throughout the day The breakfast is ridiculously expensive and unimpressive , The staff were lovely and the hotel room was kept very clean throughout 
260863,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette,No Negative, We liked the design and the ambience The garden area is very pleasant The rooms are spacious for French hotels The district is superb We overall were very happy with our stay and I definitely consider to stay here during my next visit to Paris 
260864,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The toilet in the Deluxe Room is very small , Location was brilliant could walk to Notre Dame and Musee de Orsay Also there is a hop on hop off at These locations Staff were very accomodating Pool area was really nice Also the food at the Hotel is delicious 
260865,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon and the hotel did make sure it was a little extra special for us The girl on the front desk was very nice and extremely helpful The area is very quiet and within easy reach of the Metro 
260866,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The spa treatments were slightly pricey but super convenient so worth it It was a perfect stay nothing to complain about , The hotel staff were friendly and service focused The room was beautifully decorated with designer walk in shower and very comfortable king bed TV was an Apple Mac and free wifi Nespresso coffee machine in the room The petite spa was a wonderful addition to the hotel with sweet little pool and steam room Massage treatment was wonderful The neighborhood was quiet but plenty of local excellent restaurants 15 minute walk to Musee d Orsay and 20 to Louvre or Eiffel Tower 
260867,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Minor difficulty with the wireless keyboards which didn t function but we weren t in the room long enough to be overly inconvenienced Some taxi drivers work by sat nav which take the main routes If you can find a local cabbie who knows Paris the journey and cost can be halved , We have nothing but praise for the staff in general and in particular Lola who was extremely helpful and enthusiastic The room was good sized and the rose petals on the bed a nice touch Our family had arranged the room to be upgraded as a gift to us on our 40th anniversary The hotel is well positioned for the Metro which is just round the corner and there are a myriad of independent fashion food cafes antique shops within spitting distance A very classy hotel overall Paris has grown prohibitively expensive since our last visit and we re glad for the sake of our bank balance that we were only there 3 days Saying that it s a wonderful vibrant city that puts most others to shame and we both loved it despite the weather which was rainy We will have to save up for a few years before we come again though Maybe for our 50th 
260868,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, the wifi slows down from time to time but nothing extreme , I don t even know where to start to describe our amazing experience at the Belle Juliette First of we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a Romantic Room which was absolutely divine The facilities in the room were excellent from the iMac to the nespresso coffee maker As for cleanliness I cannot praise the staff enough in fact believe it or not there s been days we had the room cleaned twice without requesting it The spa facilities were also fantastic it almost felt as if they were exclusively made available for us as at no time did we see other guests If you want you can even arrange a massage which is about 70 euro per hour The breakfast was also plentiful delicious and yammy including the coffee I normally hate hotel coffee And lastly the front desk and F B staff have been wonderful special praises to Lola and Louis Overall it s been an amazing stay and by all means intend to return sometimes soon 
260869,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The duplex suite we had booked for 2 plus a kid was not very practical Deco was not nice does not really associate with amything belle or feminine It was very cold deco amd small bed even for 2 Some of the retro plastic furniture didnt serve any purpose Eg bathroom tiny stool and low furniture Same goes for the living room cabinets and low furniture , Public spaces and staff friendliness
260870,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, At that price the minibar in the rooms could offer more, This is the breakfast that suits everyone We were early birds and could enjoy the tranquility and the freshness of all the delicatess they serv here Thank you indeed for the champagne We loved the Food It had it all
260871,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Bed was two singles pushed together to make a double which is not comfortable at all Heating was high throughout the hotel Had to sleep with the windows open, Friendly helpful staff Great location 
260872,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Hotel is a little further up from the river than I realised , Opposite 2 excellent restaurants our garden room was very pleasant and quiet the staff were pleasant and helpful 
260873,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The hotel laundry sent my clothes back a bit too damp They were sealed in plastic when damp so ended up with a bit of a musty odor More hooks please I have a shaving kit and a garment bag that can both be hung from a hook Somehow hotel rooms never take advantage and provide hooks These are very minor complaints There is a lot to like about this hotel , The room was small but comfortable The location is good with easy access to four subway stops The area has many nice restaurants and shops Anything you might need is easily available The hotel also has a very nice patio bar at the back that overlooks a very attractive garden The hotel itself and room are quite attractive The staff friendly and very attentive The shower was the nicest I ve ever encountered in Europe and the bathroom was well laid out There was enough space for my wife and I Closet space was also sufficient View out the window was excellent and the blackout curtains were the best I ve ever encountered They made the room completely dark any time of day 
260874,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Located in quite a quiet area great quality of sleep but you might need to travel a little further for evening nightlife , Absolutely fantastic hotel couldn t have been better looked after Room was absolutely huge Would definitely stay here again 
260875,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The hotel did not have a concierge service when we were there While the staff did their best we did get some misinformation and would ve benefited from having a designated resource to help us plan our visit better We would ve also enjoyed a varied breakfast buffet The buffet was great but was the same every day , The staff were extremely accommodating We also liked the unique design It really felt like a bed and breakfast where we had complete run of the facility it was very relaxing The spa was a nice plus 
260876,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette,No Negative, Lovely hotel The rooms were very pretty and spacious with a living area as well as bedroom Amazing shower and bath Two iMacs in the room Amazing smell in the lobby Spa downstairs was small but lovely Location was very convenient to many metro stations so exploring the city from there is great 
260877,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Hate the shower Water everywhere and impossible to not wash hair Very strange Also wish room had a comfortable chair to sit on Lastly a luggage rack, Love the location the lounge and the garden Staff divine Rooms are very small but value for money 
260878,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, The corridors were a bit spoky they were so dark , The staff were really kind and helpful The room was cleaned everyday It was minutes of walk away from metro stations 
260879,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Rooms can be a little warm so opening the window is a must but the noise is fairly loud at points of the evening at the front of the building, Boutique feel of the hotel and the breakfast
260880,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Nothing , Staff were all extremely helpful as a coeliac they ensured there was gluten free bread available for breakfast and helped me to find places to eat for dinner Room was beautiful and bed was exceptionally comfortable 
260881,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, Not one minute , Amazing helpful staff who went out of their way to make us comfortable Love the spa and the outdoor space This will be my new go to hotel in Paris Great location 
260882,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette, For us the main problems resulted out of disappointment and a misalignment with our expectations in general Rooms are small as per Paris standards but that was fine for us since we did not really spend too much time in the room Toilettes are separated from the bathroom So inside the room the toilette and the bathroom are located in two different smaller rooms This was a problem because if you need to go to the toilette in the middle of the night there is no way you are not going to wake up your fellow traveller You need to close one door and open another and walk around in the room to do that There is an Apple TV which I think might be available for use as a computer That was slightly noisy during the night like in sleep mode so not absolutely noisy but this was disturbing for us The receptionists were trying to be helpful and friendly they answer all questions and smile constantly but in our opinion some of that was forced and not always genuine and effective really We went down to the spa to see where it was and how it was and thought it was smaller than it seemed in the pictures We were told that there was a steam room but we saw only the Turkish hammam Maybe this is the steam room In the end we could not use the spa anyway since it was not open before 9 am in the morning The halls on the floors where the rooms are are really dark and lights are automatic In the evening when you are walking to your room this can be a bit bothering and scary really When we went down to get coffee or breakfast there was no one available in the bar terrace area to ask for anything We ended up going out for our morning coffee which was a shame because the terrace seemed nice and we might have wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee in the terrace , The location of the hotel is not bad it was a neighborhood we wanted to be located in However it may not be ideal for all travellers as proximity to some of the more touristy areas airport transfers are not the easiest The hotel is said to have a transfer service though which may be appealing to some travellers We did not use it It seems like this is a newer hotel which was a plus for us It was mostly modern and clean WiFi worked without disruptions 
260883,Hotel Spa La Belle Juliette,No Negative, The location was perfect for getting around Paris and the decor was fun and quirky But what made it the best was the staff everyone was warm welcoming and incredibly helpful
