176997,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, We were given a complimentary drinks voucher on arrival but the drinks were put on our room tab removed when I commented I requested a taxi but we were put into the hotel s car which charged us 25 for a short trip to the train station In the room there was a coffee machine but no coffee pods 1 black tea bag and no milk The recommendation for dinner was awful , Unbeatable location Wonderful bed and shower The room was small as expected but spotless and well appointed with safe robe slippers a proper hair dryer and lovely toiletries Thoughtful touches such as umbrellas available to borrow for guests We were told the bar was open 24 hours but didn t test this out 
176998,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France,No Negative, La Tamise was wonderful It was conveniently located near the Louvre and the Jardin de Tuileries both within a 5 10 minute walk The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming especially Pierre He went out of his way to make us comfortable and to help us enjoy our stay We even enjoyed fun conversation with him over coffee and champagne We miss him and his hospitality already My husband and I didn t book a room with a view but we didn t miss it as we spent so much time sight seeing outside of the room It was small but not too cramped The room was also extremely clean and nicely decorated The bed was very comfortable The espresso machine and fixings in the room were convenient for those mornings when you needed some energy before getting out the door Definitely recommend this hotel be sure to take advantage of the advice and knowledge of the hotel staff Pierre as they ll be honest and provide good recommendations Book this now 
176999,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, A little more choice for breakfast would of been nice , The staff went above and beyond to accommodate in all requests Nothing was deemed an inconvience Upon arrival we were dealt with swiftly and given a free upgrade First impressions of the room were wonderful and did not change on further inspection 
177000,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, The rooms are a little small but that doesn t detract from how nice they are Also there was a large crack in the wall of the room we were staying in , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is very nice and cosy and the fit out of the rooms are elegant 
177001,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, Room a bit small but thats Paris So can forgive this as such a great location , Beds were very comfy and lots of fluffy white towels and gown procvided Very quiet room considering location is in a popular busy area Staff very helpful polite and accommodating 
177002,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, Our room was a bit small for three but that was my mistake in not booking a larger room , The staff were all very friendly helpful and genuine My family really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend 
177003,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, Our only issues all be them small were no fridge to keep our water cold and the pillow profiles were great for decoration and not so great to sleep on Some normal profile pillows in the cupboard would quickly solve this issue The towels were a little hard and lacked the fluffy hotel towel feel we enjoy , The room was very comfortable and in a great central location to Paris landmarks and some fantastic shopping and dinning The service from the staff was amazing with a great parting touch of some crossaint and water for our travels to our next destination A perfect hotel to site see from

177006,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, If I had to say anything I would say our breakfast on Sunday I think they were not expecting the number of guests at same time and so was a stretch but with patience we did get breakfast They were agile in their tasks so covered it , Great location amazing service genuine too and great knowledge of Paris Perfect It was a birthday trip and they made me feel completely special thank you 
177007,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, The room could have been bigger but as there is so much to see in Paris we hardly spent any time in our room anyway other than to sleep once we had got in late from a day out , Rooms were very cosy with lavish finishes the bathrooms were also clean and modern 5 minute walk from the louvre across the road from Tuileries gardens and within walking distance of the musee de l armee grand palace chatelet notre dame in addition to many more places of interest Furthermore the staff were very friendly and helpful What more could one ask for

177012,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, The weather , Exemplary customer service from the moment we arrived The breakfast pastries and hot chocolate were to die for Beautiful rooms Everything you would want from a small boutique hotel round the corner from the best hotels but at a fraction of the price

177016,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, We would like to have seen a small refrigerator in the room but apart from that we were very impressed by the overall experience , Friendly staff very clean and spacious rooms excellent breakfast and the possibility to regulate temperature in the room and bathroom separately which actually works properly as is the difference with many other hotels

177019,H tel de La Tamise Esprit de France, Nothing to dislike , A Fantastic hotel situated in the heart of Paris within walking distance of Louvre museum the Metro etc The biggest asset this hotel has is its wonderful and courteous staff Julian Corentin Pierre Kevin Antonio Molkeire and Nicolas The politeness shown by all was evident by their attention to detail from the beverages offered as we left the hotel each morning to explore the attractions of Paris to the friendliness and willingness of the staff to help us find restaurants of our taste or giving directions about the metro Their kindness made our stay in Paris even more special To note the staff left messages in our room welcoming us to Paris on our first night and the following evening left a message reminding us of the time change The bedroom was compact but extremely comfortable Tastefully decorated and very clean Breakfast was lovely and well presented I would highly recommend any persons travelling to Paris to book this hotel We certainly will be returning to Paris to experience the charms of La Tamise
