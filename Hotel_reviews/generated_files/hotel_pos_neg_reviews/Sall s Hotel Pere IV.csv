394702,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Breakfast too expensive compared with the local shops bakeries WiFi in the room was poor we had to move to find a good signal The drainer of the bathtub shower was not good resulting in a lot of water when the water flow was high Only a few TV channels in English mostly news , Great location Staff was always prompt to help Room size was good
394703,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Cannot fault the hotel on any aspects of our stay , I must state that this Hotel was amazing from the professional staff on Reception Nicola was so helpful and informative The room was wonderful and we paid extra for the balcony The breakfast was very nice and lots of choice selection The staff in the morning during breakfast were very efficient and friendly and genuinely made a conscientious effort to engage with guests Dequinne was especially helpful and always made us feel welcome every day 
394704,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The fitness center was small and poorly maintained I booked spa access but was not clear at time of booking it was just for a free 1 hour booking Was wanting to use it daily which was the reason I booked it , Very large comfy bed and amazing shower 
394705,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Location was nt animated area away from restaurants the beach and the Olympic port but many transport options car metro even suburban, Room and comfortable bed good and varied breakfast The staff was friendly and professional Many facilities such as we had the possibility to leave the luggage at the hotel for 5 days when we returned after visiting Salou and returned to go home to Romania Many possibilities for transport not far from hotel auto and subway
394706,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, As a deluxe Double room with balcony the room was so small that we could not have our 2x suitcases open as there was no where to put them The pool is indoors in the Spa area really hot and uncomfortable when its hot outside We arrive on Saturday and Sunday everything was closed nearby There was bar eatery that was close but too close to smelly drains Would have prefered to stay nearer to the beach and the hop on hop off bus route 20min walk from hotel or we should ve stayed closer to town ,No Positive
394707,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Mistake for withdraw money from my credit card after checking out without notified me they returned after i follow up and call them, Its great location to visit any activity but u should walk little bit
394708,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I have reserved a room with a double bed but actually it s two single bed it s not very confortable , The restaurant is great they have really good things 
394709,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The mattress is not very comfortable and it s a shame there is no outside terrace to sit Area around the hotel is not very attractive , Quiet room with nice dark curtains lunch menu for 16 50 including wine and coffee is not expensive 
394710,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Spa voucher was confusing we thought we were entitled to an hour treatment as it specifies free access to the facilities on bookings com We ended up paying 60 euros for a sub standard message the shower was not clean loud music near by at Razamataz, sauna and steam room was good Room was a good size 
394711,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location though relatively close to the beacht 15 min walk is in an industrial area no much attractions close by Access to SPA i e the little pool and Sauna is limited to only once 1 hour This was very misleading to us since we expected an unlimited access as with other hotels we had to beg for extra vouchers to get to the pool shampoo and coffee sachets were not periodically replaced everyday we had to call and remind them twice during our stay WiFi reception in the room was very poor had to move to the corridors and lobby in order to get connected, Well maintained and decorated friendly and very helpful staff 
394712,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Location isn t the most central but there is a taxi rank on the corner of the hotel and most places are no more than 10 A c in the rooms is poor so ask for an additional key card to leave the a c running all day that seems to solve the problem, Great hotel recently refurbished and fantastic staff
394713,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Maybe spa access be good to have more than an hour pass, The room was incredible and the bed was so soacious A massive perk was the breakfast availability everything was so fresh 
394714,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It seems like only half of the hotel is renovated The base rooms are quite old but huge The newer rooms looked because I asked were very nice but smaller , Staff was very attentive and did speak decent good English Location is good with some good cafes nearby and the beach within a 15 min walk 
394715,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The air conditioning was a bit loud in the room To enter the spa you need to have a cap they sell one for 3 Eur and flip flops they sell one for 5 Eur Without these items you cannot enter The hotel is in ab it of a dead area , The hotel is nice room bathroom bed was all excellent The Spa in the hotel was also nice 
394716,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location was a little outside of the centre however very close to a metro station so it didnt bother us as was quiet nice to get outside of the centre , The hotel was beautiful it was exactly as described very clean and spacious The staff were so friendly and could do anything they wanted to help you out It was my boyfriends birthday and as a suprise they put a bottle of champagne in our room Such a lovely gesture 
394717,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Location The hotel is located in a no life neighborhood 2 km by the Olympic port, Everything 10 A wonderful hotel as well as the staff Barcelona is a stunning unique city Transportation to the city auto subway or train is extremely efficient and comfortable
394718,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Only small problem was we booked a transfer from the airport to the hotel and they had booked it the wrong way round we didn t know this and had to call the hotel who said to just get one from the airport it was the same price but not the best especially as it was late at night , Great hotel 15 mins stroll to the beach Clean and comfortable with friendly staff Close to cafes and the supermarket Would definitely stay here again 
394719,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Gorgeous room big shower huge bed We had a lovely view of the sangrada familia 10 minute walk to the beach local shops around Never short of getting a taxi staff were helpful hotel room very very clean would defiantly recommend and stay here again 
394720,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The staff were unhelpful and inefficient We were staying for my friends pre wedding celebrations and every evening when we asked the staff to order taxi s for us they refused to even pick up the phone and inquire The taxi bay outside the hotel was vacant every evening and we were forced to run 20 minutes to the marina because we thought the hotel would help us to book the taxi s for our group but they point blank refused and so we almost missed our boat party If you don t mind very poor customer service then spend your hard earned cash on your stay here it is an expensive hotel and the only thing good about it are the cleaning staff and modern rooms The gym facilities are poor treadmill was inoperative and only open 10am until 9pm the spa does not allow you to wash with soap because of poor drainage however they do allow you to use the facilities if you have a late flight and want to freshen up Also the hotel has a safe stowage area to keep your bags after you check out Please bare in mind if your room is near the emergency exit as mine was you will be woken up every morning with a very loud jarring sound of what sounds like a service lift occupying a group of maintenance workers , The property was clean and the rooms were modern and comfortable 
394721,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Internet connection was terrible We ve lived at 8 floor and most time internet connection was absent or sooooo slooooooow, It was nice stay in good hotel
394722,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Room climate control would not allow setting below 21 C Unfortunately it would not cool to that temperature and room stayed at about 23 C although hotel was responsive to requests to check it We are accustomed to cooler temperatures indoors so that was a little problem However the hotel did make efforts to fix it We were only there three days so there may not have been adequate time for repair , Super clean super modern room great breakfast buffet at reasonable cost in house restaurant and bar both good friendly competent staff with good command of English and other languages Room had multiple outlets and USB ports for charging Hotel spa looked lovely but didn t get to use it received coupons for three complimentary spa hours and extra spa costs were very reasonable Hotel had a room to hold luggage also 
394723,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, No control of air conditioning and fridge turns off when your not in the room because you have to remove card key from electric so drinks are never cold, Large comfy bed quiet location close to metro links 10 walk to beach front
394724,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Mini fridge did not work advertises free access to spa however when arrived it was told to us that only 1 hour is permitted breakfast expensive for what is on offer , The spa was of a high quality and the bedroom bed size was large 
394725,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Rooms are very sound proofed so could hear next door even chatting and upstairs toilet flushing like was our own bathroom Also those photos on the website of the spa are totally exaggerated The pool is the size of a large jacuzzi with getting 5 6 breast strokes to reach the longest part of the pool , Comfy big bed and decent sized room and closet
394726,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, wi fi in the room wasn t good If you wanted to go to the spa you had to buy from the reception a swimming cap , The breakfast was ok the bed was very comfortable and large
394727,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room was very hot The AC didn t work well The exchange office only exchanged UK pound and USD even after they told me they exchanged Canadian The front desk wasn t that knowledgeable Would not call me a taxi to get to the airport , The hotel is very new and modern The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was modern Mirror had time and antifog 
394728,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Overall experience wasn t that great The rooms and beds were relatively small Too hot in the room the lowest was 20 degrees you could get down to which for me wasn t enough The views from the rooms were horrible also Loads of construction sites around Neighbourhood definitely the worst I ve seen in Barcelona Old bath robes made of Teddy bear material , The spa is very nice and you are given 1h free Ladies at the spa very pleasant and helpful also Ten minutes walk to nearest beach Around 25 min to Barceloneta 
394729,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The only issue we had was with our aircon we just couldn t make our room cool , Fantastic hotel we only wished there was an outdoor pool but everything was amazing Staff are lovely and helpful room was huge and the bathroom was lovely Breakfast was delicious
394730,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The breakfast room was somehow like a high school canteen not so comfortable as hotel otherwise The neighborhood is not so nice looking as other parts of the centre , The hotel was ok clean and on it s own way stylish I mean it is not a new hotel but it had some charisma of it s own It is close to the metro station Also the beach was in walking distance that s why I booked this one 
394731,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The hotel does not have the ideal location so I would suggest a bit of research beforehand if having to arrange travel from the airport for example Taxi probably best if travelling with suitcases but as we only hand luggage we used the train metro which took about 50 minutes but was very cost effective It s a good 20 minute walk to Catalunya Square or to the Port area but there are plenty of bars on route and the large park where the Arc de Triomf monument is situated is also within easy walking distance The Bogatell metro station less than 5 mins walk There is a cocktail bar next door to the hotel called D9 which we found very good for food and drink , The staff were very friendly and welcoming Housekeeping was of a high standard and the rooms were spotless as a result In fact the hotel in general was well appointed The reception and bar area was impressive and the spa is excellent This a very good hotel
394732,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The staff is not friendly They don t speak to you unless you go to the counter A simple Hola goes a long way They don t smile or seem happy to be in the customer service business The breakfast buffet is too expensive and the menu never changes The bacon is sometimes stuck together in frozen areas Someone is going to get sick from eating raw pork The restaurant prices are outrageous and the menu is not good This is why the restaurant is always empty I met so many hotel guest at the bar next door where the drinks and food were both reasonable and the staff has personality Give your menus drink prices and personnel an overhaul The hotel is nice but that s it The receptionist will not call you a taxi They tell you to go to the corner Our window was on the back of the hotel where young people hung out all night on Friday And Saturday and made as much noise as they could We were there for 2 weekends Have a few spa towels at the front desk for people to sign out when they go to the beach Tell them that if they don t bring them back that they will be charged for it There are so many towels in the spa area that aren t being used It s not like the staff is there for the guests it s like the guests are there for the staff Make people want to come back I don t want to go back , Very clean Free spa access Best burger spot in Barcelona on the corner Close to subway metro Walking distance to the ocean 
394733,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room had smell of paint We paid for pedicure at the spa in cash During check out we were asked for payment again The front desk head Roger was very rude saying that it was his discretion to check whether we paid for it or not After few hours they accepted that we had made payment The rude behaviour is unacceptable ,No Positive
394734,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Lack of communication as above , The location of the hotel was superb as it was about 13mins from the beach and 5 from the tube station It was also a lovely quiet area to stay in The staff were friendly and helpful The only negative was that we had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival but received no response Neither a taxi was booked as requested This paid off as taxis were cheaper called on the street than pre booked via the hotel but it was a bit stressful as we arrived in the evening Overall I would recommend the hotel due to its location and cleanliness 
394735,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The spa was a let down really small with no sun beds to lay down on, Staff really helpful really modern and clean hotel room spacious and good facilities good location
394736,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location is a little off the beaten track but it s only 25 minutes walk into the central Barcelona area or a few minutes to the metro , Very good room with excellent black out curtains and a very comfortable bed Breakfast was excellent with good choice and quality Staff very helpful although they didn t smile much 
394737,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, You only allowed to be in the spa for 1 hour per guest visit we stayed for 4 days I would have wanted to go every day but there is a charge which isn t mentioned anywhere All coffee and milk and toiletries etc in the room were not replaced after the first day we had to keep calling reception every day and ask , It wasn t mentioned anywhere that the spa facilities the reason we booked the hotel you were allowed to use for 1 hour per stay each Only to realise you need to buy a swim hat to go into the pool The toiletries in room were not replaced unless we asked the coffee and milk in the room was the same Dont want to keep asking for things which in other hotels especially 4 star not its normal procedure Will never visit that hotel again this was our second time in that city 
394738,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Price quality location nice The bakery on the front street side are realy cheep and testy you can take a breakfast there they works from early morning For exemple breakfast price in hotel is 15 EUR and 7 5 EUR in bakery Hotel located in 300 m from nearest subway station 1 km from the beach 7 min walking 15 20 min walking from La Rambla Barcelonetta Sagrada Familia All places is really close 
394739,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Terrible car parking space underground I could not get my car out Had to ask hotel staff to the drive car out of an extremely steep car park , Easy access to beach area Generous breakfast Clean rooms 
394740,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location of the hotel was a little far away from main areas 20 30 walk to the Arc de Triomf Sagrada Familia , The staff were extremely nice and helpful and we were given a voucher for a free treatment at the spa which was great too The bar offered a good tapas selection too 
394741,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The bathroom a bit aged with not the nicest bath and shower head Cracked bathroom sink Wi Fi didn t work well Only 2 lifts which were very slow and noisy We had to pay to use the safe provided in the room , Great service very nice staff Good location close to the see side easy connection to the city centre and all the attractions Room was big enough and overall nice 
394742,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Have never ever been to a hotel with such rude staff felt completely looked down on our whole visit and it quite frankly ruined our visit We felt as though the staff could not be bothered to make any effort with guests Dealt with 6 different members over our 4 day stay and didn t see a smile between them, The room was clean and very nice
394743,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, 2it would be nice if there was the posibility to be transported from the Hotel to the airport by a hotel bus, Very good breakfast Gentle personel We would like to have more relaxing means e g massage sauna etc
394744,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Although staff was kind and helpfull they seemed stressful and didn t make you feel warm The room service didn t clean the room as needed after the second day the floor was very dirty The noise isolation is very poor You can hear people taking shower or walking Also the bar next to the hotel is very noisy until 2 or 3 am we could hardly sleep when it was crowded , Big comfortable room and bathroom nicely decorated Very good location metro station was 2 blocks away Nice breakfast 
394745,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Exceeded expectations staff were friendly and helpful Good location in a quiet area but close to metro station for exploring the city and walking distance to Olympic Marina area 
394746,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Air con did not get cold enough mattresses were not the most comfortable general finish was poor in the bathroom e g wonky grouting and a big hole in the wall for a radiator Walls were very thin got woken by a neighbours alarm one morning , Spa was amazing would have liked longer than 1 hour for a 6 day stay Reception looked stunning 
394747,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Spa Booked room with spa access I wish it had been clear that we needed swimming caps and flip flops and only a 1 hour access during our 3 night stay , The rooms were comfortable bathroom immaculate clean and tidy Breakfast was great buffet style lots of choices meats cheese bread bacon and eggs fruit etc Baked goods were delicious 
394748,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Staff were professionnal but thats it Breakfast with large choice but average quality of products Spa access limited to 1 5h only must be booked in advance Generally spa is very small and la not worth the prize For 4star this hotel is dissappointing We will not come back we believe to find better value deal , Room with terrasse good location relatively close to city centre and the beach at the same time Bus stop 10m from the hotel m tro 2 min from hotel 
394749,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Everything fine , Second time here Coveniently located close to taxi and to metro station in lively Poble Nou area full of bars Nice bar downstairs great staff Rooms are cozy and clean Wi Fi is ok SPA area with indoor pool is very much appreciated if you are on business trip and with just one or two free hours for relaxing As last time good overall experience 
394750,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Staff rude at times especially cleaning maids They didn t decide to clean room till after 4pm which we was getting ready for evening meal View from room wasn t good Noise coming from our electricity box at night which we couldn t figure out why Breakfast over priced, Room was big and spacey 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station Lovely bar next door but does not open till 6pm Quiet enough
394751,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The size of the room was very small There was practically no breakfast option Just a few a la carte things that didn t meet my expectations, The hotel was in a very good position close to the metro and Times Square Clean bathrooms
394752,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Good location subway beatch Sagrada Familia Nice point to walking and tour the city Room with nice design clean big bed Friendly and helpful staff 
394753,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, We had a fantastic stay at this hotel It was only 10 mins from most places by taxi and a 20 30min walk The hotel was lovely with friendly staff and the spa and staff were great I would highly recommend this hotel 
394754,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Staff very helpful by printing off etickets for football Also they dealt with an extremely noisy customer who had the next room to me in a professional manner 
394755,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, In the mornings very early the cleaners were extremely loud It sounded like they were renovating the rooms And they would also come In a lot with no warning when either asleep relaxing or just getting dressed etc, I loved all things about the stay the staff were ok but not super friendly The location was very central comfortable bed really nice room and hotels Loved the cappuccinos
394756,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The hot breakfast buffet lacked options for vegetarians and you could not get eggs made to your preference or order an omelette There were plenty of pastries though The hotel did not look like it did in the pictures I stayed in a family room which was dated and the decor was of a low standard The bath contained rust stains and I had to be asked to move to another room This was by the lifts and the paper thin walls meant I was constantly disturbed at night by noise from the neighbours and guests using the lifts There are no irons in the rooms these have to be requested Toiletries are also not replaced and again have to be requested , The Spa facilities were excellent The hammam and different showers were particularly enjoyable The hotel was fairly close to 2 metro stations L1 and L4 and the renfe train goes straight to Passeig de Gracia which is on L4 and means that it is easy to get to the hotel by inexpensive public transport The staff were friendly and accommodating 
394757,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Electricity felt down in our room at 1 o clock in the mid of the night and we had to pack all of our things and go to the other room in a hurry with no lights because they couldn t fix it We forgot some clothes because we couldn t see anything in the dark but we figure it out late and the hotel said that the cleaners didn t find anything So we lost our staff because of their hurry to change room and they didn t care at all , New rooms clean close to the metro
394758,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Seemed the desk staff were a little standoffish and not as open and helpful as we would have liked , Location was convenient near Olympic Port area attractions and public transport Room was large and comfortable Breakfast was excellent with great variety 
394759,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, We were on the 3rd floor staying with a two year old There is some noise from the road Saturday night was the worst as there are some clubs nearby but after reading my Husbands review online the manager rang us asking if we wanted to get moved to a higher floor We had less than 24hours left at that point so it wasn t worth it for us to pack and move The wardrobe doors slide and bang at the slightest move great fun for our 2 year old but not so much for the neighbours Could also hear other people s wardrobes banging Add to that the doors to the room no soft closets on the doors mean you know whenever someone comes or goes on the floor The spa is nice enough with a square pool but not large enough for a swim They also only allow children in between the hours of 10 00 13 00 and you only get one visit upto 1 hour which on a 4 day stay is not enough in my opinion with the price changed for the room , The hotel is very clean and the staff are helpful Hotel is located less than 5 minutes from a metro station We had breakfast with the room and although it was more continental style everything was fresh and there was a wide choice High chairs available should you need one 
394760,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, There is a large Club next door and or People gathering on the streets until late hours of the night i e it is too loud to Keep the window open In the surrounding area there are few Options for having dinner Drinks however the nearest Metro Station is quite Close 2 blocks , The room was spacious and very clean
394761,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room though premium was dark airless and much like a coffin The lighting was by neon lights which gave the room the feeling of a kitchen The sink was blocked and the shampoo was never replaced, Not much was very happy to leave 
394762,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, There was very little I didn t like But to be super critical the soundproofing between room s is a little thin But it didn t spoil my stay But could if you had noisy neighbours , Fantastic hotel in a fantastic position Really close to everything you d ever need while visiting Barcelona Which is such a beautiful City I can t wait to return and when I do I ll be staying at the Salles Pere IV 
394763,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room needed a few things repairing the floor needed repairing as a panel from the wooden floor was loose and the extractor fan in the bathroom wasn t working Also we were looking forward to the spa which is a reason why we stayed at the Salles but what wasn t made aware was that you only had an hours free access to the spa and that you had to wear flip flops and wear a swimming hat if you wanted to go in the pool at a cost of 5 euros per person , The buffet breakfast was excellent with a lot of choice the hotel was very clean and the staff friendly 
394764,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Room was noisy from the traffic on the road but suppose it s city centre Room felt tired and dated , Friendly staff good location great bakery on road behind with great food 
394765,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Unlimited spa Didn t appreciate having to pay for slippers and cap , Very clean comfy convenient Liked 1 hr complimentary spa main reason for booking over others 
394766,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The spar is advertised as inclusive but you only got one free use we stayed 4 nights and had to ask for some additional vouchers Annoyingly you had to purchase the spar flip flops and swim cap at 5 Euro each this was the only small issues but overall hotel was great and would recommend , The breakfasts were exceptional so so much choice The staff were friendly and helpful
394767,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Room was too dark However that is an issue of mine My partner had no problem whatsoever with that , I absolutely loved the spa and the extremely friendly staff members working there After a exhausting day sightseeing and walking nothing more relaxing than spending an hour in the spa The location was really good with an underground station just a few minutes from our hotel Which we also liked 
394768,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, My Fitbit was stolen out of my room when I reported it the front desk and management staff they did absolutely nothing I was instructed to report it to the police myself even it was stolen on their property , New room was ok
394769,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Neighborhood is not so good even if location is pretty close to the beach and city center , Kindly staff free 1 hour SPA facilities included room was clean lovely and spacious 
394770,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room had been supposedly upgraded but was very small and overlooked a tile courtyard that echoed every tiny noise I was awakened several nights by disputes partyers and noise , The lobby was nice and presented a nice atmosphere The breakfast was fantastic but expensive 
394771,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Coming home again at the end of our stay , Staff were friendly welcoming and helpful accommodation was absolutely lovely we received a free upgrade because our room had been taken by the time we got there well decorated beautiful amenities 
394772,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Its not in a walking distance from city center Not good wifi on the 4th floor , Good hotel clean good SPA Good breakfast and friendly staff Will go again 
394773,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The area the hotel is in does not reflect the hotel at all quite run down area but 5 min walk and that changes, Hotel is stunning and very clean spa is great food is beautiful staff go above and beyond Short walk to beach city centre and metro station ia near by 
394774,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Limited to hotel restaurant and one next door Realising overcharge of taxi from airport to hotel when pre booked from hotel to airport better service and fixed price 10 euros cheaper , Well stocked varied breakfast Friendly helpful staff
394775,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, No English tv channels although they have satellite tv pool was cold and small No signage in one of the lifts so how do you know what floor things are on No water in room for a 4 star should have free water Lots of other issues too many to list, Nothing really very bad 4 star hotel
394776,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The first room we were given had only one window which was closed in around the building from the inside Also the aircon could only go down to 21 degrees This was fixed when we got moved to another room Upon booking the rooms it was confusing as to whether we were getting one double bed and a sofa bed or two single beds as there were 4 of us , The breakfast staff were very friendly Aziz and Fernanda were lovely The rest of the staff were very helpful The view from our second room on the 9th floor was amazing Very clean 
394777,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Extra charge to use spa facilities 5 euro if you dont have plastic flip flops and a swim cap Hotel isnt within walking distance of any good bars shops or places to eat only ten minutes on the bus or in a taxi though, Pool and steam rooms were nice although limited to one hour a day
394778,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Hot Breakfast area was cold Cold bacon sausages eggs , Good location and clean comfy rooms Spa facilities was a nice bonus after all the walking in Barcelona but would have been even better if there was a Jacuzzi Cold breakfast area good selection with some great pastries 
394779,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, No mention on website or at check in about need to have swimming cap and flip flops for Spa Clearly we could have bought these with us if we had known but had to pay 5EUROpp to buy new ones in order to able to access Spa Then no control in the spa over people using them as many people went in but didn t wear the hats at all , Very clean good location
394780,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Room 712 our room HEAVILY smelled of solvent pain We had to keep the window open to mitigate the smell Our air conditioning was poor It struggled to cope in 18 to 22 degree temperatures I d hate to stay there in the warmer summer months The toilet cistern was faulty After flushing the toilet there was a knack to getting the water to stop emptying in to the toilet Annoying when trying to sleep in the early hours of the morning No bath my partner was gutted she couldn t soak in the bath after a day out in Barcelona Breakfast 15 euro per person I was in a family of four 60 euros per day If you are staying for more than a few days you are better off buying lots of nice stuff from the numerous supermarkets around at a fraction of the price You need to bring buy a swim cap and flip flops if you wish to use the hotel spa You only have a pre bookable hour per day Note the pool is about 15ft square , A good large flat screen wall mounted t v A large shower 
394781,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The staff was just okay They didn t tell us our appointment time had been moved until the morning of and took 4 hours to deliver an iron The pillows were awful for anyone who doesn t sleep like Snow White perfectly on their back they were just a extra long tube of uncomfort And the room smelt like fresh paint the entire time even with the window open , The location was nice away from the city but not dead at night and only a 15min walk to the beach And the dinner food was delicious 
394782,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Staff were not very receptive we complained about noise from the room next door nothing was done about it On the second night we were moved to a new room that was not clean and had insufficient bedding We asked for more blankets after three calls to reception and a 2 hour wait 2 blankets were delivered to our room to be shared by the 4 occupants in the room We were also charged a random amount for breakfast when we did not consume any ,No Positive
394783,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, There weren t bathrobe and sandal in the chambre when I call the reception and ask the bathrobe he can t understand Finally I searched the word in Spanish Anyway its NOT IMPORTANT my s jour was great, This hotel has just decorated bright and chic location quite good 10 mins walk to the olympique port The breakfast was excellent lot of choices if u want to use the spa u have to change at your room and DONT FORGET THE swimming CAP they sell the cap 3 its fine the sauna space of spa kind of small but any way it was nice as well
394784,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I paid for a double room with access to the Spa and when I got there they made us pay for plastic flipflops and for swimming hats Even though they were not expensive I didn t like how they were imposed on us something along the lines of you have to buy or you don t get into the spa You could have included that cost into the room from the begining Everywhere I ve been before i was provided with everything needed for accessing the Spa Also the Spa facility itself is quite small and crowded and I ve seen people having arguments because they were taking each others flipflops The Spa didn t offered the relaxing experience I was looking for Also the bathrobes provided were ripped and quite in bad shape , The facilities of the hotel were decent and the room was clean 
394785,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Was a little bit further out than i thought but really only about 10 minutes to the marina area Taxi s are extremely cheap in Barcelona so it wasn t a big issue, Staff were great and it was clean and tidy
394786,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Area around hotel is not that attractive, The view from terrace wifi Close to metro station Relativelly close to the beach up to 15 mins renting a bicycle is recommended 
394787,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Very outdated hotel but I understand the hotel is closing over winter 2016 for a full refund , Great breakfast selection Very clean hotel Staff friendly and accommodating 
394788,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, A bit off center of BCN but not a problem actually same level of comfort in center would cost much more Free Wifi is in room but connection is poor most of the time Breakfast for extra charge and too expensive , Clean and above standard for this price in Barcelona 
394789,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Little far from interest points in the city The decoration can use a renovation , Comfortable bed spacious room Ample variety of items to choose from for breakfast buffet
394790,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Tea coffee making facilities would have been nice in the room also an iron to refresh clothes , Beautiful hotel Comfortable beds Cold water and juice was very welcome Great shower No complaints 
394791,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Poor wifi in rooms Jacuzzi in spa out of order , Near metro and very helpful staff Lovely big room with extras in bathroom Lots of storage to hang clothes Lovely bar next door Area felt safe and friendly 
394792,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The spa was being maintained so we did not have the use of this it was disappointing as this was the main reason we booked the hotel but it didn t spoil our holiday , It was a quiet area but within walking distance of the city and the beach the staff were very nice and the breakfast was excellent 
394793,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Nothing, Very helpful staff on reception very clean room comfy beds spacious and airy room v silent great blinds and air conditioning poorer WiFi during busy evening hours but perfect on a morning beautifully decorated rooms and holloway nice spa with free access as extra bonus and perfect location for city visits 7 min walks to the beach tube 2 min overall very pleasant hotel i already recommended x except toilet cubicle you have got bidet ha ha x
394794,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Tub had a big crack on the centre of the edge Lighting was poor for seeing in the mirror to apply makeup No reading lamp above bed Shuttle to airport pickngo recommended by hotel the car was not fit to be on the road , Front desk staff Anastasia gave excellent suggestions and recommendations
394795,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Widely varying room rate depending on bookings , 4Star Beautiful large modern Room with comfortable bed couch large flatscreen tv quite 15 minutes walk to beach and Port Olimpic fast free wifi 
394796,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Small room Spa jacussi out of order Couldn t use spa the afternoon of check out day , Hotel exterior and lobby looked classy and helpful staff at reception Extra beds in the room would br great if travelling with a family The Spa
394797,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The only negative thing was the double bed composed by 2 single beds even if I asked to have a whole one However they offered to have a whole bed changing room on the 3rd day , Wonderful hotel very clean friendly and helpful staff really good breakfast with fresh fruit and bread and many other things elegant and spacious rooms 
394798,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Tv didn t work and for all they re trying they couldn t fix it, It your going for a lads night out This hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of the best clubs in town
394799,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The smell in the street but this wasn t the hotel s fault, I loved the spa facilities in the hotel We didn t like our initial room top floor as smelly and had a view of a wall The reception staff were really helpful and offered to show us an alternative room on the 3rd floor which was bigger and had a better view They were patient and welcoming The bar man told us about an residential area full of restaurants caf and shops called Ramblas De Problenou worth the visit
394800,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The pictures of the room we booked did not correspond to the real one we had The staff on the reception did not want to do anything about it giving strange explanation that the room we booked was even smaller then the one we got which of course was not true , The hotel is quite close to the beach and beautiful Ciutadella park is 10 min walk Housekeeping did a good job 
394801,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Jacuzzi was out of order No outdoor seating area anywhere in hotel , Excellent breakfast selection Nice hotel bar and close to metro stop 15min walk to beach marina 
394802,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location of the hotel was in a very run down part of Barcelona lots of businesses closed paths poorly maintained , We liked everything about the hotel the plug in the basin didn t seal properly but this was a minor problem
394803,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Outside of the hotel was not good very dirty and many places closed and run down which was sad to see but we never felt unsafe in any way However we were just a five minute walk from the nearest Metro and we used the public transport during our stay which was excellent , Everything about this hotel was superb and we would recommend it to anyone 
394804,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, the rooms are really small as well the bed It is possible to hear all the rumors from one room to the other , Yes the croissants are very tasty as well the rest of the breakfast was good the underground is close to the hotel 
394805,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The breakfast is quite expensive so we skipped it , The location is great as it is not too far from the beach 10min walking distance The staff was friendly and helpful 
394806,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, See the previous question and the breakfast is not 4star breakfast More like cheap hostel breakfast, The beds Great housekeeping service but bathrooms a bit moldy
394807,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Hotel is old and look more a 3 stars than a 4 Bathroom was not clean properly and room very was old with broken furnitures Yet the window was small and looking at the inside courtyard over the pool So the smell of the pool was all over and the window could not be kept open no fresh air and no light in the room , Location central and close to the sea
394808,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Despite the hotel stating that wi fi was accessible in a majority of the areas of the hotel including hotel rooms we could not access wi fi satisfactorily and was either very slow or no access at all I found this quite disappointing and misleading on the hotel s behalf The wi fi seemed to work better once in the hotel reception lobby but for I m sure for most guests staying at the hotel it would be more convenient if adequate wi fi access was available from their own rooms too Also the walls between rooms appeared to be quite thin as there were times that we could hear sounds walking shouting etc from other nearby guests , Overall cleanliness of the hotel was good and all of the staff were helpful and polite Cleaning service to the hotel room was efficient and good The hotel was of a good standard and we both enjoyed our stay whilst there 
394809,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Arranged for shuttle to airport we thought next morning we were told the shuttle was not coming but we could take a taxi for same price Front staff person arranged and said they would go with us but they did not they just sent us to taxi area There was confusion due to language barriers finally sorted out no thanks to hotel They knew we were English speaking they could have helped out but did not Sour experience to end vacation Overall Hotel was just OK would not recommend to others ,No Positive
394810,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Nothing i can think of , The hotel was lovely The room for 4 was a bit small Air con brill and no noise so we could have a good sleep Dinner at the hotel was good but a limited menu especially for a vegetarian The bar was lovely with hugh TVS Staff at reception were really helpful with our queries about places we wanted to visit printing out tickets for venues we visited organising taxis for our early morning trip to Girona Airport We only stayed 2 nights but in the two days we walked to Las Ramblas and it was a lovely walk from hotel through a Gorgeous park to get there 10mins The beach was about 15 min walk away The metro is only 5 mins walk to get you to anywhere in the city 
394811,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It s not a 4 hotel In a rooms don t have any napkins teapot cups and other little things Breakfast is a poor have only variety of sandwiches , Design is ok
394812,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Wi fi is terrible at the rooms We had to go to the lobby almost every time we need wi fi connection The connection was good at the lobby , The staff was generally helpful and professional Very close to metro station 
394813,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, 1 the Spa pool has no changing room people used the one toilet which was swimming with water as a result 2 one morning I fell on the bathroom floor when stepping out of the bath shower The floor was marble and despite using the bathmat and holding the handle I still managed to slip The floor was actually quite wet from the shower I hurt myself and decided to report it to Reception so they could take action to minimise the chance of a repeat by someone else The Receptionist was fine and said she would tell her manager when he had finished with another customer I sat on a Reception sofa and despite being there for 15minutes no one approached me My family and I were leaving for sightseeing so I didn t wait any longer A very disappointing lack of response from the Manager An acknowledgement of what had happened and some sympathy for my pain would have been the right response , The room we had was a good size and we also liked the small bar cafe It had nice waiters and great tapas Also the hotel is very close to the Metro 
394814,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The breakfast is expensive 15euro you have a lot of cold food and also coffee included but I think the wright price I think it is closed to 10euro The food on restaurant on ground floor is not the best The Rooms walls are a little bit thinner , The position is perfect if you stay more days and you re looking for a hotel to be closed to beach and also closed to center of town The area around is not the best but the neighborhood in general is ok The rooms are beautiful big clean and they have also comfortable beds 
394815,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room should have been in better condition Some things in the room needed repairing the mirror of the wardrobe was broken a part of the wall was damaged in the corner the bathtub was in a poor condition ,No Positive
394816,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Problem at check in with stuff view from the room very bad no fresh air No brush for toilet refrigerator did not work Very noisy housekeeper in the early morning Bed could be more bigger, Location is good near metro Air condiotion work good Clean 
394817,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Not the best neighbourhood But great if your happy to walk or pay for a taxi Taxis are very cheap Hotel bar closed quite early Spa pool was heated which would be great in winter but on a 30 summers day not the best Wifi was shocking in our room could nearly use Facebook It wasn t much better in the hotel lobby , Hotel bar as a good selection and always music clips playing Room had a balcony It didn t have a view but there was still a good sized balcony Room was big so it didn t feel like you are on top of each other Spa pool available but only at an extra cost 
394818,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The staff mainly the male staff were occasionally rude arrogant and superior and could make you feel stupid when asking a simple question as whether it was possible to book a taxi to the airport for the next morning , Relatively close to the beach approx 10 min walk and to the Barri Gotic 20 min walk Clean nice rooms with a lovely view 
394819,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I didn t like breakfast at all not much choice poor quality juices and coffes weren t nice also, The room was fairly good spacious with a big bed and lots of mirrors
394820,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The hotel is not new so could do with some upgrade simplyfy walls decor plaster them flat paint warm neutral colours but everything was in working order , Staff went extra mile It was my partners Birthday trip They have upgraded us and next day gave a little cava as a birthday treat I also ordered cava prior arrival and that was waiting for us cooled down Had a top floor room with some amazing views Metro station is close Area is quiet but it s 15 min walking from a party hub Staff is helpful It was a great price comparing other 4 hotels 
394821,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Breakfast was reach but same foods all days on 10 00 a m the stuff didn t like to put more foods even it was untill 10 30 if we said add some food they didn t do it , Location stuff on reception politely facility 
394822,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, The most wonderful hotel that I have stayed in Staff very friendly and cheerful Nothing was too much trouble Right near a metro station and easy reach of the beach Breakfast was buffet style and plenty of choices Sauna steam room and a little pool great for unwinding and a gym for a work out Will stay here again 
394823,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The hotel restaurant food was very poor and that was after 4 returned starters 2 of which were poorly reheated chicken and unhelpful staff However the food in the bar and breakfast was much better , Very nice hotel my friends and I had a family room which came with 2 comfortable single beds and a double We were surprised how much space there was The hotel staff were incredibly helpful the spa facilities were nice if a little tired and the breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice We would definitely come back again 
394824,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, A balcony would have been nice but unfortunately I didn t see any balcony rooms Also didnt like the fact that there were dolls in the showcase cabinets in reception Just made the hotel look dated and spoiled the look of reception but it didn t effect our stay at the hotel , Very helpful staff and assisted everytime I required help The breakfast was amazing fresh food every day Housekeeping were punctual and rooms er vice was great The spa Was relaxing 
394825,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, having to come home , excellent hotel if taking a short break or long holiday this is the hotel to stay in it has everything you need The staff are all about customer service and making sure you are happy Very professional and friendly staff Amazing food great location and first class service thank you for a great holiday 
394826,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Mostly location it was a cab ride to Las Ramblas about 6 euros each way, Very good choice and quality that was still well stocked even at the end of a long breakfast period
394827,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Spa felt unclean and old fashioned Out of order in parts Tiny and disappointing Reception staff females were not very welcoming , Rooms very comfortable and spacious Housekeeping staff and bar cafe staff lovely Ok location if you don t mind a walk which we didn t mind 
394828,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The air conditioning in the room was very poor In fact we moved rooms once because the air wasn t working well and we were staying 3 nights But then the air in the second room also wasn t working well We had to sleep on top of the covers Also the buffet breakfast was very expensive at 15 Euro per person , It did have a spa with a heated pool and sauna Location wise it was about a 25minute walk from the beach and Olympic Port but was not that close to the Born or Gothic districts old town area You will have to use the metro to get there unless you like to walk 
394829,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, , hotel was clean and room very cosy stuff was friendly and very helpful Location is great 10 min walk from the beach metro just around the corner very easy to get to hotel from airport 
394830,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Rooms poor standard WIFI in our room was there wasn t at all had to go out to the hallway broken flash no kettle in the room , Close to the beach 10 mins walk very good food and nice staff
394831,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, N a, We stayed seven nights That was second time my wife and I visited this hotel and when we get back to Barcelona we will come again Absolutely everything was perfect
394832,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel room it was clean and nice designed We asked the staff about hotel room with balcony and they booked this room for us in advance The only thing what we didn t like it was the wellness room not tidy and the whirpool didn t work But all hotel services were good and staff was friendly We can recommend this hotel 
394833,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, A little bit out from the centre so taxis to get everywhere Taxi rank outside the hotel was handy , Clean modern with great facilities Spa pool steam room etc
394834,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Missed toilet brush in the bathroom and did not like to use the hair body gel for my hair for body it is fine , Friendly staff good location comfortable bed nice breakfast
394835,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Change in the Breakfast menu, Breakfast was sumptuous and yummy and the hospitality of the hotel staff and reception staff were very satisfying and knowledgeable the rooms and bathrooms were spick and span except for the fact that the location was lil far from the centre but compromised with the 2 metro stations at walkable distance overall enjoyed the stay
394836,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I booked with booking com and upon showing them my printed booking information the receptionist said it has been cancelled i mentioned to them what has gone wrong and proved them that it has been confirmed afterwards The staff didn t even tried to check or phone the booking com to confirm my reservation Instead they asked us to pay in advance for the full payment of my reservation which contradicts the rules i have read in the policy of the hotel My family is tired at that moment thats why i didnt make any arguments about the situation Hoping in the future the staff will try to learn how to resolve the matter which is fair on both sides of party and will be able to speak or discuss the problem among them in english rather than them speaking in spanish because its really rude , the facilities cleanliness and location is above satisfaction 
394837,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The cleaners were very loud each morning only downfall , The beds were very wide and spacious The hotel is beautifully decorated Staff were friendly and helpful 
394838,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The pool was a little smaller and the gym didn t quite have as much equipment as anticipated , The location was perfect for us close enough to the festival and attractions could walk to the park in 20 minutes The room was great blackouts curtains essential and the staff helpful We enjoyed the pool and sauna to relax in during the day it also wasn t busy or noisy 
394839,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Coming home , We went for the MotoGP and I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to the circuit or looking for a place close to the beach but away from the hussle and bustle of the main strip Excellent value for money rooms very clean and tidy staff couldn t be more helpful and welcoming Only a 10 min walk from the beach and Nord bus station Anyone who says it s an hour walk to the beach either walks very slow or went the wrong way Spa was lovely great place to relax after a long day at the circuit or site seeing Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from close by Already looking to rebook for next year 
394840,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Hotel is situated in the industrial area that could scare initially but nothing really dangerous we have noticed even when we walking at 11pm back to hotel Room had a bad smell due to the stale air in it which was not good even after good cleaning if windows are closed the bad smell will return You have to pay for safe and it is only could be locked by key so you have to carry key with you Strange nowadays when all safes are code locked Good flat screen TV in the room but really you cannot watch anything as there are no many channels even in English , Hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Bogatell metro station that takes you to any point in Barcelona It is also 15 minutes walk from the beach and pier with lots of restaurants Not far from the airport just 20 minutes drive Room was big enough Towels were changed every day if you stick please make my room label at the door Even when we hanged do not disturb we received envelope with message that if we still our room to be cleaned we can let reception know by 6pm Breakfast is good with all you need really in the morning 
394841,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It s location was a bit of a shock at first when we arrived at night but once we realised graffiti was everywhere in Barcelona the location of the hotel was all right , Very friendly and helpful staff and our room came with a balcony that we did not know about which came with fab views so a big plus Very near a metro station and in a good location to get into the centre of Barcelona or to the beach Very pleasant hotel at a very good price very impressed 
394842,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The hotel was reasonable the staff was not nice and professional Ask for recommendations for breakfast and the guy at reception did not know where to send us Not nice we asked for towels for shower had to wait over 30 minutes,No Positive
394843,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Maybe could provide tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom , Excellent continental and other choices of breakfast Spa facilities good powerful steam room and sensation showers in pool 
394844,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Had one meal in the hotel restaurant which I didn t really enjoy not good value for money , 2 minutes walk and super handy for the metro which is only 4 stops to the congress centre Great little Spanish bar round the corner 
394845,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Area is a little industrial and noisy take earplugs Swimming pool is a big bath tab too hot don t expect you will be able to work out there Staff not always speaks good English but helpful , Great bed nicely decorated everything is on a good level 10 min walk to a beach Good restaurant ok breakfast though a little pricy Water at the bar even late at night Transfer from the airport very good 
394846,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Internet connection wifi was really bad , Almost everything was great I recommend this hotel Pool was also great relaxation after long walks in the city 
394847,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, The overall atmosphere and hospitality of the hotel was very good The staff were very good helpful and the bar staff excellent I look forward to re visiting the hotel in the future 
394848,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Very clean friendly hotel Comfortable stay and staff happy to help with any queries Little far to walk to the tourist parts of Barcelona Only around 7 euros in a taxi though and there is a taxi rank 30 seconds from the hotel Overall nice stay 
394849,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I stayed at Salles Hotel Pere IV with my family from the 16th of May to the 20th A few days ago I sent a request to the hotel through booking com for an extra bed Even though the request came through confirmed by booking com we were told at the hotel that they hadn t recieve any of such matter It was on short notice so I guess it was understandable We were asked to pay an extra 140 euros 35 extra for 4 nights and we agreed to it When we checked out we saw that the price was a bit higher than expected Never thinking a 4 star hotel would do such a thing we only gave the hotel receipt a quick look didn t notice they had charged us 40 euros per night for our extra guest and not 35 So that s a 20 euros burn on our side and plus on theirs I would recommend everyone to not make the same mistake as we did and allow this happen to you Definitely not worth staying and I won t be returning there next time I visit Barcelona ,No Positive
394850,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The rooms we noisey due to very thin walls You could here people going to the toilet and in the shower from the bedroom, The view from balcony overlooking the buildings Free toiletries
394851,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The rooms are not too good soundproofed Even though the hotel is near two metro stations 5 and 10 min away the hotel is located in an area that looks more like an industrial one , A good hotel with very nice rooms The price is excellent and the staff is very helpful We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel after check out 
394852,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, In a slightly quieter part of town but about 10 minute walk from the beach Not for those who want to be closer to the more happening spots in town , The rooms are quite good including a balcony The breakfast spread had good variety 
394853,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, This is a non smoking hotel but our room smelt of cigarette smoke The staff worked very hard to get rid of this and did eventually succeed There were no coffee making facilities in the room and we had to ask many times before we got a kettle which were in limited supply You had to pay extra for WiFi and although there was a safe in our room we had to pay extra to use it The location was alot further away from the city centre than we had imagined , It was a very well appointed hotel and everything was clean and spacious with beautiful marble floors The bar was welcoming and relaxing The tapas meal we had one evening was absolutely delicious The Breakfast restaurant was brilliant and you had a vast array of foods to choose from English and Mediterranean You were never rushed and could help yourself to seconds and refills as often as you liked before leaving for the day There were always staff on reception and they were very friendly and helpful and they spoke very good English which was great We didn t get the room we requested but were given an extra large one to make up for it The Metro was a 10 minute walk away and the Taxis were on the corner just outside the hotel 
394854,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, We were travelling with a small baby and I don t know if they put us on a kiddie floor but there were a bunch of unsupervised children running around at 10pm on Fri and Sat At one point even playing football Not the hotel s fault I guess but it was incredibly annoying , Amazing brekkie massive bed lovely staff 
394855,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The wifi is totally out of time and works aweful Actually I log in this page at this time is just to share with my anger about it s wifi , location is near to my client and easy to take a taxi 
394856,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, immediate area around hotel is a bit sparse and unwelcoming but it is only 10 mins from the old town and seafront promenade Breakfast would benefit with an egg omelette chef, Restaurant was lovely and on par with others in Barcelona for quality and price Staff friendly and helpful and my wife liked the decor and the Spa facilities Metro stop is 200 metres from hotel Pastries were excellent at Breakfast 
394857,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, We got very small and dark room There was hear noise from other rooms There is no cloakroom in SPA We had only tiny sheet for cover when we asked for normal quilt then we got only scratchy cover 20 EUR deposit for SPA towels and have to pay 1EUR per day for safe box why We wanted have a coffee in hotel cafe but we were waiting about 15 minutes without any effect there was two waiters behind bar , Hotel looks good and it s clean It s nearby metro station and close to city the center 
394858,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Staff was helpful room was great location was decent Only issue we had was a small ant problem which was weird since we were on the top floor Gym could use an update but we were there to explore not to workout The spa is amazing but I wish it would open earlier than 0900 
394859,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Found breakfast rather disappointing for 15 euros Dining area could be better planned at breakfast time flow of people disrupted somewhat e g glasses not placed near to where juice is obtained and queues for coffee machines , Staff were very helpful and approachable Decent sized room but needed another blanket as only one extra in twin bedded room Very kind of hotel to provide a kettle as requested in order to take medication 
394860,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Really good location 5 minutes walk to Bogatell Metro on Line 4 and 7 minutes walk to Marina Metro on Line 1 both with trains every 3 4 minutes fast into the city 10 minute walk to the Olympic Beach area with plenty of places to quench thirst on the way Rooms large and comfy There is a spa but we had no time to use it 
394861,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The spa was sparce not very clean in the pool It al looked tired not much space for clothing and changing and no one there checking , Lovely room and bathroom
394862,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, No coffee making facilities in the room but then I think it is not a standard in European hotels Maybe I m just used to hotels in England that it is standard to have complementary coffee making facilities in the room , Very friendly and accommodating staff Spa facilities are good rooms are spacious and quiet with the best black out curtains Their complimentary drinks in the fridge is a very nice touch and also I had a very pleasant and unexpected surprise when I was greeted with a card and wine for my birthday Thank you so much 
394863,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Fitness centre shouldn t be called fitness centre only 3 4 machines and swimming pool should be called leisure fun pool , Helpful staff members Good food 
394864,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Was able to leave my car in the secure hotel car park for the whole week Underground station close and on line which went right to city centre Good breakfast
394865,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The beds were not that comfortable and no A C in the room not a problem in April but I guess it will be in July Expensive breakfast at the hotel however we found several nice cafees just a little walk from the hotel We was charged for using the hotel room safe had to get the key from the reception first time I ve tried a hotel charging for this , Nicely located a little outside of the main tourist areas but still just 20 min by walk or 8 min by metro to get to downtown The pool area was nice for relaxation 
394866,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The evening staff were very indifferent things were a hassle for them Nothing could be brought to the room you had to go and get from reception eg the safe key the kettle from the bar Breakfast no muesli or porridge All the cereals were sugary and poor quality , The Spa was busy all the time but the steam room was a nice way to relax after a day of sight seeing About 30mins walk to central barcelona nice brisk walk was a good start to the day
394867,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Gym didn t really have enough equipment for an avid gym goer free weights only went up to 10kg and there was only 1 of these However this was only a slight disappointment as my stay was only a few days , Very nice hotel with charming clean rooms in an excellent location just a few stops from the marina and ramblas or even within walking distance if time isn t such an issue Parking was no problem and at a decent rate for the city 
394868,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Our initial room was too hot and no air was coming in the window I suspect due to the shape of the building air conditioning not effective , Staff were efficient and smiley Reception staff very good when my daughter became ill and the air conditioning in our room was not good they moved us to a fantastic room with a great breeze coming in the window Something for everyone at breakfast We had a bar meal that was nice and filling Drinks were good Pool small bur sufficient for a bit of a play my son loved it 10 minutes stroll to the beach for volleyball and food 2 mins walk to the metro The surrounding area is industrial workshops with some graffiti however we never felt unsafe 
394869,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The fitness room comprised of a treadmill elliptical and an incomplete set of dumbbells this was poor and misleading The d cor of our room was not reflected adequately by the pictures displayed on their website nor on booking com the furnishings are outdated and not as modern as shown online , Breakfast selection was reasonable hotel staff were friendly and the Sangria on tap was lovely 
394870,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Kids allowed to go wild in spa if parents not in control and when you go to relax its difficult could be managed better , Fantastic hotel very clean staff were fantastic shops is wonderful
394871,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Better cleaning in the spa more hot sauna no small kids screaming in spa better fitnessroom yogamats available , Breakfast was good nice big bed og big bathroom
394872,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Some of the staff were really friendly and nice however some of the staff were also not so friendly and helpful at all They also some heating costs such as safe locks and the spa was not as glamorous as I was expecting , I love the location it was only a 5 blocks away from the beach and only a few miles away from the city centre Also the rooms really clean and open space and super comfortable And majority of the staff could speak English and other languages which was quite useful The hotel also provide a shuttle bus service to the airport which was really great value for money 
394873,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Staff a bit rude and location isn t great There is a metro stop very close by though so you can get around the city form there , Really clean and comfortable hotel with a decent spa and big bed in the room Nice reception and bar area Very close to Metro station 
394874,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The breakfast could have been better , We liked the Spa pool during the week as weekend became very busy and the whole place was full and in general the hotel nice clean and staff very polite Location also is quite good overall good value for money 
394875,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Hotel room was in old style and the floor was demolished Breakfast was expensive extra 13 eur Lobby looks modern but room was in old style with broken floor and the walls had holes I was very negatively surprise Bad value for money Never again in this hotel, Staff was friendly
394876,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Genuinely nice staff although the bar man in late morning monday was rather moody To myself and another gentleman which I found uncalled for The room got very hot couldn t work out how to turn the air con on , Nice hotel Comfy bed rooms cleaned daily Complementary bar on arrival good location weekend has few clubs around but once the windows closed can t hear a thing But nothing to worry about made the evenings bit more lively around as very quiet in the day excellent black out curtains 
394877,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, the breakfast was not the best the first day the scrabled eggs were so bad we couldn t eat a bite the boild eggs must have been boiled for 20 30 minutes they were very hard and did not taste good the coffee machine was horrible neither the chocolate function or the capuchino function seem to work very well they both tasted the same the juice was not either of good quality and we scipped that all together,No Positive
394878,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location was poor Quite close to Bogatel metro but don t even try to get there from the airport as several changes of line are required The area around the hotel is industrialised and quite depressing, The leisure facilities including the pool and spa were very good The price of the hotel for Barcelona was very good

394885,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It would have been nice to have had tea and coffee making facilities in the room The bar staff were a little bit curt when they were busy Often not hearing and therefore not bring what you ordered correctly , We asked for a high room with a view and we were given exactly that 
394886,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Wifi could of been faster but who cares if you are there on vacation We wanted to use the Sauna Pool area it was sadly full of little kids screaming and opening sauna doors the whole time we left after 10 minutes This is not the Hotels fault , The Hotel was very well located and not hard to find The staff at the reception was very friendly and the check in went fast We were able to get to our room even tho it was only 10 am The room was quite big and so was the bathroom The staff at the bar made nice cocktails and also helped us out very well making choices where to eat in the city I also loved that in the shower bath they had a shampoo dispenser

394912,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room we had was too hot we complained to reception who told us to open the window This wouldn t have been a problem but for some other noisy hotel guests and our window was directly above the pool area too , Clean and well presented hotel Near to the Olympic Port area of the city with a good selection of restaurants and bars
394913,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I have left my bracelet at my room and I sent a letter to get my jewelery but the hotel wanted a MONEY for it So I have given up We wanted a meat breakfast and a vegetarian breakfast when we left early in the morning but we got 2 vegetarian breakfast Average breakfast for this STARS it not enough range Just Few fresh fruits 3 kind of sausages etc , Elegant Hotel Nice Clear Room

394919,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Need new towels in bathroom Need coffee tea facilities in bedroom Breakfast not recommended, 5 minute taxi ride from the centre so location ok not much very close to hotel spa was adaquate but jacuzzi not hot enough Towels in bathroom not the greatest and could do with larger towels 4 should really provide slippers in bedroom Bedroom ok but basic a kettle and tea coffee facilities would be nice Breakfast in hotel disappointing Reception staff very accomadating had to ask for sofa bed to be made up as hadnt prepared even though we had booked for 3 people Good value for the airport transfer
394920,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Indoor pool was pretty old not very appealing Surrounding of hotel is not very appealing wouldnt walk around at night Tourist tax was 10 EUR for 3 days Safe has to be paid extra 2 EUR a day , Staff was very helpful Early check in was no problem and a luggage room is available two metro stops within 10 mins walking Airport shuttle only 8 9 EUR p P First round of minbar was free 4 5 softdrinks water Beach approx 1 3 km away
394921,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, staff were not very knowledgeable, location was good as it was 5 mins walk from Metro station Bugatell 10 minutes walk to beach and shopping centres breakfast was ok and the pool facilities were great 
394922,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Just a little bit away from tourist area No tea coffee making facilities , Lovely spacious twin room and large bathroom Spa with themal pool and two different saunas Bar serving good snacks and delicious pizza Great breakfast 5min to metro 
394923,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Rooms location and spa, Tired unimaginative hotel which doesn t inspire one to enjoy The rooms are tired and required updating The spa is of poor quality 
394924,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It would be good to know the rules of SPA already during the booking process The policy to save water by not changing towels every day is good and was accepted by us We didn t ask to change the towels every day however we ended every day with differen situation one day they were changed another day only 2 out of 4 were changed and the next day we got only 3 out of 4 towels and etc It was still fine for us no problem but it looked strange , Friendly and helpful reception s staff spacious room good location Possibility to enjoy SPA after intensive day 
394925,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Furniture made bad there are no services does not answer you at the reception small pool breakfast is very bad no transfer bags factor, Good staff
394926,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Would say it s a low end 4 hotel if you re used to staying at 4 hotels I don t think it s a great 4 hotel to the extent the reviews say it is It isn t a bad hotel though it seems more like a very good 3 hotel , Price
394927,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location is not exactly central but it s fine if you re happy to take public transport which we didn t or walk for a minimum of 30 minutes to a lot of sightseeing spots , The room was very comfortable and everything clean Spa and gym access is a nice bonus the spa is small but the sauna and steam room are great 
394928,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The staff was not friendly not very professional the breakfast room was very impersonal there was no kleenex tissues available in the bedroom bathroom they were very cheap on the toiletries plastic soap dispenser with no shampoo no sleepers or bathrobe really not up to par for a so called 4 star hotel , Nothing in particular
394929,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Would have been useful to have shampoo and body lotion in the bathroom Spa very busy and nowhere to change , Comfortable quiet room Very clean and handy for the Metro 
394930,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Nothing, We got the rooftop room with our own balcony and living room It was an amazing room The bathroom is spacious Unfortunately we do not have time to try the Spa will for sure go back if in the future

394932,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Food Not much variety in buffet breakfast that we paid for Children did not eat as such They remained hungry Not every food item was labelled specially a bread with pork in it was not labelled Beds were separate too My husband and I slept on separate beds on a holiday we paid alot for How silly is that Our room did not have any views as such except a mosaic wall that was part of hotel , Communication with staff was easy Close to metro and other facilities

394935,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The room had no balcony like on the pictures Worse it didn t even have a real window i e an opening to the exterior allowing you to see the sky check the weather know if it s day or night etc It only had a window going to a sort of large inner ventilation shaft which had a roof and was very noisy , Good breakfast buffet clean room with parquet floor 
394936,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It seemed the walls are quite thin so sound would travel through from other rooms , The room was very clean and was a decent size especially the bathroom The staff were also very attentive 
394937,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Soap and shampoo samples would be better than the soap dispenser No coffee or tea making facilties in the rooms , Easy to get to with Metro close by and the beach 10 min walk Comfortable room and friendly staff Good selection for breakfast 
394938,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The spa was nice although it would have been good to have notice that slippers and swim cap were needed before we arrived , The beds were a good size The breakfast was good with a wide choice each day 
394939,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Free minibar was an over statement could have an alcoholic drink at least one water topped up regularly would have been appreciated Kettle in room to make a tea coffee would have been good Didn t like the hotel policy of wanting a photo copy of the front reverse of the card I wanted to pay my bill on As I actually wanted to pay b4 I arrived In the end I paid after my stay Just think that is a rather odd request as I was paying beforehand why to have those details if they were getting paid , Comfy bed clean safe deposit box though do think there shouldn t really have been a charge for this 
394940,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, wimming pool had broken rungs on ladder into pool and was dangerous and unusable, there were 13 of us and breakfast staff arranged 2 long tables for us Bar staff were very helpful beach and city centre all within 20 mins walking distance
394941,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Step down in bedroom could be dangerous Soap dispensers in bad positions Very slippery when standing in bath while showering , Relaxed atmosphere Easy distance to tourist bus shops and beach Excellent meals and good value 
394942,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Coffee in breakfast room insipid Steep access to car park Need to enforce Spa rules i e nobody seen wearing bathing caps naked man in sauna this isn t Germany after all , Free mini bar Toiletries in bathroom Generous sized beds 
394943,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Breakfast is overpriced at 13 euro The location wasn t bad but we weren t hanging out in this neighborhood at all we were constantly taking taxis to other neighborhoods There are a couple of bars around the area but nothing too exciting , This hotel was a good price with great staff and lovely rooms that were a great fit for our stay We only used the breakfast service once but there was a lot of variety Metro stops are very close 
394944,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, I couldn t get the temp in room up The restaurant was poor considering it was a 4 star hotel part of order was forgotten waiter was rushed breadsticks seemed stale and I don t know what the sauce was with Salmon but it didn t look enticing and I didn t dare try not a neighbourhood where I d feel comfortable going out after 10pm or so , The room had wooden floorboards always appreciate over carpets Nice decor Clean 
394945,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Nothing really, Just right for what we needed Away from the hustle and bustle but near enough to the beach and city sights if wished Loved De last rambles for locals not to be mistaken for the one starting at Christopher column bus statue 
394946,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Not in the best location but taxis are easy and close to the tube metro price the room rate was way too much for the hotel and rooms Breakfast 13 euros just too much for the breakfast it was not worth it so I went to the cafe over the road and also the one just around the corner had a great breakfast for 5 euros don t get me wrong I have a good stay but the price was not in line with what you experienced Richard, Clean rooms free bathroom items i really needed a shave haha Bed a little small mattress ok air con good staff good Good shuttle bus to the airport just 12 euros better than 35 in a taxi only takes 20 mins Bar ok put the Spurs game on for me Spa was ok not too much to get excited about Richard
394947,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, It s far from the city center thus you can go with the metro anywhere very close to bogotel stationed went to eat breakfest and pay cash this when we come to pay the final bill at the che k out the resepthion told us to pay again they tried to see if they can charge us twice , The spa is very good and the accomedation is nice
394948,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Don t get fooled by the number of stars at the front door this is not a 4 star hotel Maybe on paper it is but in the real life The staff is acting at the limit of disrespect whilst the facilities spa LOL are to be totally avoided for the interest of health and safety Half of the rooms have no windows to outside but to the closed inner building which means no fresh air but bad smell and non stop noise from the air conditioning installation I had to beg for a proper room we slept one night in the initial room and when I thought I finally got it I realised that down stairs there is a pub very popular amongst noisy people and which closes with the last customer usually 01 00am The Wi Fi is annoying to say the least and I could go on, They cleaned the room daily The huge screen in the lobby Unfortunately they only show FC Barcelona
394949,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The location of the hotel is not so great Its situated in an industrial area and our room was overlooking the wall of a delapidated building Its approx 25 min walk to the beach and Las Ramblas Closest public transport point which we could see was approx 10 min walk The room had a strange smell like it was a smoking room or something , The room itself was comfortable and clean 
394950,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, A disappointment was the pool Broken ladder with bottom rung missing made it difficult and dangerous to get in or out of pool Our group were in age range 45 88 and most of could not use the pool due to this, Very helpful staff Breakfast waiters moved tables to accommodate our group of 13 in tables close together Likewise reception staff tried to put all group in rooms close together 
394951,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Breakfast was mediocre Location also not the best though it was close to the subway , The staff was great and helpful Room was quite clean and enjoyed my room with the outdoor loft area 
394952,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Everything from the location to the greeting the room was good the breakfast was ample and all too soon I was leaving I recommend it to anyone I wish I had more time to enjoy the facilities in the hotel maybe next time Thank you 
394953,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Mattress was not comfortable Need to pay for the key for the safe 2 euros per night I was exempt as I stayed for 10 nights Breakfast was over priced for what you get For that price outside you could get a really nice breakfast in Barcelona Instant coffee machine poor quality coffee No coffee on room They kindly provide you with a shaving kit but the shaving blade was far worst than the single use disposable ones , Clean Next to metro station Nice staff Free upgrade to junior suit
394954,Sall s Hotel Pere IV,No Negative, Loved the place Very clean and comfortable Nice pool and spa The staff was friendly and helpful Close to a metro station and 10 minutes walk away from the beach Highly recommended 
394955,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Nothing to complain about , The hotel is well situated 15 minutes walk from the beach and less then 5 minutes walk from a tube station The room we were given was great with a big balcony The hotel is calm and the staff is friendly and professional 
394956,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Everything other than WiFi had to be paid for Makes no sense to charge for internet when you offer free WiFi And they were not able to tell me which version of internet explorer they have You have to pay for the safe in your room for weighing your luggage on the scale for use of the lockers in the spa That is a turn off These things are normally standard Most of the jets in the jacuzzi didn t work , They gave me a room immediately although it was a single bed Staff friendly and helpful 
394957,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The smell of chlorine from the spa Crazy elevator that stopped on every floor The toilet flushing by itself it was fixed during the stay though Fantastic view to the neighbour windows and SPA Very small room , The sea was not so far away from the hotel 
394958,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, neighborhood had MANY closed stores restaurants Graffitti everywhere on all streets nearby Not hotel s fault but makes location less desirable for strolling about especially at night Towels were very old thin 3 days out of 6 , Staff was excellent helpful courteous and knowledgable about Barcelona and environs 
394959,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, Furniture in the room looked tired They installed cheap laminate floors which made a squeaky noise even while walking with no shoes on The board at the edge of the laminate was loose and made a clapping sound every time your stepped on it Bathroom door wouldn t close unless slammed hardly Bathrooms towels old and scratchy Our window faced a tight squared enclosed outdoor space on top of the swimming pool which had a glass top so you can see people inside the pool from your window If you open the window you can smell all the chlorine from the pool and of course zero sunlight as it was facing the enclosed space with other rooms windows Our room rate included the so called SPA access which is basically a mini pool 1 meter to 1 2 meters deep a tiny Jacuzzi for 2 people a mini sauna for 4 people a mini steam room and 4 dark shower cabins The SPA has no changing rooms and provides no towels You have to come prepared swimsuit on and bring your towels from your room The lockers are in the same space with the pool area and did not lock at all Supposedly you have to insert a 1 euro coin and the key will release I inserted 1 euro and the key did not release eating my coin Most of the lockers were occupied and all the keys were in the lockers with someone s stuff in it You basically leave your belonging unlocked and unattended Since there are no changing rooms and floors are all wet you simply have to wrap the towel around you and walk to your room in your wet swimsuit Not sure why this was called a SPA We saw no attendants of any kind in the SPA area to address our concerns and questions Next morning around 9am the cleaning lady enters the room unannounced She saw me in my underwear and quickly exited saying sorry in Spanish Downstairs restaurant food was not good Location was close to a metro station however the neighborhood itself looked abandoned semi industrial area with lots of graffiti and boarded up businesses , Quick and efficient check in Reception staff accommodating and spoke good English Well organized baggage room Excellent breakfast 
394960,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The safe was too small and was not free There are no tea coffee making facilities in the room , Friendly professional staff Location in a quiet area and near a Metro station My room on the 8th floor had a terrace with great views

394962,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, The walls very thin and I could hear the neightboors The swimming pool was smaller than on the pictures and the air conditionar in the hotel was set tu very cold compared to outside Outside it was approximately 30 35 degrees but inside of the hotel it was maybe 17 19 , The personal was very friendly and spook English They always advised and tried to help The room was always very clean 
394963,Sall s Hotel Pere IV, ants in the bathroom 1st day lots of ants we complained then more or less one or two ants remained in the following days ill, The locate is good 3 mins walk to underground L4 which is a great line that stops at major scenery spots Lobby bar is also good the hotel staff r helpful
