220441,Newhotel Roblin, Room could do with a little smartening up I guess this is just general wear and tear Definitely wouldn t put me off coming back though , Amazing location in Paris Hotel staff were friendly and welcoming the hotel itself was great our room looked slightly tired and could do with a bit of a touch up bit it was still very nice Lovely free Hermes bathroom supplies this was nice touch Loved the view from the window onto the street Really luxurious late check out time Thank you 
220442,Newhotel Roblin, We paid for bed and breakfast however I would recommend room only in future Breakfast is served until 10 30am however when we arrived for breakfast at 10 00am the majority of the food was gone and there wasn t really anything left and we had to go buy breakfast elsewhere Waste of money , Lovely hotel great location in the beautiful Madeline area of Paris Just around the corner from the metro Very clean rooms 
220443,Newhotel Roblin, Cleaning staff entered room while the do not disturb sign was up to indicate we did not need cleaning Croissants day old on sunday breakfast not up to the standard the rest of the hotel carries , Great beds quiet rooms and beautiful hotel close to metro tourist busses and walking distance from great hotels and Place de la Concorde 
220444,Newhotel Roblin, The desk staff were rude not helpful at all the concierge during the week was outstanding as was the restaurant manager , Gorgeous building excellent location
220445,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The hotel is situated in the center of Paris very close to everything Close to restaurants shops transport But when you walk inside you feel so calm Breakfasts are tasty 
220446,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, We just loved the ambience location friendliness Overall a WINNER Will def b back Just a pity my previous 9 times to Paris not aware of this gem 
220447,Newhotel Roblin, Nothing , The hotel was is in a very good location and everything about the hotel was so good from the first moment we arrived to when we left the service went beyond expectation 
220448,Newhotel Roblin, Nothing, You would have to try very hard to find a hotel as nice as this in central Paris not exactly cheap but few 4 stars are in large cities Our room was in the back so nice and quiet but quite big well appointed and tastefully decorated The bed was comfy and the air conditioning was fairly quiet We were in Paris for the tennis and this hotel was near Madeleine an easy one interchange ride on the Metro 
220449,Newhotel Roblin, Dark rooms no bath no iron or radio as advertised Charged extra for fried eggs at breakfast Shabby paintwork in room Not as nice as pictures on website, Comfortable bed
220450,Newhotel Roblin, The staff who is doing the cleaning is not well instructed You can find dust in many corners and under the bed and table next to the bed , The people have been very friendly and helpful To stop in front of the hotel to unload you lauge means you block the traffic Therefore you need to be quick There is closely a public parking which charges 30 EUR a day Which is normal for Paris 
220451,Newhotel Roblin, Nothing , Location was so easy to walk to many attractions especially Eiffel Tower champs elysees metro 2 mins away staff so friendly and helpful hhelpful 
220452,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast not consistent , The staff were so friendly The food in the restuarant very good Nice to have a restuarant in the hotel after long day travelling 
220453,Newhotel Roblin, When we arrived they said they had our reservation but no room for us and would transfer to a nearby hotel that s even better the other hotel was also a 4 star but definitely not the same style old British style very outdated not better at all not even similar I would have never book that hotel We felt forced to go there and where extremely unhappy about it the staff couldn t care less We still end up sleeping at new roblin after we call and complain about the room of the other hotel I will never book again at new roblin and I advise people not to book there You might sleep in another ugly hotel for the same price,No Positive
220454,Newhotel Roblin, It was only one restaurant high chair for all hotel little visitors baby No diversity in breakfast menu all 6 days served same breakfast If you want something that not served like hamlet you need pay about 5 euro , The rooms are very clean the location of hotel perfect near metro station 
220455,Newhotel Roblin, A very poor bottle of wine was served in the restaurant It could have been corked but not being an expert difficult to say As the hotel was situated in an expensive part of the city everything was expensive around it The hotel was however not bad value , A small hotel but excellently refurbished We were upgraded which was nice The restaurant served good french food but unfortunately the bottle of wine was pretty poor Breakfast was adequate with some cooked food but bread croisons weren t great Staff were very helpful and spoke basic English and helped with my French The location was relatively close to all major tourist attractions within a good walk anyway We would definitely stay there again if coming back to the area 
220456,Newhotel Roblin, No different to most Paris hotels I would have preferred Bigger room Less street noise Lower cost But I would definitely visit Newhotel Roblin again and recommend it to others, Beautiful hotel fantastic location Positive smiley staff from the front desk to the cleaners
220457,Newhotel Roblin, Nothing, Lovely hotel in a great location All staff were friendly and helpful My room faced the interior courtyard and was totally silent No street noise at all in such a large city was amazing Good breakfast good free wifi 
220458,Newhotel Roblin, The breakfast isn t as varied as I expected it to be for 4 star hotel although the few options it had were good , The location is superb If you like walking every main attraction is on walking distance from the hotel Staff is friendly and helpful 
220459,Newhotel Roblin, Room was initially very hot but cooled down after a couple of days with windows open , Comfortable bed convenient location and good breakfast options Fantastic shower 
220460,Newhotel Roblin, The mattresses were quite worn The hotel in general didn t look quite as nice as in the photos A bit old and shabby Definitely not a new renovation , Excellent location Madeliene district Very close to the best shopping in Paris Laffayette Pritemps etc All the major shopping stores Very close to the opera Also relatively close to the park and Louvre museum 
220461,Newhotel Roblin, WIFI was very weak Cooling system and ventilation didn t work in room However would still really recommend this hotel Since we were staying only one night we didn t bother to complain as I am sure it would have been taken care of immediately , Hotel was so beautiful And breakfast was excellent
220462,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast was somewhat poor and the restaurant area smelled funny at times , The room is very comfortable it is very centrally located Personnel is very nice I would definitely stay there again 
220463,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, Great staff and excellent facilities Beautiful room in a great location close to everything Very nice hotel would return helped us with all our questions 
220464,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast room was crowded and seemed like not meeting the needs of the volume of guests Both mornings we ate there several things were missing plates bread etc However the food was very nice freshly baked bread and a nice selection of cheeses If you want a quiet breakfast try to get a table at the end of the room close to the windows Also if you come by car please note that parking can be difficult , Great location with easy access to many sights by foot a very clean nice and confortable room we got an upgrade from standard room with a lot of space Also the reception staff was very friendly 
220465,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast service was very poor and bad value Also our bathroom kept flooding because of poor drainage from the shower , Hotel was in a good location bedroom was a good size Very stylish 
220466,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast could be better not much choice really for a 4 star hotel, Amazing stay perfect location quiet and comfortable room our special thanks to Daniel from Concierge Desk who was very helpful and always smiling Daniel you ve made us feel warmly welcome from the first minute we arrived 
220467,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast not so good respect the hotel For 2 mornings at 9 00 no madaleine biscuits available Very poor service I asked 4 times to have a small spoon and I never received it , bedroom very clean and spaciuous Staff at the reception very kindly and efficient with all request 
220468,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The location is great The manager was extremely nice and gentle He gave us a great room after the cleaning person made a mistake We enjoyed our stay

220472,Newhotel Roblin, , Everything was perfect Good and helpful stuff convinient location Very nice and cosy room and bathroom Shampoo Hermes Breakfast is completely enough 
220473,Newhotel Roblin, I didnt like a lot First of all staff was absolutely terrible No smile at all when i have asked a guy at the reception for anything they were rude and didnt help us at all Room was very very small Bed was so noisy that I couldn t even move to not disturb others I mean other rooms And no we didn t have fun there Never again , I did like a lift and loby of the hotel
220474,Newhotel Roblin, The room was overlooking the road so a bit noisy, Great position so we were able to get everywhere easily walking by public transport or by taxi We were upgraded to a great looking room
220475,Newhotel Roblin, Unfortunately it was very cold in bathroom We asked at reception to fix this problem but nothing changed , The staff was helpful The hotel is very well situated in the neighborhood there are lots of nice places 
220476,Newhotel Roblin, Unfortunately our glasses weren t changed by room service during our two night stay , Very friendly staff nice size room great size wardrobe and bathroom Well designed and well thought out Loved that there was no carpet in rooms Bed extremely comfortable 
220477,Newhotel Roblin, The photographer for the website was particularly skilled in crafting the illusion of a spacious and unique hotel I can assure you it was not , The colors were cool 
220478,Newhotel Roblin, Soundproofing between corridor and room can be improved Other than that everything was perfect , Location helpful and kind staff and very well sized room for the price I would stay again at this hotel 
220479,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, There is no hot water kettle in the room ask the staff is it anyway to get hot water the staff provides hot water kettle it s really nice to have hot water in this cold weather 
220480,Newhotel Roblin, breakfast good and various but would expected a bit more for a boutique hotel of this range suprisingly no omelettes to be ordered and no vegetables of any kind for breakfast but it is actually only A for that , Extra cozy and warm retro rooms touch of luxury with Hermes cosmetic in the bathroom super comfy beds for heaven sleep Nespresso machine for relaxed coffee pleasure in the room great location for walking tours as well as easy subway reach pleasant and convenient hotel as a superb base in Paris 
220481,Newhotel Roblin, The hot options for breakfast were not that great The scrambled eggs had a grainy texture and the sausages were like warm cocktail franks The restaurant was disappointing I had the roast beef and I got a chunk of beef and fries no vegetables and no option to order them as sides The bar opens and 6pm which is a bit inconvenient when you come back after a day of exploring the city , On arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable and clean Many of the main Paris attractions are within walking distance and there s a metro station nearby for longer trips If you want to eat out there are plenty restaurants nearby If you want to shop there s lots of nice shops close by too 
220482,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, Room bed decoration everything perfect they upgraded my in a quiet double room large and cosy gentle warm and efficient care of all my needs felt pampered and spoiled 
220483,Newhotel Roblin, My superior room is a bit small and less natural light the small windows cannot be really opened due to privacy reason Bath tub addicted guest would be a bit sad , Staff is excellent from reception room service breakfast and porter Really rare to find in paris They are impressively friendly and helpful
220484,Newhotel Roblin, Matrass is tired and gives in too low breakfast though sufficient never changes 7 meals all the same staff inefficient and you always have to ask for things that are finished like baggett creps juice WI FI not at its best disconnecting a lot across the square there is ORANGE and can get a good local sim card with a lot of G for EU40 , location is perfect just off the La Madeleine metro and buses minutes away 10 minutes from Opera or Gare st Lazare from there you can go everywhere I had a very good haircut downstairs next door pharmacy across the street quality boulangerie few minutes on Le Arcade st right right from the hotel numerous cafes and brasseries all around The big department stores are 1 bus stop away 6th floor was comfortable and quiet Bathroom exellent spacious go in shower hot water great preasure towels clean and large Reception staff are always willing and helpfull cleaning ladies polite and clean Free newspapers free tel calls from room to line numbers around the globe
220485,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, We loved our stay in this beautiful place very nicely finished and very comfortable sleep Would recommend to anyone looking for a lovely weekend in Paris
220486,Newhotel Roblin, We arrange transfer from hotel but driver were extremely rude and disturbing Taxi also cost same price anyway and more comfortable that you dont share the car with anyone else So i dont recommend anyone to get transfer from hotel The rooms need more lightinning , Stuff were very polite and helpfull Hotel is very nice decorated Location is good enough Housekeeping is very successfull 
220487,Newhotel Roblin, Not very much The restaurant was not the best but otherwise there was little to complain about , Great staff friendly and helpful Very close to the Metro 
220488,Newhotel Roblin, I wished upstairs but you did not give the room I do not like the room you gave me because the room is small and stuffy I stayed enforcedly at the first floor, I like the location which is near the metro station madaleine and for airport and the far from Roissy bus station is 500 mt Our breakfast culture is different Turks are not good at breakfast but other people may good at breakfast The room is neat but small Personals are friendly and they are smiling 
220489,Newhotel Roblin, A little bit tired but I dont care , Really big room and bath for Paris Lovely place with veryyyyy good breakfast City center Next door is a good liquor store parking 10 discount within living in hotel restaurants Love this place and for sure come back again 
220490,Newhotel Roblin, The room was pretty dark which made it hard to get ready to go out There was nowhere with decent light or a decent mirror to put on make up Also nowhere to make a cup of tea , Pretty much everything we had a great stay 
220491,Newhotel Roblin, I don t have anything negative to say the bar was closed but we didn t want to stay in the hotel in the day so really wasn t an issue either I don t think the location is 9 2 or whatever they say but it s walking distance from the metro not even a minute walk and it s a good safe are so in that sense it s good , Staff were so friendly The hotel was perfect I read reviews that said the walls were thin and room was small but the room is a great size The shower was great walls are a bit thin but not an issue at all They had the robes and slippers and really made you feel like a guest in luxury 
220492,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, Great location right in the middle of the city yet managed to be quiet Excellent breakfast with lots of options claasy interior with good rooms had a good time 
220493,Newhotel Roblin, Disinfectant smells from the wc s penetrating lounge area on ground floor The hotel bar was closed on Saturday night which was a bit of a shame ,No Positive
220494,Newhotel Roblin, We arrived at 9 00 for breakfast there were no eggs only scrambled eggs that were runny We asked for eggs to be arranged so we could cook them in the boiler provided ourselves were told that there would be no eggs for the day There was no alternative to pork for breakfast and only 2 cheese selection We also felt that the hotel could offer cooked tomatoes mushrooms or fried eggs omelette without having to pay extra That was disappointing and we had breakfast outside of the hotel The room should be fitted for people who enjoy tea not just coffee We had to request a kettle there was no tea or milk, Room was perfect comfortable
220495,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, I have been welcomed with warmth and professionalism All my stay has been excellent The staff whatever their task in the hotel make you enjoy a worry free stay I would highly recommend this hotel to people I know 
220496,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast was poor in choice no coffee was served all personal was chatting in kitchen I think no one visible for first 20 minutes Limited tables were ready to sit at we were there at approx 8h30 most spots were lacking cutlery or plates , Great looking hotel with small but comfortable room 
220497,Newhotel Roblin, Located in a very upscale part of Paris so the local dining and drink options were rather pricy , Great central location just off of Madeline sq friendly staff and classic Paris period property 
220498,Newhotel Roblin, only one small lift so take the stairs charge for nespresso capsules and machine didnt even work , fantastic location Clean rooms upgrade to the bigger room if you are a couple 
220499,Newhotel Roblin, very small bedroom aprox 9sqm small bed for a double room 1 5x 2m too expensiv for such a small room best case 2 3 stars but never 4 stars we were disapointed, very friendly staff
220500,Newhotel Roblin, Very small rooms Windows faced the inner yard which was noisy in the morning The staff is not very pleasant but OK, Breakfast is quite limited but fairly reasonable though overpriced Good bathroom Excellent fluffy towels and a bathrobe Limited number of toiletries but appreciated Hermes 
220501,Newhotel Roblin, The room is tiny and not worth for the price at all It s even hard to find a place open your 30 inch luggage There is only a small desk under the screen which is not enough for me to place my laptop and checking emails Also there was no tooth brush toothpaste and comb in the bathroom I asked for the reception desk and they gave me but without comb The main lift was always out of service I don t recommend anyone used to stay in a 4 star or 5 star hotels to waste your money on this hotel Take your time find another place , The louge is probably the only decent part of this hotel 
220502,Newhotel Roblin, The rooms were a little bit small and breakfast rather light , The hotel has a central location not far from main places to visit walking distance to galerie lafayette printemps Overall a sweet cosy hotel tr s parisien 
220503,Newhotel Roblin, there is only one tiny elevator so unless we had luggage we took the stairs there is a nespresso machine in the room but ours didn t work and when we asked for a kettle they gave us one which was dirty and full of ground coffee They did bring us a new one when I pointed this out , location is fantastic and rooms are basic but clean and quiet the standard is too small for two people so I would go one up We didn t try the hotel breakfast as there are many options close by which are cheaper 
220504,Newhotel Roblin, Only a small issue the breakfast staff were having loud conversations and it was very off putting for guests eating , Interior of the hotel was very clean very boutique WiFi is excellend and the rooms are very nice The location was easy to walk to from Gare du Nord and easily accessible to the Louvre 
220505,Newhotel Roblin, I would have liked it if the concierge could have helped with tickets , The room was modern and comfortable The staff really helped us The air conditioning worked 
220506,Newhotel Roblin, Bathroom door is wardrobe type can hear from inside , Great quality breakfast Comfortable bed good sized room for Paris standards Great location close to all major attractions 
220507,Newhotel Roblin, A little disappointing with regard to rooms They are small but that s a function of the building rather than the hotel and let s remember it is architecturally beautiful Paris but not necessarily modern We were on the 6th floor and you have to get the staff lift up there which is not cool would be better to lift to the 5th and then walk Finally most annoyingly they make you pay for your Nespresso capsule , Location location location It really doesn t get any better for anyone wanting a weekend in Paris With its top notch location comes charming staff with a sensible price so for that reason alone makes this hotel a serious option 
220508,Newhotel Roblin, Reception were not very polite Bed sheets never get changed unless you ask They don t take garbage from the room you have to ask them to clean Bed is not comfortable for this price it s 1 star beds, Location
220509,Newhotel Roblin, I can t think of a single thing Our stay was simply perfect in every way , The location couldn t have been better for seeing the key sites in Paris The staff were absolutely lovely they even complimented my husband and me on our French even though it wasn t nearly as good as when we lived there and the rooms were well appointed very clean and extremely comfortable A perfect stay to finish off a wonderful vacation in France 
220510,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The staff at the front desk were all welcoming and provided great information We loved the design detail through out the hotel From the elevator to the sleeping rooms everything was beautiful 
220511,Newhotel Roblin, You can hear people in the hallways But overall not a big issue , Amazing location centrally located and easy access to public transportation if you decide not to walk Beautifully decorated everything is RH inspired 
220512,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, We couldn t fault anything about this hotel Our room was beautiful with every amenity we could ask for and the hotel was in the perfect location for exploring Paris A secure car park was just a couple of doors away The fold down service with a chocolate was a nice touch 
220513,Newhotel Roblin, Unfortunately the two roaches on the wall in the dining area took away from the breakfast experience The food was not very good at all the bacon was completely raw and the coffee was not like it used to be when we have stayed at the hotel before Disappointed in the loss of wifi for two days the public areas were very warm we assumed they would have the air conditioning on Clearly the hotel has changed it s just not like it used to be they stayed there four times and there just seems to be a very masculine effect to the hotel now Such is life , location Clean room
220514,Newhotel Roblin, No check was an hour and a half later than what was promised on booking That makes it tough after an overnight The Internet was unreliable in the lobby and unavailable in the room At first the hotel denied there was a problem as I overheard them tell guests while I waited for my room then said a technician was coming to fix it at some point Housekeeping walked into the room without announcing themselves which was kind of weird since I was in the bathroom I think you have to take this with a grain of salt Paris in August You have to expect some bumps The folks that make run smoothly are on vacation leaving a skeleton crew that s my guess anyway I have not had these issues when staying there before The staff was polite though and made an effort I will stay there again , Great location The hotel itself is really nice aestheticly 
220515,Newhotel Roblin, The wifi stopped working for two days and the alternative router couldn t get to the 4th floor I had to sit at the lobby all day to get connected , Nice breakfast good location It s quiet clean 
220516,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The room on a little small for a couple Coffee you had to pay for capsules And first night water free then you have to pay for water other hotels you get free bottles of water everyday
220517,Newhotel Roblin, The bed was a little too soft and therr wasn t a view in my room , The staff were helpful and the overall place was clean It was also conveniently located saving us time and money 
220518,Newhotel Roblin, The room and the hallways of the building were uncomfortably hot The hotel refused to take responsibility for the dry cleaning service that chose to re write our order from a request to wash 3 items to dry cleaning 3 items and charging us 42 euro for a service we did not request They produced a sign in our room on day 2 that stated the coffee in room was at a charge and after we checked out proceeded to take unauthorised money from our bank account to cover this small surprise charge of two coffees per day We requested a taxi to pick us up upon check out The hotel took it upon themselves to book a private driver costing us 22 euro for a very short trip to the train station Arrogant to say the least and we cannot recommend the hotel based on these experiences , The location was very good 
220519,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, We arrived at hotel very early morning almost 3am We were very tired in the morning but they made us late check out So we could take a rest in the hotel Very kind Good location to go to the museium 
220520,Newhotel Roblin, The bar and restaurant opening times days were a bit erratic but it was around Bastille Day so normal routine was out the window One slight disappointment we had an issue with one of the bathroom fittings on the first day we stayed 3 nights we reported it twice but no action was taken the manager was sceptical and indifferent although most of the staff were friendly and helpful , Location Location Location and overall good value for money for the standard and personal aspects of this hotel Great bars and cafes all around and most major attractions are within a 20 minute walk or a short metro ride Really liked the hotel and enjoyed our stay overall 
220521,Newhotel Roblin, Overall the room was fine very compact however it could use a touch up as the paint had chipped in a few places , Staff extremely pleasant and helpful Location is great right in the middle of good shopping and sight seeing 
220522,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, Very convenient and safe location close to the famous sceneries on ur travel lists very considerate service The room is not big but very elegantly arranged 
220523,Newhotel Roblin, We booked the family suite and were advised it was not available upon arrival which was not a great start We were provided with two neighbouring rooms One was large light space and very nice while the second was darker in colour and bad lighting Wi Fi was not good in the rooms at all and the rooms were noisy in the evenings from the traffic outside Pillows were not great , Location and staff were great Close to the shops Metro restaurants pharmacy One room was very pleasant Good facilities 
220524,Newhotel Roblin, Slightly scruffy decor in our room and synthetic bedding nothing to write home about just small things Our bathroom sink plug got stuck down meaning water couldn t drain away We didn t bother to inform staff as it occurred on the morning of departure I m certain they would have dealt with it straight away had we made them aware of the problem The bar isn t staffed and somewhat lacked atmosphere Perhaps some music instead of TV The coffee served with breakfast was pretty bad , Value for money this place really is a hidden gem The location is fantastic the staff were extremely friendly and the decor was nice The great price was just an added bonus When we requested an ironing board was brought up to our room the receptionist said I will be up right away and he actually was I ve waited a good 30 mins other hotels Last time I stayed in Paris it was at one of the top rated hotels on trip advisor and it cost about 500 Euros a night NewHotel Roblin is far better that this hotel I will certainly be staying in this hotel again 
220525,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, Just an amazing experience from the minute you walk in to the minute you check out Fantastic staff beautiful yet relaxed hotel and a perfect location Thoroughly recommend this hotel 
220526,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The location was perfect walking distance to many tourist sites and designer stores the staff are very helpful and the hotel is beautifully designed and decorated 
220527,Newhotel Roblin, NOTHING I CAN THINK OFF, VERY ACCOMODATING STAFF FROM THE MOMENT I CHECKED IN MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SECURE A ROOM PRIOR OFFICIAL CHECK IN ROOM WAS WELL APPOINTED RENOVATED AND VERY COMFORTABLE MODERN BATHROOM SHOWER ONLY BUT IN MY CASE DOES NOT BOTHER ME HAD A LOVELY TERRASS PROBABLY WAS UPGRADED HOTEL HAS AN OLD WORLD FEEL WITH A WELL APPOINTED BAR WITH GOOD SEATING AREA BREAKFAST WAS EXTREMELY GOOD VERY MUCH RECOMMEND WILL BE BACK
220528,Newhotel Roblin, My only gripe is the WiFi in our room I could get a very good Signal However your in Paris so did spend much time in the room , The hotel is in a great location lovely staff and spotless room The area is a shopperholics paradise 
220529,Newhotel Roblin, I will add light to the rooms, The place is beutifull and very well located Its at the madelline plaza a few steps from the travel agency and the tour bus hop on off
220530,Newhotel Roblin, The conditions of cancellation are terrible Because of the strikes in France our ticket was cancelled by SNCF company trains we did not wanted to spend our last 2 days in Paris in the middle of street rallies and strikes so we called the hotel to try to cancel our 3 nights that we payed in advance and ask them if they could at least give us back our money for a night and they refused Even if it was not our fault but because of the constant strikes in Paris The hotel is too dark Not enough light in the rooms The restaurant is also dark and depressing , The location of the hotel Not a bad price for the room 
220531,Newhotel Roblin, We didn t have breakfast at the hotel but I checked it once and it didn t seem to worth the fee they are charging for it, The room was really cosy and comfortable the staff was welcoming and always smiling 
220532,Newhotel Roblin, every thing was just perfect, Hotel location is very convenient few step away from Madeline metro station within walking distance from all the attraction The hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly We arrived at around 8 00 am in the morning and they checked us in without any additional charges I would definitely stay again in this hotel 
220533,Newhotel Roblin, The wash basin did not empty fast enough and was cracked The metal bar for the toilet roll was loose The pillows were too plump The breakfast while including scrambled eggs suffered from soggy bacon and tasteless sausages Also the bread selection and quality could have been better , The quiet at the back was ideal The window could be kept open without noise from the street The access to wifi was very good The walk in rain shower was a pleasure 
220534,Newhotel Roblin, I have been to this hotel few times and this time the bathroom and room were not particularly clean I was a bit disappointed , I keep coming back to this hotel The location is great and I like the style of the hotel 
220535,Newhotel Roblin, A kettle in the bedroom instead of a Nespresso machine Only drink on offer was espresso and you had to pay to use the machine I think with the cost of the room complimentary tea coffee wouldn t be too much to expect Restaurant was expensive so we chose to dine elsewhere Room well decorated but lighting a little dim , Good size room great location really friendly helpful staff Very clean attractively decorated room 
220536,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, A very charming boutique hotel in excellent location the rooms are quite amazing Khalid on the front desk was so helpful and kind the staff were fantastic and extremely nice would always book my hotel in Paris there
220537,Newhotel Roblin, We ate in the hotel dining room early on Friday evening and only 2 of the 8 main course choices were available The dining room was closed on Saturday and Sunday evening , The staff were very helpful and polite and the standard of housekeeping was very good The hotel s location was perfect for visiting the main sites of Paris 
220538,Newhotel Roblin, Shower could be better They should give new sets of amenities after being used more than half already , Nice and cozy room Friendly staffs Location is perfect
220539,Newhotel Roblin, Everything was really good Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris Only downside was street noise early morning bins being emptied etc etc so would ask for inside room if stayed again , Situated in lovely area with shops and restaurants nearby Very good location for train station and for bus stop for sightseeing bus 
220540,Newhotel Roblin, For business travel the hours for breakfast are too late Impossibility to have hot beverages before 7am even with room service , The comfort of the room Very calm place 
220541,Newhotel Roblin, Elevator was a bit small but not a big matter , Really like the location and the cleaness of the hotel The staffs were very kind as well Probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in Paris 
220542,Newhotel Roblin, I was charged with breakfasts that I d never taken I got the refund and everything was all right after all though it wasn t so nice , staff helpful 
220543,Newhotel Roblin, the service should be much better the staff has no smile and not friendly and you have a feeling that you should be on their service not vice versa Especially the manager was so stressed with request if I may to enter in the reception office to put some things which I d just bought in my suitcase I made a check out already not to opening it in front of the reception desk and other guests maybe not to charge for coffee capsule in the room, Location is really good near almost everything there was a one men somebody who is helping you with luggage car etc who was really kind
220544,Newhotel Roblin, Size of room Super small my 3 daughters and I were placed in 2 separate rooms the exposed beams in both our rooms made them feel even smaller then they already were I was obviously paying for location , Liked the photos of property Clean Good area of Paris and close to some sightseeing monuments 
220545,Newhotel Roblin,No Negative, The hotel is awesome It is strategically located on the small nice street right at the corner of Madleine square so that you could easily walk either to Champs lys es or to Grand Boulevards Opera area There is an underground parking on the same street very convenient for anyone arriving by car normally you do not need car in Paris it is much nicer to walk here so it is worth to park the car during your stay Hotel provide 10 discount for the parking you have to bring and stamp your parking ticket at the reception to validate the discount Parking price is 28 Euro night The room is really big especially according to Paris standards It is a little bit too dark and too grey at my taste but at the same time I must admire that it is really stylish The lobby is perfectly furnished and decorated so you could spend some minutes just sitting and relaxing there to feel the atmosphere Staff is enough friendly and trained Wi fi connection is stable enough Bathroom needs some things to be fixed and I would add that comfort and convenience were sacrificed here in from of designers ideas Anyway it is just my small remark and I would not say it is a kind of minor point Spoil yourself with Hermes shower gel and shampoo I would expect better housekeeping here cleaning was not enough I can surely recommend this hotel for everyone visiting Paris and I would say that it is worth to pay the room price even if I consider the value as a little bit too high 
220546,Newhotel Roblin, Nothing, The hotel is very conveniently located for all major sightseeing by foot Very good breakfast comfy beds The staff is very friendly and helpful The price is very reasonable too for a 4 at such a good location I cannot remember anything that was not to our satisfaction Would highly recommend this hotel to everybody 
220547,Newhotel Roblin, We loved everything about it, Absolutely amazing The staff was super friendly The bed was a dream The room was gorgeous with the most beautiful views of Parisian architecture Luxurious Herm s products Very will isolated and the temperature in the room was perfect The design of the hotel was ultra chic yet cozy and welcoming in a splendid neighbourhood filled with luxurious boutiques We will definitely stay here again next time we come to Paris Thanks to everyone at Hotel Roblin for making our stay so enjoyable 
220548,Newhotel Roblin, The top floor 6th rooms are a bit small with low ceiling THe heating was too much and I had trouble sleeping Besides these though I had a great stay Very nice and stylish hotel Great for the price, I liked the cleanliness and the decor of the hotel Also the location is just great It s very close to Madeleine and Opera The staff are very kind 
220549,Newhotel Roblin, Breakfast could have got more varieties of food The staffs services aren t quite friendly , Very convenient to the shopping center restaurant easy to stroll along the main street
220550,Newhotel Roblin, The people looking after our room were very nice but didn t seem to have consistent procedures One night we used wine glasses they were still there dirty the next evening , The size of the room was great especially compared with other Paris rooms we have had before and the toiletries were wonderful

220552,Newhotel Roblin, The pillows were the only thing I didn t like but hey that can definitely be overlooked considering we had a fabulous time their I would recommend putting slightly larger pillows and for me That s not a compliant it s my own personal request We never did use the breakfast in the hotel , Everything about this property is excellent The staff along with the property itself are great The rooms are bigger than one would get in most other hotels We booked a single room with a queen bed the room was definitely bigger than what my wife and I had anticipated The hotel has an old feel with brand new amenities The staff are great always pleasant to talk to and always very helpful The front office gentleman I think his name was Abdel Karim was awesome and very polite helpful and always kind The rest of the staff was the exact same staff Good on the hiring department The area is full of great shops great restaurants and small caf s to chose from My wife and I were very pleased to come into the room and find the crib that we had requested ready and with sheets put in it ready for our baby to be dropped in to it The rooms are extremely quite We were on the other side of the hotel on the first floor and it was awesome
