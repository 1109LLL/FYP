155685,Norfolk Towers Paddington, As per my experience above the way the staff make you feel when you are simply asking for something you are paying for Customer service should be very high on anybody s list of requirements however common courtesy and general manners should be essential If you can t deliver these you simply should not be in a customer forward facing role , We found the bed to be comfy but actually very short The breakfast was lovely however the lady on the restaurant was not friendly approachable or accommodating at all I asked if there were more fried eggs coming out The response to my question was you do know you have to pay extra for a cooked breakfast To which my reply was I asked if there were more cooked eggs coming out Before she then proceeded to answer my question she wanted to know my room number She then went onto say breakfast finishes at 10 o clock I am aware of this and this is why I came down to breakfast at 9 15am I pointed out that I was aware of this and then went into point out that it was 9 45am and therefore it is still breakfast time At this stage I was getting most annoyed and gave her 1 final chance to ask the kitchen if more eggs were coming out She went and asked and then came to me with the answer and a slip of paper to sign for the additional cooked breakfast charge The question about the additional charge was never in dispute I just wanted an egg with my breakfast The reception staff were lovely and very professional 
155686,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was quite small for 2 people but was well equipped and was adequate for short stay, very modern clean and comfortable hotel Excellent location with great transport links but even so area around hotel relatively quiet at night so weren t disturbed Choice of good continental or cooked breakfast Have stayed in a lot of hotels in London in this price range and would definitely stay again 
155687,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Really nice room and the staff were very professional and understanding I d had an operation the day before and was stuggling so they extended my checkout free of charge 
155688,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room service started at 3pm but no one was answering the phone had to call receiption in order for someone to contact me back and take my order I had called room service for 10 minutes bloody terrible, Room service great staff polite room couldn t swing a cat inside bathroom tiny bed comfty location perfect to where I wanted to be I wouldn t stay again but it s not the worse place I ve stayed in London 
155689,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom was abit small as the door was awkward too close and open too near the toilet, The bed was so comfortable and slept really well also found the staff really helpful 
155690,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Internet wifi was miserable probably the worse in paddington All other hotels have much better wifi , Easy accessibility to the property Staff was good breakfast was as good as expected of paddington 
155691,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It was very over heated I had to go for a walk to regain normal temperature , The single room could accommodate two so although small it was well appointed The staff were quick to respond and helpful It was most helpful to be able to leave luggage before checking in time 
155692,Norfolk Towers Paddington, slightly more space around the bed to move around easily, Room was a bit small Otherwise very nice with good continental breakfast and very good staff ready to help on any matter 
155693,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small elevator, The location was perfect with a bus stop literally a few steps from the hotel itself paddington station 2 minutes from the hotel and a variety of local cafes restaurants and many other shops with a few minute s walk It was extremely quiet and the rooms were spacious and kept clean on a daily basis The staff were very accomodating and were willing to provide us with any service we requested We ended up extending our stay and enjoyed every minute of it We ll definetly be returning again soon 
155694,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was not the standard lift for the 4 stars hotel The wheelchair couldn t enter the lift easily and also the corridors also are not designed for the wheelchair and the breakfast it is not good for the hotel to charge the clients for some extra items like eggs and , The staffs were polite and very welcome
155695,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The staff were not very welcoming or eager to assist The rooms were small but would be okay for business travel or a short stay , Great location if travelling to from Heathrow as it s only a 5 minute walk to Paddington station Hotel was clean and housekeeping were great Overall the hotel was presented very nicely 
155696,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was perfect for 1 person and a little tight for 2 people Would return however because the location and experience was very positive , The location was excellent Convenient to Heathrow Express and the Underground Tube 2 short blocks Staff was friendly and very accommodating Within walking distance of Hyde Park close Marylebone and Regent s Park 
155697,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Staff happy to change my room allocation when asked I had requested a room with a bath and the initial room had a shower only I was upgraded to a larger room Walking distance to Paddington Air conditioning
155698,Norfolk Towers Paddington, rooms are noisy due to the heavy doors at night or in the morning you have people that slam the door It is very noisy unfortunaltely, good location friendly statff
155699,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Excellent variety for breakfast all very fresh and nicely presented Nice ambience in the restaurant Very close to Paddington station able to drop off our luggage on our arrival the hotel stored our luggage and we collected prior to our journey home
155700,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The toilet seat and the carpet weren t that clean Usually in 4 stars hotels they put bottles of water as complementary service , What I liked the most is the location The hotel is comfortable and the staff were helpful I loved that they were flexible about checking out I was supposed to check out at 11 30 but they allowed me to stay till 12 
155701,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The beds were too soft When we first tried to sit in them we almost fell off because of how soft they were The lift is also very old and compared to the lobby is very out of place The rooms are not as modern as they look in the photos but otherwise it s a decent room and bathroom and stay in general , The area was lovely 
155702,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There was only one lift which was frustrating at times , We stayed for three nights in a Club Double Room which was very compact but functional Bar fridge was much appreciated as this is an absolute rarity in the UK The option of having either air con or open window was a plus Staff were very professional and extremely helpful Restaurant had great menu choices and all of the dishes we ordered were top quality Prices of food and drink were very reasonable Great continental breakfast which offered many options Excellent location being only a three minute walk to Paddington Station which has much appreciated ramp access for passengers travelling with luggage 
155703,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small almost a grave Stretching half of my arm when lying in bed I could touch the wall Our room was just in front of the lift so until 1 o clock nighttime it was very noisy The bathroom was small but clean and very functional Breakfast was ok but nothing special , The position is quite central and the room was clean 
155704,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathrooms were relatively small and the bathrm doors inconviently placed , The hotel is a 4min walk to paddington station and lots of eateries around Housekeeping was superlative and beds were very comfortable The reception staff were very helpful too We were a family of 4 and stayed in 2rooms for 4nights The rooms n bathrooms were always very clean on our return each evening On our last day at the hotel I asked for an iron and since their irons were already in use and unavailable they sent me a brand new iron to use within a short time Also although we had a night flight out of London the hotel graciously stored our luggage for us after checkout and later that evening when we returned we freshened ourselves in their spotlessly clean bathrooms in the lobby We will definitely stay with the Norfolk towers again 
155705,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The early check out time , The large roomy family suites en suite bathrooms The air conditioned facilities Public transportation practically at the doorstep 
155706,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms are not spacious when using the sofa bed but we didn t mind as it was perfect in every other respect , Everything was first class including the restaurant Great choice and quality Beds are very comfortable Would highly recommend this hotel 
155707,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms was filthy and a shoe box room key given out to another guest who walked in whilst in bed I checked out early as totally not acceptable , nothing
155708,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room and bathroom were very small The windows don t open at all Was disappointed there was no water in the fridge and tea and coffee selection in the room was very basic , Helpful friendly and efficient staff Good location nice building comfortable and spotlessly clean Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and pleasant staff and surroundings 
155709,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms are very small Toilet are very small Lift is very small and slow corridors are very narrow Internet is very slow and not stable, location Clean
155710,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small rooms but that s London for you Noisy at times from the room next door Small lift , Location is great with only a short walk to Paddington Station Staff was friendly and the place is super clean 
155711,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was too hot air conditioning stops after a while in the basement no windows Very noisy , Large rooms good bed bathroom lots of exotic restaurants nearby as the hotel is in a Muslim district 
155712,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Housekeeping staff They not detailed I have to request for this service almost everyday came back to room at 4pm room still same as at I leave it at 8am Front desk staff not so friendly no one will help you to lift your suitcase to room Only one elevator They combined two single bed called it KING , Improve on few things this place will be great for everyone Nice interior I really love it Closed to tube station is another bonus 
155713,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The twin room wasn t very big we had trouble putting down 2 suitcases But apart from that it was a great place to stay , Great location nice and quiet comfy beds beautiful little park not far from it The staff were fantastic we had a long wait for our flight home and they let us store our suitcases there until we were ready to leave thanks so much 
155714,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift can be a bit slow and is rather dodgy But that became our standing joke of the weekend , Staff were really friendly Room was clean and comfortable Breakfast was great lots of choice and the cooked breakfast is worth the upgrade from the continental option We had dinner in the hotel one night and the food was lovely if a little expensive but great food so no complaints Location of the hotel is perfect for Oxford Street Hyde Park and all local attractions 5 minutes walk from Paddington rail and tube with plenty of restaurants and cafes around check out the pastries in Bonne Mouche 
155715,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Smallest double room I have ever been in Only way to get in bed was to shuffle sideways along the wall Totally unacceptable room for two people especially paying 614 for 3 nights in a so called club room The only way to close the bathroom door from inside was to squeeze between the toilet and bath Impossible for two people to move around at the same time The room photo shown on my confirmation mail did not resemble the actual room and was totally misleading , close to bus route clean modern room reasonable prices in restaurant
155716,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bed mattress of poor quality It sinks when you sre on it Bad for people with back problem Breakfast choice is very limited , The friendly staff and cleaniness 
155717,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I had a single room and it was tiny like a wardrobe there was nowhere to hang way thing up and the desk was so close to the end of the bed you could not sit in the chair to use the desk Air conditioning was set at 33 decree and could not be made cooler ,No Positive
155718,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was a bit small bathroom very tight but acceptable at the price The lift is very small slow with stairs not neighbouring , Clean modern air conditioned room comfortable bed selection of electrical ports for modern devices Helpful efficient staff 
155719,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We had booked bed and breakfast but they tried to tell us breakfast wasn t included in the price until I showed them booking confirmation The room wasn t serviced for the entirety of our 3 night stay I discovered the night before we left that a symbol on the wall I hadn t even noticed was there was lit up indicating we didn t want to be disturbed and must have been left on by previous occupant and not switched off by housekeeping before our arrival The second evening I was polite asking for teas coffees and extra towels but I was not impressed the next night when we came in from yet another day s sweaty excursion to discover we were expected to sleep in the same bed linen for the third night running Although reception promised to send someone up no one came to the room and no one mentioned that the electric symbol on the wall was indicating we didn t want service No literature was available in the room that you would normally expect to find explaining hotel policies etc The bathroom was tiny , Location was fabulous only couple of minutes walk from Paddington Station The bed was fabulously comfortable I have fibro and back trouble but had no trouble sleeping The air conditioning was a godsend 
155720,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms Facilities Corridoors, Nice staff the hotel was priced completely incorrectly for the service it was offering For over 200 per night I don t think it would be unreasonable to expect to stay in accommodation designed for humans not borrowers 
155721,Norfolk Towers Paddington, No car parking not even a drop off point for unloading luggage Double Room I was given was tiny a couple with 2 suitcases would not fit in room Room comfortable and clean and very modern but size too small I also scored a room next to lift despite asking for a quiet room Wifi internet included in stay but far too slow for a hotel that has been modernised in the centre of London No room service after 10pm No early breakfast option available , Great location for Paddington and Heathrow Express Close to Tube Walking distance to Hyde Park Notting Hill Oxford Street etc Very modern hotel and clean room and bathroom Good continental breakfast 
155722,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very cramped bedroom and bathroom Plus air cond too hot and slow to adjust, Good continental breakfast and helpful front desk staff Good location for the Heathrow Express 
155723,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom door configuration was a bit of a challenge and the rooms are on the small side , Breakfast was good plenty of selection in the free section Coffee was excellent 
155724,Norfolk Towers Paddington, As someone coming from dubai the place is not how i imagined and they are not sure about price of water when they found im from dubai they increase the price , Only location 
155725,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Ensuite bathroom was smallest I have ever seen anywhere When you get out of the shower there is not enough room to dry yourself You need to go into the bedroom This wifi is slow and under provisioned to the point that it is unusable at least on the 5th floor where our room was You need to re log in for each session on your device and it took up to 6 minutes for the login screen to load I showed some connection speed tests on my laptop to the manager on duty to explain the situation I was told many guests complained about it but there was nothing they could do , Location is very good Staff were helpful when we asked I would consider it reasonable value if they provided usable wifi 
155726,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The size of the room and the hostility of the staff and manager, The single person room was not fit for human occupation It s the worst I have seen in my 20years of global business travel
155727,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There were a lot of staff too many in my opinion particularly at breakfast All staff were neither friendly or unfriendly I had a query about my room rate which I had notified Bookings com on the day of booking I tried to explain to the staff on arrival to no avail so had to pay the full price for myself when in fact I think I was charged for two people Bookings com assured me that they will refund my the difference once I arrive back in Australia when I produce the receipt I have since read in reviews that this is a recurring problem I was in a basement room and could hear the London Tube underneath the building not loudly but I could hear it I have stayed in Paddington many times before and the price I paid is well over the going rate , Although the room was smallish it was well furnished and clean 
155728,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was very small and pricey , Location is great with easy access to entire city and Heathrow from Paddington station which is a 5 min walk Staff were friendly and helpful 
155729,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The size of the room and only 1 lift , The price of the hotel I found was unreasonable compared to the size of the room and there s only one lift which is very slow The draft is good The receptionist was helpful and changed my room for me again this room was too small 
155730,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room on a low ground basement although with exterior light window Standard Breakfast included but Continental breakfast is paid extra At breakfast to get a Cappuccino 3 70 pounds extra charge , Nice and modern Hotel with good location near Paddington station 
155731,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom was on the small side but was well fitted and clean Bar prices were expensive which meant we only had one drink One round of vodka and coke and a Bacardi and coke was 18 , Location was excellent close to lots of pubs and restaurants All staff we had dealings with were friendly and helpful Good choice at breakfast 
155732,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing to improve from me , Staff were very friendly and helpful Allowed to leave cases before check in and after check out Bar cocktails were lovely and the continental breakfast had a great selection and was delicious We got an upgrade to a larger room with a shower wet room which was great 
155733,Norfolk Towers Paddington, for what we paid the room was rather small and unfortunately we got a room next to a quite large fan kind a aircon for the building outside that luckily switched off at 10 pm Bath room too small for the amount paid Breakfast rather average , location is great next to Paddington station for direct access to tube pub around the corner very clean and extremely friendly staff
155734,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift wasn t working so I climbed to the 5th floor with my bad cramped legs One of the staff sniggered when he heard I m having to climb up to the 5th floor due to broken lift The bedroom was incredibly tight and there was way too much furniture for the space Bed didn t even look like a double bed and felt springy , It had the necessities Inc TV 
155735,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small but hey it s central London I would have liked an iron and ironing board Booking com was a trial , The sheets felt incredibly fresh The staff were responsive and anxious to please The room was spotlessly clean This part of London looked beautiful in early summer 
155736,Norfolk Towers Paddington, One elevator which broke down at least 2 times during our 4 day visit Room was small and awkward for two large suitcases but that would not stop me from staying there again , Continental breakfast was good with plenty of options Loved the muesli Room was comfortable air conditioned looked great and modernized Personnel were very helpful and polite Great location very close to London Paddington Station and plenty of reasonably priced eating places around We also felt safe in the area 
155737,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, All of the staff were excellent In particular the restaurant staff were very friendly and the food was delicious It was very convenient having breakfast at the hotel everyday and the hotel was well located 
155738,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Description of the location The name and location both Norfolk was confusing because the name Norfolk is used so often in the area Not a problem once we connected with Google maps , This was the nicest hotels we stayed in the UK we stayed in four other four star places in London Oxford and Tenby It has air conditioning 
155739,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There should be a rubber floor mat in the bath tub it was quite slippery , We came to London to get a medical procedure done for my husband The hotel was extremely helpful and caring Although the room was a wee bit small we managed fine The food on the dining room was excellent the the staff friendly and helpful 
155740,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift is a little slow and a bit small you just need to be patient , I have stayed twice now and would go back good location with plenty of restaurants nearby if you want to venture out at night Breakfast is good if you choose continental and excellent if you go for cooked and are peckish A short walk from Paddington 5minutes max and the same to Hyde Park The staff are lovely the rooms recently refurbished or wearing really well and really comfortable 
155741,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom was on the small side but very smart and well equipped , Breakfast was lovely The bed was huge and very comfortable Staff were very helpful and the hotel as a whole was very modern and bright and in a good location 
155742,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was out of order in the morning which was unfortunate because we were on the 5th floor and we were staying overnight after I had had a hernia repair operation The hotel was recommended to us by the hospital because it had a lift so that I would not have to climb stairs , I liked the decor the accommodation and breakfast The staff were helpful and friendly
155743,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Excellent stay great location recently renovated hotel everything clean and shining I had a quiet room with no noise from outside Pleasant personnel good service good breakfast 
155744,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Average breakfast continental Bed was too soft felt uncomfortable , Great location close to subway train bus hyde park walking distance Helpful staff 
155745,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was small, Location comfortable beds towels changed every day and linen every other day good breakfast friendly staff The bathroom was super there was a tap with hot water beside the toilet and an extra mirror with it s own light for make up 
155746,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms are slightly on the small side but this isn t really an issue for business trips The executive rooms are definitely more comfortable for longer stays and they don t break the bank , Great location for access to Paddington Station The hotel has a really nice feel to it and the staff are very friendly Comfy beds too 
155747,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Limited breakfast They charge extra for hot breakfast which was not advised during booking Horrible staff extremely rude Will not help accommodate you for anything We had booked 4 rooms and they did not give even 1 room one hour early to my parents who were senior citizens saying it s full But promptly added that it could be done with a GBP70 charge When they finally did give the room it was ridiculously small It woukd not fit any humans after luggage was unloaded Hotel has Only 1 Lift which is extremely slow and doesn t work sometimes , Good location near Paddington Station Grocery shops and restaurants close by 
155748,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The staff was not smiley enough and the breakfast was not substantional enough , The hotel has a very key location with an access to trains buses metro station and delicious restaurants 
155749,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Oh dear I do understand that those moving a Paddington area hotel up market are going to have to struggle with small rooms but room 310 for an active 67 year old with a stiff knee from having to walk long distances through a city traumatised and blocked up by the North Kensington fire was a real challenge A small gymnast or a Twister expert would have had no trouble sliding past the open bathroom door and squeezing into the small space beyond in order to close it again but I struggled It was probably five of the same small gymnasts who could have just squeezed into the Capacity 5 lift but 2 5 normal people or as I discovered trying to get upstairs one Texan with a suitcase is more like it , The bed was very comfortable indeed Breakfast was good in parts as they say ok bacon off putting sausage scrambled egg which filled my plate with water The bar staff were lovely 
155750,Norfolk Towers Paddington, She could only stay 3 nights It was a place of safety for her My adult disabled daughter was delighted by the caring and supportive staff , Staff cared for my daughter She had room service food and enjoyed 
155751,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The continental breakfast buffet was decidedly average We also got food poisoning on our second night NOT from this hotel but had to spend the next day in our hotel room It was noisy and the curtains didn t block out the daylight Also when we asked for room service to bring up some water we had to call three times before someone came up And then the water was GBP10 The bathroom was also exceptionally small at this hotel , Location to Edgware road was the best thing about this hotel
155752,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Staff is very unfriendly and rude specially the asian lady on the reception Rooms are so small that there were no place for keeping my shoes even what to say of bringing my luggage inside It was the worst stay of my life ever Plz dnt waste your money here there are couple of other hotels in the same area Stay there, When I checked out 
155753,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small narrow rooms and bathrooms No complimentary water in the room Reception check in staff slightly unfriendly , Good location near the Paddington Subway Clean and well kept rooms 
155754,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There was nothing to Dislike at all, From check in to leaving the following day I was very impressed With the staff and the hotel We were upgraded to a suite and I must say that our stay was fantastic Breakfast was lovely and the whole experience was stress free and relaxing Would defiantly stay here again 
155755,Norfolk Towers Paddington, This is the second time I have visited the hotel and the tv did not receive a signal Very annoying, I and my wife have used the hotel a number of times Each time the standard are maintained to a good standard to very good
155756,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room 116 was the smallest I have ever seen and not even a hanger let alone a wardrobe The en suite was bigger than the bedroom WiFi was also extremely weak , Location
155757,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I arrived the hotel after 10 pm and there was no drinking water or juice in the room nothing in minibar no room service and no one at the front desk to help me , good location for this trip s purpose
155758,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The internet was horrible completely useless I cannot even browse any websites They managed to fix it a little bit the last 2 days prior to my departure , Nice place a walking distance from Paddington and on a good bus route A couple of good restaurants a walking distance from the hotel Must try the new greek place just around the corner 
155759,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Had Air Conditioning which was needed for London in the summer but the towel heater in the bathroom wouldn t turn off and was producing a lot of heat the only way to keep the room cool was to shut the bathroom door but that made the bathroom uncomfortably hot Also the shower was so open you couldnt use the rest of the bathroom toilet sink whilst someone was showering without getting sprayed The mattress was incredibly hard overly firm not what we needed after a transatlantic flight Our room was directly below the check in desk and we could hear everything people walking moving bags There was only one very very small elevator 3 4 people max without bags which was not programmed well we waited 20 minutes to use it as every time it came down to the basement rooms it was full of guests who got in at the ground floor and wanted to go up With our bags we couldn t have managed the stairs we almost missed our train , Air conditioning friendly staff good continental breakfast spacious room lovely bathroom and close to Paddington for the Heathrow Express train 
155760,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms were very small 2 people with a suitcase each made it difficult to maneuver around A longer stay would be uncomfortable in such a small room , Hotel had a great location the rooms were clean modern Included continental breakfast was tasty 
155761,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Elevator was out of order for a whilw but repaired soon, Overall good place room was renowated good beds bath with tv Continental Breakfast ok with extra money upgradeable to full Monty Good quiet location with hood transportation facilities f g Tube is near 
155762,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room Air conditioner was making huge noise And if you don t turn on you want have air in the room They open a window for as around 7cm When I Book hotel i ask for two bads And they were in my booking but when We come into Room they were two bads but together You can not walk around them I work in hospitality business also and I didn t like attitude of the waiters for breakfast plus they were piking up dishes holding the glasses for the rim and than with the same fingers making new set up Unacceptable for a 4 star hotel For taverna it is ok Last night we ask for a bottle of proseko they didn t have than we ask for a bottle of vouve champagne they also didn t have eventually we got a bottle of rose cahmpagne , Brekfast was great And staff that seems Like managers were great 
155763,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was extremely hot throughout the day and evening even though we had opened the windows Shampoo was provided but there was no conditioner which is a necessity for me , The Bed was extremely comfortable the room was spacious and I like the electronic maid bell and do not disturb system on both sides of the room Also our room got upgraded which was a bonus and pleasant surprise 
155764,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Sometimes wi fi was very slow for those who are in business trip it s very important As i ve understood it s common problem for London very slow wifi, Personnel is great they try to help you as much as they can Tasty restaurant and ladies that work there 
155765,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was incredibly small which was not reflected in any of the photos It was sold as a Club Room which generally suggests a better quality larger room with some additional benefits It needs to be rebranded as a standard basic double There was literally nowhere to put suitcases so we had to stack them in the very small cupboard , The location was great and the room seemed to have been recently upgraded with a very nice but small bathroom The bar fridge was a bonus 
155766,Norfolk Towers Paddington, A bit more selection at breakfast we were late ish down gone 9 and some things didn t get topped up in the continental section , The staff were very helpful and polite we needed extra milk in our room and it arrived less than 5 mins after asking for it 
155767,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room is absolutely tiny and the bathroom is even smaller Room is very comfortable and the bathroom is well appointed just tiny Staff were very cool couldn t have been much less interested and welcoming They did their job but a smile would have been appreciated , Very handy location Bed is extremely comfortable 
155768,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very very small The breakfast was twice served to the room without the coutelery The server who delivered the food was really unfriendly and so rude in contrast with the staff of the reception The lobby is too small and the seatings are not confortable , The room and the bathroom were so clean and the bathroom very well equiped the location is good 
155769,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room and bed were small However when raising this as an issue the staff did show us alternatives although not much bigger than what was originally allocated This was a minor issue as there were many positives, Location was brilliant easy access to public transport The decor and facilities were to a high standard The staff particularly in the restaurant were professional and friendly The food was excellent 
155770,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing, Very comfortable accommodation Near Paddington station Continental breakfast Cleanness bed was good Helpfully staff I recommend this hotel 
155771,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Check in at 3 pm which mean if you arrive to London early you have to search for another place till 3 pm It is very difficult if you have kids, Place is close to Paddington train stataion Arabic street in London and big bus stataion Also the rooms are very clean
155772,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We had electricty problems the last 2 nights After 21 30 the lights gone and there was a fuse problem we didnot plug anything The hotel was not interested we could not take a bath charge our phones etc We have paid so much money and stay in the dark t was not nice, Clean good reception big room
155773,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing, Location was ideal for just getting off the train at Paddington and getting a good night sleep before heading into the City for early meetings the next day I tend to judge comfort these days by the presence or absence of mattress toppers which to my mind transforms the comfort of the bed Please to report all present and correct in that regard 
155774,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms were extremely small and dirty The bedsheets were not clean and there was a spider on the bed We ordered room service on 2 occasions and it did not arrive and there was no apology from staff when we called to cancel the order 2 hours later There was a bathroom leak and we had to get our room changed The second room we were put in was smaller All this when I informed the hotel months ago that we were celebrating my mums 60th Let alone provide us something complementary they ruined the stay for us with poor service , Location and internet access was the only good thing about the property
155775,Norfolk Towers Paddington, First room very small but after discussion with reception we were moved to bigger room next morning , Lovely hotel with easy access to tube Staff helpful and pleasant Good price for this standard of accommodation Great restaurant and bar 
155776,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Not getting what we asked for which was 2 single beds and then being told that we should have sorted it out this should have been sorted out before we arrived with the hotel staff , the comfort of the room
155777,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, The hotel was very fresh and clean Immaculate and well designed The single room was very small but still well appointed and I expected London hotels to be small so wasn t a big deal 
155778,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift second time we have stayed at this hotel and once again the lift went out of order , Staff were very friendly and helpful espicially Claudia in the resturant and Victor main reception who went out of his way to get us a taxi 
155779,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When we first arrived young woman at reception was not friendly as we were there before 3 p m check in time I had requested a 11am noon check in time at booking subsequent staff were very accommodating Continental breakfast was not worth 7 5 each pastries were very stale , Bed was very comfortable TV was easy to use Bathroom was well equipped 
155780,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I booked a Suite hoping to have a good experience and to relax to realize it was an underground room In the basement I felt like being in Jail with with little light and vue on the an external metallic stairs I asked to change but then was explained that the hotel is full and I could not even cancel and they explained me that the 3 nights are to be charged to the credit card anyway Not to mention that Internet was really bad and no Mobile Phone Signal at all Really bad experience in all and definitely not a place I will go back to , The location 
155781,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The only thing that I really didn t like in this hotel is the breakfast that s included in the room rate It doesn t have choices and it is so limited with only few kinds of food if you want more choices of breakfast like egg beans or sausages then you have to pay The price per night is too high according to the overall provided services , I liked the friendly helpful staff The location is very good The hotel is clean and modern The room size is small but it is comfortable and clean The process of checking in checking out went so easily quickly The room service is absolutely good and they serve a very tasty pizza
155782,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Staff is very unpleasant specially those serving breakfast with manager being quite rude to tourists Elevator broke down and had to use stairs for a day and a half until it was fixed Rooms and bathroom are tiny , Breakfast was nice and croissants were excellent Rooms were clean but small Location very close to bus stops 
155783,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The first room we got could have bin little bigger more space and with a comfortable chair but we got another the day after when we asked for it very nice of you Breakfast was good but the full english breakfast would be nice if included we like one or two fried eggs but 4 95 pounds person day is too much for that Overall we don t have very much too complain over When we return too London we will absolutely return to this hotel , Staff were 10 points Location perfekt
155784,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift nearby was very noisy, lovely comfortable large room fantastic bathroom It was in basement but didn t affect our stay We were worried about the noise but realised it was the lift which was quite close but it didn t disturb us Continental breakfast was a bonus 
155785,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the double bed room was very small and so was the toilet obese person won t find it easy to get inside the toilet but the good thing was they have a water hose shattaf , close from Paddington train and underground station lovely and helpful staff nice small lobby
155786,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was definitely not worth 200 my bed room at home is bigger You couldn t open the bathroom door fully as the room is too small the shower was awkward to stand in due to the uneven ceiling They have still not cancelled the pending transaction form a family members account even though the room was paid in full upon arrival and it was promised this would be sorted out immediately The welcoming wasn t as expected we were told we couldn t check in till 3 fair enough which we were then shunted back out of the hotel almost immediately I didn t appreciate this after travelling 3 hours to come to this property , The hotel was lovely breakfast was nice and in a good area 
155787,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small but this is central London , Seemed to be very well run and very clean and comfortable A good restaurant Excellent location easy to find and very close to bus train and underground 
155788,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Extremely dirty room smelt of cigarettes the single room was so small my bag wouldn t fit in absolutely disgraceful room wouldn t even leave my dog in there ,No Positive
155789,Norfolk Towers Paddington, More varied breakfast , Location was great within a five min walk of Paddington Station Hotel was very modern room was a really good size and lovely quality Very good nights stay and great value for money 
155790,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I didn t like the size of the bathroom it was tiny The breakfast I feel could have had more options i feel they should include the full English breakfast in the price as again there was not much option , The room was nice and clean bed was comfortable and well presented Breakfast was alright
155791,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Intially they checked me in in avery small room Smaller than what i have booked Told them about it and upgraded next day Due to the vacancy, Location
155792,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was fairly small, Excellent location in the heart of London Excellent breakfast with a wide variety to choose from Exceptionally clean room and hotel in general Flawlessly functioning free Wi Fi Easy to get to from the airport
155793,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rather small bathroom you couldn t even close the door easily and the lighting in the bedroom was either very bright and garish or a bit too dark , Great location within 5 minute walking distance of Paddington station easy to walk to Hyde Park plenty of shops and bars restaurants nearby Friendly helpful staff and the continental breakfast included in the price was a nice perk 
155794,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Super hotel very near to Paddington Station and the underground An excellent continental breakfast which you can upgrade to full English Breakfast for less than 5 
155795,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When visiting the hotel bar you are not informed in advance that the hotel will directly block your credit card when you request them to charge the bill to your room , Breakfast was ok nice personnel decent coffe fresh tomatoes 
155796,Norfolk Towers Paddington, cleanliness service and the staff was arrogant Single room was too small could not even open the window After taking a hot shower the air of the room was terrible No ventilation at all Felt suffocated , Location and the standard and of the room was fine but service cleanliness was really bad 
155797,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I booked a Club room and got a room on the loft that you couldn t swing a cat in So that was disappointing I am not one for complaining I just remember for future ,No Positive
155798,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I cannot think of anything , The friendliness of the staff upon arrival The vast choice of breakfast with catering staff being very helpful The room was lovely spacious clean and very quiet 
155799,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast could have been better cafe latte charged at extra cost I had coffee cold milk despite i asked for hot milk many times A lot of noise You will wait a loooong time for the lift, Overall good location room bed
155800,Norfolk Towers Paddington, They only thing that was a minus was the coffee that was included at breakfast instant But this is a tea country so I am not complaining just saying But if you wanted real coffee you could order it from the bar , Comfy bed with with nice and warm fluffy bedding Big and fluffy towels No nice view from the window but who cares about that when you re in LONDON Room size perfect don t know way people have complained about that Maybe they ve never been in a big city before 
155801,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We booked a double room but what they gave us was an economic single room max 8 We told them that we cannot stay there and they should change the room They said that this is a double room I am very very disappointed and would not recommend anyone to stay there ,No Positive
155802,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was tiny and the bathroom as well you would have to be good at tetris in order to position yourself so you can close the bathroom door plus the elevator wasnt working for the whole length of our stay that is 4 days some colleagues of mine had arrived 3 days earlier and the elavator wasnt working then either so we are talking about a full week which meant that we had to use the staircase all the way to the third floor enough times Thankfully the hotel stuff offered to carry our bags when we arrived but that wasnt enough excuse for a broken elevator , The breakfast was fine and the hotel stuff friendly 
155803,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bar in hotel is closed same time as pubs by night Think it has something to do with the local councils Room and corridors were fairly tight in terms of space couple walking around the room even though it was well decorated and laid out , The breakfast was very nice Its a continental breakfast You pay more for English Breakfast Hotel staff pleasant and the hotel was clean Bathroom was clean and had a rain shower Good selection of TV channels 
155804,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The hotel could reach full potential with some small extra amenities and services such as toothbrushes available ironer in the room more flexible hours for room service and an additional extra smile on the staff working at the restaurant especially during breakfast Isolation not maximal so ask a room on the upper floors if you ever need to work from the hotel , Good location in a quiet area close to transportation so you can easily reach all the sights in London Very easy to get to the hotel if you come from Heathrow and use the shuttle to Paddington Room is clean and comfortable Breakfast is good Staff at the reception is very nice and helpful 
155805,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms are small That s a typical feature of hotels near Paddington of course , The location is great A good option for those who travel from Heathrow and other places to Paddington Although this is more a preference for short stays Had European socket in the room 
155806,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Although the room and the windows were isolated the door was not We had a pleasent neighbour who started of a couple of mornings retching his guts out Wifi was a bit slow but still free and availible in the room Not much to complain about , Oh my the bed was wonderful Both English and European electrical outlets and USB ports for charging I liked the lamp system where you could turn on sleeping or ready for cleaning when you went out for the day Continental breakfast included maby not the most hearty kind of breakfast but it did the job and kept you full till lunchtime The location was great a short walk to Paddington station multiple busses stopping outside 6min to Oxford st 25min to Camden Town and a 10min walk down to Hyde Park and Marble Arch The rooms were isolated and had an extra window pane to keep the sound out from the already quiet street outside We tried the restaurant downstairs the last evening ok food and friendly staff I decided to pay a little extra for accommodation on this trip and this hotel definitely was worth it 
155807,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small not good if you are claustrophobic wouldn t be able to do any star jumps in the room barely have any room to breathe also when you wake up Don t expect a coffee with milk all my little longlife milk pots were mouldy and you only get enough for 2 drinks so you are screwed everything else was great tho , Myself 22 F and my daughter 4 stayed here just to sleep sh shower before another hectic day touring london greeted by Lovely polite staff very clean posh modern comfy hotel looked really nice to look at little shop right opposite to buy your own milk and water 5 min walk to Paddington station and few restaurants steak house ask Italian this is my first ever review think I m doing well tbf 
155808,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rate that was quoted for the reservation in usd dollars was not what was charged to my account What I ended up being charged was about 69 usd dollars more The 2 nights were billed separately and I was only asked if I wanted to be charged in dollars for one of them Left me with a very negative feeling which isn t a Great first impression , The room was large for a London property The bathroom was very nice Large beds 
155809,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Too noisy I could hear doors slamming conversations in neighbouring rooms toilets flushing Hard to get to sleep as a result Room size was small ish but the bathroom was ridiculously small Could only close the door if you stood in one exact spot , Decorated and finished to a high standard Very friendly staff Exceptionally comfortable bed and excellent air conditioning 
155810,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift not working Basement room very good but no view OK for one night stay Not particularly cheap , Modern well equipped recently refurbished rooms Very good restaurant food and friendly helpful staff 
155811,Norfolk Towers Paddington, During our stay in the room the only thing was the amount of noise that came from everywhere And we believe that the room LG1 is very near a boiler room hence the constant humming during the night also the walls couldn t isolate the noises coming from outside or from the ceiling as the room was underground , We loved the room the hotel s location the bar staff the reception and welcoming staff where are very good 
155812,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Elevator was of for all our 4 days stay This is an issue that must never happened The technician arrived only on tuesday morning it s not possible that in a similar good hotel like this an elevator is not repaired during the weekend Breakfast is acceptable the hot breakfast section is not free of charge the women at the breakfast desk seems like a police women she controls all people if someone pick a single slice of bacon and charge it with 5 pounds this is simply ridiculous it is a Brexit consequence , Location is perfect Hotel is clean and new staff at the front desk was very nice 
155813,Norfolk Towers Paddington, a very small and rather slow lift , a small boutique hotel where a lot of thought had gone into the planning of the rooms Great breakfast and lovely staff
155814,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The wifi was absolutely terrible and sadly it would keep me from staying again until it was fixed I m traveling internationally for business and I couldn t even send an email in the evening when the hotel was its busiest In 2017 it s just not acceptable to not have reliable wifi especially in a major city , Great little hotel in London Excellent location for the price and the beds were very comfortable The breakfast was included and good and the staff was very helpful with helping me make an emergency copy of some papers and giving me free late check out
155815,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Wonderful hotel I had left another hotel because it was so bad and luckily found this place Welcoming staff with a clean and comfortable room that was perfect 
155816,Norfolk Towers Paddington, My room was small but good value for the amount I was paying , The Buffet Breakfast was excellent as was the Bar and dinner very good value I found the Staff very friendly and helpful The room was always very clean The Bathroom was very modern and completely functional 
155817,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We booked this hotel just for a night after our flight was delayed and we wanted to try something new To be honest I regretted my choice and it was my worst experience in London When we checked in we were told that the lift was under repair And the best part was that we were checked in on the 5th storey of the hotel I don t recall them compensating us for that inconvenience Just imagine going up and down 5 flights of stairs after a long tiring day out The hotel staff brought our luggages to our room and to our horror my friend s luggage handle was broken The staff apologized however he blame my friend s luggage for being heavy which caused the handle to break In the first place if the hotel lift didn t break down this wouldn t happen We told the manager on duty who said he can only offer us complimentary breakfast which we declined The manager said he will bring up the issue to their in charge who will be in the next morning The next morning however the in charge did nothing at all and only told us to email in our complains I was dumbfounded Expected some form of service recovery but got none Speechless Really And the lift wasn t fixed yet that morning Made me wonder just because I m not staying in a 5 star hotel doesn t mean I don t deserve service right , About 5 7mins walk away from Paddington train station and cosy bed Bigger room than our previous hotel 
155818,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Continental breakfast was included in the room price The hotel also had hot breakfast available for extra but the continental breakfast didn t have any eggs available which would have been an improvement My room was upgraded at check in to what they called a suite which had a sofa I suspect the original room would have been small No iron available or bottled water Hairdryer lacked power and was difficult to use with arthritic hands , Great location walking distance to underground stations Edgware Road and Paddington Huge variety of restaurants near by and in the Paddington Basin Right next to St Mary s Hospital so would be brilliant for someone visiting a sick relative or friend Small but well equipped bathroom 
155819,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room smelt mouldy Moved to upper floor where size was tiny and air conditioning didn t work Third room was tiny but clean and comfortable , Location
155820,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms are very small and the elevator didn t work during our stay 4 days They gave us a room on the third floor but we asked for another room At first they didn t want to give us another room but eventually we had to sleep one night in that room and the other two nights we were moved to another room on the first floor If you are a tall person the beds are way too small Last but not least you have to pay extra for english breakfast We chose the continental normal breakfast but there s little choice what you want to eat , We really liked the style of the hotel and the location is very good it s nearby paddington station The staff is nice 
155821,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room size was small but over the week got used to it , we had Continental Breakfast which was very good Plenty of variety and good quality Tea and coffee brought to table Very happy 
155822,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lady on the front of house at breakfast was enough to sour your milk She didn t smile and too busy trying to pick faults with her staff even though they were doing an amazing job Nothing worse than seeing staff being told off this should be kept for behind the scenes extremely unprofessional Room is very small not much space for cases or any luggage , The hotel room had a fridge which is always a bonus when travelling room was clean 
155823,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room is totally small for couples The elevator was broken and the didn t mentioned that while they gave me the room in the fourth floor so it was a long up stairs to the room, I like the cleanness Wifi was strong Close to edgware road and exford road
155824,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was way too warm even though I was on the ground floor and had turned down the thermostats couldn t open the windows both my partner and I kept stubbing our toes when leaving the bathroom you couldn t see the tv screen when soaking in the tub all you could see was the reflection of the ceiling and last but not least the taps in the bathroom didn t run cold and there was no water in the mini fridge so I could not have a cold glass of water , The bed was so comfortable it felt like I was sleeping on a cloud Also it was very clean 
155825,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift of the hotel This is my second visit and the lift was not working The room is very small, Location and restaurants nearby Mosque just in front of the hotel
155826,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We were on the 5th floor and lift wasn t working on our 2nd morning disgrace also I booked a room for 3 adults but the room was really small with 2 single beds pushed together and a pull out couch which there really was not much room for room was really stuffy We had to leave window open all night and was really noisy outside sounded like some kind of fan , Location was good
155827,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast room was tiny so there was a queue rooms were minuscule and it was difficult to get out of the toilet because of how tight everything was room decor was subpar , Bed was huge but only because it was two singles put together 
155828,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathroom was so small was extremely difficult to get in and out the door would ve been better opening into the room, The decor was lovely and modern
155829,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Club double room bathroom VERY small Constant noise from ventilation fans motors at rear of property and we were on the fifth floor , Friendly helpful and professional staff Lovely full English breakfast Close to paddington Station with luggage storage before and after check in departure 
155830,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast staff spoke abruptly single words such as Coffee Milk and Sign and without pleasantries cooked breakfast was rather bland and a little cold compared with the additional 5 price to the continental breakfast Garfunkles down the street do a fine breakfast cooked to order for 5 95 , Great location for using public transport good rooms quiet and generally a good experience Check in staff friendly well spoken and helpful 
155831,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Shower head was loose and difficult to make work, This hotel continues to outdo itself in terms of the quality of the rooms and the lovely friendly staff
155832,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Since we were two of us with 12 days stay We had a lot of luggage with us 4 bags to be precise and it was quite a small room for us to manage with all the 4 bags and move around comfortably inside the room So having the room size slightly bigger in size would help for twin room sharing customers like us with more luggage space Otherwise the room was always cleaned every single day and was spic span by the time we return in the evening from our meetings , Location is very accessible to both Paddington and Edgware Tube stations Plenty of food options around the Hotel for Lunch Dinner including Indian joints The Hotel Room was in a quiet zone they do so while booking when we mention we are coming for business so it was very helpful after a long day work to relax without outside hustle bustle Helpful staff and a good breakfast spread Overall quite a value for money Hotel 
155833,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Was a little disappointed that I had requested upon booking an early check in between 12noon and 1pm On arrival this was not possible unless we paid from 69 extra If this was the case I feel I should have been informed when I originally requested , The bed was really comfy Shower bath facilities lovely 
155834,Norfolk Towers Paddington, A bit more flexibility I arrived at noon and couldn t check in till 2 30 The only hotel lift was broken for the period of my stay The till in the bar was also not working and could only do card payments Staff were friendly enough but there didn t seem to be a big effort to be more flexible with guests , Location of hotel
155835,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There s only one lift and it was out of order for the three days I was there This meant climbing four narrow flights of stairs each time I saw no sign of a repair under way It s totally out of keeping with the quality of this hotel , The staff was excellent the room smallish but well fitted out the breakfast just fine 
155836,Norfolk Towers Paddington, breakfast included but they offer you just the continental breakfast very poor and they prepare in another table the English breakfast eggs bacon salad etc but you have to pay for that no sense all peopole just had the continental one with disappointment elevetor they didn t repair the elevetor so you have to do 3 floors of stairs with your luggage they don t offer you help be careful at the rooms Under the level of the street they are very noise I don t suggest more for the service than for the structure that could be good, good position close to hidepark close to paddington metro stop
155837,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift was broken had to go up to the fifth floor evening and morning Breakfast was poor as per 4 star hotel Small room , The stuff were really nice and friendly As per price quality this hotel is a very recommendable option Great location easy access to the metro trains and Heathrow airport only 20 mins 
155838,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It was slightly disappointing to not be able to get ice or drinks after the bar had closed No bottled water available in the room so if you need a drink you have to walk to shop at night , Fantastic little boutique hotel was great to be upgraded to a suite and the staff were so welcoming and friendly 
155839,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Personalens attityd var mystisk De viskade n stan oupph rligt sinsemellan log i princip aldrig alternativt kort och forcerat verkade inte trivas p sitt jobb Att hissen inte fungerade var ett klart minus med 5 trappor att g , Mycket bra frukost trevlig restaurang 
155840,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I was charged extra for breakfast paid it in cash and the noticed when I arrived home it was took out of my account also and never got it back, Like how cosy the room was and the area was perfect
155841,Norfolk Towers Paddington, some spots of dirt in the bathroom The elevator wasn t t working but as we had only hand luggage it was no big deal, the room was small but nice and tidy the bed was comfortable quiet location and room Very good continental breakfast with coffee tee choices of juice and bread fruit yoghurt cereal etc 
155842,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator was broken this time But what can you do the staff helped me with my suitcases all good , I really like this hotel It was my second time here and I didn t regret it for a second The location is perfect The staff is so friendly and willing to help The rooms are stylish and clean The shower is simply awesome Great value 
155843,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator was not working I was not informed prior arrival and my room was on fifth floor This was really annoying and disappointing I have a knee injury and had to climb for 5 floors every day What was really bad is that the staff didn t try anything to make up for this issue, The location and the room were good
155844,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Unfortunately we asked for a quiet room which wasn t the case we were down stairs in room 4 and every foot step and every suitcase could be heard also the rumble of the underground every couple of minutes, The room was very clean and comfortable breakfast was her good plenty of choice the staff were very attentive 
155845,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift is small I had difficult times becoz i was having baby pram Only 1 lift had to wait longer At checking in we arrived from airport 8AM they said its too early to check in so we went out starting our tour and came back to the hotel by 1 pm still they said its early we have to wait till 3 pm i was disapointed becoz i have a 2 years old baby needed to sleep , Clean hotel Near to bus station Calm area Looks new hotel In geneal it is good to stay again
155846,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator was out of service our entire stay 4 nights Too long to repair , Good breakfast very nice staff great location very clean Small rooms but it did not bother us 
155847,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Was not served at the bar as it was 11pm despite the fact residents were in the bar having a drink I was not advised that if I did want a drink from the bar it would have to be done via the night porter The lift was not operational I have difficulty walking and my room was on the 5th floor No attempt was made to find me a room on a low floor The lift remained out of order overnight and in the morning No communication as to when the repair would take place , Location cleanliness well maintained
155848,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator did not function and I was placed in 5 floor The stairway are a joke The old chines lady organizer of breakfast need a smiling course, Location
155849,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift was out of order and looked like it had been for some time It wasn t referenced at time of booking and no allowance made on price for the inconvenience , Comfortable hotel well placed for Paddington
155850,Norfolk Towers Paddington, No telephone signal in room 001, I have visited your hotel before with my wife This time I was on my own we plan to stay with you again during June July on a business visit to London
155851,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift broken down but we were on 1st floor so not an issue , The beds were very comfortable shower was especially powerful the hotel was friendly with food options if required and it was centrally located for Paddington and underground 
155852,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Being picky the room and bed were a bit small but we were expecting that after reading other reviews Lift was broken and stairs were quite steep 3 floors up meant a good workout for the thighs , Stylish decor and staff couldn t be more helpful Great location for paddington station everything in easy walking distance Hotel was quiet and clean My partner had the full English and said it was really good Breakfast staff were really efficient and friendly Check in was easy and we were able to leave luggage before and after check in with no trouble at all Room was very warm but had air con so we were able to easily adjust that 
155853,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Broken Lift No Room Service available Bath was tiny Executive Double was quite small for the price , Clean and tidy with comfortable bed Good location for Paddington 
155854,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Reception works very slowly I ve been waiting for 10 minutes while just one receptionist have been talking However all staff are very professional and politely My room was very little in comparison with average rooms in London Last one corridor was very tight so tightly that I hardly go through it with baby carriage, Location and facilities perfect Furniture perfect and climate control too all staff are very professional and politely 
155855,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was very small Expected a little for price and location but 2 ladies could not get ready at the same time Fine for a night or 2 at most not for longer stays ,No Positive
155856,Norfolk Towers Paddington, For one room was absolutely too small There was barely any space to walk around the bed and even more so for our suitcases Was definitely too cramped Also they could not offer us bottled water to the room and told us to drink from the tap or go to the tesco to get one For the money being asked per night you would think this could be offered without a problem Also staff seemed a bit off and just annoyed at really anything that was asked from them , Location was good It is close to paddington station and there s plenty of restaurants nearby Bed was soft but comfy Breakfast was continental or for 4 more you can get English breakfast 
155857,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Beds, We arrived and we re given a basement room I asked is there a window Yes there was a window overlooking the firestairs the room itself looked nice but we could hardly move it was so tiny to use the loo with the door closed you needed to straddle to toilet or step into the bath and the noise throughtout the night was dreadful we think the kitchen area was above our room and they stomped around quite a lot 2nd night we asked to move rooms and were accommodated no problem both beds were like sleeping in a hammock far too soft and if your over 5 7 your feet will hang out of the end good location clean and lovely decor just the comfort issue which let it down for us breakfast was included and was OK
155858,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the breakfast was very limited the corridors are very narrow there is only one elevator for the whole residents the rooms are small, location is good the staff tried to do thier best to help
155859,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Expencive facial product went missing from one of our rooms It was never found We were also promised to have breakfast to go because we had early check out but this we never got Also our triple room suite were at the basement and what it sounded like near kitchen After 10 pm there were quite noisy clearning the kitchen or something Service at the restaurant at dinner was quite slow , Clean rooms and nice overall look Good food and breakfast at the spot 
155860,Norfolk Towers Paddington, First night sound of water rushing in ceiling I was moved to another room unfortunately over a c units which was very noisy Hotel wanted to move me again but as i was staying only 3 nights did not want to repack again ,No Positive
155861,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was incredibly small just acceptable for 1 person as we were 2 persons we didnt have room to open our suitcases unless we put them on the bed Was difficult to get out of the bathroom it was so small The lift was small took ages you could just fit 2 persons with 2 suitcases ,No Positive
155862,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nit picking but the bathroom though beautifully styled was a little too dark to see to do make up etc The breakfast eggs had been there a little too long , The hotel has been totally re vamped since my last stay and the facilities are excellent The new lower ground floor room was extremely stylish and HUGE The staff always make your stay even better so friendly and they do anything they can to see to your needs Like a 5 hotel service Ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was very good 
155863,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The double room s paper thin wall, Excellent staff we re booked with double bed and wanted to see if twin beds room available they took well care of it not only did they changed us to twin bed room the room was bigger and with better sound proof they also helped us to move our bags we d totally stay again 
155864,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The only small negative was the slightly basic continental breakfast and busy breakfast service was still tasty though , The room was a good size and modern the bed was very comfy and the shower was very good 
155865,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The hotel has a rather sterile ambiance starting from reception It needs something to break up that sterility flowers plants etc Since its renovation I would report it as having started well but needing now to add colour and warmth , Location Convenient for any central London purpose 
155866,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bedroom seemed bigger in picture A member of staff was unhappy with us when we told her we asked for tea instead of coffee at breakfast , Most staff were nice
155867,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Banging doors Bar prices , General atmosphere and friendly helpful staff Good choice at breakfast Great location for transport links Executive room nice and spacious 
155868,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The only issue we had with our stay was that despite paying for breakfast when we booked we were told of an additional charge if we opted for the cooked breakfast However the overall experience was excellent and we are planning on staying here again , Excellent staff in both the hotel and restaurant very friendly and helpful extremely close to Paddington tube and train station safe location with shops near its vicinity 
155869,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I was disgusted at the size of my room for 99 pound I basically got a space that I couldn t even turn around in I was awake all night and then to make things worse the woman at the desk told me breakfast started at 6am it didn t it was 7am so I missed it There are far better rooms in other hotels for the same price,No Positive
155870,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very thin walls Noise from corridors roads adjacent room Windows cant be opened Very poor ventilation and room air quality very poor Mattresses very uncomfortable, Breakfast was good
155871,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Couldn t open the windows for fresh air maybe there was a way but I couldn t see it, Lovely little boutique hotel that was modern and warm with nice staff I was a little unwell during my stay but they were very sympathetic with me and that helps when you are on your own and feeling poorly 
155872,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Maybe room could have been bigger but we are not big people so ok for us , Excellent location when using the train to Paddington Completely modernised everything spotless 
155873,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift is a nightmare One lift serving all floors and used by staff and guests Lift very small and slow Stayed on the first floor and lift would often stop with people going up despite pressing to go down Stairs are quicker and easier to use Wifi very slow and found 3G to be quicker Room we stayed in was very small despite next door room being much bigger , The hotel was very clean and all staff friendly Excellent location with bus underground really close 
155874,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was tiny I ve seen bigger broom cupboards The shape of the room was laughable Bed was cut into a wall so that once you climbed it you had walls on both sides I ve no idea how a cleaner would get in there as I calculated the floor area as about 1 5m sq even getting undressed you were banging up against walls and then there was nowhere to put anything Wifi was non existent , The location was good for getting a train the next day The room was quiet once the extra fan stopped which took ages 
155875,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Went down to breakfast during the last half hour but there was very little left Hadn t realised it was an extra 5pp for a cooked breakfast Should have been offered that when we checked in , The bed was really really comfortable and the room was extremely clean 
155876,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms a little close together and heard a little noise in the morning Gluten free knowledge was average more training Not much choice for GF , Location was great quick to central London and theatres Plenty to see within walking distance Breakfast was really good staff pretty helpful 
155877,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was very tight No slippers No Teeth brush was provided Noisy you can hear the sound of toilet flush from other rooms Breakfast is the same everyday and very limited choices, Staff
155878,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The whole experience was extremely poor I had to change rooms TWICE because they got the room type wrong in the first room then the second room door would not lock and the final room was just very worn down The staff were nonchalant to this fact That was extremely frustrating I was given a run down iron and ironing board that I couldn t use because it was just rotten I went for food in the roba restaurant I think that s the name and it was terrible and the cutlery and serving plates were filthy so I couldn t even eat my food which was all frozen by the way I had garlic bread and fries as a snack but cancelled the main I genuinely wouldn t recommend this place if you intend to feel comfortable or you are used to high quality hotels , The actual decor was good location was great 
155879,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bedroom 309 was rather on the small size and a squeeze around the bathroom door to get in Anyone on the large size would find it difficult Lift took a long time to respond Fans at rear were a little noisy during night , Location was fine about 5 minutes walk from Paddington and bus stops not far from the door Hotel clean and staff were very friendly 
155880,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The mini bar was empty The toilet seat wasn t cleaned properly but everything else was clean and perfect , I stayed in the club double room The place was clean and the bed was comfy The room was big enough I enjoyed my stay as the location was perfect and everything was near me 
155881,Norfolk Towers Paddington, My room had a connecting door to next room This door wasn t locked and no way of locking We had access to their room and vice versa This left us uneasy about leaving valuables in the room I think these rooms should be allocated to people who book more than one room , Location clean modern
155882,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Fresh milk for tea and coffee facilities in room Also decaf versions of tea and coffee Bottled water would be nice , Closeness to station and shops Staff very helpful Had everything you might need in room 
155883,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room on first floor was small however many city centre hotel rooms are so really can t complain Bed was quite soft yet was still comfortable , Excellent customer service cleanliness in this modern hotel Continental breakfast was really lovely very fresh and good quality items In addition a cooked breakfast was only 4 95 extra if you wanted this but as the continental breakfast was so good we didn t avail of it 
155884,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It was sort of noise during the night because it room was in the basement under the restaurant , Location cleanness friendly staff and size of the room 
155885,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There s only one lift which can slow things down to a halt during busy hours like breakfast The WiFi was too slow , The staff is very friendly and courteous The location is amazing The bed was comfortable 
155886,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room we got was really tiny and quite cold and AC wasn t warming the room properly The room had a balcony which door wasn t insulated properly Breakfast was sufficient but there could be a bit more choice We didn t opt for the English breakfast WiFi was sluggish , The hotel itself was OK and the location was quite good Underground station was just a couple blocks away and there was plenty of restaurants nearby Free WiFi although on the slow side 
155887,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Single glazing in the window meant the room became cold very quickly The basement executive suite was perfect other than the constant drone of an extractor fan outside , The hotel was a simple 2 3 minute stroll from the front of Paddington Station in a seemingly nice clean and vibrant area of Paddington itself The selection of both continental and English breakfasts were good and the English items sausages bacon hash browns fried and scrambled eggs etc were all nicely cooked and not slimey or cheap tastinng like most buffet breakfasts The restuarants food was excellent and flavoursome and the cocktails were reasonably priced and went down very smoothly We were upgraded from an executive double to suite for free which was a pleasant surprise and the room itself was all but faultless Being near Paddington station also meant being on the Bakerloo Tube line to take you to the heart of shopping in Oxford and Regent street sights of Picadilly Circus and links to other tubes all around London for whatever you fancy 
155888,Norfolk Towers Paddington, If I have to be critical then room size otherwise everything perfect, This was a clean hotel close to most amenities and being a single woman traveller I felt very safe Would certainly visit again 
155889,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Unfortunately there was what appeared to be some dried bodily fluids on the head board of the bed the water pressure was rubbish and the lady at breakfast was very rude , It was kind of the check in staff to give us an upgrade and they were very friendly 
155890,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Virtually nothing Only comment though impractical for the hotel to easily remedy the lift is rather small and slow , The courteous and helpfull staff The up to date and comprehensive room facilities all of which worked Location and value 
155891,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Missed breakfast Not the fault of the hotel as I had to leave early to catch a flight , First class hotel which is very convenient to Paddington Station
155892,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The staff in the restaurant weren t very professional The manager in the restaurant a small dark haired rounded woman was extremely belittling and rude to me and my friend who were having dinner last Sunday 15th Calling me Hun and sweetheart whilst pointing something out that I d got wrong Really sarcastic manner and ordering everyone around like they re her slaves It was really off putting Also the lift kept stopping at every level whenever someone would press it it took ages to get to our level , Good breakfast and comfy beds clean room and good showers overall good value for money 
155893,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room is very small I felt like sleeping in the corridor the room is not soundproof at all however the heater needs time to warm the room Also we had to wait for the breakfast which was not worth it, They provide bags storage services I left my bags for 3 hours after check out
155894,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Staff in the dinning room they act as police no smile at all They booked the money from the account 5 days befor comming and on booking reservation it says free cancellation up to 2 days before booking, Great location near Paddington station a lot of restautants and bars Rooms are clean 
155895,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room LG6 was quite noisy we could hear chairs being moved around noise from the kitchen restaurant English breakfast would have been nice as an inclusion when paying for continental breakfast, Bed was comfy amenities good and the map and the friendly advice we were given was helpful
155896,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Maybe some biscuits along with the tea coffee facilities in the room would be nice , Very friendly and accomodating staff beautiful decor great rooms Loved its location 
155897,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift inadequate for size of hotel , Surprisingly quiet excellent shower comfortable bed good towels nicely fitted room easy reach Paddington Station very good Continental breakfast full English available at reasonable cost everything we needed 
155898,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It wasn t the cleanest A few of the facilities mentioned in the list was not including Since we were on the lower ground floor we heard a lot of noise from above so we had broken sleep The employees seemed a bit stiff , Our room was upgraded which was nice The bed was comfortable and the location was good since everything was around us The bathroom was lovely and there was a lot of space in our room 
155899,Norfolk Towers Paddington, no parking at hotel rooms were not soundproof early morning can hear people moving around upstairs in lobby and staff moving cleaning supplies next to the room DO NOT USE NCP EDGEWARE ROAD our car got broken into, hotel was brilliant food was good
155900,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was very slow it took a long time to come stopped on every floor even when there wasn t people there for it but as we were on the 4th floor it was too much to always take the stairs, The room was small but bed was comfy rooms were clean Lots of hot water staff very helpful Breakfast was nice offered a full English breakfast as well at an extra cost 
155901,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Two main issues really the room which we had for this visit was much smaller than the room we had the previous year The bathroom was extremely small Also there is only one lift which can only hold a maximum or three guests Shouldn t be too much of an issue unless like us you are on the fifth floor The stairs from the second floor up get very narrow , Second stay in this hotel and I will be going back again It s location is absolutely perfect Two tube stations and within a 2 minute walk very good bus services available from just outside the hotel The room was very clean Breakfast was very good with a wide variety of choice Staff were very helpful 
155902,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, I think this is the first time when we booked a room on this website and the photos of the hotel are exactly what the hotel looks like in real life We ve booked club room and got a free upgrade to one of their suites The room was very clean and spacious and the beds were comfy There was a TV in the bathroom and a walk in shower We enjoyed our stay so much Staff were all friendly and helpful The check out was at 11am however when we called reception asking for later check out we ve been told we can stay till 12 30 free of charge which absolutely made our day Thank you so much We will definitely be back 
155903,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very poor Service Rude staff Tiny rooms Lumpy mattresses High Cost Non variety of food esp breakfast One lift for 5 floors , Location is one of the only positives 
155904,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The breakfast included is really limited Besides the room is small so people had to wait to get a table for their breakfast Only one lift up to 5 people at the time for the entire hotel , The location is excellent 5 minutes from Paddington station and many buses stops The entire hotel is clean and looks brand new The staff is kind
155905,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room itself very small Wardrobe right up against side of the bed so kept knocking elbow on it when turning over Rooms not very well soundproofed Could hear people in the next room quite easily , Clean friendly staff and nice shower Breakfast included in the price 
155906,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Continental breakfast was included but to upgrade to full English costs 6 Not a massive amount but to ask extra to add the small number of items on offer seems mean and penny pinching A small issue but when I booked the hotel it said breakfast included Anyway the breakfast was very good and staff were polite and helpful , Very clean and well presented Good location close to Hyde Park and Oxford Street Great for walking and shopping but only two minutes walk from Paddington and the underground etc Staff in restaurant were very good 
155907,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When I arrived I was told I had got an upgrade My upgraded room was in the basement I could hear trains underground every 3 minutes buses every 5 minutes the lock didn t work it was cold there were bathrooms beside the room which had an incredibly loud dryer or fan system as it was under the reception area which had a tiled floor I could hear all footsteps and luggage passing through , The staff moved me to a quieter room on the second floor 
155908,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast was a little disappointing but with so many great places to eat near by this was not a problem for us The sound proofing between the rooms were very good but you could hear everything happening in the hallway We kept wondering if the door was open when people walked by it wasn t Luckily it was normally very quiet so it wasn t a major concern Small room with no room for suitcases We traveled with one big suitcase and it was possible to open it on the floor but I doubt you could open another one at the same time and still be able to walk from the bed to the bathroom There was a rack for hanging clothes but not really any shelves , A very friendly and helpful staff Very clean rooms good looking bathrooms Elevator Comfortable bed Good TV and a great charging station with USB ut put and sockets used in other countries Refrigerator Great location And a great choice of restaurants nearby and a Tesco Very close to the metro and bus stops 
155909,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator is way too slow and too small for my liking Also supposedly we were given a soundproof room but we could hear conversations from the outside , The location of the hotel is ideal where the underground and train station is just 5 minutes walk away The executive room we stayed in was small but very cosy The bar on the ground floor serves the best fish I ve ever tasted The staff hotel were very helpful hardworking and friendly Double thumbs up for them 
155910,Norfolk Towers Paddington, 1 The room was too small even I couldn t have space for my suitcase 2 I booked room with breakfast but I found that the hotel have another breakfast you have to pay 5 Pounds more 3 The price was unbelievable per one night with this room 4 The bathroom also was too small , I didn t like anything in the hotel
155911,Norfolk Towers Paddington, In the basement poor light right below reception so could here everything noisey all night never slept both days there plus waitress at breakfast was very rude, Not much
155912,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Would have liked some flexibility on the check in time we arrived at 12 30 and check in was at 3 pm I had requested early check in prior however got a non committal answer and no accommodation till 3 so we had to wander around as we had travelled from Toronto overnight we were looking forward to freshening up , Was all good we did not eat at the hotel restaurant as we preferred to walk up the street to a little cafe for breakfast and for dinner we ate at the local pubs 
155913,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small hardly enough room to move also asked several times for more tea sugar and milk but never got it, The hotel was in a good location
155914,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift not working all the way up to our floor Needed to take stairs for last flight Difficult with luggage , Great location very clean Continental breakfast included
155915,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was dusty and so so small Me and my husband have asthma We wanted a room with a bath well the bath was so small my feet were hanging out I m 5 foot 1 my poor husband is taller so well he didn t even try We kept bumping our feet ect my husband got so clostraphobic he went outside several times for some air I ordered some food to our room but was so shocked the chicken wings still had feathers on them I was horrified I couldn t sleep the pillow was so flat It was a very disappointing experience, Nothing much
155916,Norfolk Towers Paddington, To avoid all rooms ending with 16 they are very small cold and wifi signal it s very bad Breakfast based on save money not customer oriented,No Positive
155917,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Breakfast was included in our price which was lovely But it turned out that only part of the breakfast buffet was included so you had to pay extra depending on what you selected also coffee and tea were not included either It felt a cheap way to make extra money off the guests 
155918,Norfolk Towers Paddington, room is way too small and the picture on Booking com does not depict the exact size Bathroom is so tiny that the door can barely open when occupied, distance from train staton
155919,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small rooms and gets pretty hot during the night , Small but cosy rooms with everything you need for a city break great location near Paddington station just round the corner from Hyde Park Good selection of continental English breakfast Helpful and friendly staff 
155920,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Really only minor things The elevator kept breaking but the staff was happy to carry our luggage up and down the stairs The chamber maid sometimes forgot to change the drinking glasses apart from that the room was clean and nice The breakfast room was a tad too small so several days we had to wait This seemed like a recurring problem which they easily could have solved by adding a couple more tables , Friendly and helpful staff good breakfast delicious dinner in the hotel restaurant Excellent central location 
155921,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Only one lift to use for throughout the whole hotel which worked incredibly slow and can only fit three people , Bed was comfortable and the hotel was very clean
155922,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small and the bed rediculously small My feet and half of my legs were hanging off the edge Even with budget chains you get a kingsize The one lift took about 10 minutes to get to you and only took 3 people , The hotel was very clean and well presented Staff polite and nice breakfast 
155923,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Asked for and confirmed 2 single beds with staff on arrival but got a double Rubbish lift Had to use stairs due to number of customers but I had cracked ribs and was better moving than waiting more than the 10 mins we had waited Disappointing hadcto wait for she s in foyer for a breakfast table Continental Breakfast VERY Poor , Comfortable bed 
155924,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Had a little trouble with heating the room One minute it was too hot then it was too cold , The bed was very comfy We were upgraded to a suite for free Everything was very clean 
155925,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room is too small it was the executive and i was by myself i can t imagine this space for two it s good for one or two nights but not more , Location staff comfort
155926,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bedrooms we re quite small very compact Having to pay for p a glass of water at Breakfast seemed a bit odd , Great location if using Paddington station Very helpful and friendlyl staff 
155927,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Sorry my comment is for both boxes, Paid for English breakfast stone cold told the lady boss didn t do anything just walked away poor ending for a fab hotel
155928,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I booked a single room which was almost the same price of the couple room the given room so tight as I couldn t even turn around I bet Jail would be more convenient to stay I advice everybody to Check the room space before booking , The location
155929,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Had a room underneath the dining room so very very noisy in the mornings with scraping of chairs and tables across the wooden floor which irritated us and kept us awake , Suite was fantastic load of room Bathroom was huge Big comfy bed which was a bonus and continental breakfast really good 
155930,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, The hotel looked as it had just had a refurb everything was clean and modern The staff were very friendly and polite we were near to most amenities subways were near but we took taxis everywhere and found that they were not too expensive to use we visited winter wonderland which was brilliant had a great time 
155931,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Definitely needs another lift installing lift far too small and slow , All the staff were exceptional have stayed in many London hotels and not found staff as friendly as at Norfolk Towers very nice bar and restaurant 
155932,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The Lift were troublesome it was really slow and even dropped to the lower level at least twice when I was inside , The room surprisingly quite spacious 
155933,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator lift was broken during the two days of our stay there was only one lift in the hotel and we were given a room on the 4th floor which was quite a trek upstairs The room was very small and barely had space to move around for two people let alone have our luggage open The bathrooms too were very small if I was brushing my teeth no one else could come in to the toilets or else I would get hit by the door While the staff were apologetic for the lift not working definitely the value for money was less as I could have been at a hotel where the basic details such as lift was working and I would have had a larger room and toilet for the same price I paid for the room at Norfolk , The staff was friendly and location was good 
155934,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Wifi wasn t great and was a bit irritating that you had to constantly re sign in , Room was comfortable in size and the bathroom was nice and modern Breakfast included was excellent lots of options 
155935,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Food was not hot almost cold ran out of wines Couldn t lower the air conditioning at night too hot didn t sleep , So clean staff extremely pleasant Very comfortable Staff went out of their way to make us welcome Continental breakfast excellent 
155936,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I could not fault anything at the Norfolk Towers , The hotel was very clean the food fresh and well presented the staff were exceptionally nice All the staff were extremely professional helpful 
155937,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Would definitely stay here again Staff were very polite The hotel was clean the beds are the comfiest ones we have ever stayed in to the point my partner wanted to find out where they purchased them from Breakfast was delightful Great location Couldn t have been happier with our stay 
155938,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room a little warm , Good location very near to Paddington station easy walk Staff very pleasant and helpful Very clean modern tidy facilities Good breakfast included in the price 
155939,Norfolk Towers Paddington, On arrival we found 2 long black Hairs in the bedsheets Elevator out of Service and room in 4th floor We booked a quiet room and what we got was a room next to the elevator which was very loud and also the room themselves were not sound isolated We even could hear our neighbours talking The breakfast included turned out to be only for continental breakfast and they asked for extra payment if we want english breakfast It was overall very dirty and old For all this it is much too expensive We cannot recommend this hotel , It is close Paddington Station 
155940,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Staff on front desk unhelpful and poor communication skills At one point when phoning for room service to restaurant I was told that they would try but that they were very busy mam Not my problem get more staff , Room nice clean location v good good continental breakfast
155941,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was too small to classify it as a double room bed was too small for two people Room was on the 4th floor lift not working stairs were very steep Continental breakfast included in the price and extra 4 95 to be paid if you want full English breakfast, Bedroom was modern and clean with tea and coffee facilities bathroom with bath and shower towels shower gel etc were provided Hotel staff friendly and helpful Restaurant small but clean Cooked breakfast very nice but extra cost on top of hotel room
155942,Norfolk Towers Paddington, One room was small but that is too be expected in London The other room was directly under the lobby and was very noisy However the staff were very accommodating and moved us upstairs , Staff were very friendly and helpful Location was good and very close to Paddington tube stop Can take the Heathrow Express Rooms were clean 
155943,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Location very close to train tracks Cleanliness bathroom mirror dirty Charges used phone in room attempted to charge me 128 for a 20 minute phone call Staff unhelpful generally in resolving issue Slow broadband Lift wasn t working Thermostat very difficult to use, On the whole the room was very nice bed was comfortable Complimentary upgrade to a suite Breakfast included in price
155944,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The only negative was that the lift wasn t working so we had to take the stairs But they offered help with luggage and maintenance was taking place immediately to get it up and running again Plus my girlfriend doesn t like lifts so we d have probably taken the stairs anyway And it was clearly just a technical fault which happens to everyone so it wasn t really something I d pick to improve about Norfolk Towers , The entire 2 days my girlfriend and I spent there were faultess and nothing less than perfect really The overall comfort and luxury of the place was lovely and made for a great experience and good nights sleep Plus for the price we payed it was more than worth the money The optional extra 4 95 full English breakfast was delicious and there was plenty of it left even towards the end of the morning would recommend on top of the free breakfast options Plus the location of the hotel was really convenient given that we were 5 minutes walk from Hyde park and 2 minutes walk from Paddington station which was easy to then get about in London We plan to head back to London around the same time next year and we ll be booking with Norfolk Towers again 
155945,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was lovely but my only complaint would be its a little small It was quite hard to move around and was especially hard to open and close the bathroom door if you were in the bathroom as there was no room , Location was great Only a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park to visit Winter Wonderland We had prosecco and strawberries sent to our room in the evening to celebrate our anniversary and the bar lady was very friendly and helpful Breakfast in the morning was delicious aswell Everything was clean and the bar was well stocked aswell Always a bonus 
155946,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathroom was tiny and the breakfast was just about mediocre The shaving mirror was also broken but I didnt need it so that was no big deal , The location is perfect for central London the staff were lovely and the beds were ultra comfortable The tea provided in the rooms was really nice 
155947,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms were absolutely tiny Nothing like the pictures on the website You couldn t close the bathroom door without maneuvering around the toilet first and once you d taken all the cushions off the bed there was no room to walk around it Would have been better of staying in a budget hotel ,No Positive
155948,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, I was worried about the stay after reading other reviews but had no need to worry Staff were very friendly The rooms were clean and perfect for what we wanted Nice location near the tube station We left are luggage in the store this was really helpful Breakfast was hot and plentiful Would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again 
155949,Norfolk Towers Paddington, That I couldn t stay longer , Staff really helpful and friendly which was especially good as my mum was travelling with me and is partially sighted Room was just what we needed very comfy beds and excellent bathroom
155950,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was a little small for 2 people but we weren t in it much so it didn t really matter the area around Paddington station is still pretty grim but is definitely improving , Staff were cheerful polite friendly and competent not a grumpy one amongst them 
155951,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very SLOW lift Breakfast can be improved , Nice location 5 mins from paddington Rooms are average for London in terms of size but clean comfy 
155952,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room small so double bed only accessible from one side and bottom This causes problems when you are both of a certain age and have to get up at different times in the night , Good location to get bus to Oxford St etc 
155953,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Requested early check in in advance by email and was surprised it was unavailable and also at a charge of 69 I have stayed in many hotels around the world including London August 2016 and have always been facilitated with early check in when requested and never at an extra charge that was very disappointing as I had to change and freshen up after my early am flight in a public toilet as not even a spare room was available for me to use Very very disappointing and I will never use this hotel again as a result or recommend it to friends and family, Location breakfast staff cleanliness
155954,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom could be bigger as could the lift Price of drinks in the bar were very high but thats the norm in London , Very modern and very clean Central location for Paddington station Staff were very helpful Would highly recommend this hotel 
155955,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Unfortunate problem in room meaning we had to move to a much smaller room but an extra day after we alerted staff No duty manager on at night , The modern decor space in the first room
155956,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Very convenient for Paddington Bedroom are perfectly nice But I would not call this a boutique hotel Not that charming It was quiet and you could open the window I would stay there again if I need to be near Paddington 3 minutes walk 
155957,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing, All staff were very friendly and helpful Stayed in an executive room with huge comfortable bed All very clean Continental breakfast was lovely great choice of cereals and fruits
155958,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bedroom 508 was not really a double as far as room area is concerned If there had been two of us I do wonder where a second suitcase would have been stored I did contact reception to check it was a Club bedroom as I expected a larger room Only one person at a time in the bathroom and the shower screen was not sufficient to stop water spraying onto the floor at the side of the toilet I was very angry when I realised that the lift only went to the fourth floor I should have returned to reception and asked for help to the fifth floor which was up a very steep narrow staircase but had had a long day and simply wanted to get to my room I was angry because I was not informed by reception that the lift was out of order after the fourth floor consequently each time I returned to my room I had to climb the top stairs Being in my seventies and a woman I do not understand why the state of the lift was not pointed out to me or even why I was allocated the top floor I always ask for a higher rather than a lower floor but certainly do not expect the lift to be partly out of order Before I booked out of the hotel I rang for assistance to carry my suitcase to the next floor down and as it so happens as I opened my bedroom door to put my suitcase in the corridor one of the hotel staff was in the process of carrying other suitcases for the same reason At reception I was given an invoice for my two night stay and it was only when I checked later in the day found that the charge was correct but the address belonged to someone else Reception need to up their game as it lets the hotel down , The Club bedroom on the fifth floor was very comfortable and quiet and as the room was so high up in the building I slept with the blind up which was lovely to go to sleep looking at the night sky 
155959,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Tiny room like a cupboard thin walls could hear what was going on in every room around me not great at night and as a normally very good sleeper I got very little sleep Slow Slow elevator, Clean modern bright and good breakfast
155960,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was noisy draft coming in from windows heating did not work only a small radiator tv did not work in bathroom li complained the manager came up but could not fix it he then phoned us to say he had left a message with maintenance and if I wanted he would bring us extra covers that was last we heard wanted to speak to a manager in the morning but no manager there what a set up it put a downer on a fantastic day, Location close to station
155961,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room quite small and bathroom was really small and awkward to use with the size of the sink meaning you had to reeve yourself round the door , Bed and bedding was lovely
155962,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Food a little expensive , The staff were very helpful and friendly The room was lovely good size comfortable and very clean The breakfast was good Drinks at the bar good 
155963,Norfolk Towers Paddington, 1 we asked breakfast room service it was continental breakfast included though the phone they were really rude and didn t answer us properly i can understand F B is busy in the morning however it was really bad moment in the hotel 2 Lift is super slow and maximum 3 people 3 even though we do not want to clean our room they keep entering our room in the morning, The room was clean and bed was enough comfortable 
155964,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Our room is connected via a stair case and we have to carry total of 4 luggage case 20kg each all the way up Remember to request for a room that can reach directly , The hotel is nice and tidy staffs are friendly and helpful
155965,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Cooked breakfast was cooked well but all cold so had continental breakfast the next day which was really good The lift had a mind of its own, Beds were good The waiting staff were excellent especially the evening staff in the bar 
155966,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Cappuccino macchiato latte are extras and the buffet is essential Single lift extremely slow, The room is clean and pretty The area is good 
155967,Norfolk Towers Paddington, A bit cramped esp the bathroom but not as bad as I expected from the other reviews , Clean comfortable beds central location not bad breakfast Really good value 
155968,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Only complain was the elevator too small and too slow , Staff were friendly and polite Room was clean and quiet although the occasion noise from hotel guests in the corridor Bathroom very clean and modern Very convenient with many choices of cuisine in the vicinity and few minutes walk to Paddington underground and railway services 
155969,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room photos did not really represent what we had however I realise that it was a special price you pay for what you get Continental Breakfast was included so that was handy The bathroom was VERY small and the hallways were very narrow There was also a stain on the chair in the bedroom The staff were not particularly friendly however there was one or two on the day we checked out The choice of restaurants in the area was limited to one predominate style , Location handy to Paddington station so perfect for the Heathrow Express which is the only reason I chose this location Okay stay for the price we paid I would rate as a 3 star I was pleasantly surprised that you could re charge your Iphone directly into a USB plug in addition to the normal power points in the room 
155970,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Fantastic service and friendly staff Hotel is in a great location I was upgraded to a fabulous room that had been refurbished Thank you I would definitely recommend staying here 
155971,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift is too small and too slow The room is a little too small especially the bathroom , The upgrade of the hotel is lovely especially the dining room and bar The closeness of buses and the Tube is very convenient 
155972,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room and bathroom was indeed very small but did work well even though I am over 6 foot tall I can however imagine that those larger in girth might find the bathroom a tight squeeze If I m picky then the lift is small and slow and the stairs labyrinthine but at this price it is very good indeed , The design and decor was excellent fitting a quart into a pint pot The restaurant and bar are also furnished to a high standard with good honest food and reasonably priced drinks 
155973,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Think we had the smallest room on the floor and it was certainly smaller than the hotel advertises on Booking com which was very cramped even for one person The lift was out of order on two occasions requiring us to walk up to the fourth floor and generally seemed faulty , Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel for the Paddington district Nicely furnished and spotlessly clean A shame about the room size 
155974,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Attitude of staff was bad and room was uncomfortable We booked a double room and when we arrived we requested the possibility of checking inn early around 2 pm Our request was denied but a young white couple was given the room despite the fact that they arrived after us Room was freezing no heater after several requests to sort out the issues it was not solved The next morning we requested again to sort out the issue instead they wanted to give us a small room with the heater and give our room to another couple We refused the room on our way to our room we found the couple and they were complaining about the size of their room but the hotel was going to give them our room with good heating When I explain to them that the room has heater problem the lady told me that they were told that the room is big and has good heating the third day the switch the water heater finally we had some sort of comfort but we were surprised why they were not honest and fair and dealing with clients I don t think i will stay at this hotel again with the staff attitude that we had , Excellent location to access trains and shopping areas
155975,Norfolk Towers Paddington, No executive double with shower Outside the hotel is terrible for taxi drop offs , Staff wifi location restaurant room service lounge non dairy milk

155980,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The elevator doesn t go to the 5th floor so we had to use the stairs from the 4th floor Bath Towels weren t always clean, The team was very nice and helpfull
155981,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Musty smell in room Difficult to work shower bath control disappointed TV didn t work in bath Charged extra for cooked breakfast for 195 room a bit of a cheap Some staff rude especially the one in charge at breakfast , Location comfy bed
155982,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The most dangerous room I have stayed in as step from bedroom to bathroom and got knocked out in the middle of night going to toilet and wrote to hotel saying someone will be killed unless they sort, Everything ok
155983,Norfolk Towers Paddington, My first room had a busted AC so the room was sweltering BUT the front desk quickly found a new room for me that was actually an upgrade from my first room , Excellent attention to guests Very nice hotel with GREAT location to Paddington and Edgeware stations 
155984,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The LIFT way too slow too small needs to be moved Better signs needed to stairs really glad I was on first floor Replace sheets soaps lotions everyday , Everything really good new feeling good location quiet at nite Nice staff friendly Will stay again soon hopefully 
155985,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The staff was very professional but not very personal or friendly It was obvious that they did their best but you can tone down the professionalism for some more heart to the guest , The bed was super comfy The facilities were very clean and well taken care of 
155986,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Hotel room size a bit small, Very friendly and helpful staff hotel decor very nice fab power shower very comfy beds and pillows Hotel room a little on the small size Very well designed though wrt layout Location excellent for Paddington station and Heathrow Express which was why we booked this hotel Would stay here again if returning to London

155990,Norfolk Towers Paddington, THe room was clean Comfortable bed Tea coffee making facilities BUT the room was too cramped No free floor space Also on entering the room there was a stairway down into the bed space Not practical downright dangerous Bathroom very small literally no room to move I will not stay at this hotel again , Breakfast included in the price was great Continental b fast was more than adequate Cereal juices toast jam etc Staff here very pleasant Location was excellent Paddington Stn just a short walk around the corner which helped locating to sightseeing Lots of great restaurants nearby especially the Lebanese options Cost of food in these places much better value Certainly plenty of choice that u could get a different option each evening
155991,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was not working on our floor so we had to carry our bags up the last flight of stairs The lift is also quite small and a little claustrophobic We were so excited when we saw the TV in the bath but it didn t work and that took a little tiny bit of the shine of what was otherwise a lovely stay , The staff were very helpful and attentive The room was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed for a one night stay Location was perfect to be able to scoot over for an early start to Hyde Park for the Royal Parks Run Sat night we dined in the restaurant and were really impressed with both the food and service Breakfast was also scrummy 
155992,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift only worked up to the fourth floor It would have been great if they had advised us at the front desk about this issue before we hauled all our luggage up to the fifth floor so we could have opted to leave what we don t need for them to store it a simple breakdown in communication , The hotel s close proximity to Paddington station was the basis for our choice to stay at this hotel along with the lift We requested a quiet room and it was very spacious compared to what you ll usually get in London with comfortable beds and well made headboards desk with an array or assortment of plugs for electronic devices There s a working television with a choice of good networks at no extra cost as well as closet that can easily accommodate four wheeled carry on luggage The bathroom was a dream all fixtures made of stainless steel good sized tub sink and toilet with tv Towels and sheets were very clean We always bring our own set of toiletries so I can t comment on what was provided but the hand soap was good and made in Italy not China The room had a hint of fresh clean scent Wi fi a bonus A very welcoming accommodation 
155993,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the very small room although an exective room manged to change for second night to a better exective room seems most rooms are very small, well present rooms very modern and clean staff very good helped us get a better room
155994,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The furniture become old and not cleaned The elevator always not working since two years now they don t solve this problem Water leakage in the bathroom, The location and the staff
155995,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room on the 5th floor and the lift not going to the 5th Got to the room with our luggage and the key would not work so a long trip back to reception , Inclusive breakfast was very poor 
155996,Norfolk Towers Paddington, ROOM Extremely small 5m2 overall very uncomfortable bed It is not what you see on the advertised photos Absolutely horrible BREAKFAST I had the WORST BREAKFAST experience staying at a hotel An Asian origin lady apparently The Boss is running her dictatorship at the restaurant First thing you hear when you walk down to the restaurant for breakfast is what you cannot eat Waitresses are super stressed there s an obvious tension on the floor nobody smiles You can t even sit where you want in the restaurant Felt like North Korea WIFI Terrible It takes you few mins to connect then it hardly loads anything Had to use personal mobile data OVERALL I felt ripped off DEFINITELY NOT VALUE for Money Avoid staying at Norfolk , Location only 
155997,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Our room was on the fifth flour and the lift wasn t working , I stayed at this hotel 3 times but out of tree timed twice went the alarm bell This time was 7am We didn t know what wad wrong It wasn t so convenient and no apologies In this instance we would like to know the information as soon as possible of
155998,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms were too small and breakfast very poor You have to pay extra 5 pounds to eat common egg One very old lift that does not even go to all floors The property should not be rated , Nothing
155999,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Cleanliness clearly nobody in this hotel have heard about dusting Room size not even close to the picture while booking I know it s London BUT we had a twin room and it was literally impossible to separate the beds because there were no space to move them the wall was completely packed with cupboards Bathroom size if you d like to open the door while inside the bathroom you will have to move as much as possible behind the toilet just to get enough space for door opening and getting out of there ok I may exaggerate a bit but for a bigger person I bet you you ll find it uncomfortable Short beds since I m not tall it didn t bother me but in case you re 180 cm or taller pay attention to the length of the bed while booking Elevator didn t work several times on our stay and the guy from the staff was supposed to carry the luggage to our room but he noticed us that he will be able to do this only in a half an hour and of course it wasn t meeting our need of getting it now so I had to carry it myself I feel like I can do anything now thank you Early check in the price of early check in was ridiculous Breakfast comedy club it was incredibly fun and also kind of sad to watch how the breakfast reception lady was guarding the English breakfast buffet you could have purchased them for additional 5 ponds or so if you wanted to if not you weren t allowed even near it Continental breakfast didn t propose any salad so I felt really bad when I was forced to steal the salad garnishes from the ham plates sorry I just had no other choice , Location Staff great suggestions for sightseeing and activities Bathtub Newly renovated hotel and rooms Comfy but short beds
156000,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I was majorly disappointed with this hotel I arrived and found my room to be really dirty There were stains on the carpet which you can accept in a hotel but what you can t accept is finding two hairs and a pubic hair in the bed and having a throw at the end of the bed which is COVERED in stains I felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the hotel after this The next morning I stepped into the shower and within 20 seconds it was overflowing water going all over the bathroom floor I had to turn off the shower and was unable to properly shower When I mentioned it to reception they said I had to left the drain up on the floor before I shower to allow the water to pass through I ve never stayed in a hotel in my life where I ve had to fiddle about on the shower floor lifting drains up before I shower and if this is the case provide me with instructions in the bathroom so I know to do this When I told reception I was unhappy with my room and it was unclean they said sorry No offer to reimburse me in any form Sorry doesn t really cut it , What did I like Nothing The mattress was too soft The room was small The bathroom wasn t overly clean The room has a smell of must damp 
156001,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Clearly the room was directly below the dining area and woken up early as tables and chairs were being moved No soundproofing between floor and ceiling obviously, size of the room and room facilities Pleasant staff
156002,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was extremely small possibly the smallest room I have ever stayed in I expected a lot more for the money The lift is far to small and took forever to arrive , clean and tidy nice bar area 
156003,Norfolk Towers Paddington, lift was out of service very often had to stay in a very small room the first night because the hotel was fully booked lower category than booked , breakfast was good rooms were clean great location friendly staff
156004,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Do not go to this hotel I was kept awake all night by regular rasping noises like very loud snoring coming form the bathroom I complained in the morning and was told the manager was too busy to see me even though I offered to return after breakfast he clearly did not want to face me I insisted a staff member accompany me to the room where he the handyman verified the noise was still very much happening every few seconds I filled a complaint form and left it for Mr Touray the manager He has never been in touch even though I e mailed him as well I did not sleep all night and the fact that they did not even say sorry or contact me is disgraceful ,No Positive
156005,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Shower head needed descaling water did not flow well as was blocked, Compact room but well designed and high quality finish very comfy bed excellent tea and croissants 
156006,Norfolk Towers Paddington, 4 hours when our room was finally ready their only lift was broken Our room was on the 4 th floor We are seniors They took our suitcases up to the tiny room It about killed us to walk up 4 flights of very narrow stairs Waited in the room for more than an hour for the lift to be fixed Finally went back down the narrow stairs and walked to eat When we came back again the lift was still broken Could not walk up stairs again Finally after having to get angry and waiting a long time the girl called the manager and refunded our money My husband had to haul our suitcases back down the stairs A very bad experience The room was very noisy when we were in it could hear every word the room next door said , The girl in the bar was great We were waiting in the bar for room to be ready 
156007,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Moved rooms because safe didn t work room 302 then 2nd room s safe didn t work either room 106 Called reception when safe didn t work person initially went to room 203 rather than room 302 so it took a long time to check it then move rooms Rooms could be cleaner cleaners obviously didn t move furniture to clean so dirty around edges of carpets inside cupboards by mini fridge safes Elevator didn t work on my floor I had just had surgery no porter so had to carry my own bags to 2nd room on different floor Fire alarm went off accidentally 3 times during my stay It was after my surgery so not pleased I had to get out of bed to check what was happening Room service didn t always answer phone even after several calls The first night room service brought my food but forgot my water Double charged on credit card charged on arrival 18 Sep and departure 20 Sep I have contacted credit card company to dispute charges ,No Positive

156009,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room very small Pillows very soft Lift most of the time out of service Not value for money considering small room and limited continental breakfast, Location is excellent Room and hotel very clean Staff very helpful and took steps to change our room Good furniture and refurbishment
156010,Norfolk Towers Paddington, extremely slow elevator even in a 6 story building had to take the stairs every time the hotel should think about putting a faster elevator , great location 5 mins walk from Paddington very clean good breakfast good friendly staff always helpful great value for money i would recommend this place 
156011,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We had three large bags our Room was at 1 floor nobody from staff offered us help with bags Bell boy was standing and looking at us while we struglled to carry bags over the steps After we entered the room lady from reception started hysterically knocking on our door yelling that smoking is prohibited and that we need to stop smoking in the Room When I ve opened the Room she saw that nobody is smoking and she started to sniff after she told us it was mistake and she left Without Aplogize or anything We Were there for 4 days and we felt completely invisible for staff , Location was perfect close to Paddington tube station we had suite for three people and the room was spacious
156012,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very small room ridiculously small elevator max 3 persons for the complete hotel which needed to be used by guests as well as staff so long waits in front of the elevator we took the stairs to come down 2nd floor so OK , the staff was very kind and most of them were cheerful as well Very nice cuisine and cocktails Good welcome and help 
156013,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room they gave us for the first night was really small for the two us It was room 502 but they did eventually move us to a bigger room the next day at no extra charge The breakfast however could have been better , The rooms were very clean and tidy and the staff were really kind and welcoming

156016,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Couldn t find anything negative about this hotel, Extremely friendly and helpful staff Very comfortable room and a decent size for a London hotel Breakfast was also very good Nice bar to have a relaxing drink at the end of the day 
156017,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The man, Everything was ok except the man that helped with the suitcases passed too many comments on 3 occasions like I had too much lauguage didn t think it was his business 
156018,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Very good location and value for money too The staff were very friendly and helpful The restaurant is very good Room was a bit small but very clean and comfortable 
156019,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was like being in a sardine can it was so tiny you could barely turn around in it There was not enough room for our luggage The elevator was extremely small also it only holds three people and there is only one elevator in the building , The location was great Modern facilities Breakfast selection was very good 
156020,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was tiny I am petite and was travelling alone so okay but for a bigger person or a couple it would have been a struggle to cohabitate in that room or get into the bathroom for that matter Walls a bit thin as I could hear my neighbours talking , Proximity to Paddington Station excellent
156021,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was not available at 15 00 and I have to wait for one hour to get it ready The continental breakfast was very standard and they have full English breakfast but with extra cost , The location is close to Paddington station 
156022,Norfolk Towers Paddington, small room the internet get disconnected each time when I leave the hotel poor breakfast no one helps with the luggage water sound in the room, nothing
156023,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The single small elevator used for services as well as hotel customers stopprd working and has not been readily fixed in the two days of our stay That made our stay a very negative experience ,No Positive
156024,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom very small I am not a small lady and found it difficult to dry after a shower because of space Paid extra for cooked breakfast first day but it was cold very cold so second day had the included continental , The bed was Huge and extremely comfortable Powerful shower 
156025,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bed was too short and the bathroom was for trolls Not enough space The last day the lift was not working The lift was too Small , The breakfast service was great met my needs I like room service cery clean everything in order each day Nad was comfortable but short 
156026,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Continental breakfast was included and very good We were upgraded to a suite which was nice even though it was located in the lower level Very close to Paddington station for ease of travel to Heathrow
156027,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I was given Rm1 05 This room is awful It was a portico on the first floor so it juts out over the street and is all glass windows across one wall That would have been great if it was sound proofed and the huge curtains were organized to open and allow the windows to open to let in some fresh air However this was not the case and the room felt uncomfortably small due to the extra large bed and the 1 foot around the edges The bathroom was a crazy little caged space off to the side If you cannot stand noise or having the street lights beaming directly into your room this is not the room for you From the d cor I assume the other rooms must be appointed quite well so maybe one of these might be great But I felt I was in the worst room on the property And being an international traveler from the southern hemisphere hoping for some sleep this just did not happen Staff were nice but incompetent at billing they charged me incorrectly and I had to pay 90 pence on booking out ,No Positive
156028,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing can t fault it , Everything I ve been staying here over several years and it gets better every time The executive room was perfect aircon very efficient and loved the new ground floor restaurant for breakfast and dinner the latter highly unusual for a London hotel 
156029,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Lovely and modern but still very comfortable and welcoming All the staff where really nice and helpful Great location All in all an excellent place to stay
156030,Norfolk Towers Paddington, room was too small with stairs going down into it from the landing Loud noises from the ceiling during the night The lift didn t work so I had to carry everything down the stairs The air conditioning didn t work properly and leaked in to my open suitcase , the location was good breakfast was provided though fairly poor 
156031,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room and bathroom are very well designed but there isn t a spare inch anywhere You have to hold your tummy to get through the door of the bathroom literally The Paddington area while very central and convenient for travel is not the best especially not at night , Clean modern room with very comfortable beds Friendly staff and very nice continental breakfast included in the price Very near Paddington station 
156032,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, The basic room without extra luxuries was about the most luxurious hotel room I ve stayed in London The staff was very professional The other customers were quiet and though the hotel was next to a hospital it was very nice and quiet there I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London 
156033,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Tiny tiny twin room the photo looked better For the price a full English breakfast would have been warranted The only elevator didn t work the first two days staff said it often breaks down , Good Continental breakfast Close to Paddington station Can leave luggage there on check out for the rest of the day
156034,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was great , Tha staff is great especially Assam the conseiur at the desk He was exceptionally pleasant and helpful The experience was mesmerizing 
156035,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I wondered if the cook used MSG I ate there twice and got indigestion Local restaurants were okay Room was nice adequate but small , Very helpful and courteous staff Computer for guests helpful too Very near by Paddington Station 
156036,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Having to pay 4 99 extra for the cooked breakfast seemed odd not that I did pay the extra , Location I had an early morning flight from Heathrow and wanted to be near Paddington station My room was also very decent better than I was expecting though for some reason I got a suite 
156037,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Wasn t a lot on off for breakfast we paid around 5 00 extra each to have English breakfast I was disappointed with this as it was very cold however the sausages were nice, The room was lovely not much room to move around but the bed was very comfortable The friends who stayed at the same time had a corner room this was far more spacious as to be expected 
156038,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bad serviced asked 4 times for additional blanket and shampoo for 2 days noisy rooms near the road you can here every car inside the room noisy water pipes from other rooms wake you at nights The stuff is friendly and tries to be helpful but we had very poor sleep and payed relevantly more than other claimed 4 star hotels we travel allot never had such disappointment , Good location friendly stuff but poor service and noisy rooms not worse the price of a claimed 4 star hotel 
156039,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room which we stayed in was small for the price we have paid Maybe smaller then the popular small ness of the club med ski hotel rooms Wow Be ready for next generation of space saving techniques It might be wiser to get larger rooms or other hotel if this might be a problem We Two brothers didn t have any problem with the space provided The elevator didn t work for 2 days which we didn t use anyway The window couldn t be opened fully Note that the breakfast included is continental coffee toasts and other light things and there is option to purchase the British breakfast for extra cost , Location is great close hyde park paddington station and restaurants Staff members where great and the overall environment is friendly and welcome 
156040,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, A great location walking distance from the Heathrow Express making it easy to get to and from the airport and city There was plenty of fresh fruit warm croissants juice toast coffee tea and cereal at the continental breakfast The room was very clean and the staff very helpful and attentive 
156041,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Reception staff need to make eye contact and smile Public areas need carpets vaccum more often Small but important points for a proper and otherwise very good hotel , Modern bright everything worked Air con in room was powerful and tv in bathroom good and quirky 
156042,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was quite bijou but perfectly adequate for one person or a short stay, You can have breakfast delivered to your room for free The room was clean and well presented 
156043,Norfolk Towers Paddington, This hotel was quite a joke The room was ridiculously tiny I had to actually climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room the elevator was so slow and could only hold 3ppl at a time As if that wasn t annoying enough two days in the elevator broke and we had to walk up and down 4 flights of stairs I actually had a sprained ankle so this was a major problem The elevator was still out of service when we left three days later I found staff quite rude and condensing not just to me but to other guests particularly front reception the hairdryer actually set of the fire alarm one morning just from the stream in the room which brings me to my next point there was no ventilation in the room at all House keeping kept closing out tiny window every day too which didn t help the situation house keeping took my bottle of water and when I phoned reception to inform them of this they were rude and said there was nothing they could do until they spoke to staff the next morning to ask them if this was true I had to take medication and the tap water was not drinkable not sure why as Iv had tap water else where in London and it s been fine but this water was disgusting and tasted like sugar breakfast was basic bare minimum of toast croissant cereal no cornflakes and juice Honestly the service was terrible and no where near a 4 star , very clean and beautiful looking hotel location was quite central and close to tube
156044,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the wi fi was terrible and this was further compounded by the fact that the 3 4G signal is also poor in the area, Its a lot better than most of the other hotels in the area it looks smart its modern has good food and drinks and the staff are friendly and helpul
156045,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Great location 5 min walk from Paddington meaning easy access to anywhere in London and lots of ammnities close by Good value for a central city London hotel 
156046,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the lift was tiny and very slow could not work out how the AC worked so spent an uncomfortable night as it was very hot, the beds were really comfortable good the shower worked really well the towels were soft and large the restaurant was very good food very good so were the staff
156047,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast long wait for poached egg had to ask twice Told we could have Lactose free milk was served with hot Soya milk this could have made me ill the milk was hot and it was for tea ,No Positive
156048,Norfolk Towers Paddington, However when we got in the suite the room itself was lovely clean and spacious but the bathroom had a foul human excrement smell When we first arrived we didn t notice it to much as we were in and out It wasn t until we returned on the night 1am plus the smell has crept into the bedroom and it stunk As it was a lower ground room I can only assume all 6 floors above waste was travelling through our bathroom waste pipe We told the staff in the morning and they didn t seem to bothered well put this way not as bothered as swiping my card for payment The smell was horrendous , The room was fine and we got upgraded to a suite upon arrival Clean and modern
156049,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Little space No shoe cleaning or sewing kits nor umbrellas provided but they on a business trip that is neccessary Okay breakfast , Easy accessable from Paddington Station Cute rooms with nice decor Check in was possible one hour earlier 
156050,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Dust build up in room air conditioning ducts and on top of shower head Lift out of action for up to 1 day , Efficient check in Restaurant service good Good choices at buffet breakfast 
156051,Norfolk Towers Paddington, 1 I am 170 cm tall but the bed was short for me 2 On the fifth floor the water pipes make a very noticeable sound at night 3 The toilet Sprayer seems not to be tested before , 1 The location 2 Very friendly staff 3 Good WiFi 
156052,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Good sized room for London excellent continental breakfast in pleasant restaurant luggage room to hold bags Easy walking distance with luggage to Paddington Station restaurants and Little Venice for boat trip 
156053,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift broke Not great with a damaged hip Would not have been a problem otherwise but it was an inconvenience , Staff were great very helpful Hurt my hip while there and plenty of ice supplied Location is very close to Paddington so travel was easy with good access to the rest of London 
156054,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room size was a bit small though it was a club twin room The single lift was very small for 3 persons only no more space for luggage It was unfortunate that I stayed 3 days with 2 days lift out of order , The location is specially good as it is very very convenient to Paddington railway and underground Many cafes are easily reached nearby 
156055,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Perhaps bottles of water could be offered in addition to tea and coffee in the room , Very clean and modern excellent location just a couple of minutes walk from tube station Excellent breakfast Fridge in room was useful 
156056,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing to moan about Superb hotel brilliant staff and a brilliant location , Superb hotel staff couldn t be more helpful with an amazingly clean and well decorated room Will be staying again 
156057,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Rooms are VERY small staff in the reservations are evils although front desk guys are nice I have not seen good cooperation from the hotel every thing for them is money only so be careful , The location little bit
156058,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We were upgraded to a basement room Unfortunately with very little natural light it wasn t very comfortable For a place that indicates Norfolk towers I didn t expect to be below street level, Hotel was clean and well appointed 
156059,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room wasn t ready upon arrival within the arranged time frame This ended up with a 45 minute wait at the reception area No staff attended to inform or reassure guests re ongoing situation of fire alarm sounding intermittently in the early hours These were false alarms which I discovered on phoning Reception The first alarm caused my daughter who was woken up from a deep sleep considerable distress Neither did anyone enquire about our experience or mention it in any way the following day I was expecting to have a chance to bring it up on check out because it had led to a severely disturbed night but I wasn t asked how the stay had been Too few staff at breakfast which made it a somewhat chaotic atmosphere Being on the 4th floor and nursing an injured leg I had to unfortunately depend on the lift It was functional but very small with very occasional queues to use it , Very clean modern and comfortable public areas and room Good quality breakfast The continental option was more than sufficient Hardly any traffic or street noise in the room Excellent air con 
156060,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The beds were shorter than two meters Room 415 was very small we were offered to change the following day but decided to stay The room of our two boys was better in size , Beatiful and newly decorated Very professional and helpful staff Perfectly located for Heathrow London and close to Hyde Park for the morning run All in all very good value 
156061,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Way too expensive for what it was It was very tiny no room to even move in the hotel it was really disappointing The bed was uncomfortable and the room was kind of dirty Wasn t horrible but it wasn t worth what it costs , The staff was really nice and there s a metro train stop right down the street 
156062,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Nothing, Everything Amazing its my second time of experience in this hotel and am very satisfied espicially the Friendly Staff as Malika and Victor even other staff member i did t remeber thier names Great Thanx to all
156063,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I did not like the fact that for 3 days Friday Saturday and Sunday the lift was out of service and waited until Monday to fix it Even I helped some new arrivals to the hotel with their suite cases up the stairs because they were ladies and others old people I did not like the extra charge the hotel demanded even being little because the room price they charge should include the extra food they charge for it In conclusion I will never go back to this hotel even if they charge me half of the price I paid last time , The stuff are nice people specially at the restaurant and the bar The reception stuff are nice but their English is poor somehow I think the price they charge should be lower even though it is close to central London because a much better quality hotel in a better position and better quality services and food charge close to this hotel charges I will never
156064,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room size was too small using the writing table was not possible it i s just part of the room picture only The noises from other rooms playing in the bed was so clear and toilet flushing and bathing as well The only lift was not enough to the hotel guests You could have manage some sound proof between the rooms My room was having steps down from the door to the bed which cause difficulty moving my bags in and out, The bed is nice and comfort Reception staff where so nice and helpful Location is very good

156081,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Very nice hotel Modern design and fantastic location Staff was not very courteous and wasn t very helpful They wanted us to settle our 1st night payment at check in despite a pre blockage on our credit card We didn t have enough pounds and needed to exchange euros or dollars to pay them The guy at the reception almost made us empty all our pounds Not good customer service Hotel is decently comfortable but basement rooms are difficult to get to and lift wasn t working at night

156092,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The young lady tried to give me a bigger room in the basement It seemed damp and dark and would have only worked if I was planning to have a party Since I was alone and not drunk it was not a good option I think they need to check those rooms for mold , The location and the free wifi 
156093,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Our executive double bed was two singles pushed together one bed was lovely the other was very used and dippy , The staff were lovely reception and bar 
156094,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I appreciate that London rooms are small but this place takes it to the extreme The sole lift in the place fits no more than 3 people and is extremely slow Ridiculous that if you want a cappuccino during your complimentary breakfast that you need to pay extra , Location was ok and generally clean 
156095,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathroom was a wee bit tight especially since the door opened directly to the toilet and only one person could be in there at a time Also it would be safer and easier to get in and out of the bathtub if the space between the tub and the wall was another foot wider esp for older people who need some assistance in climbing in and out of the tub , The complimentary continental breakfast was fine 
156096,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small bathroom Had to keep to a corner to close open door , Responsive staff Prompt response Everything in the room worked Good location Near the tube national rail cafes and supermarket

156106,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Don t go to this hotel The overall impression was that the hotel was more interested in taking your money than taking care of you We had a suite but it was located in the basement No view outside and a very odd smell in the room You couldn t sit on the bar and watch football euro2016 unless you ordered something even if you were a hotel guest The male bartender threw a man out for that reason even though the bar was practically empty Never seen that happening in any other hotel The bar closed early English breakfast was for extra cost and for this price it should be included Didn t see too many people eating it , The hotel was clean new and there was a good tv in the bar Tv in the bathroom 
156107,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathroom was a little on the small side but it wasn t a bother at all just nit picking now , used this hotel on two occasions good quiet location 5 minute walk from piccadily station We have found the hotel very clean the rooms a bit on the small side but for the short time we stayed it was ideal Very comfy bed lovely shower The breakfast was good plenty of choice of cereals fresh fruit meats etc Would not hesitate to stay here again

156109,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When I booked the room I was under the impression that breakfast was included When I had breakfast however I was charged extra for the eggs meats and mushrooms It seemed petty and stingy that only certain foods were free and yet other more healthy and filling options were sitting out and available but for a price If you re going to play that game it might be better to include some hard boiled eggs on the continental side Better yet if you re going to charge for anything it should be made to order , The rooms were comfortable and well done The front desk staff were mostly friendly and helpful 
156110,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Boring breakfast and when I were checking out they charched me for expensive calls I never made and when I came home I saw they charched me for things I don t know what they are, In The beginning the staff were nice Nice location

156117,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The hairdryer was not working and they had no replacement so that was a little disappointing But at least I tested it the night before and not after I had washed my hair the next morning I would not have been please to leave in the morning with wet hair , Croissants were delicious Dad paid 5 extra for English Breakfast and enjoyed that too 
156118,Norfolk Towers Paddington, English breakfast costs 4 95 extra whereas in most hotels the breakfast buffet is all inclusive no matter what you are having to eat , Good location and very nice room only downside was we were on the lower ground floor with a view of a brick wall and nothing else 
156119,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room 101 is next to a fire door which bangs when it closes It is used by staff to come too and fro It needs a muffler of some sort The bathroom is incredibly small and if I had been the designer I would have opted for a free standing shower rather than a bath Impossible for two people to be in the bathroom at the same time Also a room for two people but only one chair , Proper bath towels that you could wrap yourself up in Attractive d cor Helpful staff
156120,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Walls not very sound proof Flight of downward stairs as you open the room door with no warning sign Have to cart luggage back up stairs Room is small as is typical in London , Quiet street handy to Paddington station Good bathroom with bath Helpful staff Very nice continental breakfast buffet No need to pay extra for English breakfast 
156121,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The WIFI was week, Whenever I visit London the one and only hotel is Norfolk Tower The location is perfect the beds are comfortable and the staff are friendly esp Victor who did his best to make sure that everyone is satisfied 
156122,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Two different breakfast continental and british for british you have to pay The room a little too small but ok you will not go to London to spend holidays in the room , Location of the hotel is very good close to Hyde park paddington subway and train station

156128,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Pathetic service Waited for hours to get a glass of drinking water in the reception area Very inflexible around check in times Limited repetitive and boring breakfast spread, The location is great being close to Paddington and Edgeware Road
156129,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I have already sent an email regarding the last 2 nights stay that spoiled our overall experience still not heard anything back but not surprised I will continue until I hear something back , Comfortable beds TV in the bathroom Excellent decor 
156130,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I didnt like you had to pay extra for fried breakfast as was not worth the extra Breakfast should be all in with no hidden extras , I liked that it was very cleaan an greaat location

156133,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I had the single club room which was so small that I struggled to get my bag inside The room is so small but with a reasonable bathroom size At that day there was a party downstairs and I could hear everything , The location the room had everything Tv fridge and safe box with a nice bathroom 
156134,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The breakfast service wasn t good especially the Asian women I think she is a leader she doesn t serve as pleasant though she is polite When I get in the area for breakfast there isn t anyone standby at reception so I walk direct in And she came after mine and shout loudly good morning miss in order to make me turn around and look insight with her to make communication with me I don t think it s a good way to make a conversations with your client it s really rude and Irrespect , The service for leave luggage in the lobby after check out which is so convenient and the front desk staff was also nice 
156135,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When I walked in I had no makeup on and the room wasn t ready for 3 which is check in time 5 staff were at the reception and stared as I walked over none made themselves look welcome and they looked me up and down They didn t offer any drinks or show us to the bar they just sat us down in the lobby and ignored us However when I checked out the next day the same woman couldn t have been more friendly This time I had my makeup on I wouldn t recommend staying here unless you were looking for a tiny room to stay one night in Anything more would be a nightmare to stay in the box rooms , The food was good but they forgot to bring the drinks with room service so we had to phone down and remind them
156136,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was too small there was poor service and they make you pay extra for an English breakfast even though that was included in the offer terrible hotel ,No Positive
156137,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Restaurant closed after 10pm I arrived after a delayed journey at 2am having had no meals in lunch due to the journey While I was assured there would be someone at reception to meet they failed to mention there was no food hot cold not biscuits available for guests who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in this situation There was no clear idea of where to find anything restaurants Eventually managed to find a some to deliver food to the hotel , The best thing about this hotel aside from the location was the concierge service It was beyond excellent 
156138,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast is dodgy You have to pay ten pounds for the English breakfast which is not clearly informed by the receptionist or stated in booking confirmation It s a little surprise the poker faced breakfast receptionist handed you a bill to sign without saying anything , Nice location
156139,Norfolk Towers Paddington, 1 The WiFi was terrible Mesaured on two devices at aprox 0 25Mbps download Told the front desk Nothing improved 2 Included Breakfast was ok However eggs and undercooked bacon costs an extra 4 95 pounds Desperate to nickel and dime 3 CHEAP policies On the day we were scheduled to arrive by Eurostar from Paris to London while we were waiting in line there was a bomb scare due to someone taking two mortars on board After waiting for hours our train to London was cancelled We notified the hotel and booking com and at 11pm had to book a night in Paris We arrived the next afternoon to stay at this hotel They new of the extenuating issue but still opted to charge us for the night we were stuck in Paris due to a terrorist situation Booking com also contacted this hotel asking them to waive the no show but they declined How very understanding of their management and owners , The room and bathroom were recently remodeled and very nice Close to Paddington Station 
156140,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bed was super soft and comfy for the Mrs but I prefer it firm so I really can t complain once the Mrs is happy, The hotel was clean the breakfast was excellent the staff polite Very creative use of space and good taste in architecture design and furniture Excellent lighting in the room hallway bar and dinning The bathroom was small but stunning Overall I ll rate the cleanliness of the room and hotel as 10 10 yes 10 10 
156141,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I honestly can t think of anything that would have improved our stay , Very clean rooms great facilities we were able to use the printer to print out attraction tickets and leave our bags there after checking out whilst we toured london with no problems and all at a great price I would recommend this hotel to friends and family 
156142,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very disappointed with sirloin steak but made up for it with chocolate cylinder for dessert which was to die for , The staff were very helpful and friendly Reception bar and restaurant area was spacious light and airy with a good contemporary design Twin room and bathroom very clean Lovely fluffy towels and good shower Plenty of choice for Continental breakfast The whole experience was very pleasant 
156143,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was a little cramped and second night we had cushions on the bed first night we didn t and tv remote didn t work all little things really as wernt in the room that much, Bed was by far the best night sleep ive had away quiet and nearby everything
156144,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was directly below reception and you could hear people walking above you here the tube below you , TV in Shower was a nice surprise and the room was spacious and modern
156145,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, The whole ambiance was good and the staff could not have been more helpful The room was airy and very clean The full breakfast was great There was a great selection and it was served hot and fresh 
156146,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bed was a bit lumpy and we had to put a pillow underneath as the bottom was divided Also the breakfast staff seemed a bit stressed and busy and could have come across a bit friendlier , The shower was really good and room well done The continental breakfast was plenty good enough for a stand alone breakfast 
156147,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Foremost its excellent location that is near Paddington Station easy to get to Heathrow and anywhere else using the tube The hotel is also very near convenience shops restaurants and fast food outlets It is also newly refurbished with nice clean rooms amenities Staff is also great and very courteous 
156148,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Massively over priced Poor value for money even the suite was very small Terms of the booking were also misleading it said breakfast included but when it came to it only the toast was free the cooked breakfast was extra , Reception staff were pleasant and efficient
156149,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Had to carry heavy suit case up 4 flights as lift did not stop at ground floor Smallest hotel room ever however they did move me promptly Carpets smelled like they had been cleaned with sour milk Someone s napkin was left at the side of the bed even though the room had been cleaned Room was not cleaned until late afternoon , Good location staff helpful Breakfast was very nice
156150,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Stayed at hotel for London marathon hotel had made no arrangements for early breakfast despite asking Room was ridiculously small and the bathroom required you to manoeuvre around the door to get in out of bath shower I m very petite someone of a bigger build would really struggle ,No Positive
156151,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Only the continental breakfast was included There was an additional charge if you wanted to have some of the full English hot food i think the full English should also be included considering the relatively high room price ,No Positive
156152,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was out of order We had to climb 5 flights with a handicapped person But they moved us Monday morning to the 1st floor We left Tuesday morning The restaurant managers was a bit frosty But overall it was a good trip The restaurant staff had limited English But were smart and very pleasant , Food was lovely Beds were very comfy Very clean Waitress s were lovely plus bar staff and manager
156153,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was temporarily out of order The bathroom was a bit too small to close the door comfortably Would like at least one fold up case wrack There are often two people in a twin room and they usually have two cases to open and access , The Norfolk Towers Hotel was extremely comfortable lovely decor great happy hour and excellent dining in 
156154,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Elevator was out the entire time of my visit and getting to the 5th floor 2 3 times per day was a problem , great location near transport restaurants parks Room furnishings and bathroom were great 
156155,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was small for the price that was paid Was told breakfast was full English and that it was included in the price paid Bathroom was very small and not much room to move around in Location to London wasn t very good as was at least 45min walk to Oxford Street If booking I would recommend not booking with breakfast included as there is a pub just up from the hotel that does full English for the same price as hotel plus it s extra on top of what you already pay for the hotel itself , Bed was comfy although it was 2 singles pushed together Staff were very helpful on arrival 
156156,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Considering it was an executive room it was small even by London standards Weird layout in the hotel meant wait for ages for the one lift or go past the kitchen to the stairs Walked in to the room to be faced by another flight of stairs to the bed Thin room low ceiling aircon didn t work so it was hot and a surprisingly small TV Other rooms may be better but avoid 112 Usual East European and middle eastern staff were polite and helpful and the continental breakfast was OK Good croissants , Recently renovated in attractive modern style Big comfortable bed and very clean although the carpet is already getting shabby Decent enough location near Paddington station 
156157,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Friendlier staff on reception Room classified as a suite was so small that when sofa bed was opened out you could not sit at the dressing table really only suitable as a twin or double room , Great location good restaurant food and friendly staff in bar and restaurant and helpful concierge called victor 
156158,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Too much noise from generators and couldn t sleep Lift to upper floors so small and can only carry a few people at a time , room very comfortable and clean check in was swift and professional 
156159,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It stated breakfast included Although it was what wasn t mentioned until arriving for breakfast that if you wanted full English breakfast a additional 4 95 pp charge was added, Cleanliness
156160,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was tiny and there were no storage for clothes part from a couple of hangers for jackets which causes a problem especially if you are in town for work and leisure We couldn t even fit two suitcases in the room Had to put them closed standing up with the clothes in them by the door , Good location very close to the tube as well as Hyde Park if you fancy a morning run 
156161,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The breakfast staff did not clearly inform that the English breakfast cost an additional 5 The hostess mumbled something unintelligible about English breakfast to some of the guests but there were no additional information about the extra fee for taking a sliver of bacon The breakfast was also noticeably less varied on the Saturday compared to the Friday Less fresh fruit and no Nutella on the weekend , Comfortable beds fresh and clean 
156162,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the breakfast has no varietie they didnt mention that there is another menu with extra charge there is no hot water in the morning they are being late in cleaning the room there is one housekeeper with bad smell which made the room stinks , the location is amazing the room is comfort however a little bit small 
156163,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room wasn t really a room more like a cupboard The door couldn t open properly because the furniture a bed a chair and a desk that had been crammed into the cupboard in a desperate attempt to make it pass as a room took up the entire floor space There was no space for me to put down my bag other than on the chair and that left nowhere for me to sit or stand other than on the bed I felt quite literally like I was a child hiding in a store room meanwhile the hotel staff told me there was no way to change rooms Having already paid for my two night stay I felt compelled to make the most out of it but I should have just left I slept reasonably well but slipped into depression the claustrophobia anxiety that I didn t have adequate accommodation when I was supposed to be enjoying myself in town and lack of self worth to be accepting a cupboard as my dwelling added up to an oppressive wall of negative feelings surely only ordinarily experienced by the homeless I bit the bullet and paid for a second hotel after the first night I simply left and never went back My advice to others is to pay a few extra pounds at a hotel where you actually get a room instead of being crammed into a storage space like a pile of unwanted linen , Nothing the negatives outweighed any positives and I m left feeling scarred by the experience of visiting the hotel
156164,Norfolk Towers Paddington, As a regular hotel user or guest I would strongly suggest you avoid booking this hotel unless you are confident everything will run smoothly which as we all know it s not always the case and things do go wrong sometimes The staff are simply rude and disengaged regarding any issues You have been warned , The hotel is located centrally to London making it easy to travel 
156165,Norfolk Towers Paddington, the tiny rooms weren t ideal luckily we are on the slim side but space was tight The renovations caused us a few inconveniences , Ideal location and good value for money The customer service is excellent and exceeded my expectations Great smiling and helpful staff 
156166,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Smelly bathroom when I told them about it they gave me air freshner there was no accountability after paying 135 a night for the room Again they served me ice cold chicken pieces as a starter only with an apology Rooms very small bathroom very tiny can t swing in it ,No Positive
156167,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Tea coffee supplies a little restricted and no biscuits Although this does seem a little nitpicking , Location to paddington excellent Quiet area no nighttime noise Good walking distance to Hyde park Harrods and Oxford street Very comfy beds Lovely breakfast
156168,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The size of the room was actually very small no space for my lugagge small bag The bed occupied 95 of the living space no cupboard to put the cloth The ventilation in the bathroom was so noisy that was impossible to sleep The room was situated on the service stairs above the kitchen so you can hear all noise from there Horrible experience , The location was great 
156169,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Little to No hot water during daytime in bathroom and very noisy Doors slamming can be heard especially the fire doors and bathroom doors, Location was good and hotel comfortable
156170,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was small Yes it has all the facilities but to get in and out of the bathroom was a challenge Luckily neither myself or husband are big people , The staff Very welcome helpful and friendly 
156171,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was too small double bed took up most of the space Very little room to move around , Location was close to Paddington underground station and other public transportation Staff was very helpful Room and other facilities were clean and up to date 
156172,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The fact that it does have one small elevator is little disappointing , I liked the location of the the hotel the breakfast was fresh and great the showers perfect the staff are the best always smiling would help in anything I asked for early pickup to heathrow airport by 5 am and all was done 
156173,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There was actually a s mark in the toilet bowl when we arrived Reception staff not too friendly , Very close to Paddington and Heatrow Express Nice looking hotel comfy bed 
156174,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was great The staff were very friendly The concierge was extremely helpful The location room and d cor were also outstanding 
156175,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was too small for three of us We have no room to put our luggage even for two people was far to small We paid for three people s room We were charged for an extra 4 99 each for the breakfast as we ate a boilling egg and a piece of bacon as the explanation was given that they only provided the contential breakfast and we walked into the restaurant too fast they don t have time to explain that to us , The location is excellent
156176,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The TV want working, This newly refurbished hotel is well designed with high standard of fittings and facilities the continental breakfast was just right 
156177,Norfolk Towers Paddington, No hot water due to a problem with the boiler We did however get complimentary breakfast to compensate , Comfy beds clean room excellent location next to Paddington station tasty breakfast able to leave bags there all day 
156178,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms are small and they charged for the English breakfast which i thought included in the breakfast i paid for initially , Modern clean hotel with excellent location and very friendly staff
156179,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The two nights we stayed was not so smooth I have to say The slow and broken down once in a while elevation didn t help either But the most annoying thing was we didn t have hot water to take a shower the second night Well the first night we have noticed the shower water was luke warm so when I called the front office to let them know the response was they will notify the engineer To our great surprise the second night when we were ready to take a shower there is no hot water at all The answer from the front office was to wait so we waited and waited till midnight and there is still no hot water although when we got up in the morning ready to leave for the airport the hot water is back We choose the rate which includes the continental breakfast Yes they have the basic but that s about all In comparsion with most other hotels we have stayed at in Europe the rating is poor The hotel is obviousely newly renovated The bed is comfortable We even got an upgraded to a suite But the suite is only slight larger than a small room This doesn t look like a four star hotel to me I would definitely try to book another hotel if I will visit London again For the money we pay this won t be the best choice , The location is near the Paddington Station so it s convenient 
156180,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lunch and Dinner meal availability within the hotel for guests During my stay you could order meals to eat in your rooms only With confined room space this is not ideal The option to eat in the main bar lounge area would be much more guest friendly , Close to transport links Breakfast buffet was lovely with plenty of choice Staff were all welcoming and helpful 
156181,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Small rooms and probably the slowest lift in London On breakfast warm dishes English breakfast were only available at an extra fee of 5 , Clean and nice hotel with friendly service Has been refurbished recently Good location by a quiet street close to Paddington station Heathrow express and both Central and Bakerloo underground lines 
156182,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Tiny room too many steps to carrying luggage up and down Down handicap friendly mean anything Who designed the bathroom Why leave a large unusable spot by the tub wasted space , The location and the bar
156183,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathroom was extremely small one could hardly move in it As my partner commented it would create a lot more space if the door could be hung the other way so it opened into the room instead of into the bathroom The water at 8 45 a m was cold The small cartons of milk for tea were off , The staff were extremely polite and went out of their way to help us We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in and we were able to leave our luggage also after checking out we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel until our train left at 7 30 p m in the evening a definite bonus We had lunch at the hotel which was very nice and once again the staff were extremely polite and helpful The room was very compact which we expected it was very clean plenty of hot water The bath oils and creams smelled beautiful and were of good quality The bonus for us was that the room was not overlooked and the sash window actually opened slightly at the bottom so we were able to have some fresh air in the room 
156184,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Allocated Room 207 on check in and the room stunk of sewage and drains We contacted reception and were immediately moved onto the 5 th Floor In this room you had to move the toilet roll holder to lift the toilet seat and the shower flooded the tiny bathroom area We had to lift the cover off the shower drain to get the water to soak away , All staff were very friendly and efficient Hotel is in a suberb location within minutes of Paddington Station and shops bars restaurants and cafes 
156185,Norfolk Towers Paddington,No Negative, Well located to the main attractions in central London and the flexibility to reach the hotel by public transport at different hours of the day were important to me my room was really clean and the staff were more than helpful throughout my stay would definitely recommend Norfolk Towers Paddington to anyone staying for a short break in London it would certainly be my first option during my next visit
156186,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The executive room we booked was near to a generated of some sort room 211 I think Which was a little noisey But the staff were amazing sorted it straight away and moved us to a different room even upgraded us to a suite Nothing was too much trouble , It s the second time my daughter and I have stayed here The staff are very friendly and helpful It s lovely and clean and a really pleasant atmosphere Will definitely recommend to friends and will definitely stay again 
156187,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I had booked an executive double room and they gave us a room that was super tiny Even though continental breakfast was included espresso was an extra charge ,No Positive
156188,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Certain staff were rather unfriendly and miserable , The receptionist staff were very pleasant One specifically who if I recall correctly was a gentleman who put my suitcase in storage before the check in time He gave an outstanding and incredibly helpful explanation of the London public transportation system and what to see when using a map the hotel provided which I found was excellent advice 
156189,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathtub too narrow and small also extra high to step into Only 1 bar of soap had to move it to shower and back Flimsy bathroom waste basket , Liked puffiness of bed fluffy towels safe and frig in room Good breakfast 
156190,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms were quite small as expected in London , Great location Marylebone station is a short walk away and it was about a 15 min walk to Oxford Street Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was modern and clean Will definitely stay here next time I am in London 
156191,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The design and layout especially in the bathroom was very tight If either myself or the person I was travelling with had been generous in bodily proportions it might have been a bit of a struggle to get in and out of the bathroom , Overall it was excellent in most respects 
156192,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bed is really too short I m over 1 6m tall and my boyfriend is over 1 8m both of our legs have protruded the bed The room is really small which is absolutely not enough for opening luggage and walk fluently at the same time There were some noise from renovation work in the morning The price 103 is too high for aroom like this , Close to underground rail station and bus station Easy to find this hotel 
156193,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small A rude receptionist told me that I had booked a single bedded room when I had booked a double bed and would not believe me when I tried to explain to her A bad start ,No Positive
156194,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Having to pay an extra 4 95 after pre paying 7 50pp for the breakfast to have an English Breakfast It s ridiculous , The room was great probably had the best nights sleep in a while 
156195,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The bathrooms were a little awkward to get in with the toilet right behind the door but well equipped with a brilliant shower, The restaurant where we had breakfast was great the rooms were very clean and the staff were lovely Very close to Paddington and Hyde Park We booked a suite for 3 adults but when we showed up it wasn t available so we got put in 2 adjoining rooms instead which was fine 
156196,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We ere in Room 213 and could not get into the bathroom and out of the bathroom very good Very tight squeeze with the door opening into the bathroom Hopefully not all the bathrooms were the same as that would put me off staying again , Breakfast was very good good choice and cooked breakfast was cooked very well not to greasy Bed very comfortable Staff very helpful 
156197,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Very hit and miss on the rooms We were first allocated a box room I could nearly touch both sides of the room We asked to move however there were no other rooms available They did move us on the second night to a much larger room however my frustration was the lack customer service on the front desk If you get a large room the value for money is great however the smaller rooms are tiny and so you could be left disappointed with the lack of space , Great location very close to Paddington station The breakfast was also good and hotel was clean and modern 
156198,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The first twin room we had on the second floor was extremely small But we changed to 4th floor and it was ok Breakfast is only continental there is a 5GBP surcharge for eggs and bacon and sausage , Location is great very near the station and bus stops with many restaurants around It was calm and clean 
156199,Norfolk Towers Paddington, In terms of location it was a little further out than we would normally stay but in the grand scheme of things this didn t really make too much difference the hotel is really close to Paddington Tube make sure to come out of the Praed St exit and it s literally a minute walk and this falls on a number of underground lines making it very easy to access all the sights and shopping My only issue was the mattress on the bed which seemed to me quite soft and probably needed replacing it was sunk in the middle through use However I still slept well , Myself and my boyfriend booked a 2 night stay in London during half term We booked a few weeks beforehand and actually in terms of value for money this was great I had looked at travelodges in central London which were much more expensive and didn t include any breakfast Staff were very friendly turned up prior to check in but we were able to leave our bags and venture off out into central London before returning about 6pm Room was really nice very clean and great facilities Bathroom was quite small but had the added bonus of a bath tub which was lovely nice to have a soak after a day of walking around Breakfast was great as an added bonus very comprehensive continental and you could have a cooked breakfast for an additional 4 95 Hotel also let us leave our bags after we checked out so we could make the best use of our last day and we collected them a little later on 
156200,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When I arrived there were twin beds in my room I called reception and within 10 minutes two lovely ladies had converted them into a very comfortable double with crisp white cotton sheets super , Recently refurbished it felt new I was so snug in my room lovely comfortable bed and very near a range of restaurants and shops 4 minutes walk from Paddington station I would stay again and recommend it The continental breakfast was good too

156203,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The continental breakfast was a huge disappointment Also fascinating that you had to pay for the English breakfast Weren t it for the children we d have breakfast outside the hotel , Nice and friendly staff Close to paddington station the underground and just a few minutes walk from Hyde Park 
156204,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room was incredibly small I would go as far to say it was claustrophobic There was not even room to put my bag on the floor and stand by the bed at the same time , Great location for LHR express very modern and recently refurbished smart bathroom and shower Duravit and Grohe 
156205,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The first room was the smallest room Ive ever been in Once we put our suitcases down we then had nowhere to stand I think they may have been called a Club room These are Cheap in price and nicely furbished and modern but only good for one night We were staying 4 nights so we requested an upgrade They kindly gave us the up grade at no extra price The next room was 10 10 , The beds were perfect No street noise at all The heating was able to be adjusted well to what ever temperature you like so many hotels in Europe are too hot and you cant adjust easily The continental breakfast was wonderful and the staff were always more than happy to help and go the extra mile The concierge were very efficient and the porter excelled and gave us great local information We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to friends The location to the Hop On Hop off bus is so convenient We also took a 20 minute walk to Oxford st Paddington is a convenient location to all sights if you dont want to pay the high price of being closer in town 
156206,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift was a little slow not much that an be done about that if your able use the stairs not a problem , This is the second time with have stayed at this hotel it has been renovated since we last came and its lovely The breakfast dinning bar in particular is very bright but relaxing Nice breakfast lots of choice if you just want basic breakfast stuff cooked breakfast is extra

156214,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The morning female staff on the desk were less than friendly from staff in the evening The carpet in the room was stained and disgusting Also you have advertised on booking com that the hotel is 0 9 miles from the American embassy It s actually a lot farther than this but you don t find this out until you get to the hotel , We liked the fact that there was wifi 
156215,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Marks on lower part of wall in room could have been painted over the TV had a line all the way down the screen been hit or dropped at some point the bath water wasn t hot enough the shower was cold in the morning The milk for tea coffee in the room appeared to be off as there were bits floating in our hot drinks even after we d asked for fresh milk , Overall we were happy with our 2 night stay Breakfast was very good lots of choices eat as much as you like The Reception staff were very helpful advised us of things going on in London that might be of interest to us on arrival Hotel staff in general were good

156219,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was on the small side It was a bit of a squeeze getting past the foot of the bed to the wardrobe Same with the bathroom it took a bit of manoeuvring to close the door when in the bathroom There was a leak from the ceiling which we reported Hopefully it has been fixed already , Quiet location yet within strolling distance of Paddington Station Staff were very helpful and obliging We arrived early for booking in but the receptionist checked that the room was ready and gave us our key Lovely big comfy bed and good TV Modern bathroom We had the continental breakfast which was ample and tasty

156222,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I have booked breakfast with my stay but when we got there they told us they charge extra for English breakfast so the breakfast you book only includes toast ham cheese So my partner wanted a full English so it basically was a waste of money booking breakfast because we had to pay extra anyway ,No Positive

156232,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room is not big I guess it is not the hotel s fault but 2 adults with 2 medium size suitcases staying in a double room was a bit tight Aso for some reason cleaners keep taking soaps a part of hotel amenity which caused a bit of inconvienience , Very close to Paddington station supermarkets shops and restaurants Friendly and helpful staff Very clean room

156268,Norfolk Towers Paddington, confusion about the breakfastbuffet No signs at all or staff saying that we were charged extra if we took food from one of the buffets Poor staff It seemed pretty uncomfortable for them as well as for the guests We told them at the frontdesk that signs could help a lot after we had a minor argument with one of the staff The breakfast was very good o , The hotel and the room was great Nice staff 
156269,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Bathroom was producing a very bad smell as well as staff was not helping at all Breakfast was included and they also charge almost 5 pounds per person as they say u are eligible for continental breakfast only and they provide English breakfast, Location
156270,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Walls are on the very thin side to the point of being able to hear the elevator announcing floor stops from your room to people walking around upstairs Also the maid service was great at cleaning but would remove items you re using an not replace them ie soap and towels , Good location a short walk from Paddington station and not too far from Hyde Park A good selection from breakfast although it will cost you extra to have a full English 
156271,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Early evening I asked reception to book us a taxi to the West End was charged 5 more than a black cab charged late at night We should have walked to Paddington station and got a black cab there , An excellent room with very comfortable beds

156280,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The only problem is when you go down to breakfast all the staff are just standing front of your face literally and waiting for you to finish or as like your planing to rob a plate just standing there and watching you wasn t really comfortable but other than that it s good, The hotel it s such a nice location and perfect for young couple not much facilities such as gym and pool but it is nice and comfortable I went on New Year s Eve and was quite and calm very nice
156281,Norfolk Towers Paddington, What could have been better about this hotel is that the wall should be more sound proof than it is as we could hear people talking despite them not talking too loud in the wee hours of the morning Also if it is possible to make the check in hours a little earlier than 3pm as we had to wait for the time and we were already flushed out from the long hours of flight and just looking forward to rest , The hotel is situated near paddington station which is easily accessible to other parts of London The room was cosy and just nice for two people Any extended facilities are one call away and the staff were really helpful The price for this hotel is not too bad and so far we had a really good experience staying in the hotel I would really recommend this hotel if you re looking for a place to stay in London

156294,Norfolk Towers Paddington, We asked for an early check in as we need to change for a reunion I appreciate that it could not be guaranteed but it was very obvious that they were not even going to try to check availability from their attitude at the front desk Also asked for a quiet room They put us at the front of the hotel with the traffic and buses Don t give people options if you are not going to do anything for them Just adds to disappointment , Like the location easy to find and very convenient for paddington

156309,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Breakfast was very poor , The hotel was in the middle of renovations which we had not been told prior to arrival When we asked for a jug of water one evening we were told they didn t have any The location was close to the tube stop but not in a nice neighbourhood The room was absolutely tiny

156317,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Hotel going thro refurbishment Breakfast taken in main lobby area which has hotel reception at one end main entrance to the side making the dining area cold exposed Two sets of narrow tight stairs to the 5 floors with only one lift takes 5 people serving 84 rooms Shower excellent a very good size it took up more than a 3rd of shower room area There is no way they could have made it any smaller enough space for just about one person 4 stars It was very clean but it was pretty much brand new facilities , Location Shower excellent a very good size see cons comment 
156318,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The rooms are very tight for space One person can just about move around in a room rooms are too small for two people The club room is a waste you can t fit through the door to get in and there are two doors and then once in you can t move You can t even take your trousers off I ve seen toilet cubicles bigger than the club room , Cleanliness

156325,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I thought the restaurant rather let down the overall air of style and sophistication , Loved the stylish bedrooms and the TV in the bath Phone charging points by the bedside excellent

156328,Norfolk Towers Paddington, having to be asked if what breakfast we had paid for and that we could not have the cooked selection unless we paid more It was not done in a professional or discreet manner For an extra 4 50 this could have been done on arrival or included secretly within the room price and the choice is breakfast or not I thought when breakfast was included I did not then have to face a choice so coming down to breakfast felt quite insulting to be challenged at that point , The staff and facilities were excellent 
156329,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The room was very small in the attic and we could hardly open the suitcases when we did that we just didn t have space to walk around the bed , Great position
156330,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Basic rooms very small with smaller than average length beds Very difficult to close the bathroom door anyone on the larger side would have a real problem without needing to stand in the bath Could not open the window and the Air Con was temperamental Hard to believe there will be 85 rooms in this building and without an additional breakfast area can only see it will be packed , Modern clean hotel except the builders were still there despite the hotel website stating that works would be finished in October Staff were very friendly and helpful 
156331,Norfolk Towers Paddington, I had to keep the window closed at this particular room had the a c condenser outside Also I managed to pull off the shower knob which was an interesting conversation at reception , I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms on the 1st floor it was labelled Exec room which was very nice Bed very big and comfy and I m 196cm tall Bathroom compact but good toiletries and light up shaving mirror too nice touch VERY fluffy towels Wifi good Nice charging panel in wall for USB etc Reception was also being worked on so should look good soon Staff friendly Breakfast was standard continental affair liked the Nutella but no marmite Easy walking distance from Paddington UG Take a right left to go up to Praed St for some great food options Take a right and then a right to head towards Hyde Park and enjoy the m houses and a walk round the park Best feature excellent value for money Really good deal

156335,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The breakfast is only cornflaks jam fruit cheese and cold meet wich we did not touch due to the bacon The english breakfast is for 4 95 It contains eggs and hush brown etc you can here the next room There is only one and smaaaal lift wich is full in check out and you cant catch , Friendly stuff with friendly Autmospher The bathroom has a hose 
156336,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift wasn t working the evening we arrived and we were on the 4th floor Restructuring work is ongoing so I believe the bar was unavailable Breakfast was uninspiring Room is small for a 4 star hotel, The staff were always extremely helpful The location is good

156339,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Lift didn t work when we checked in We were located on the fifth floor and this was for one person of us who has a heart problem more than a challenge The room first allocated was an imposition no place to turn around not enough place to store your clothes etc But after complaining they agreed to change , The hotel is being freshly renovated and so up to standards 
156340,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Only one elevator which was too small and which was out of service for two days In addition the hotel ground floor was being renovated A bar lounge would have been nice , The room was pleasant and comfortable enough and the breakfasts were good Handy for Paddington station and tube Good restaurants close by 
156341,Norfolk Towers Paddington, lift broken so had to walk up to 3rd floor Staff unhelpful Could hear everything in the next room including them putting the TV on at 12am and waking up at 6 30am Room tiny no water pressure from the shower could hardly get in the bathroom as the door nearly hit the sink, location
156342,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It is not a 4 stars hotel at all When you enter there are lots of chairs and tables and no living rooms To shut the door when you are in the bathroom you need the advice of an engineer The staff was kind till the moment we told them we would not use their taxi company they recommended From that moment one of them was very hostile , The location
156343,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Extremely small room which was very claustrophobic barely enough room to move in Very basic breakfast and overall the hotel was not worth the money , Friendly staff and great location 
156344,Norfolk Towers Paddington, It would have been nice to have found out that the hotel was being renovated during our stay as that would have changed my choice Plus there was a constant humming noise in our room that was quite annoying In many of my previous hotels there has been bottles of fresh water in fridge but none here , The bed and shower were lovely
156345,Norfolk Towers Paddington, They ask for out ID although they didn t ask before I didn t obay them I think they ask for non English guests only It s racism , Location

156347,Norfolk Towers Paddington, When I asked where the jams were The lady pointed at my table and said It s there but she said it in such a way that made me feel I should know that staff have to remember we are their guests and it may be our first visit and need to remember that we pay their wages By the mere fact we are there , the location and the fact the room was quiet
156348,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The staff at the breakfast were less than pleasant and continuously asked for our name and room number claiming we had not paid for breakfast when we had My daughter could see our name on the list the lady was holding and pointed to it Continental breakfast selection was adequate but not great if you are gluten free or vegan , Short walking distance to Paddington station and a nice walk to Hyde Park For Royal watchers it s just down the road from the hospital where Princess Kate gave birth The desk staff were very nice and helpful

156350,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Unfortuneately the building was undergoing repairs and the reception area although functional was a bit like a building site The staff were doing a good job in difficult circumstances This did not affect our enjoyable stay , We had our granddaughter with us staying in a Queen Room for 3 days It was very comfortable and roomy Very impressed with the TV in the bathroom Everything cleaned everyday fluffy clean towels crisp white sheets tea and coffee available 
156351,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Room small Bathroom too small but we only stayed one night so not a problem , Quiet clean and comfortable close to Paddington Station Staff very friendly and helpful 
156352,Norfolk Towers Paddington, On arriving at the Hotel Reception advised due to Booking com there had been an over booking and that they had organised a room for me at an adjacent Hotel The Hotel was satisfactory but not to the same standard as the pictures of the Norfolk Towers Hotel would indicate Very dissapointed to be messed around like this , Not applicable

156357,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Single room is too small below expectation and rate charged for single room is quite hight comparing to room size I would strongly suggest to reduce the rate slightly , Location is great close to train station and all attractions
156358,Norfolk Towers Paddington, The lift broke while we were there on the day we left we had to carry our bags down a very narrow staircase it had lots of issues during our stay my sister was on level 3 my boyfriend on 5 the lift often wouldn t go up to 5 from 3 not a big drama but slightly frustrating , Such a convenient spot close to public transport and walking distance to lots of great food places Hyde Park friendly helpful staff It s the third time I ve stayed at the hotel and would certainly stay again 
156359,Norfolk Towers Paddington, Overall what we got was not what we expected from a four star hotel The hotel is quite old and the rooms are very small There s only one lift that takes ages to reach we sometimes had to use the stairs The lift itself is very small and can barely take 4 persons Breakfast however was our greatest disappointment We were offered continental breakfast with the room we took The breakfast area down the basement was quite dim and unwelcoming with dark antique furnishing Not the perfect atmosphere for your early morning breakfast the selection of food was very narrow Only one kind of cheese and no eggs There was no name tag under each dish we couldn t tell what type of meat was on the tray , Staff were very friendly always smiling and very helpful when asked for anything They changed the room the next day when we complained about how tiny our room was 
156360,Norfolk Towers Paddington, There was a long flight of stairs in a very narrow hall way from the door to the room and the living space , The location to Padington Station was great

156365,Norfolk Towers Paddington, From the start there was no disabled access When i booked the hotel it had disabled access To which i was shocked there was no way i could get into the hotel unless my sister and friend could lift me in my wheelchair What about their safety Secondly the lift was a disaster You could fit 3 people in there never mind a wheelchair Also in the morning when we took the it to the basement where breakfast was served we realised that the lift had to be recalled by a key instead of us pressing a button but only if a member of staff would be a there if not you had to find a member of staff Also when we went down to the basement floor for breakfast we stepped out not realising and we walked straight into a heap of washing barrels not what you expect when you exit a lift We decided that we wear going to complain It was the general manager that we spoke to First about no disabled access as the other 2 points I said that i booked via booking com he said that he would get in touch with yourselves to remove the disabled access The next morning day we left we got the option of full cooked breakfast and the 1 night removed from our bill Overall it was this was a dismal affair but peaked by the v nice receptionist who dealt with our refund but no i would not recommend as disabled person staying hear Until they get at least a RAMP If you are going to advertised it , The location 
156366,Norfolk Towers Paddington, A little expensive but I guess London Fashion week made the prices hike up , The location is fantastic if you arrive with Heathrow Express just few minutes walk from the Paddington station I got an upgrade to a suite in the 5th floor was lovely and modern if rather small
