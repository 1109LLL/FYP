341657,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The restaurant was closed for summer break , The option to personalise your room scent at turndown The building is beautiful and the room was excellent made even better by the complimentary pillow menu for a perfect night s sleep The free bike rental is also a great plus
341658,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The hotel is within walking distance of the City s landmarks but it was still on the verge of the tourist area so people that are not accustomed to walking better use bikes available at the hotel I wouldn t recommend the top floor it feels a little like servants quarters and I guess it once was , The hotel has an absolutely gorgeous garden the largest in Central Amsterdam apparently It s a real gem in the very heart of the City I booked a King Grand Premier room and it was spacious and comfortable Staff were all very welcoming and approachable All the services that I used at the hotel drinks at the bar laundry in room bar all were very reasonably priced I had an amazing Bloody Mary at the bar for only 9 euros 
341659,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Hotel service, Hotels was an excellent and the stuff very friendly Nice restaurants and very good food Location is fantastic and very romantic view 
341660,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The concierge was not diligent and thorough with his responsibilities And the fitness center is poorly equipped , Loved the location the overall style of the hotel and rooms 
341661,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The price was more than I should have paid for a luxury room I stay at the Four Seasons Ritz Carlton and this was a little higher than it should have been ,No Positive
341662,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Surely one of the best I ve ever been Everything is so great Staff breakfast a big clean beautiful room great canal view great bed and bathroom The atmosphere is expetionaly special 
341663,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, We love Amsterdam and we always stay at Waldorf when we visit as it is a perfect destination We are always made to feel very special and comfortable throughout our stay 
341664,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Not a thing , A wonderful hotel in a fantastic central canal side position The staff from reception to housekeeping to bar and catering were quite honestly superb Nothing was too much trouble and they did everything to make our stay a memorable one Despite all this the hotel was remarkably relaxed and without the stuffiness you can get with some hotels of this standard and quality It s not cheap but in the case of the Amsterdam Waldorf Astoria you definitely do get what you pay for 
341665,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel and staff were exceptional and made our stay a perfect break A special mention to Wilson and his colleague in the Vault Bar excellent 
341666,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything the people were amazing it was a beautiful old building but it had modern walk in showers large hallways the beds were really comfortable location was great 
341667,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The size of the room for the price I paid was insulting The room was so small we could barely move around the bed , the hotel was beautiful Staff great Location perfect
341668,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, It s a historic building but the interior is beautifully renovated The rooms looked and smelled clean and the spacious room they gave us overlooking the canal is probably the nicest hotel room I ve stayed in in any major city 
341669,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The Concierge Mirielle planned in advance all of my tours for the day The staff is very professional friendly and courteous The hotel is clean lovely and in a great location 
341670,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, We have every mix feelings about this hotel As we just arrived for one night the cleaner was interrupting as 3 times trying to clean our room as we arrived maybe 2 hours before 2 times she knock to the door and next time she entered our room without checking if we are in She also knock the room at 10am before we were leaving for breakfast Finally before we left the hotel and I was paying the bill I notice that the 5 new note received last day in the shop disappear from my wallet I address the problem to the supervisor but we have not received any respond As we travelling a lot so far this one is biggest disappointment from this class of hotels 
341671,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, It is expensive but so is all of Amsterdam s top hotels, This hotel has loads of character compared to most in Amsterdam centre whilst being just outside the hectic part of it Perfect 
341672,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Enjoyed it all nothing i didn t like , First class experience in every regard starting with attention from staff through to hotel and room facilities Especially enjoyed the hotel bicycles 
341673,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The bath tub had a large step down that was a little hard to maneuver I am 5 7 and I was barely able to reach the floor Maybe a step to help one get out the bath tub safely would be a good idea , The bed was amazing I slept so well there It was a nice quiet room too Lovely accommodations 
341674,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, We loved everything , Everything about the hotel oozes style and comfort What an amazing space The bedrooms were light an airy The bathrooms spacious and extremely clean The location on the beautiful canal unbeatable A space where you truly feel like the first families that occupied the homes forming the core of the hotel 
341675,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, They tried to overcharge me in the Vaults Bar The room was very expensive , Excellent customer service Good location Very nice pool and fitness centre 
341676,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, They did not make it clear that you cannot eat or drink in the garden this was annoying as we had walked back to the hotel to eat in the garden as it was a lovely day the law says they cannot serve food or beverages in the gardens , Staff very friendly and helpful very comfortable and luxurious hotel
341677,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, No gracious way to go from spa to your room You end up passing by the bar and downstairs restaurant , Beautiful rooms Extreme lovely staff Gorgeous lobby 
341678,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, i dont like when I came to reception on 23 of July at around 16 00 to change the room I recieve answer that i should return to the room and wait as somebody left with keys for me I explained her lady with dark haires that my daughter waiting with whole baggage in the lift She said Sorry I cant help you the doorman alrready left with your keys to your room Please wait I dont understand why is so difficult for her print another keys as we are with whole luggage staying in the lift But on the coridor concierge realised something that I was unhappy and immediatly help us with luggage and support to come to our room THANK YOU I really understand that she send another person with keys but in the situation when I m allready i came to the reception would be nice if she can be more supportive But generally wondeful stuff hotel and food , wondeful stuff hotel and food 
341679,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, It s not cheap but you get what you pay for , Beautiful building in a quiet and peaceful area within easy walking distance of all the main attractions Staff were very attentive and the standard of the accommodation was excellent Dinner in the Goldfinch Brasserie was very good 
341680,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The pool is too small for exercise Night time there needs to be more atmosphere the bar is lacks atmosphere as does the lounge perhaps a little saxaphone or piano pre after dinner , Almost everything the porters were wonderfully welcoming and helpful the front office staff efficient and warm Breakfast was wonderfully elegant and staff very attentive Location was A1 we walked everywhere and the historical aspect with a beautiful garden oasis was so Amsterdam 
341681,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff was always available without being intrusive and they seemed to like their job and their surroundings Garden is magnificent Hallways were wide and beautifully designed 
341682,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The only thing we did not like was having to leave A return stay is an absolute must , Excellent service from arrival to departure Definitely try their cocktails in the bar The bed and linen was so comfortable we wished we could have stayed longer 
341683,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, They charged me 90euro for removing my plain gell nail no cut no trim and the gell nail wasn t remove properly Did a bad job , The service is great 
341684,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, It took far too long to get assistance when dialled from the room, Great hotel extremely comfortable with modern facilities and friendly staff Also in the best location
341685,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing to fault , Location is excellent The ambience inside is wonderful and the private garden beautiful The staff are amazingly friendly and very helpful The attention to detail is quite exceptional An amazing experience 
341686,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The only thing I didn t like was paying 29 Euros for a pot of coffee delivered to the room , The room was amazing the place was amazing the staff was amazing 
341687,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, From the moment of arrival to my departure the staff were so wonderfully attentive The room was wonderful from the scent sprayed into the room each day decor soft and relaxing tones bed super comfortable bath and shower was outstanding as sometimes you just feel like a long soak 
341688,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent with lots of fresh fruit and berries Of course the highlight was dinner at the Restaurant Librije s Zusje book in advance as its alway full on the weekend The staff was brilliant and very helpful Most impressive was the decor that created such a calm atmosphere Ask them if you could look at the original dinning room that has not been renovated 
341689,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, What is it that makes guests show up in shorts and singlets at breakfast in one of Holland s finest hotels What does someone make believe that I would want to listen in to his face time conversation at breakfast It must be a terrible dilemma for hotels to deal with these manners of its affluent guests Personally I would appreciate a polite gesture from the hotel s senior staff to those that suffer from a temporary lapse of good taste , From the warm welcome at the reception desk to the vacuum cleaning of my car upon return everything was taken care off extremely well The breakfast buffet was lavish while the water bottle and the mints that came with the complementary bicycles were very welcome on a very warm day 
341690,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Superb hotel friendly staff cozy atmosphere and excellent location Beautiful spa Michelin rated restaurant and lovely gardens and bar converted from an old bank give this place special character Highly recommended 
341691,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, We travel extensively around the world and we stay at some of the best Hotels This Hotel rates among the better ones, The Bath was outstanding The rest very good
341692,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The price is a bit on the high side I suppose that is due to Keukenhof season Every hotel in the city has raised prices , We like everything the location is not far from Centrum yet very quiet place The staff is extremely courteous and helpful thanks especially to Lesley The bed is extra comfortable and the ambience of the restaurant is really nice 
341693,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The sound bar on the TVs was difficult to operate there was no sound when the TV was switched on, The attention and professionalism of the staff was amazing best we have ever experienced the ambience was second to none
341694,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, One of our group was a wheelchair user Even though the personal was extremely attentive it is not nice having to pass by the kitchen In the afternoon before our departure the following morning to many phone calls with helpful offers for our departure almost a day later , We liked the bar and the personal of the restaurants and breakfast very much We also appreciated the fact that we could stay in our rooms until we had to leave for the station after 12 00 hrs
341695,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved every single thing about my stay here Having previously stayed in different Waldorf Astoria s around the world including New York I genuinely feel this is by far my favourite My room was absolutely divine staying in the deluxe room right on the river with my partner I was only sheduled to stay here for 2 nights but I fell so in love with the room city and staff that I extended my stay an extra 3 nights Absolutely obsessed with the shower in my room So perfect and actually heart broken that I have to leave it Room is sooo spacious bed is amazing giving you a perfect sleep and they even have their own pillow menu for that extra comfort as if you need it Staff I cannot applaud them enough Genuinely care and go the extra mile for you I would like to make special compliments to the reception concierge Lizanne not sure on the spelling exceptional customer service skills and really really cared about mine and my partners upmost comfort during our stay and ran all over the building at all hours of the night for us One last thing the building and the architecture of this building is incredible An amazing historic building with a beautiful characteristic luxury interior design Cannot reccomend this hotel enough 
341696,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Bland and boring international hotel that could have been anywhere from Dallas to Moscow Check in was incredibly slow like they are opening a private bank account for you Friendliness of staff not matched by their competence , Location was good for what we wanted and quiet Room size was generous Staff were friendly 
341697,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, There was often a wait to talk to the concierge but he she was always helpful , Fabulous location Great staff Beautiful and interesting architecture Breakfast was very good 
341698,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, just add brackfast to my bill it was include room charge in my booking , Hotel location is amazing only 15 minutes walking to Dam square very near to resturant and coffee shop staff frindly and smiling welcoming us all the time conciarge is proffissional as guide for place should be visit as tourism private boat trip with sunsit really amazing we enjoy it thank you for every thing 
341699,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing hotel with very friendly helpful staff They made my stay in amsterdam more pleasant i highly recommend this hotel on all levels comfort luxury customer service ambiance food etc 
341700,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing we didn t like about this hotel we didn t eat breakfast there as thought it was a little steep and we wanted to go into Amsterdam for breakfast We also extended our booking by two nights well in advance of our arrival It ended up being two separate bookings and our keys newspaper request stopped after the first booking It wasn t a problem only a thought worth mentioning , The staff were all fabulous and couldn t do enough for us The concierge booked us some nice restaurants and trips with no trouble at all and on great recommendations House keeping and turn down service were amazing Our room was upgraded and it was beautifully furnished and generous size 
341701,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing, Goodness where do you begin The extra high level of service the staff the facilities Oh my Goodness The Spa the food the bar the atmosphere All superior to anything I had ever had before but was so very comfortable with it all You must if you can stay here But don t short change yourself spend at least 3 4 full days here and in Amsterdam Both deserve it and so do you 
341702,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Upon registration we explicitly mentioned that we are in a hurry and want to finish with all procedures as quickly as possible Nothing of the kind The staff started showing us hot towels and ancient flavours from which we were asked to select for our room All this finished after 30 minutes so we missed our appointment For the staff it was more important to give its performance than meeting our will Later while waiting in the lobby for the room being cleaned my partner tried to ordered a tee but they didn t offered any herbal infusions so we gave up ordering There were cookies on the table in the lobby so my partner took two or three of them in a small plate and sat in the chare in the lobby To our surprise the lady responsible for the lounge came to us and rudely told us that cookies are not free of charge and they only could be taken if we ordered something All this happened after we left a solid deposit on the front desk All this made us a bad impression but we wouldn t even mention it here if the following didn t happen On the next day we asked the concierge of the hotel to help us finding a lawyer who could give us a consultation about a contract which was part of our visit to the town The concierge contacted a lawyer which was familiar to the hotel and arranged the consultation and only told us that we need to have money in cash because the lawyer do not take payments be card So far so good After the consultation of about an hour we were given an invoice for 2000 euro deposit The lawyer assured us that he informed the concierge about the deposit and we must have been informed about it When we later asked the concierge he denied knowing anything about rates of the lawyer Obviously someone was lying and we asked the manager to investigate the case After more than a month we only received a note from the hotel that their service was ok and nothing wrong happened , I liked everything except for the service Does it make sense to offer ideal conditions building rooms accessories cuisine atmosphere etc if the staff is able to spoil everything before they accommodate you in the room So I would not come back again 
341703,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, The only thing we didn t like was the lack of communication by one of the employees to my husband who then didn t proceed to book our wedding night as a result of that , Loved all of it Made my wedding day relaxed and more special it was great to get ready for the big day there 
341704,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent food polite staff very comfortable room We celebrated our second wedding anniversary and received complimentary cake and our bed was scattered with rose petals on the first evening 
341705,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, There were issues and long delays on check in and I am not convinced we were given our originally allocated room I had requested a canal view 6 months before but were given an attic room with no view especially when we had an alarm call for someone else at 0700hrs The assistant Manager Sara handled my severe displeasure with aplomb Other than that hiccup this is an exceptional hotel, Exceptional hotel in the centre of Amsterdam spotless room and very comfortable
341706,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Maybe the price but as everything was excellent the cost was irrelevant , The hotels location staff and restaurant were all excellent and made our stay memorable 
341707,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, We were disappointed with the service At breakfast we felt rushed and were constantly reminded of their need to clear us out so they could set up for lunch Also when checking out we ordered a taxi to the airport We were told that someone would come to our room to collect the bags No one came and when we arrived to reception there was no taxi waiting The staff whilst lovely people struck us as being quite dishevelled and not working as a team , A beautiful hotel six canal houses converted to create it The main reception area is simply stunning The rooms and spa area are incredible 
341708,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, In the room serives the food arrive not hot and not really big choices and I had a stateue watch was really bad, The staff are really nice and the location with really nice decriton
341709,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, oncierge s working No one restorant that we prefered was booked in by the concierge of the Hotel oncierge forgot to book in a time in the hairdressing salon at the my birthday And nobody gave us vase when we called the reception , location design interiors
341710,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, No Hairbrush was within the hotel we asjed for to the room , Personal place location was perfect and very nice We had pleasure to taste the food as well and I recomend it to evyr guest to visit the restaurant 
341711,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Don t order breakfast in the room it s over priced and poor compared to going downstairs at the buffet , The decor is beautiful staff very helpful and cordial and our room view was gorgeous The location is ideal central but quiet 
341712,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Friendly staff great position rooms magnificent and the Breakfast excellent Concierge was probably the most helpful we have ever encounted in any 5 star hotel Afternoon tea in the lounge wonderful 
341713,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing to complain about, From the moment you walk in the staff are so helpful and friendly like visiting friends The hotel is beautiful rooms are warmly luxurious and the location is a short walk from everything 
341714,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Entrance as a wheelchair user through the back of house is very unwelcoming and not worthy of a 5 star hotel I felt like a criminal being guided through the kitchens and the smelly corridors The in room breakfast was a complete disaster both quality and service wise cold eggs cold coffee incomplete order waiter not even setting up the table having to come back 3 times to complete order very disappointing Reception apologised and removed the charge It does not however make up for the ruined experience So much for a romantic morning in bed I cannot but feel that as a disabled person I get the shortest straw in terms of room type The care that goes into making the room accessible goes at the cost of luxury , Great location to celebrate 15 year anniversary The hotel was wry nice to give us a bouquet of flowers and a small cake The room is large Very large for Amsterdam centre and the hotel is pico bello 
341715,Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, Nothing, Everything
