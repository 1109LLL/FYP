286961,Hotel Alimara, Wifi does not work well poor No swimming pool in a very warm place Gym very small Fridge very small No restaurants bars close by Reception sent us to a room that was not ready to occupy We had to let them know about it The hotel charged the total amount of four nights when I did the booking even though they said that they will not charge anything They explained that they wanted to check if my card was valid This caused that my credit card was blocked for a few days until I talked to the hotel and my credit card company , The size of the bathroom A supermarket close by the hotel The building looks nice
286962,Hotel Alimara, Air conditioning is a joke The room is spacious but the noise and hot indoor temperature don t provide the comfort required for a 4 stars hotel The staff wasn t helpful and attentive , Really close to a metro station spacious room and nice bathroom
286963,Hotel Alimara, We requested a cab the day before we were set to departure and the can never showed up The front desk said thy only use one cab service and if I knew of any I can call Not sure how a tourist would know about different cab services Totally disappointment in the customer service provided by the front desk Also AC was not working and had to call several times before anyone showed up to fix it ,No Positive

286965,Hotel Alimara,No Negative, I loved that the window could open fully It seems a trivial thing to mention but in a warm climate it is delightful to be able to let the cool breeze blow in if you want it 
286966,Hotel Alimara, Overpriced for what it offers Restaurant food was good but not much of it so poor value On two consecutive mornings our dirty coffee cups were left in the room and not exchanged for clean ones Water was only available from the minibar and charged for Reception staff efficient but not caring , Convenient for metro line although a long way out of centre Local coffee shops in residential area good for breakfast Fast lifts WiFi very good Breakfast plentiful 
286967,Hotel Alimara, A C wasn t on and breakfast was way too expensive My room was also charged for a restaurant charge that I didn t make but it should ve been taken care of , Close to metro and very clean Beds were decently comfy and grocery store was across the street It s a taxi stop so we didn t have trouble getting one to go to the airport

286970,Hotel Alimara, There s no aircon open in April although is already a little hot , The location is good The metro station is just 2 minutes away from the hotel You can walk 3 minutes from the hotel to the nearest supermarket If you want a hotel for reasonable price during your trip in Barcelona Hotel Alimara will be your great choice 
286971,Hotel Alimara, The room had a very strange smell Heating did not work so it was very cold Staff were very unfriendly so we were not too keen on asking them for their help Breakfast was disappointing Too many cakes and sweet stuff were served Eggs were cold Not very much choice for vegetarians and vegans For this price I expected much more for breakfast and more assistance from the staff , The room was spacious The hotel is close to the underground station 
286972,Hotel Alimara, The invoiced amount was higher than the deal confirmed by Booking com Correction took time and argument Their accounting department does not seem to be functioning very well , Rooms are well organized and clean Breakfast buffet is very good Most of the front desk staff are nice and helpful

286993,Hotel Alimara,No Negative, A very cozy place with nice and clean rooms The place is on the outskirts but very close to metro that will take you to the city in 20 minutes Line 3 takes you directly to Camp Nou if you are there for the match Very good staff and very helpful Breakfast is optional and costs around 13EUR
286994,Hotel Alimara, Beds were two singles close to each other but we expected a double bed Air conditioning is too cold at times There s no water in the hotel s self service machines , Very close to a few bars metro stations and a super market Rooms are nice and clean The staff is young and friendly It s very easy to get to the city center and you can ask for a city map at the reception 
286995,Hotel Alimara, We were not thrilled with breakfast We only tried it the first day The other days we went out for breakfast It would have been great to have more variety of fruits at breakfast and overall more variety , The staff was helpful and the rooms spacious The beds were just perfect the air conditioning worked fine and the rooms were clean 
286996,Hotel Alimara, The first night the airco started leaking from the ceiling and we had to be moved to another room free of charge of course but no compensation We requested a double bed but got twins instead due to availability , You get excellent value for money It s close to the metro station and the grocery store 5 min walks Loved the bathroom 
286997,Hotel Alimara, Room decor needed updating was very nice but wallpaper needed touched up etc Had to call for the iron every day as they kept coming and taken it away every time we used it Doors were extremely creaky and woke us up quite a few times , Location modern hotel staff gave us early check in

286999,Hotel Alimara, too much noise from nearby city highway also because windows not closing good bathroom a bit dated would need some renovation , close to Metro station and night bus station friendly and helpful staff
287000,Hotel Alimara, Staff is simply horrible I complained client at the reception were complaining likewise for the breakfast Simply unacceptable for a 4 hotel Avoid it , Clean hotel
287001,Hotel Alimara, It would be perfect if we could have some duvets instead of blanket and have a kettle to make tea , 1 The staff were very nice we arrived before noon and we got a room in 15 mins 2 The cleanliness was very good the room was cleaned every day and everything looked very hygienic 3 Very easy to access the metro station 4 the room was air conditioned and the conditioner was not noisy 
287002,Hotel Alimara, It was not as clean as we like our room to be There was dust hair that was not ours and so one I dropped my bath sponge accidentally when I was taking a shower and when I picked it up it had dust and hair on it and we just arrived at the location Also expensive breakfast 15 EUR person day , Comfortable bed great location in a quiet area very close to the metro 1 min

287004,Hotel Alimara, The location rooms that overlook the busiest ring road in Barcelona and therefore are quite noisy even during the night Dinner stops at 10 3o pm We arrived at 10 and were misinformed by reception staff who said 11 Result cheese and cherries in the room ,No Positive
287005,Hotel Alimara, Extremely disappointed and annoyed about the car parking as this was one of the main reasons I booked with the hotel as it stated it provided car parking However this was not the case and I had to park out on the street which resulted in our hire car being towed away as it was parked illegally This resulted in a 200 euro additional cost and immense upset caused to the family at the start of the holiday VERY POOR Communication by hotel regarding car parking,No Positive
287006,Hotel Alimara, This hotel would be even so much better if they would have a pool , I love this area of Barcelona It is a residential area with some shops and not at all touristic but the hotel is right next to the metro station and within a short time you are wherever you need to be The hotel is very decent and at the price they charged us really a bargain 
287007,Hotel Alimara, The bed was a little bit harder than I would like it to be The dinner at the restaurant wasn t great for the price There s not any restaurants around the hotel to go to or things to do near it , The breakfast chocolate crossiants were delicious The staff was very friendly and helpful I like how you could have pizza delivered to your hotel room 
287008,Hotel Alimara, The hotel is near the highway so if you are a light sleeper we suggest you bring earplugs if you sleep with open windows The windows have excellent sound insulation so you can keep the air condition on at low in the summer months and close the windows at night did not hear a thing , Comfortable and spacious rooms clean and reletivly new The bathroom was perfect Metro stop is a next to the hotel and a 15 20 minute ride to the Gothic quarter Very safe neighbourhood The night falls around 10 PM in June and we felt very safe comming back by metro and to the hotel after 11PM 
287009,Hotel Alimara, The shower fitting was loose and coming away from the wall The pressure was very good but meant the the shower head had a mind of it s own due to the loose fixing The plastic lounge chair was like sitting on a wooden box not good Glad we only had one night, Comfortable bed
287010,Hotel Alimara, It is not a 4 star category in my opinion Pretty normal facilities Bath robe not available Street was in work progress so it was noisy at the afternoon and from 08am , Staff was really nice and the bed was super comfy

287013,Hotel Alimara, The breakfast was not worth even half the money we paid Very poor , Very nice views from 9th floor windows open fully allowing fresh air Very clean bathroom first time I d have felt comfortable to have a bath in a hotel bathroom didn t have the time though 
287014,Hotel Alimara, The breakfast was although great value for money could have been a bit more varied , It s location was brilliant right next to the metro and on the central line to the city centre The staff were extremely helpful and nice Parking was easy and secure so had no worries regarding our car

287022,Hotel Alimara, The Fitness Centre is a small room with a treadmill cycling machine and a not so useful weights machine and there is a clear lack of oxygen in this room Besides the room was not very well maintained in terms of cleanliness , Although the hotel is far from the city centre metro is just a few meters away which is convenient Wi fi connection was good Helpful and friendly staff Clean and spacious room
287023,Hotel Alimara, Breakfast was expensive , Although the hotel is located relatively far from the city centre it is possible to reach the most important touristy places within 20 minutes on the metro The area is clean quiet and safe and there is a supermarket and several good coffee places nearby The staff were all very nice and helpful WI FI worked without any problems Rooms and bathroom were very clean and the bed was comfortable Would definitely stay again as this is a bargain in Barcelona even if further away from the city centre

287029,Hotel Alimara, The only thing that i didnt like is that i went on winter and i had to open de window to have a nice temperature inside the room and it was very noisy because of the cars on the street and the AC only works as a heater So i didnt have excelent sleep because of te noise , It is less than 5min walking from the metro station The rooms are really good quality 
287030,Hotel Alimara, I booked a double bed and got twin beds on arrival when I asked to change they said that since we arrived late they gave all double beds to other guests They should really only sell double rooms until they run out and then offer only the twins they have left Also there were no tea coffee facilities on the room Very expensive breakfast and parking at 15 euro each Luckily there is a nice cafe to get breakfast nearby and free parking readily available across the street , Fantastic value for money Very good location near metro L3 that takes you into Plaza Catalunya and also to the Barca Stadium We were able to park on the street just across from the hotel for free every night Lovely room looks newly renovated Great water pressure on the shower nice toiletries as well Very helpful staff they stored our luggage until the evening on our check out date Loved it will come back 
287031,Hotel Alimara, Poor attitude of staff was very disappointing They were very unhelpful when they made a mistake with our parties booking and we found someone else in our room At first they refused to give us a different room as they said they were fully booked After complaining to the hotel manager and the company we booked with they miraculously found a room available for us It s a nice place to stay but I wouldn t say it s 4 star 3 at best, Good location in very close proximity to Barcelone el Prat Airport and a 2 minute walk to the metro and local facilities such as a bank hospital supermarket and all purpose store Very clean rooms and good housekeeping
