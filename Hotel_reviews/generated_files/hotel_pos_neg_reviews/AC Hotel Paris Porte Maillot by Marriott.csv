221514,AC Hotel Paris Porte Maillot by Marriott, Nothing , Stayed here for a long weekend having entered the Paris marathon We like walking so happy that hotel is not as close as others to some key attractions areas However there is a metro station very near by and we also utilised this What set this hotel apart for me was the genuine helpfulness of the staff Every request was met with excellent local knowledge and they were only too happy to get a map out and help All advice given was spot on I can genuinely say the staff here were the friendliest hotel staff I have ever met Whether this was down to the individuals concerned or the management of the hotel I don t know and really it doesn t matter but well done One important point is that if travelling from CDG airport the airport bus takes you to a stop over the road from the hotel We didn t know this in advance but very handy if coming into Paris from the airport Would gladly stay again
