309557,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, Upon arrival the staff told that my room was sold and I had to go and find another hotel It was a guaranteed booking prepaid It took me up to the GM and to call booking com to get the staff to get me a room ,No Positive
309558,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, We weren t given a room until one and a half hours after the designated check in time which coupled together with us arriving a bit early meant that we had to spend our first two hours in Amsterdam waiting at a hotel reception While the room we ended up having was on the top floor and it was a larger room one of the executive floors I would have happily stayed in a normal room which was available on time We had booked a standard room More annoyingly the staff kept telling us the room will be ready in 30 minutes Once we were in the room it turned out that it wasn t even cleaned properly The only alternative we were given was a room with better disabled access which we didn t want in case somebody else needs it more than us One of our towels was not replaced after the first night and we found the general cleanliness of the room was not great There was rubbish on the balcony from the previous stay , Bed was very comfortable Location is great as both the city and the airport are within 15 minutes by metro train The hotel is also very close to Amstelpark which is amazing on a nice day We were offered free Starbucks coffee because of the delay which was nice But again I would have preferred not to have been delayed in the first place 
309559,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, One thing that can be better in this hotel is the breakfast I think the hotel with these facilities must have a better breakfast it should be available for different nationalities with different religous , I had a comfortable stay in Holiday Inn hotel I went to Amsterdam to visit the exhibition it was very close to the exhibition about 5 min walk and also to the subway and tram too so I could go to city center easily Generally it was a good stay for me 
309560,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, In January booked and paid for 2 executive rooms for 2 nights inJune We arrived early so our rooms were not ready We checked in and left our bags in a locked room at reception On returning to the hotel at 6pm we were told they had given away one of our rooms that afternoon and told no other rooms available but had a room available in another hotel As we were travelling with a larger group of 40 people this was not acceptable When we asked to speak to a manager we were told there was none on the premises When the trainee receptionist realised we were not going to go away she went into the room behind reception and would not come out After standing there for over an hour we were given keys to a second executive room Unbelievable , Close to trains and trams 
309561,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, When I booked I put in close to the railway unfortunatly it was not amsterdam central but amsterdam rai Saying this the transport link between each of the stations was very easy and frequent , The room was spacious and the bed was very wide could have slept 3 in the bed with comfort

309568,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, Staff were very rude and sarcastic When I asked the lady at the reception how long it would take to go to the airport in the morning and how much time in advance do I need to go to the airport The lady was rude and sarcastic and said that as I don t have a private jet and I am a private airport and as I am not the only person flying I should go there early It was not a joking conversation either Such sarcasm was not required for a simple question for a new visitor to the city I arrived late as my flight was delayed tired and hungry only to be told that the kitchen was closed and the only thing available was a pizza or Cheese platter The location of the hotel is so far from city centre that there was literally no options to eat The receptionist then gave me a website for a local delivery I could order which took more than an hour and half to arrive by which time I was already sleeping I asked for a Iron board and a UK plug adapter for which I was told to sign a declaration that I would be charged 50 euro s if not returned or damaged The adapter never worked in the first place and I had to go to reception everytime to change it to a working one poor service I checked out early in the morning as I had an early flight The receptionist took it upon himself to order a taxi although I had arranged one myself through Uber and was upset that I did not take his taxi I would not go back to this hotel and would not recommend If you have a choice stay elsewhere , Convenient to walk to the Convention centre

309581,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, The service at check in was very slow we had to wait 20 minutes as there was only one staff member on the desk although others were sitting in the office We also had to change rooms as the tv was broken We were shocked at the price of the bottled water and were disappointed not to be given clean cups and supplies of tea and coffee everyday ,No Positive
309582,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, Unfriendly reception staff I felt judged and looked down upon by them The scrambled eggs were cold in the breakfast and watery the bacon though was delicious Bonus points for pastrami as a meat option in the breakfast table it was really good They didn t offer any transportation to Amsterdam RAI and I had to drive 30 minutes to get there due to roadworks blocking what otherwise would ve been a super easy access , Loved how spatious the room was bathroom was really nice and clean bed was comfy and they offer a selection of pillows The best part though was the lounge bar restaurant hybrid they have on the first floor It s really casual and cozy there s TVs tuned to sports games if that s your thing with couches around The food there is great served fast and with a smile if only the people at the reception were as friendly I would ve rated this 5 stars

309587,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, There was a lot of construction refurbishment taking place I luckily did not need to use majority of the hotel facilities and so was unaffected by this , The room was clean and comfortable Close walking distance to the RAI station 
309588,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, Unfortunately for us the confort was modest to say the least The room was cold due to the AC not working at its fullest and being winter the overall feeling was unpleasant I brought up this aspect to a few members of the staff and all they did was write my room number on a piece of paper and that was it I don t know if all rooms suffered from this but they never got back to me After a while I stopped bothering to complain , The hotel is very close to the Amsterdam RAI metro station which is also serviced by trains connecting the city to the airport The rooms are large Due to an error we ate breakfast on our first day and it was indeed very good There are tablets in the elevator that you can play Angrybirds on while going up down 
309589,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, Not as close to the centre as I had thought but 2 minutes walk from metro and train station Breakfast was expensive 22 Didn t feel like the room was good value for money but I m aware it is to do with the time of year Dec 30 Jan 1st 200 Euro a night , Very nice room on 12th floor Good size and very clean The bathtub also had a jacuzzi feature

309594,Holiday Inn Amsterdam, The hotel has a 4 star rank but for us it was not a 4 star hotel Our room was on the 5th floor and it was very noisy traffic the windows are very thin It was also very cold eventhough the heating was on we also think because of the thin windows Also the staff maybe a chance for us but the employees we talked with 80 was new and didn t know a lot of things We had to ask for several things for toilet materials toilet paper toothpaste etc normally in a 4 star hotel this is already in the bathroom and you don t have to ask for it Our kettle was broken we lucky got a new one the room was cleaned after the first night but not after the second night and when you choose this hotel with the amount of money you have to pay for you are expecting some luxury And finally on the ground floor there is renovation also very noisy you can not here the employee at the reception you are talking with Some employees are very friendly and say they are sorry and some for example when we checked in 22 November 1500 are talking very slow and you don t feel welcome It is ofcourse not a bad hotel but with a 4 star hotel it was not what we had expected , The Breakfast was very good Large variety of breakfast options Also the location of the hotel is very good central For us we had to be in the South of Amsterdam so it was very comfortable Very close to train metro and tram
