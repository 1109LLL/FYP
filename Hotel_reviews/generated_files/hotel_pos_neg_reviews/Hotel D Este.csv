494693,Hotel D Este, there wasn t nice views from our room but that wasn t a big problem it is worth it for the comfort and luxury experience at this hotel , The bed was incredibly comfortable And the room was so big and luxurious Bath robes and slippers were a nice touch Large bathroom with lots of space and bathtub Extra dressing room off from the lounge area too Wonderful beds high quality linen and good mattress support Amazing traditional italian restaurant directly across the road Really great cheap Asian stores in walking distance with fashionable stylish and well made clothes for women at great prices 
494694,Hotel D Este,No Negative, Very good hotel location perfect for walking around and enjoying the town specious room I asked for a higher floor there was no problem Room and bathroom clean staff nice 
494695,Hotel D Este, Location is great if you reach the hotel by car taxi not so much if you use the underground service , Clean and comfortable room modern structure kind staff 
494696,Hotel D Este, Room was very small in a sense the bed if you sit on the edge it flips The internet always breaks and slow not efficient for working and its supposed to be business hotel , Close to bocconi
494697,Hotel D Este, Nothing , Breakfast fresh and clean lovely choices Privacy and helpful staff Comfy clean room and modern styling Loved stairs down to breakfast room Would go back again definately 
494698,Hotel D Este, You can t really improve this but the location is only ok It is a 20 minute walk from any train station and a 20 25 minute walk into the centre It is worth the walk into the centre though as it is quite a nice stroll But if you want easy access to the train this not the best option , The room was exceptionally clean and the staff were helpful and friendly The shower was excellent after a long hot dusty walk through some very strange backstreets in Milan WiFi was good and fast enough The room quiet and cool 
494699,Hotel D Este, Quite far from centre but 25 mins walk Not a lot of natural light in the room Should have been a bit cheaper given the location I feel but seems to reflect current prices , Good sized room and bathroom Modern 
494700,Hotel D Este, My room number was 609 and literally 90 degree next to the elevator Also the door insulation was poor My sleep was interrupted several times each night by the mechanical noise as the elevator door opening and chatting guests getting on and off the elevator This is point should be improved Upon my complaint the staff offered to replace me But I was already unpacked and quite overhelmed to do it again during design week fatique In my opinion room doors should be optimized immediately The black out curtain is a good idea but the motor is again too noisy I could even hear the next room s curtain motor , Location was great Quite close to Porta Romana Metro station and walkable to Duomo Ticinese Navigli and locations like Bococci Univ Colonne di San Lorenzo or Fondazione Prada 
494701,Hotel D Este, Expensive Some street noise but there are heavy blinds that can be rolled down which reduce the noise , Comfortable hotel perfect for a business stay especially if visiting Bocconi quiet clean helpful staff I ordered a bigger room so there was plenty of space Exceeded my expectations 
494702,Hotel D Este, The room furnishing is old and may require an upgrade for a better value for money ratio The bathroom had no heating and was really cold, Croissants at breakfast were really good and ghe service really helpful Location is really good 
494703,Hotel D Este, Would have preferred if the staff asked us how we would like to pay for the room rather than just take the money directly from the credit card given during the booking I would have liked to pay cash to get rid of the Euros I had left and to avoid unnecessary credit card charges FX fees , Front desk staff with very good local knowledge We were very satisfied with the recommendation for the restaurant for our dinner Secure off road vallet parking right next door for 20 a day Access to public transport Tram with stop a few metres away Room very well insulated and no noise at all at night given that the hotel is on the main road Room looks out to a quiet court to the side of the hotel 
494704,Hotel D Este, Just location, Big and comfortable room with king bed and single bed the bathroom bright Breakfast was excellent High rocommened if you can walking about 20 30 min to city center
494705,Hotel D Este, No welcome when we arrived but the worst was that we had to change rooms 3 times in 24 hours as the air conditioning was not working No apologies from anyone The worst hotel I have ever been to and I travel every 3 months This is my first ever complaint from all the hotels I booked from booking com Stay away from this hotel , Not much room very uncomfortable
494706,Hotel D Este, Wifi signal was poor in my room and the room itself need some improvements , Comfortable room kind and professional staff the whole hotel looks fine but I just slept so I can t say more 
494707,Hotel D Este, the reception stuff wasnt friendly but did their job fairly well the door of a neighbour room didnt work minor things really, in the student part of town 30min from central station lots of bars restaurants public transport great rooms two double glazed windows make it soundproof against the road
494708,Hotel D Este, Old man at the reception was very rude when we checked in No welcome no smile Have never seen this in a four star hotel Room d cor very old fashioned, Breakfast selection nice City centre is within walking distance approx 15 minutes 
494709,Hotel D Este, Room was a little stuffy and it was difficult to open the window At night I put down the blackout screen so that I could then sleep in the dark but then it was impossible to open the window This is only a minor quibble and most other hotels are as bad or worse , I was visiting Bocconi university for a conference and this was excellently situated Room nicely appointed Decent breakfast 
494710,Hotel D Este, We asked to pay with a different credit card than the credit card used for the reservation They said it wasn t possible Completely non sense Staffs could be more welcoming and friendly , Clean room and bathroom Great comfort 
494711,Hotel D Este, Bathroom floor not well cleaned, Wooden flooring in The bedroom Extremely kind and efficient waitress For breakfast Most convenient location near Bocconi University
494712,Hotel D Este, I was with my sister and her sun for one night but it was more than enough to disappoint me wifi wasn t work at all just in entrance water of shower was cold really cold poor breakfast In one word clean hostel is more fix than four star I didn t write this but because even the stuff wasn t nice to us I thought it s better everyone knows before booking this hotel , It was clean
494713,Hotel D Este, The location of the Breakfast room was bit off as it was located in the basement but no complaints about the staff serving breakfast to customers , I liked the staff and over all facilities at Hotel 
494714,Hotel D Este, The location fairly was good Walking distance to canal and 25 min walk to duomo The area was a bit sketchy graffiti and a fight broke out across the street in the morning Otherwise we were very happy with location and there was a pharmacy and Health food store close by , The hotel was excellent quiet clean and new Bathroom was very nice Hotel room and bathroom felt upscale 
494715,Hotel D Este, Location is next to nothing and not a nice area though , Breakfast was not bad staff were helpful Rooms are quite very tight untill we asked to move to another room coz AC didnt work properly second rooms size was much better
494716,Hotel D Este,No Negative, Nice location a solid hotel with lovely and spacious downstairs area very modern and nicely laid out rooms quiet super clean excellent breakfast and very responsive reception Exceeded my expectations 
494717,Hotel D Este, Staff was rude except for one young guy who worked a night shift I arrived late and the guy at the reception a more senior person did not even bother to respond to me in English he kept talking in Italian like he wanted to make a point The room was the size of a closet true I booked a room for a single person but still I am amazed they call that a room I went for a conference with Bocconi and I had to leave one night early Of course they did not want to cancel the last evening although I stayed there already two nights Because it was an emergency everything happened too fast on my side and I could not call bookings during that time period to report the issue So they just charged me without any shame The younger nice guy at the checkout told me that the management may respond if I threat them with my Bocconi ties But why should one do that and not expect fair treatment Other than that I ve seen better rooms in the hotel so just check carefully what you book and do not expect fair treatment , Location Ok if you need to be in that part of the city close to Bocconi U 
494718,Hotel D Este, My room had a light in the entry hallway that was flickering which was a little annoying at some point but it wasn t too big a deal as I was very happy otherwise , The single room is perfect if you are just one person but the bed can be too small if you are above 6 feet tall Its decorated in a super cute and cozy way There is a cute minibar with drinks and some snacks the bathroom has all the toiletries and facilities and the breakfast is amazing It also really helps that the staff are really nice It is a 5 minute walk to the Ripamonti stop and a 10 minute tram ride to the city centre Duomo et al There are also some Japanese and American restaurants nearby If you are visiting Uni Bocconi like I was it is a short 5 minute walk and really couldn t be in a better location 
494719,Hotel D Este, Very few staff to provide any support services location seemed dicey parking was around the block at 20 Euros a day Hotel hassled us repeatedly that our credit card holding the room wasn t good despite the act that we were using it at the same time throughout Italy A second card that we were actively using was also rejected FINALLY a third card went through We think that the hotel wanted to cancel our reservation and rent the room at an even higher rate because the soccer finals were in town NO OTHER HOTEL DURING OUR 12 day visit to Italy had any problem with our cards , Restaurant down the street was terrific 
494720,Hotel D Este, no view from dark room at forst floor back side room poor view at wall behind building, front desk staff very good also breakfast staff very good thanks
494721,Hotel D Este, Breakfast really poor for a 4 star hotel should definitely improve , Very friendly and kind staff Cleanness comfortable room and pretty renovated bathroom really good equiped Special compliments for the waiter at breakfast couldn t recall name 
494722,Hotel D Este, Rooms are very small Bathroom was not optimal clean Breakfast not so much choices 20 min walking to the center Pillow not comfortable Bathroom very small, Friendly staff Nice decoration Parking in garage from another company 2 min walking Good pizza restaurant in neigborhood
494723,Hotel D Este,No Negative, Nice breakfast with a variety of sweet and savoury food Tram stop out the front Staff friendly and helpful They ordered me a taxi which arrived immediately They allowed me to leave my baggage after check out so I could tour the city without carrying my luggage 
494724,Hotel D Este, Massively heavy keys is the only thing I did not like they could be changed , Awesome staff very friendly Nice and clean rooms with a nice location not too far off the city centre that said the location perfectly served the purpose of my visit
494725,Hotel D Este, Never saw one taxi even though there were a lot of cars on the street Staff will quickly arrange for one though Could use an outside sign s that stands out a little more The Wi Fi didn t work reliably , All staff were very helpful and genuinely pleasant All desk staff had confident English Double room was clean comfy and good value for money For a fairly busy street there was no noise The mini bar wasn t as extortionate as other hotels I ve been in Decent range of bars and restaurants nearby considering it s in a quieter part of central Milan Well priced deal for the weekend in the center of a big Global city Would recommend for future business or leisure travel if a similar deal was available 
494726,Hotel D Este, No bar in the hotel anyway not a big problem as the street is full of restaurants and cafes , Location is very close to my place of business Very quick laundry service Quite rooms

494730,Hotel D Este, It is a little too pricey for what it is but on the other hand most of the hotels in Milan are , This hotel is conveniently located in a close proximity from the city enter and the tourist attractions like Duomo di Milano cathedral as well as from the restaurant bar district of Navigli di Milano About 15 20 min walk to the former and 10 15 min to the latter 
494731,Hotel D Este, Minor point no iron in the room seems to be common with most European hotels, Location is very convenient tram stop out the front easy access to all main attractions Great customer service especially from Lorenzo on the front desk very informative and helpful Good breakfast Max and Massimo were very attentive and make a great coffee especially Max rival any barista We had two adjoining rooms as requested good size comfortable and clean great bathroom Good restaurants near by Would stay again when back in Milan 
494732,Hotel D Este, Rooms are small air condition blocked to 24 degrees when you leave the room and the room never got fresh , Location good if you need to go to the Bocconi university Breakfast is ok The parking garage next door is practical
