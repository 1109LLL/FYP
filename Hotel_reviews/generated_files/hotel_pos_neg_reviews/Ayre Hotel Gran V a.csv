327773,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Hotel breakfast very very limited especially for hot food Cold was the usual and plent of deserts and fruits room for improvment here like hasbrowns Very hard on vegetarians Room not very well cleanned found hair in both the room and bathroom We also has some insect presence in a day Bed with all the sheet layers are always sliding off painful to sleep on them The hotel had no facilites like a gym or pool , Its very convinient for public transport you have all options 5 mins away There is also a mall in the Espanya squre with food and restaurant Very good area and direct transport from airport with A1 or A2 stops there Room has air conditioning that is a must in a hot city as Barcelona
327774,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, breakfast was not up to the usual standards of this hotel tables were not cleared and we had to wait for a table hot food was not replenished very quickly , everything was great as usual 
327775,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Housekeeping staff a little noisy in mornings despite DONOT disturb sign, Very Comfortable spacious clean quiet we had an inward facing room 
327776,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I think it was a little on the expensive side even with the special offer particularly as the hotel doesn t have a pool However considering we travelled in July that s probably to be expected , The staff were wonderful There was a huge choice for breakfast and everything was lovely especially the freshly baked mini pastries 
327777,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The room could use some updating But it was fine , Great shower and very large bathroom Great view and dark shutters to keep light out if you need to Staff was great 
327778,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, On our last day we had planned to visit some sights using taxis as I have difficulty walking any distance I wasn t told that the taxis were on strike that day I thought there should have been some notice at reception to let guests know , The hotel staff were lovely and very friendly the rooms spotless and the beds very comfortable 
327779,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I can t think of anything we didn t like , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and cleaned everyday It was very central in the city and within a few hundred metres of the metro Excellent experience 
327780,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The rooms are quite big and clean The restaurant is also very good and was open until 23 00 which was a handy alternative when arriving late after a day of sightseeing Also access to and from the airport or train station is easy and fast It is conveniently located next to metro station 
327781,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Wanted flowers sent to the room to my SO as I was late checking in they advise on a very good florist and made the delivery impeccable Very happy with their service 
327782,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The shower , The snacks and breakfast including the coffee at the caf bar were excellent Staff very friendly and helpful Very quiet for a city hotel great soundproofing Very Clean Comfortable beds w
327783,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The hotel was a bit difficult to find by car Once you know where it is there is a small entrance to parking right next to the hotel Pull in and press the intercom button tell them you are checking in and they will open the gate , The location is convenient to Sants train station which is why we booked here as we had to return our rental car to the station It is clean modern and comfortable They had a taxi waiting for us to take us to the airport at the exact time we asked 
327784,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, That we got a room on the 2nd floor without a view We have noticed through our trip in North Spain and South France all our rooms were booked through booking com that we were given one among the least desirable rooms in the property ,No Positive

327787,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Upon arrival we were offered a room with twin beds or a double bed naturally as a couple we decided on the double bed When we finally entered the room there was no bath which was listed on the itinerary when we were booking the hotel via booking com I asked reception why this was and I was told that the baths are only available in rooms with twin beds And to add insult to injury the room was on the first floor facing the busy street outside ,No Positive
327788,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Hotel is rated a 4 star there is no pool or spa No coffee maker or hot water for tea in the room I appreciated the hotel as it was Hard to be critical when such wonderful people are themselves 5 star quality , Hotel is located near the Plaza D Espanya Great spot for those that do not want to be in the center of the tourist activities like Las Ramblas But Las Ramblas is 2 minutes by metro or a few more minutes by street bus and there are plenty of buses going that way from Plaza D espanya Taxi is relatively inexpensive costing less 5 euros to get there From the airport the Aerobus terminal 1 or 2 will get you to the Hotel its the first stop 20 minutes ride The Aerobus stops just a few meters from the hotel just look to your right when getting off the bus and you will see the hotel The hotel is clean great staff at the desk and at the restaurant they will do just about anything to make you feel great Their breakfast buffet is wonderful great selection Those who want just a croissant or cereal orange juice and coffee that can be had for 4 euros or so as a separate option to the buffet Rooms are comfortable and spacious Dinner at the hotel restaurant was one of the best my wife and I experienced For the money the presentation and quality of food was exceptional And we found that out unfortunately in our last night there

327790,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, They just did not have a kettle in the room we kept on asking for boiled water so we can have tea in the room at least they can improve on that kettle with various teas in the room will give it 100 , The hotel could speak a language we can understand English the staff was amazing at all costs they wanted to make sure their guests are okay from the restaurant to the room hospitality managers it was in the perfect location in the city it is modern and near to all transport amenities 
327791,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The corridor smelled terrible like a bathroom Our room was so small and cramped Housekeeping not responsive only made the bed and threw new pillows on the chair We asked for clean sheets one night twice untill we got them No gym no pool no kettle for coffee and tea in the room And very pricy for the stay , The location is ok if you plan to use the underground and busses about 30 minutes to anywhere in Barcelona city but convenient transport The staff are really nice and helpful

327795,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I wouldn t considered this hotel a 4 stars I had major issues with the air con During my trip the temp outside was around 38 Celsius I complained that the air was not cold enough and strong enough All they said was that it was central and nothing they can do about it All they can do was change the filter Changing the filter helped a little but it took my body to cool down about 1 to 1 2 hour in the room I was also a little peeved when I came back to my room at 2pm to get away from the heat but the room wasn t cleaned I called the front desk and they said the cleaning of the room time is till 4pm Most hotels i stay at the rooms are cleaned from 10am to 1 pm Also for a 4 star they don t offer small things like a kettle or a box of tissue paper I have been to 3 stars hotel that offer better services Overall the hotel was considered just passable for a 4 stars the price I paid was a little steep My last advice is do little more research in what is available before choosing this hotel , The room was clean and the bathroom was roomy 
327796,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, We asked for a non skid mat to be put on the shower floor as it was a little slippery with the soap they tended to it immediately perfect solution We were grateful Lovely hotel , Great location near the metro wonderful dinners and the breakfast buffet is amazing We will come back to this hotel

327875,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The wi fi was really slow and disconnected on many ocasions Too bad the hotel does not provide electic kettles for the rooms they said that it is possible to ask for hot water at the hotel bar for no cost if needed , The location is amazing 5 minute walk from the fountain and Arena mall All kinds of public transport available within the 100m radius of the hotel The rooms are clean and provide most of the comfort you need in a hotel room The breakfast was very good too The staff was very peasant and helpful

327886,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The room was a bit small and so the bed had to be just a standard double There was only one bed side table even though a little one could have fitted If we had asked I m sure we could have been moved to a different room but we liked being on the first floor In the summer it might be better to be on a higher floor and not at the front so the windows could be opened without the street noise being a problem , Great location for accessing metro shops restaurants the fountain and Montjuic area The airport bus stopped a few metres away Excellent buffet breakfast Worth having at least on one morning The shower was big and the bed comfortable The staff were always very helpful

327906,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The breakfast staff didn t advertise the eggs as you like it option and never offered unless you grab them and said what you wanted , The staff was extremely helpful and the location to the conference center was perfect It was also close by to a lot of shopping opportunities but not overly touristic

327914,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, It is a shame that there is no tea coffee facility in the bedroom , The breakfast buffet was amazing and the Nespresso coffee machine in the restaurant is a plus The location is fantastic and not far from the airport 20 mn with the Aerobus that is 3 minutes walk from the hotel 
327915,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Boiling water would have helped to make a decent cup of English tea, The breakfast choice was brilliant the service and changing cleaning the tables to allow later sittings was always done professionally and quickly great value for buffet style multiple course breakfast really friendly and helpful staff in all areas of hotel 
327916,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Room was chilly and the warm blanket provided didn t seem fresh There was no tea kettle or iron Soap that was provided never seemed to have been enough for 2 people , Location was good Staff was helpful

327918,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Although the hotel was modern it wasn t the type of place you would want to spend the night at the bar as it wasn t particularly cosy or inviting , Very modern and clean hotel Staff at reception were super helpful and allowed us to check in early which was really appreciated after an early start The rooms are modern and the the bathrooms are beautiful 
327919,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Nothing it was a perfect break, We stayed in the Junior Suite and it was amazing Lovely big room staff wonderful and helped us with places to eat Breakfast was plentiful varied and lots of it Although next to a busy road you could not hear the traffic 
327920,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, A whisky and a Baileys in the bar at 19 60e was far too expensive hence we never used the bar after that and the seating is not comfortable Also it may be a modern hotel but the bar is far to plain no kerb appeal , Everything except the bar 
327921,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The mattress on the bed was not very comfortable NO wash cloths in the bathroom , The cafes food is excellent The use of the elevator was a necessity for me City tours info was so important 
327922,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, It lack a bit of personally it s decor was like many modern hotel in Europe Note the bathroom was a hazard as wet tiles can be very slippery and care is needed idea would be to have non slip mats for the shower and floor area , Location easy to get a bus to the airport Easy walking distance to places of interest 
327923,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No tea or coffee making facilities , It s on the Aerobus route from the airport 5 40 one way 10 20 return The hotel is clean and quiet We had a street side room but there was no noise triple glazing Staff are helpful and speak good English It s mostly a business hotel so the focus is on being efficient Nevertheless as tourists we found it ideal The location is a 3 minute walk from Placa d Espanya where you can catch the hop on hop off bus or catch the Metro We walked to La Rambla in 30 mins 
327924,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No balcony terrace or rooftop, Right on the Aerobus line from the airport so it is extremely convenient to get here for cheap Location is excellent steps from Placa d Espanya the Magic Fountain of Montjuic Olympic Stadium etc Beds were comfortable and bathroom was nice excellent shower 
327925,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The hotel was nice , Kind and helpful staff clean and confortable rooms but far from touristic places If you have limited time to see favorite places and night life the location is not very good 
327926,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Rooms were lovely bathroom was great and very modern I was not expecting it to be as nice as it was as we got it fairly cheap Great stay also good area right by the magic fountain Subway easy connection to city centre and all the other main attractions Also the airport shuttle bus stops very very close to hotel so there is no walking round a place you don t know looking for your hotel was very easy to get to 
327927,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, I stayed in the Junior Suite room with my girlfriend The room was simply amazing it had a great view a lot of space and a beautiful bathroom The staff was really nice and allowed us to check in earlier they also told us that we could have the drinks in the minibar of the room for free The location is perfect just 2 minutes away from the metro station and the magic fountains I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to everyone Tip Ask for a room on a high floor in order to have a nice view
327928,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Excellent choice for Australians visiting Barcelona choice of locations to suit business or leisure I stayed at Gran Via for convention centre however Rosellon Caspe Ayre Hotel more suitable for persons not familiar with Barcelona wanting to walk the sights , Well serviced hotel Excellent breakfast variety to suit international visitors For visitors not fluent in Catalan most staff have english conversation muy bien WiFi included in room
327929,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Wifi is weak, Great location right at plaza espanya with Metro access to everywhere Airport bus stops 2mins walk away The Juniour suite is large and got a beatiful good size bathroom Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again 
327930,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The facility is poor that not meet four star hotel standard There is no adapter to borrow from front desk no iron in the room u can borrow from reception though thus cannot iron clothes whenever u want to The quilt is just a piece of cloth not comfortable and keep us warm enough U have blanket in the closet though but not clean I think cause I feel itchy when it touched my skin Guess they didn t wash it frequently We found out our towel didn t be changed daily at day 3 we informed front desk then afterwards they changed it right away , The staff is very nice and cheerful The location is amazing 
327931,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, our room was at the front of the hotel it was lovely but you could hear the noise of the traffic and we were on floor 8, good choice at breakfast staff very helpfull
327932,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The best question in context of my stay would be Was the hotel value for money Unfortunately the answer is No From the beginning to the end I was disappointed I location was good due to connectivity to the other areas by public transport Bus stop Public transport Airport buses and Tourist buses were less than 2 mins away and Metro station was also close by But the good things ended here for me Wifi was sub standard no electric kettle in the room room was small and many more issues Would like to make a special mention of an episode I am from Dubai and hence needed an adapter to connect my chargers and other devices to the European Plug points I asked for them in the reception from my room s intercom Inspite of being tired after a 12 hrs flight and after paying hefty room charge I was told to come down to the reception to take it I went down and to my surprise I was given a box with some USB cables and other useless cables to choose from and when I complained about it they said its not available and gave me the address of a supermarket to buy the stuff This was a turnoff of me within minutes of entry to the hotel This is just one of the several disappointing incidents that took place In short I would like to say Highly overpriced minimal facilities no room service and arrogant staff I would have got better hotels at better locations at better price ,No Positive
327933,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No adress on card holder of hotel got lost 1st day after getting off metro on return to hotel Stress to visitors on leaving reception importance of knowing adress of hotel, Very comfortable bed no noise staff very friendly
327934,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The A C in our room kept leaking even after they tried to fix it but they gave us another room after , Breakfast options were good and one member of staff made the best San Francisco I ve ever had 
327935,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The air conditioning was weak and the location is a long way from the action in Placa de Catalunya , Our room was clean quiet and comfortable It had public transport options nearby 
327936,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Air conditioning was not very cold and had to wedge a a 2p coin wear the window closes to block out the noise , Beds comfy but we did stay in the junior sweet Clean and tidy with friendly staff
327937,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Room cleaning was not good Bed linen wasn t change for two nights until my wife complained at the reception , Helpsome personale and good facilities Near Tourist attractions and metro station Good breakfast 
327938,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Bed was a bit hard but still had a good night s sleep , Lovely breakfast had everything you could possibly think of Very helpful staff gave us a map and stored our luggage after our stay Great amenities generously replenished I would definitely stay at a hotel from this chain again 
327939,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, 1 The ventilation in bathroom is not good , 1 very good location located in the center of the city National Palace and Fountains are just besides 2 Breakfast is really good 3 There is a restaurant in the house 4 Friendly staff 5 Free documents printing 
327940,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Wifi was not great on first stay end of July as it dropped out all the time but this was much improved on our August stay Reception did say that they were looking to change their provider to improve on this Beds are comfortable good quality but a little bit hard even though we like firm beds Would be ideal if this hotel had a swimming pool , Excellent location easy walk from to Aerobus stop Metro and hoho buses Superb breakfast hard to beat this one Large quiet room 708 very good Good walk in shower with strong water pressure Helpful pleasant staff Easy walk to the shopping centre on playa d espanya good view from the top of the centre to Montjuic and good spot for a cocktail at sundown Magic Monjuic fountains very short walking distance and worth seeing 
327941,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Location is perfect close to fountains but walking distance to port beach and la ramblas etc If don t fancy walking ideal for metro tourist bus We used both and location was fantastic for this Lots of restaurants etc round about as well Airport bus only 5 mins and first stop Perfect for a tourist short stay in Barca 
327942,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, If I was to be picky I would say tea and coffee facilities would have been good , The location is excellent right next to Espanya Plaza and a main metro link station 
327943,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Room and sink size was smaller but that s not that big of a deal , They have a delicious express breakfast for 4 Euros that offers a sandwich juice and coffee or tea 
327944,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The tiles around the lower part of the shower need regrouting , The location is extremely good for transport everywhere Aerobus stop 2 mins away as is tourist bus stop and metro Very close to Sant Montjuc attractions fountains museum and Spanish village and Olympic stadium 15 min walk to Gothic quarter The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly Nothing was too much trouble for them You can buy sightseeing bus tickets from them andvthey will suggest places to visit They will also keep your cases for you as well in a secure room after checkout Housekeeping is excellent Linen good quality We had a meal in the restaurant which was good quality and well priced Between 5 8pm with every drink you get a tapas dish taster Rooms fair size and very large bed which was comfy Bathroom was large with a good shower Blackout blinds in room and no noise Maid service every day Variety of bars and restaurants nearby from pizza to sushi as well as local bars 
327945,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The location is a little bit off it s only 10 15 mins away from Plaza de Catalunia and Las Ramblas but it s still a metro bus ride the room was clean but pretty outdated super small TV old towels no way to set the lights in a desired way all ON or all OFF mode and no pool, Right next to the Plaza de Espana the hotel was clean and nice service was good and price was fair
327946,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, There weren t anything in refrigerator There weren t any tea maker in room, The receptionists were so polite and helpful The lobby is big but it can be more luxury than current situation
327947,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The location was ideal and it was a pleasant place to stay The breakfast was lavish and the staff was very helpful However the pillows were most uncomfortable and the quilt was not clean We got free water for the first day however the staff did not exchange the sparkling water bottles for still water even upon our request Otherwise the location makes it an ideal place to stay 
327948,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, What we thought was missing is a proper ventilation for the bathroom and maybe some curtains not for the sun but for using it at night so not everyone can see what are you doing in the room The Wi Fi is weak but works Don t expect high speed Internet , The bed was very comfortable and the food tasty We opted for the 4 breakfast and was more than enough The location is perfect The airport bus leaves you right beside the hotel 2min walk and the access to other types of transportation very easy 
327949,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No complimentary bath sponge after the first night , Excellent buffet breakfast good location helpful friendly staff nice room No problems with WiFi 
327950,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Excellent location due to its closeness to the Espangana Square which connects to many places of interest using the local bus service the Metro the tourist bus The hotel itself is modern clean has great amenities 
327951,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Nothing , Perfect location Very clean Metro 200 meters walking with alot of line s in placa espanya You can get from the airport by line 9 to to fire Europe metro station and from there line1 red line to placa espanya We didn t take breakfast We had breakfast outside all the time 10 meters away supermarket thats open 24 hours Great WiFi Helpful staff Very comfortable beds and quiet Good bakery near the hotel 250 m away with the best coffee in Barcelona Audry s bakery Very close to poble espanyol village The staff helped up to choose very nice flamenco show They have a late check out option 2 hours for free till 14 00 Bottom line i would come back again Thank you 
327952,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The curtains were see through There were lights on outside all night long which made it very difficult to sleep Even though overall good experience the curtains are a deal breaker ,No Positive
327953,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No pool , The staff is nice and helpful Location is good Pretty clean Basically you can get what you expect from a nice clean quite professional 4 start hotel 
327954,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The breakfast buffet is huge Full of options for anything you would like to eat Fabulous place to stay for any American s who have not traveled around Spain much This place was the most Americanized location we stayed in Wider spaces and a large shower Noticed the hotel parking is immediately adjacent to the hotel although we did not make use of it Rooms are incredibly quiet even thought we had a window facing the very busy main thoroughfare through the city Great location for walking to Olympic areas and not terribly far for a walk to the Ramblas the beach the zoo Everything touristy that Barcelona has to offer Staff if suuuuper friends and helpful 
327955,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Rooms don t have black outs and the curtains are fairly sea through , Great location right beside the Aero Bus to the airport but very central in the city 
327956,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Many construction defects in the room the bathroom looks pretty shabby but clean , Very good breakfast buffet for a reasonable price Large and quiet room Large bathroom with large shower Extremely helpful staff Suited 100m to the Metro line and to the Aerobus line Free and fast WiFi All in all recommended 
327957,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The room was rather basic as for a 4 star hotel , Location is very convenient to explore the Montju c area including the Magic Fountain and the Olympic stadium Otherwise it is a bit far from the center and takes at least 20 minutes public transport ride 
327958,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The location of Placa Espana is further from the old city center than we expected In the heat of the summer it was not ideal to walk in out of the center every day However you could certainly take a cab for maybe 6 euros or the bus we just prefer to walk Not many great restaurants nearby as well everything was at least 15 min walk away if not more The internet was absolutely TERRIBLE This was probably our biggest complaint as my boyfriend was supposed to be able to work for an hour or so each night The wifi continually made you log in every time you left the room and it cut out frequently , The bed was VERY comfortable and the blackout shades were perfect for us after 2 weeks of traveling it was nice to be able to sleep in more than usual The room was very well kept and clean Hotel felt secure and always had security guard at the door at night 
327959,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, This hotel was adjacent to both the train station for montserrat AND the airport bus which was super convenient The property is really nice complete with the blackout shutters Breakfast is fantastic Plus a really great shower and bathroom 
327960,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Lovely hotel just like in the pictures Excellent breakfast Rooms lovely spotlessly clean Nice toiletries and complimentary water in the fridge on arrival Excellent staff Near to bus stop and metro
327961,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Location for our interests Beds could be more comfortable , Breakfast buffet is great Although I was not specially impressed by the location because I would have preferred to be more nearby Paseo de Gracia area it is not bad It is right by Montjuic and the Pueblo Espa ol which is an amazing place to visit Also there is a very large mall very nearby 
327962,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Full buffet breakfast at 13 expensive but quick breakfast at bar for 4 good value for money and more than sufficient Error on booking com details there is no rooftop pool
327963,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Room looked nothing like the photos decor was out of date old brown orange retro two single beds prepared instead of requested double had to re enter code for wifi every hour or so , Great breakfast
327964,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, My husband and I had a wonderful stay the staff were lovely and the facilities were first rate We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet it offered enormous choice and excellent quality In addition I would also like to thank the hotel staff for facilitating our trip to Sagrada Familia we had not booked in advance so did not manage to get in to the basilica at the beginning of our holiday We subsequently discovered that the hotel could help and needed two days notice to book us on a tour The service was brilliant and enabled us to go to the fabulous church on our last day I really can t recommend this hotel enough My husband and I are already planning a return trip to Barcelona and can t wait to stay there again 
327965,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Breakfast was quite poor nescafe and nespresso should not be served in 4 Star Hotel my poached eggs were microwaved, staff were friendly hotel was clean 
327966,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Nothing major , Great location with easy access to public transport polite and friendly staff Nice house cleaning service and luggage storage facilities after check out Overall we enjoyed our stay 
327967,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Breakfast was OK but not great at Euros 13 p p Frosted bathroom sliding door does not shut completely Might be an issue for some Door faces hallway and not rest of bedroom thus still privacy Cannot be locked Only Spanish TV channels , Needed two rooms for one night stay with two teens prior to return flight to USA 15 min drive by taxi to airport Perfectly adequate for our purpose Rooms facing courtyard are very quiet and light We stayed at more central location for sightseeing two weeks prior but this location can work if necessary due to subway bus access Many restaurant options in ten min walking distance Several small supermarkets within 5 min walk Nice views from Las Arenas shopping mall nice fountain display at night Thurs Sun nights Perfectly adequate for budget hotel Draws Span business as well as international budget travelers Very clean Residential neighborhoods are multi cultural working class 
327968,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Perfect hotel friendly staff Amazing breakfast with quality food local ingredients like Iberico sausage serrano ham manchego cheese and drinks Nespresso coffee at breakfast was a nice surprise The rooms were clean and well equiped Placa Espanya basicly 1 min away from where you can get to almost every tourist attraction in 10 20 mins 
327969,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I didn t like how the windows are organized Some of the rooms have a view inside the building aka view on other appartments organized in square My window was also small and kinda blue with a view on noisy streat , If you would like to find perfect location in Barcelona this is the hotel you need to stay at Walking distance to the metro and train station Direct shuttle to the airport Fountains are just 3 min walk The room was clean and stuff was friendly 
327970,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The beds weren t great A bit bouncy and you can t move without waking your other half up , This hotel was virtually flawless The rooms are excellent The staff are lovely and friendly and helpful Breafast was perfect The blackout blind was a very welcome addition 
327971,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I was tricked on the bill as I had paid for everything up front including breakfast and then was charged extra for breakfasts at the end Also the hotel organized a friendly taxi driver for me who charged me EUR 34 to the airport Per other reviews the normal rate should be about EUR 20, The location was very good
327972,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Confortable big rooms nice and clean city hotel good value for money Good neiborhood close to Arena shopping mall You need taxi to the center but taxis are more than affordable 
327973,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Staff talking to themselves in Spanish at the reception desks and not focusing on the gust as they should , Good hotel beautiful room excellent breakfast
327974,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I requested for an extra power plug the reception office to buy it from the store next door In late May the temperature I had to remind daily to on the Aircon ,No Positive
327975,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Most rooms where too noisy or too dark We asked to be changed 3 times Because of Sant Juan apparently we were charged 200 per night which was outrageous for the quality This hotel is quite far from town centre and extremely noisy overall given proximity of massive roads The staff was incompetent to say the least and not really helpful Some didn t even speak any foreign language Finally the breakfast quality was below average quantity was okay , Liked the car park That was meant to be 17 per day but they didn t charge not too sure if that was an oversight from them or just normal Proximity of airport about 20 minutes drive 
327976,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Location room size breakfast staff all were perfect We were very happy with our stay at the Ayre Gran Via We spent three wonderful days exploring Barcelona 
327977,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, You can hear traffic through night but just ask for room off front , Very clean hotel with a excellent breakfast Aerobus from airport took 15 minutes with the bus stop 150 yards from the hotel Les Rambla 30 minute walk or metro stop 150 yards from hotel plenty of bars restaurants nearby 
327978,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Relatively expensive hotel Room functional but not large or luxurious Currently questioning my bill for meals which according to their invoice is incorrect , Excellent transport connections enabling you to access all parts of Barcelona beyond 
327979,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No complaints the hotel was first class and location was excellent , The room was excellent on both occasions but the higher floor on the first visit was exceptional due to the added views over the MNAC and surrounding areas
327980,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The mattress was hard and the pillows were really REALLY hard so we both had creaked necks and sore shoulders back , We stayed for Sonar festival so the location was excellent It also meant we mainly slept during the day and the hotel was lovely and quiet 
327981,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The breakfast should be included in the fare of the bedroom , The room was clean and comfortable with a big bathroom The hotel is very modern and extremely close to the Metro Airport Bus and Hop on Hop Off bus stop 
327982,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Maybe a couple more English Chanels on TV , The Central Location and the friendly staff Easy access to various modes of travel and great selection of Restaurants just steps away 
327983,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The room was sparse with limited storage space for clothing so we lived out of the suitcase A shelf in the bathroom for toiletries would also be helpful , Location was great We had easy access to all transportation that included the Metro busses and the hop on hop off bus Hotel was clean and comfortable Staff were very helpful and spoke English The location also gave us access to local restaurants Every morning we walked for local coffee and pastries I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona 
327984,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Eggs somehow did not work for me scrambled tasted burned and the boiled eggs remained liquid even after 7 minutes , Room was excellent bed shower bath 
327985,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Ordered a Bar meal not up to their usual standard Ordered patatas bravas along with a few drinks and coffee The patatas bravas was just potato wedges out of a packet with poor quality sauce Very disapointing , Great location quiet room 
327986,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The staff are very friendly and helpful We travelled me and my brother for the first time to Barcelona we felt at home I recommend this hotel for sure It s location is center with all around facilities 
327987,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Great location right at plaza espanya Metro link to everywhere The airport bus stops 2mins walk away Breakfast great everything you could need Buffet for cereal etc but hot food ordered and served to you fresh Rooms large and comfortable just missed having tea coffee facilities Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again 
327988,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The lounge area could have had more comfortable seating , The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the location excellent been so close to the Espanya underground station and the Arena 
327989,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Great location great staff Very clean and comfortable rooms and super close to a main metro line Room service was brilliant Their bar served very yummy cocktails Sangria was fantastic 
327990,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I can t think of anything negative to say , It was a celebration of my 60th birthday with my family On arrival we were promptly allocated our rooms My daughters had arranged for a bottle of bubbly in the room olives and nibbles were given as extras The room was very clean and modern with plenty of cupboard space The bed was large and comfy and we all found the rooms very quiet with no noise heard from corridors or other rooms at all We paid extra to have the breakfast and couldn t have been more pleased There was a large selection of food and we were more than happy with it It also helped that breakfast was served until 11am as we had a couple of late evenings The metro was just around the corner and the reception staff were more than happy to book taxis if needed they were also easy to hail from outside the hotel 
327991,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I think that having one master light switch is not a good idea as sometimes all we wanted on was one light also having a massive table light on the table took up far to much room , The beds were wider than normal which made for a more comfortable sleep Also it was a good idea to fit mock wooden flooring which stops the scraping of chairs 
327992,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Have to travel 20 25 minutes to the very center of Barcelona la Rambla , Situated near the Spanish square with good transport routes Clean and comfortable with friendly staff
327993,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Very minor thing but the windows were needing a clean The hotel is situated on a busy road so dirt has to be expected and for all I know the window cleaners may have been scheduled for the next day , The size of the junior suite was great and worth paying extra for The bathroom was very luxurious 
327994,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, nothing, the hotel was SO quiet for its location we were on the 8th floor which helped but brilliant and the black out blind was also a good addition as this aided sleep the hotel also had carpeted hallways and very quiet closing doors the staff were very friendly and helpful very convenient for local shops restaurants cinema
327995,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The blow dryer cannot be moved as it is affixed to the wall Also it keeps shutting off when it gets hot so it takes a long time to dry longer hair It was a minor inconvenience though , The staff went over and above my expectations especially when I got sick For example they gave me the contents of their first aid kit to treat a burn I had before I arrived When I ended up with a stomach ailment they gave me extra water and more bottled water The room itself was spacious with an amazing bathroom The bed was very comfortable Even though the hotel is not close to the center of the city it is close to many stores restaurants and some land marks I appreciated the fact that the hotel was close to the Arenas where there s a food court and a grocery store Also the airport bus stops a block from the hotel 
327996,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Limited dinner menu not much choice, Comfortable clean room light and airy huge bathroom Secure parking site Excellent gluten free breakfast items available the bread was superb 
327997,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The bed isn t very comfy The mattress is hard and the pillows are foam There also isn t a kettle though there is complimentary water , The location is great and the breakfast is amazing Clean and modern business hotel Close to Sants so airport transfer is easy very friendly staff Fantastic black out blinds and very quiet 
327998,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, More an issue with booking com Obviously a preference for a double bed does mean anything as we had to contend with two single beds The hotel said they would switch rooms the following day which they didn t So in the end we did unpack for the time we were there The wifi dropped off all the time and was a headache at best , Friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at the hotel 
327999,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, I wished the hotel provide a kettle and some tea bags or coffee, I did not have breakfast But I ordered tea to be brought to my room The service was quick and friendly 
328000,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The only thing that bothers me was the WIFI internet It was too slow in the room which somethings made me go stay in the lobby for couple of hours , I liked the staff the variety of food in the breakfast the location since you have everything near by you
328001,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, There is no lobby hotel feels like an appartment block There is a smell of bleech everywhere The staff is rude and not welcoming I did not pay for breakfast in advance this displeased the breakfast usherer The second morning i did not want any breakfast and asked for a cup of coffee I could not get one as the bar did not open until 8am it was 7 45 am There was absolutely no chance of having a cup of coffee without having a full bteakfast that i did not want Absolutely astonishing , The location of the hotel rught next to Plaza L Espanya is excellent The hotel is simple and minimalistic 
328002,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The room was quite small and had very little natural light As the room was overlooked we had to have the blackout blind closed The lights in the room didn t allow for an ambient light the light controls either turned all the lights on which included bright tubes above your head as you lay in bed or just a cold reading It would be nice just to have the lamp on Generally the hotel had a dark feel due to extensive use of stylish but dark stone tiles , Excellent location modern interior comfy bed and good shower The restaurant and bar looked nice but we didn t use them 
328003,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The location is conveniently right near a metro station but generally the hotel is a bit far from all of the major attractions and so we spent a lot of time taking the metro from one place to the next , The rooms were immaculate The blackout blinds were incredible Had one of the best sleeps of my life 
328004,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Swimming pool outside sun area, Location very modern had room on seventh floor over looking courtyard very quiet Good lifts Nice coffee shop serving fresh light breakfast as alternative to hotel across Street 
328005,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Breakfast I was expecting more vegetables tomatoes cucumbers peppers several varieties of tea green tea , Accomodation and place I feel very comfortable and relaxing For the exhibition purposes it is the perfect location 
328006,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The bed was excellent and also the staff were really helpful Our light wasn t working in the room and the receptionist came up with us and sorted out very efficient 
328007,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The breakfast was really good enjoyed it just on the last morning The Juniorsuite I booked was bigger than it seems on the pictures Staff is excellent if you want know where to go out for dinner just ask and they know really great places I never saw our lady from roomservice but also she deserve a big Gracias I just can say see you soon Same place different time 
328008,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Bar closes at 11pm Watch out for taxi prices from airport Our party used 3 taxis which went the same route but were charged 25 35 45 not good, Friendly helpful staff clean and modern
328009,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, wi fi was not good needed logging in and out all the time it seemed We had also asked about getting a cab to airport and told no problem Then it turned out there was a problem a big event closing off nearby streets to cabs This event cannot have escaped their notice and the hotel made no effort to make arrangements with cabs for access nor to let us know even though we had asked about this matter in advance Left a sour taste , Bed comfortable and room clean Functional but a very clinical atmosphere 
328010,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No tea making facilities which i would have expected Internet and TV very poor reception Room not made up on one of the days Prices were fair but had to book an extra night and this was very expensive for this standard of hotel , Good location for access to the city Very friendly and helpful staff 
328011,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, the lights were really temperamental in the room we would put the key in the light slot about 5 times before it would work each time , Really excellent location and breakfast choices
328012,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, It was quite warm inside the room and if you left the window open the noise from outside would be a bit annoying but on the plus side there were blackout blinds which kept the light out plus there was a fan AC to help cool the room There was no iron in the room and the TV only had Spanish channels , Location was excellent Aerobus shuttle from airport stopped 50 yards up the road and the Espanya metro station was 200 yards away La Ramblas and Nou Camp are only 2 4 stops away so the journey time to those places is only a few mins Port Olympic is only a 10euro taxi fare away Staff were very helpful and spoke excellent English They were happy to deal with any requests Room was very nice and very clean Minibar was free There s also a 24 hour shop next door 
328013,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, There was a confusion when we entered the breakfast room on day 3 of our staying We mentioned our room number but the staff was saying that we have to sign a paper We don t like that , Location was perfect breakfast was very nice during our 3 nights of stays choices of tours were various and the receptionist was very helpful 
328014,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, it was the holiday weekend over Easter so a little more traffic than usual but that can t be helped , comfortable bed and very clean room Bed was made up fresh everyday Lots of little extras in the room Great sized room mini suite Very friendly staff who made us feel welcome from the minute we entered the hotel range of food was excellent and they would also cook something different for you if there was nothing in the buffet for you to eat excellent base to get to all parts of Barcelona either by foot bus or train tourist bus is a good way to see the city stops a couple of hundred metres away from the hotel 
328015,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Where do I begin I wanted an hotel which was near to the city la ramblas This hotel stated it was only a few KM away but I found out that wasn t exactly the truth Each time I had to pay for the taxi atleast 30 euros in total to get to the city Instead if I knew it was that far I would ve paid extra for a hotel nearby which would ve ended up the same amount Also the beds were horrible to sleep on I have no words I had the worst 2 nights ever So squeaky and hard I found the bedding hadn t been washed for the second night We travelled as a family of 3 so I requested a cot for my 5 month old I was appalled The cot was half broken For the price I think it s a rip off Far from city Rude staff Very late room service arrival No kettle in room to make my baby s milk Each time I had to pay to get water boiled Overall I wouldn t recommend or come here again Total waste of money , Absolutely nothing 
328016,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The breakfast was fantastic Lots of selection for whatever you wanted including decent North American breakfast food selection Hotel staff was friendly and helpful Room was clean and quiet despite the windows facing a busy street with bus stops right outside Great close walk to the subway station 
328017,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Eh Em Nothing , The bed was super snug It had a mattress liner cover that made it like a glove The shower was huge temperate adjustable to perfection Plus robes in room Great touch 
328018,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The wifi was basically unusable when the hotel is crowded the wifi infrastructure is not enough , The room was perfect and really clean also the position is really good for tourism trips
328019,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and never had any problem with answering queries about Barcelona and getting around etc The location of the hotel was excellent right next to the metro which made it really quick to get around Barcelona and see everything with ease which was excellent as this was our first time in Barcelona They even stored our bags for us after check out until our flight home which made life easier on our final day Would definitely recommend staying here 
328020,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, horrible food room service i had the burger housekeeping department only made the bed the second day but didn t clean the room moreover the housekeeper entered the room in the morning while we put the DND sign on the door and she did not even knock at door before entering pillows and materess are a way too hard , nice buffet breakfast 
328021,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Can t think of anything, Great location close to Pla a Espanya and 1st Stop on Aerobus from airport Also excellent for all public transport Good base to explore from Plenty of bars and restaurants near by and about 25 min walk to Camp Nou Breakfast 13 is very good value Wide selection of hot and cold buffet style service Something for everyone s taste Rooms good standard comfortable bed everything was very clean No bath but huge walk in shower Although it s close to main road you didn t notice it Staff very helpful free WiFi through out 
328022,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, A minor complaint When I went down for breakfast on my last morning I was advised that breakfast was not included in the pre paid price for the hotel I requested breakfast when I checked in and was informed that I could pay when I check out The receptionist validated my credit card therefore I was somewhat suprised to be told that I had not paid for breakfast when I had already agreed to pay when I check out The young man was very polite and was quite sensitive in handling this situation Perhaps the information had not been made available to him The hotel might need to review the procedure for this scenario to prevent possible embarrassment for guests This did not spoil my stay and I would happily recommend this hotel , The member of staff on duty at reception was very helpful and spoke excellent English This set the tone for my stay in the hotel The room was cleaned daily and staff were very approachable 
328023,Ayre Hotel Gran V a,No Negative, The location was excellent right next to the metro and the aerobus stop from to the airport It was our anniversary and the hotel staff sent us complimentary chocolates to our room which was a lovely gesture Great 4 night stay we will return when we re back in Barcelona 
328024,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Odd wardrobe door set up , Really quiet once in the room ask for one that looks inwards The perfect location if you like to walk or take the metro it is just a 2 minute walk away 
328025,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Room refurbished drilling noise with only one room between my room worst on first day afternoon was offered another room but declined as I was gone in daytime no noise in evening , Excellent breakfast good location friendly staff

328027,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, A kettle in the room would have been great , Friendly staff especially Maria good breakfast excellent location The bed was v comfortable Maria was v helpful and so lovely 
328028,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, No duvets We had to request one but they gave us that one without duvet cover It was disgusting to use it as we were not sure if the duvet had been cleaned or not , Location is great Close to metro station and the airport shuttle bus stop is just few minutes walk from the hotel 
328029,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Not a lot going on in hotel small bar and restaurant didnt seem busy , The staff were very nice and friendly 1st room we were shown to was at front of hotel and there was a lot of traffic noise we were given a room looking out into centre of hotel which was really quiet although had no view Close to placa espanya metro station and Arena shopping center with variety of restaurants on top floor lovely ensuite with great shower
328030,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, On day 1 the pillow had blood on it the second day the new pillow had more blood on it I assumed the sort of hotel that has blooded pillows wouldn t be the sort of hotel to respond to criticism so kindly So I didn t use the pillows,No Positive
328031,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, slow Internet connection different password for each device no single sign on the curtains and bed sheets are cheap inconsistent with a 4 stars standards , Very good location 100 m to Placa Catalunya 2 to the subway 3 to the airport bus 7 to Magic Fountain and Museum of Art It s a basic 4 stars business hotel clean modern design standard furniture average size of the room Excellent staff both skills and attitude always ready to provide support they even prepared a nice surprise for our anniversary thank you Very good breakfast diversity of products

328036,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Rooms are very small breakfast could be a better selection , the staff was very helpful with any questions we had We had to leave a day earlier but didn t need to pay the full stay Cava for breakfast was great
328037,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Location is far if touring the city for leisure Ok if you are there for a conference close to the hotel Otherwise its 30mins walk to la Ramblas , Staff was great

328042,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Beds are very hard and the sound insulation between rooms is not great we had a disturbed first night due to noise next door to our room, Very convenient for the metro and the Aerobus to and from the airport hotel staff were very polite and courteous 
328043,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The water didn t flow away in the shower , The location was excellent Modern hotel with good facilities Good service and nice view on the place Espanya on the 7th floor

328049,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, The 2nd stay the room was smaller and the bed uncomfortable even though the same price of the 1st stay At breakfast in the restaurant the hot food needed to be replenished but my request was ignored Finally eluctantly some bacon and eggs were prepared although a staff member told us that there had been some bacon left 2 rashers , close to Barcelona Sants station so stayed one night at the beginning of the holiday and one night at the end The bar staff were pleasant the tapas very good and the bar quick breakfast option was useful The first room we had was clean and comfortable R ception staff helpful 
328050,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, As it is becoming trendy there is a glass bathroom door which means that when the light in the bathroom is on then the whole room gets illuminated This is very disturbing when sleeping The room was too warm and we had to sleep with air conditioning in the middle of January The hotel does not respect its own policy on saving water and therefore the environment even though our towels were always hung on the towel rack they were changed every day The water in the shower became very cold for 2 seconds and then very warm for 2 seconds more and then ok for a short while until the process started again , Nice hotel nicely located next to Pl Espanya with metro and bus Very quiet room facing an inner yard This was good because the hotel is on a very busy street Nice breakfast

328054,Ayre Hotel Gran V a, Not really, You have to take a coach downtown from the airport The hotel is 5 minutes walk to the final stop of the coach So it s easy for you again to take the coach to the airport Good location Exterior look impressed me at first sight that night Sapcious room Very comfortable Definitely recommendable
