0,Hotel Arena, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer , Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
1,Hotel Arena,No Negative, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam 
2,Hotel Arena, Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge , Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back 
3,Hotel Arena, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep , Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character 
4,Hotel Arena, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again , Amazing location and building Romantic setting 
5,Hotel Arena, Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars , Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs 
6,Hotel Arena, Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it , The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park 
7,Hotel Arena, Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good, Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast 
8,Hotel Arena, Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time,No Positive
9,Hotel Arena, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night , The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling 
10,Hotel Arena, Nothing all great , Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too 
11,Hotel Arena, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 , Style location rooms
12,Hotel Arena, The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast , Comfy bed good location 
13,Hotel Arena,No Negative, This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return 
14,Hotel Arena, The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him , It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it 
15,Hotel Arena,No Negative, This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good 
16,Hotel Arena, Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse, Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic 
17,Hotel Arena, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment , We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland 
18,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues 
19,Hotel Arena, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely , I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee 
20,Hotel Arena, Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit , Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area 
21,Hotel Arena, Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery , The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location 
22,Hotel Arena, Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing , The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable 
23,Hotel Arena, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner , Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly 
24,Hotel Arena, Nothing , Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning 
25,Hotel Arena, The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv , Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m
26,Hotel Arena, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all , The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around 
27,Hotel Arena, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you , Great hotel original concept style
28,Hotel Arena, We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom , The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits 
29,Hotel Arena, There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical , The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel 
30,Hotel Arena, Little bit on the pricey side, The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning 
31,Hotel Arena, Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective , Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern 
32,Hotel Arena, Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,No Positive
33,Hotel Arena, Please see above, The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible 
34,Hotel Arena, The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two , The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing
35,Hotel Arena, Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality , Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great 
36,Hotel Arena, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park
37,Hotel Arena, The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more , Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed 
38,Hotel Arena, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam
39,Hotel Arena, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet , Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good 
40,Hotel Arena, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy , The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything 
41,Hotel Arena, Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate , Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous 
42,Hotel Arena, Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again , Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk 
43,Hotel Arena, Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that , Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back
44,Hotel Arena, The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning , The brunch to purchase in the morning was good 
45,Hotel Arena, Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either , The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people 
46,Hotel Arena, The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else , Massive bed
47,Hotel Arena, The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups , The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in 
48,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone 
49,Hotel Arena, Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here, clean and new
50,Hotel Arena, The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam , My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night 
51,Hotel Arena, When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all , The location and views 
52,Hotel Arena, I loved everything , The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
53,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly
54,Hotel Arena, when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction, good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction
55,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend 
56,Hotel Arena, there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night , location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed 
57,Hotel Arena, Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task , Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly 
58,Hotel Arena, The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference , The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really 
59,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me 
60,Hotel Arena, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management , The property is beautiful
61,Hotel Arena, The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor , Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up
62,Hotel Arena, Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again , I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed 
63,Hotel Arena, Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room , Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room
64,Hotel Arena, The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe , The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard 
65,Hotel Arena, Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation , Great trip staff very friendly
66,Hotel Arena, Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip , Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely
67,Hotel Arena, Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived , To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing 
68,Hotel Arena, The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass , Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central 
69,Hotel Arena, Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone , The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already
70,Hotel Arena, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price , The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place 
71,Hotel Arena, Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra , The young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful Dinner has been cooked excellent 
72,Hotel Arena, The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive , The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well 
73,Hotel Arena, upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside , breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added 
74,Hotel Arena, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast , Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed
75,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again 
76,Hotel Arena, The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction , The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee 
77,Hotel Arena, Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors , Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed 
78,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning 
79,Hotel Arena,No Negative, We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous 
80,Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money , The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel 
81,Hotel Arena, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy , Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room 
82,Hotel Arena, The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel , We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc 
83,Hotel Arena, Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful , The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location 
84,Hotel Arena, The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy , The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel
85,Hotel Arena, Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss, Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer
86,Hotel Arena, That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel , The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous 
87,Hotel Arena, Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait , Pretty building interesting rooms 
88,Hotel Arena, No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up , Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences 
89,Hotel Arena, We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain , rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky
90,Hotel Arena, Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done , Large bed 
91,Hotel Arena, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere , It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished 
92,Hotel Arena, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair , Good location Cheap 
93,Hotel Arena, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms, Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion 
94,Hotel Arena, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas , Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast 
95,Hotel Arena, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate , Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center 
96,Hotel Arena,No Negative, We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds 
97,Hotel Arena, Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout , A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding 
98,Hotel Arena, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,No Positive
99,Hotel Arena, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing , beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different
100,Hotel Arena, Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud, Location
101,Hotel Arena, Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought, Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll 
102,Hotel Arena, There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant , The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven 
103,Hotel Arena, it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot , super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location I love amsterdam 
104,Hotel Arena, Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle , Staff were brilliant Really helpful attentive and friendly Amazing building with lots of history too 
105,Hotel Arena, Construction during the day though not intrusive, Great Customer Service Staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and Metro passes 
106,Hotel Arena, The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined , The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from 
107,Hotel Arena, No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance, Good water pressure in shower
108,Hotel Arena, There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place , The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind 
109,Hotel Arena, The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious , We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub 
110,Hotel Arena, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view, Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful
111,Hotel Arena, Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant , Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots 
112,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level 
113,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night 
114,Hotel Arena,No Negative, This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel 
115,Hotel Arena, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel , Very friendly staff lovely comfy room
116,Hotel Arena, I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 , food recommendations were brilliant
117,Hotel Arena, The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done , The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience 
118,Hotel Arena, the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware , Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice
119,Hotel Arena, The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough , The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine 
120,Hotel Arena, Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend , Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help 
121,Hotel Arena, The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,No Positive
122,Hotel Arena, The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small , Well located if you don t mind taking the train 
123,Hotel Arena, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam 
124,Hotel Arena, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central, Liked the staff The location
125,Hotel Arena, Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression , Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport 
126,Hotel Arena, We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick , Room was a great size and comfy bed
127,Hotel Arena, We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back , The staff were lovely and very helpful Bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links 
128,Hotel Arena, The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim , There was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent The snacks in the restaurant were also very good The staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful The bed was comfy 
129,Hotel Arena, We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on , Bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows We stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice Reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful 
130,Hotel Arena, Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space, Very helpful and friendly staff Free WiFi Location and proximity to public transport Provision of iron and board 2 televisions
131,Hotel Arena, There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night , The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside 
132,Hotel Arena, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished , Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history 
133,Hotel Arena, First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all , Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park
134,Hotel Arena, Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms ,No Positive
135,Hotel Arena, the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor , The friendly staff in bar restaurant The evening meal was excellent A pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful After the building renovations I think this hotel will be fabulous It has so much history and is so unusual Loved it 
136,Hotel Arena, The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well , The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy 
137,Hotel Arena, There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work , Great room great staff great food 
138,Hotel Arena, Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower , Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast 
139,Hotel Arena, We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow , Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms
140,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know 
141,Hotel Arena, The fact I had to leave, The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful
142,Hotel Arena, The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished , Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice 
143,Hotel Arena, The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating , Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay 
144,Hotel Arena, Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive , Very comfortable bed and cool hotel
145,Hotel Arena, Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road , Hotel was very clean and staff helpful Very trendy and reasonably priced
146,Hotel Arena, We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,No Positive
147,Hotel Arena, The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper , The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase 
148,Hotel Arena, The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning , Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive 
149,Hotel Arena, There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major , The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine 
150,Hotel Arena, More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on , Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room 
151,Hotel Arena, When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste , The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle 
152,Hotel Arena, Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost , Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant 
153,Hotel Arena, Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night , Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower 
154,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room 
155,Hotel Arena, The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night , The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable 
156,Hotel Arena, Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly , Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed 
157,Hotel Arena, The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid , The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport 
158,Hotel Arena, I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel, The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle
159,Hotel Arena, the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise , Bed was nice 
160,Hotel Arena, Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained , Really nice building but lots of building work going off But only outside so not a problem Good size rooms fairly modern Good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram WiFi worked perfectly and quickly 
161,Hotel Arena, The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms, Loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly
162,Hotel Arena, The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking, 24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint
163,Hotel Arena, Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem , The staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms s good size Nice bathrooms Bar area very comfortable Complimentary drink a nice touch A little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around Plans for development look amazing Would like come back when completed 
164,Hotel Arena, Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired , Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you
165,Hotel Arena, Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through , The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk 
166,Hotel Arena, The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive , Great hotel and quiet university area Wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms The food is wonderful 
167,Hotel Arena, The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money , The bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our room for the money that we paid 
168,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive The room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
169,Hotel Arena, Nothing One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl ,No Positive
170,Hotel Arena, Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day , Our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows Very memorable The hotel is right next to a large nice park Staff was friendly 
171,Hotel Arena, The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu , The rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere Due to building work In progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture 
172,Hotel Arena, Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,No Positive
173,Hotel Arena, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking, The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible
174,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush 
175,Hotel Arena, The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards , Room service good quality staff
176,Hotel Arena, We didn t have a bad experience , We loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling 
177,Hotel Arena, Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue, Hotel was very modern and location was great Complimentary drinks was a really nice touch 
178,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend The hotel was perfect A short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel Perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy We really enjoyed our stay 
179,Hotel Arena, Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it , Staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish 
180,Hotel Arena, They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back, absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location
181,Hotel Arena, When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts , The bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my room Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a room by 2ish which was good 
182,Hotel Arena, Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting , The room was pleasant We liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses
183,Hotel Arena, The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom , Nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction 
184,Hotel Arena, The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp , The room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best I ve ever seen The staff is very kind I would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel 20 min to the center 
185,Hotel Arena, The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion , The room we upgraded to was very nice 
186,Hotel Arena, Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool, Location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again
187,Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel , Polite staff 
188,Hotel Arena, The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult , The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam 
189,Hotel Arena, the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again , nothing
190,Hotel Arena, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena, Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed
191,Hotel Arena, Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only , Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center 
192,Hotel Arena, Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful , The room was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend 
193,Hotel Arena, Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel, Very smart room good food 
194,Hotel Arena, No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine , Breakfast Staff
195,Hotel Arena, the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants , staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked 
196,Hotel Arena, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel , The hall
197,Hotel Arena, Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing , Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction 
198,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend 
199,Hotel Arena, Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please , Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar 
200,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena
201,Hotel Arena, Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive , Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff 
202,Hotel Arena, Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you ,No Positive
203,Hotel Arena, The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times , Good Wi fi 
204,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building 
205,Hotel Arena, At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked , The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received 
206,Hotel Arena, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc , Character of the hotel was great Location was good
207,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel 
208,Hotel Arena, The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future , The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great 
209,Hotel Arena, Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,No Positive
210,Hotel Arena, next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay, friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins
211,Hotel Arena,No Negative, This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly 
212,Hotel Arena, Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am , Great location lovely room
213,Hotel Arena, The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs , Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram 
214,Hotel Arena, The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift , Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms 
215,Hotel Arena,No Negative, It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus 
216,Hotel Arena, Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all , The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect 
217,Hotel Arena, No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping, Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction 
218,Hotel Arena, The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice , The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome 
219,Hotel Arena, We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice , We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows 
220,Hotel Arena,No Negative, I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable 
221,Hotel Arena, Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done, The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower
222,Hotel Arena,No Negative, Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town 
223,Hotel Arena,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights Hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes Hotel is situated in a quite area The rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy The staff is very nice and helpful
224,Hotel Arena, Theres nothing we was unhappy with, Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport
225,Hotel Arena,No Negative, The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home 
226,Hotel Arena, The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it , Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes 
227,Hotel Arena, Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets , Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food 
228,Hotel Arena, n a, This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible 
229,Hotel Arena,No Negative, We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa 
230,Hotel Arena, It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre , Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena
231,Hotel Arena, No bad experiences, Amazing rooms with beautiful view of river Food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon Staff are helpful and friendly 
232,Hotel Arena, floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating, staff good location suited us
233,Hotel Arena, The bathroom needed to be deep cleaned Tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps Loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating, Great historic buildig
234,Hotel Arena, There was a problem with the hairdryer in our room The hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror Just a minor detail really but a bit annoying , The hotel was great The rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly Our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean Drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive The hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes 
235,Hotel Arena, There were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times, How different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram access

237,Hotel Arena, The variety of the breakfast was not as good Empty marmalade coffee was more water , Was convenient because our friends live close by Furhthermore I liked the possibility of renting a bike on short notice And the interior was spectacular liked the modern twist 
238,Hotel Arena, Small room in 2 levels connected by a very narrow and small steps The room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc Very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window , The terrace lounge The building The location 
239,Hotel Arena, Our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night , The staff were very friendly and very helpful

243,Hotel Arena, A bit noisy You can hear a lot through the walls It s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done , Friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look There are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to Central and both go to the main tourist hub Oosterpark right on your door step
