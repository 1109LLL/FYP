21748,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, We ordered room service twice and each time the phone cut out We waited 45 minutes and nothing happened Eventually we went downstairs to be told the restaurant tried to call us but got no answer It would have been nice for someone to come to our door maybe and check what was going on , We stayed in a suite and the room set up was really cool It was a lovely relaxing break and a 15 minute walk from Eiffel Tower 
21749,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, We felt that breakfast should have been included in the price that we paid and also the room service menu was limited , We loved the location and staff particularly Jordi who attended to our every need He was very helpful and always had a smile 
21750,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, hotel pool should stay open later there is no staff there and it is in the basement so it does not bother anyone and should not bother anyone if they let it stay open an hour longer so guests can relax it closes at 10 but its hard to find a restaurant in paris that opens before 8 so it ended up always being do we eat or swim it would be really nice if it was open until 11 also the pool water was not warm enough , rooms very clean the staff was very nice I didn t like that when I got there the price was completely different than what booking com told me it would be it was considerably more to be fair the management agreed to charge me only what the booking com price was but I don t understand the initial discrepancy it is nice they give you cell phones for free to use while you are there 
21751,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Some of the rooms are small and bathroom functional but tiny On my recent visit the pool was closed this is often the case , The hotel is convenient for my office The staff are pleasant on arrival and in the restaurant The rooms are small but well furnished 
21752,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The croissants at breakfast weren t from the neighborhood bakery but same boring convenience pastries you ll get in most hotels , Great location on Place de Mexico close by to Trocadero and the Eiffel tower Good advise on local choice of restaurants from the front desk staff 
21753,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, I was extremely missing fried or boiled eggs on breakfast , Great hotel with excellent staff nice rooms tasty breakfast And the location is great of course 
21754,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, We forgot a bag Our own fault of course but they could have called us instead of waiting for us to contact them Then we wouldn t have to drive back three hours They did help afterwards though thank you , Beds were good swimming pool also 
21755,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Room temperature was above 28 degrees the residence does not enable Continental breakfast included means coffee juice bread and butter If you want slice of cheese then have to pay extra money The gown for visiting the swimming pool was not available the operating staff to requests unresponsive Pool so large that two people at the same time it is difficult to swim The invoice was included in the abstruse donations above me without agreement ,No Positive
21756,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Nothing, Location great Lots of lovely restaurants around and easy to jump on the hop on hop off bus Staff were so helpful as we left sunglasses in the room and they sent them onto us 
21757,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Not all the lights in our room worked and the sheets bed were made but not fresh everyday The staff were ok but a little grumpy and standoffish , The bed was very comfy and the breakfast was nice Great location 
21758,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel,No Negative, To the management and especially all the staff at this hotel I couldn t say thank you enough I was planning a romantic surprise trip to Paris to propose to my OH The staff on reception especially Thomas and Julien went beyond their dutys to ensure our trip was special On arrival we only had to wait 10 minutes for our room to be ready even though we were 2 hours earlier than the stated 3pm check in Check in was quick and without any problems and soon we were unpacked and ready for our few special days even if my heart was about to burst out of my chest with nerves for the proposal that evening On our way out Thomas and Julien pointed us in the right direction for all the main sights champs ET Arc De T Louve and also for gluten free resturants as my OH had special dietary requirements I proposed that evening after an amazing nightime cruise on the Seine and managed to photograph the proposal thanks again to the help of the staff at the hotel As a photographer I set up all my equipment to take a romantic couple shot something I always do on trips away with the Eiffel Tower in the background To the staff member on duty the night of the 23rd of April at 11 40pm I didnt get your name too nervous but thank you so much for your help Another example of helpful and friendly staff to make our trip memorable The next morning we were upgraded to room 615 and the view was absolutely stunning Our own personal view of the ET I will attach the photos The rooms were spotless and cosy We got a deluxe room and would highly recommend them The bathrooms were clean and while the rooms arent massive they were perfect for us so don t let that bother you We only got the breakfast once over our 3 days It wasnt included in the room price so we paid 30 each I have to say it is worth the price and the service was second to none We got cereal an omlette a fry fresh yoghurts fruits and breads juices teas and anything we wanted 
21759,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Room a little too small I had to store my suitcase under the sink breakfast was very poor also a continental breakfast for two basket of breads two yoghurts two orange juices and tea for two was 40 euros , Really friendly and helpful staff great location 15minute walk to Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomphe very quiet even though beside a road
21760,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Lift not working breakfast service slow but fantastic waiter presented complimentary wine in our room to apologise , Comfortable bed quiet room good shower and bath

21768,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The minibar is very expensive 8 euros for a cola Also the room cleaning isn t very good We didn t get clean towels one day and no more coffee although we had left 5 euros for the cleaning staff Also they reserve an amount of 300 euros extra on your creditcard for extras The wifi is very bad doesn t work in the evening I think because a lot of gueste are using it at night , Nice bed dark curtains so you don t wake up from the lights Nice staff We booked a classic room and thought it was with a bath But it wasn t This was a mistake of booking com so they gave us a upgrade to a deluxe room without paying extra Also the location was good Near the eifel tower and metro 
21769,Le Metropolitan a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, The rooms are toooo small and tight the toilet was in a separte location than the shower and sink which is completly strange and unpleasent The room price is way high than what it deserve , The location was perfect just near the center of the city
