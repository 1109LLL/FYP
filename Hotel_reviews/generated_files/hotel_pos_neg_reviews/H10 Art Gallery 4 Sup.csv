318744,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, We had standard room Window into light well Tiny room Surly reception staff on arrival Each time we dealt with this guy it was surliness incarnate Others on reception were much more helpful Overall not great value , Location was good Surrounded by cafes and longish walking distance to main areas of Barcelona Modern hotel with good bathroom and excellent shower very comfy beds 
318745,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Such a lovely place to stay The beautiful courtyard with the olive tree was lovely to relax in before dinnertime The mojitos were fab too Breakfast was gorgeous Shower was so big toiletries were a nice touch also Highly recommend
318746,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Soundproofing could be a little better we heard noise from the hall, Location was great Friendly staff Lovely room and amenities Bike rental was very easy
318747,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, A fresh coat of paint in the bedroom to clean it up a bit would have improved the look of the room , The bed and pillows very comfortable Great air con which was much needed Complimentary bottled water replaced daily Lovely outside area to relax and have a cocktail Helpful and friendly staff Very nice breakfast Close to metro and plenty of places to eat and drink in walking distance 
318748,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, What s not to like , The roof terrace is stunning they serve the best Pina Coladas Restaurant has yummy food and the bed is so very comfy I could have stayed here for much longer 
318749,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, instructions for the expresso machine would be good we are English , great location far enough away from the tourist areas to ensure good quality eateries bars on your doorstep Easy 20 min walk to Ramblas Great roof terrace with plunge pool 
318750,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent hotel the beds were super comfortable the room was amazing Lovely sized bathroom The fitness facilities and swimming pool were brilliant 
318751,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room was very small for two people it is the kind of single room you find in other hotel very small hard to move around small double bed , Perfumed air condition in the lobby
318752,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, No evening dining facility at the hotel however lots of restaurants within 5 mins walking distance, Very comfortable room bed is great balcony and really well designed loved the Art work in the foyer and on each themed floor
318753,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, More explanation about how to use the pool facilities would have helped Location of towels and bar facility for example, Room was good but bathroom and shower were superb
318754,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room is really too small even for a classic room I couldn t even open my luggages inside It s quite annoying , The bed is very confortable and everything is clean and well decorated The breakfast is just perfect you have many choices 
318755,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Everything was fine We loved our room 512 which overlooked the street I wouldn t have liked to have been at the back nor one if the central rooms that look into the central courtyard although these are cheaper and smaller It depends what you want and can afford We didn t have the top price room , It is very well situated you can walk to most tourist sites Staff were very very helpful especially Victor in the afternoon on the front desk and the two ladies in the morning The hotel s arty modernistic themes were great Nice outside courtyard in which to have your pre dinner drinks generous G Ts in typical Spanish form before going out to dine in one of the many excellent restaurants We loved the H10 Art Gallery We would stay again 
318756,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Thin wall means u can some times here the people next door, Location was excellent lovely clean traditional part of Barcelona and walking distance from the main shopping area like Zara Gucci also a really nice restaurant right next to hotel would definitely stay there again
318757,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Only fault was the outlook we had from our balcony everything else was perfect we would highly recommend this hotel, The staff here were so helpful friendly with a smile on their faces at all times
318758,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, We travelled to Barcelona for my partners birthday the hotel was excellent and the staff couldn t do enough for us Excellent location too Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone 
318759,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, A balcony would have been nice but we had the standard room which was still excellent, Everything about the hotel was excellent the staff were really helpful the food and cocktails were lovely if a little expensive nothing bad to say about it 
318760,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Room location facing an inner pier , I was in Barcelona for a convention and booked a regular room through booking com 7 nights Euro 220 per night without breakfast for one person and my tiny room faced an inner pier No window facing the outside world not possibility to know what the weather is like or see anything that is going on outside No way to open the curtains as the see through elevator was going down next to my room and there were other windows facing mine on all sides I think that a 4 star hotel must have all rooms facing the outside and if the room is not this needs to be written in the room description I thought Euro 220 per night without breakfast were enough and did not take the superior room which was an additional Euro 50 60 per night When I saw that my room is facing a pier I asked to change the room but they said they were fully booked I want to stress that the hotel is beautiful has a good location the room was clean and nice the bathroom big and comfortable there was a Nespresso coffee machine and 2 water bottles every day complementary from the hotel But in hindsight I personally would not have chosen this hotel with this view I find that depressing Sorry And the hotel MUST say in the room description that it faces an inner pier Period 
318761,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Walls between rooms are really thin you can hear everything what is going on in the neighboring rooms We were lucky to have quiet neighbors , We had wonderful terrace facing courtyard so it was were calm and quiet in the room Breakfasts were great very tasty and friendly serviced A lot of restaurants bars shops next to hotel 10 minutes walking to main streets 
318762,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The coffee made by night bar staff was pretty good but unfortunately at breakfast it was undrinkable if you ordered a cappuccino A tissue box is required in room The packets in amenities pack ran out quickly and weren t replaced , The bed was fantastically comfortable The art books and art made the place very much like our home which is similar The location and neibourhood were lovely
318763,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Room was very noisy We had a room on the inside of the hotel so we tought it would be a quiet room as we are light sleepers But we could hear the whole hotel flush their toilets during the night and rooms were not very well isolated , Neighborhood was more local but perfect for us Not too many tourists Nice restaurants on every corner You could still walk everywhere The staff was very helpful When we checked in we got a room with a big single bed were we would not fit in with two persons We asked for another room and got a room with a bigger bed The shower was fantastic and even got a small gift on arrival 
318764,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Fantastic service and very nice to be welcomed with an ice cold cava in the reception upon checkin Fantastic location with 10 minutes down to Placa de Catalunya La Rambla ad 2 minutes up to the extremely long shopping street Diagonal Lovely little garden where the afternoon drink could be enjoyed 
318765,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Wi fi ONLY works in the lobby Staff not very helpful unfortunately And they did not clear our room for the entire day the next day I had to ask for it They came but a quick 10 minute just tidy up I was very disappointed as the value for money was so bad Better to pay more and get a good value then ever staying here again I tried to explain to the staff in a nice way that they should work on improving as I also am in hospitality but no one was interested and very nonchalant , Not much to be honest Im sorry but no one was eager to do something about it either Im never the one who complaint and gets angry but told the staff many times about the cleaning that I wanted my room cleaned was done after the 4th call to the reception the day after So Im sorry really not worth the money 
318766,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, The extra touches made it really feel like a 4 hotel from the welcome drink cava on arrival to the Nespresso machine and biscuits in our room The staff were lovely and breakfast was brilliant the food was freshly made to our order every morning it was actually totally worth the 18 which surprised me The pool area was great and I can t wait to go again 
318767,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Room was a little small but had everything we needed All amenities in the room were excellent, Terrace bathroom was spacious and water pressure was excellent Bed was very comfortable
318768,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, They missed the cleaning one day but it that was a minor thing all in all it was great, The staff was very helpful and knew everything that I asked about
318769,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, we had no television for 24 hours as television was broke but was sorted first thing the next morning as we did not realise it was not work till really late , hotel was gorgeous staff and service was excellent i would defiantly return and recommend
318770,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Quality Price was overrated I paid a lot for the things that the hotel provides , Room was nice All details were keep on the right attitude I didn t miss anything Small details like cookies beside of the bed coffee machine in the room etc makes the difference 
318771,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The bed was uncomfortably small The room was really small and cramped And the hotel roomwas really warm , Location was good staff was pleasant and the breakfast was very good 
318772,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, The AC worked very well although had an automatic shut off temperature hold The balcony was nice to have and the decor was trendy and clean Selection of pillows to choose from In a location that is a little further from the main Catalonia Square where the bus to the airport goes but has a good selection of restaurants and shopping nearby 
318773,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Ability to make tea in the room Nice to have the coffee machine but would be nice to have the option of tea if you don t drink coffee , Welcome drink on checking in was a nice touch 
318774,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, d cor was slightly tired but this is me being very picky, Excellent hotel close enough to all the tourist attractions but yet far enough away to be quiet for a good nights sleep Lovely restaurants and bars in the area as well 
318775,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Loved staying in this hotel which was in a good location Great rooms we had 2 superior ones Everywhere was spotlessly clean Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble Breakfast was delicious A real bonus having the small rooftop pool area too just to chill out and sunbathe Would definitely stay here again 
318776,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Our bed was a standard double and we are used to a king size The breakfast was expensive , The room was brilliant everything in it was well thought out We asked for a kettle and they bought us a tray with mugs as well The staff were very helpful The breakfast was excellent 
318777,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, All staff brilliant apart fro two women staff who served breakfast the final morning more interested in chatting together, Helpful friendly staff spotlessly clean
318778,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Everything was absolutely perfect Super nice room very comfortable bed good cleaning We were in Barcelona to celebrate my girlfriends 30th birthday and when we got to our room the first evening there were a bottle of cava and a desert plate in the room That was a very nice gesture from the hotel Nothing could have been better 
318779,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Our room was a twin although we asked for a double as it was our honeymoon They put the beds together but still Rather expensive , Room was stunning Staff were friendly and professional Lots going on locally 
318780,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Room was quite small the bar could do with a TV or music , The roof top pool was great staff were friendly helpful our room and the whole hotel were very clean Perfect location 2 minutes from metro a nice 20 minute walk to La Rambla Welcome glass of cava on arrival is a really nice touch

318783,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Wish swimming pool was heated, Very comfortable atmosphere and staff were very nice Rooms were very clean and we were offered free upgrade on arrival The art around the hotel was fantastic Would definitely recommend this hotel 
318784,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room was a little claustrophobic no tea and staff not that friendly no desk to work on Because it was Mobile World Congress week when Barcelona is full we paid about 3 times the normal price For that considerable extra money the hotel could have been a bit more generous with frills such as drinks or included breakfast which would have made us feel special without costing them much , The style is great
318785,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The rooftop pool wasn t heated too cold to even go in Also had to wait a long time To collect luggage from hold when leaving, Managed to get room early Very clean Nice rooms Good complimentary toiletries
318786,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, I would have been nice if the pool had been heated would have loved a swim on the roof on a sunny spring morning , The hotel was in a great location surrounded by loads of restaurants but on a quiet road Perfect for coming back to after a long day exploring 
318787,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Standard room is quite small for 2 persons ideal for 1 person Bed size is small too Rooms are quite noisy lots of audible evening activities , Breakfast is great value for money Eur 18 pp bathroom and rain shower and amenities rooftop with swimming pool ideal for sunbathing as well 
318788,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The bed could be a bit longer I am 177cm and my partner is 188 and the bed was a bit too short Not a deal breaker though , Location design staff breakfast To be honest it is a really good hotel 
318789,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing really Great hotel and great value for money , The hotel is very modern with good facilities comfortable rooms and friendly staff The location is also very good for anyone visiting Barcelona There is a decent gym in the rooftop which even has a bluethooth speaker so you can connect your phone and play any music you want Another thing that was a great surprise is the attention to detail they provide a bathroom kit with everything you need including thoothpaste hair comb etc I d definitely come back to this hotel
318790,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, We had a welcome drink and a room upgrade Everyone was willing to help us and our room was comfortable clean and tidy the WiFi was excellent Great place to stay 
318791,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, No kettle in the room The worst sound proofing I ve ever experienced in a hotel The walls must be Paper thin You can hear everyone in all the rooms around you not good Very difficult to get a good sleep as a result , Good location very smart double room with balcony Nespresso machine a nice touch 
318792,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Basic rooms are extremely small and have internal windows so they can be too warm Stayed for a week and bed linens were changed only once, Location and design are good the pool and gym on the top floor are nice to relax 
318793,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing all great , Fantastic staff great location Got a welcome drink The reception gave thorough overview of where to go in Barcelona directions public transport etc It was brilliant 
318794,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Wallpaper was a bit grubby waited at the bar for 20 mins but no one was there to serve us room service wasn t great , Bathroom was lovely comfy bed modern hotel
318795,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing, Loved everything Staff very helpful and friendly Arrived before 10 am to leave off our bags to be told our rooms were ready for us Had a welcome drink while we checked in Fantastic breakfast great selection Amazing shower and extremely comfortable bed Would highly recommend Hotel Decor very interesting and unusual 
318796,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, A few more coffee pods please, Location great nice restaurants close by with shops around the corner Bar area pleasant to sit in and look at art work Nice to have a coffee machine in room it makes a difference of a morning Staff helpful and would go back to the hotel again
318797,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, The service from all staff was excellent It was our honeymoon and they left us a nice selection of chocolates The location is excellent We were a short walk from great restaurants and shopping 
318798,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, If I was being really picky the room we had was a little small and the bathroom door is just glass Not much separating you from the room if you wanted some privacy Again I am being really picky The room was clean comfortable and amenities were great Nespresso machine is a nice touch too , Hotel is clean modern and comfortable Staff very helpful and knowledgable Great location for getting around the city Metro station right around the corner from hotel too We went for my husbands birthday and there was a bottle of bubbly in the room when we arrived That was a nice touch Lots of little restaurants and cafes for breakfast and lunch around hotel 
318799,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Disappointed that the hotel does not have its own restaurant, The fact that my concerns around the room size was taken seriously and my health taken into consideration
318800,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The bathroom door was frosted glass and didn t retain much privacy , Great modern hotel with beautiful art throughout Bed was comfy shower was amazing and there is a great bar outside area that serves an excellent mojito I ll definitely be back to this perfectly location hotel 
318801,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Front desk staff made minimal effort to welcome us Seemed uninformed Gave poor directions no suggestions No material in lobby or room for tourists Only H10 hotel advertising Big issue when we arrived after traveling over 15 hours from Los Angeles minimal effort was made to welcome us It was 10 30 pm no one else in lobby When given a room I specifically asked is this a nice room Oh yes was the response The room was likely the worst room in the hotel An airless dark box at the bottom of the hotel next to an elevator shaft No outside window It was awful it was late and it was inexcusable Given another room which was fine with a small terrace Why wasn t that offered initially Did the front desk person just think we were completely irrelevant Bad way to start a trip in such a wonderful city Rest of front desk staff metely adequate We were there 4 nights Would not recommend this hotel based upon front desk reception, Cleanliness location Expresso Keurig in room
318802,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, We had a basic room and it was tiny The door opened towards the foot of the bed which was a bit awkward I think it would have been fine for one person but not two , The towels were fluffy and the shower pressure was great The business centre in the lobby had a printer so you can print train tickets etc for free Wifi was fast enough for video streaming From outside I saw the bigger rooms when the doors were opened for cleaning the looked really nice and I think it would have been worth it to pay more for them if you are not staying alone The location is convenient and there is a great English language bookshop called Come In just around the corner 
318803,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, A very smart and attractive hotel in a good location The bed in the first room we were given was very small We asked to upgrade at reception we were willing to pay and were told there was nothing available until the next day However later on we were told there was another budget room available with a bigger bed We changed rooms at no extra cost and had a much better bed The rooms are small but well equipped Lovely showers Local restaurants were very good 
318804,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, It is situated in a great area Metro a 5 minute walk away plus you could walk to La Rambla in 15 minutes We were spoilt for choice on places to eat just a few minutes away The staff was very helpful and polite the lobby area was bright and welcoming bar restaurant and terrace was tastefully decorated Room had everything you could possibly want for a overnight or long stay 
318805,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The only small negative thing I can mention is that I asked for an iron at reception and it did not arrive , My double room was located at the front of the building facing the main street and there was no noise The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room was very clean and tidy All of the staff at the hotel were very helpful and met all of my needs The breakfast was excellent and there was a good choice of food On check out the hotel was very accommendating as I was able to leave my case at the hotel for the afternoon and collect it when I was ready to leave for the airport I would recommend this hotel to friends and work colleagues 
318806,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, I have to tell the story of how wonderful the staff was when I left my iPhone in the pocket of the bathrobe at the hotel I was at the train station ready to go to Madrid when I discovered that I didn t have it They went to the room found it and had it at the desk for me as I dashed back by cab to retrieve it Knowing that they found it and were holding it made those anxious moments a bit less stressful 
318807,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, i book city view but i got apartments view, Rooms absolutely fantastic we stay in Superior Double room bed comfortable about 10 min walk to the city centre
318808,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room is pretty small Overall a bit pricey for Barcelona , Very modern Hotel Nice staff the art theme is pleasant Location is great hard to beat that 
318809,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, value for money a bit expensive for the size of room and in room facilities provided , good location reception service clean free wifi in room works 
318810,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Very small room hardly bigger then the bed in it There was no space to open the lagguages apart from the bed My biggest problem was the glass door on the bath room about 2cm distance from the walls around Actualy if you sit on the toilet its 1m from your partner who lays in the bed and there is nothing between you to block the strange noise and smell , Very good location 20mins walk from everything Very nice rooftop pool with good coctails on fair price 
318811,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room isn t the most sound proof which means you can hear everything that s going on , great location for transport links throughout Barcelona Very modern decor Awesome bathroom with a great shower 
318812,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, A generic hotel with small rooms and particularly surly and unhelpful staff Parking was pre booked but never materialised thankfully there was a public parking station nearby The staff never even offered to help my wife with her bags , Not a great deal really
318813,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room was rather small and not very sound proof , The pool was a fabulous facility although a few more sun beds would be better The hotel was very clean and modern 
318814,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, I would hardly call a 120 cm bed for a double bed and aircon was extremely difficult to set at an acceptable level , Good location modern hotel and nice roof top pool 
318815,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The basic rooms are a bit small and for the money should probably be a bit bigger but it s still nicely designed and equipped , Contemporary design and the rooftop terrace Great location near bars and restaurants and easily accessible to the centre Has a high quality feel to all of it 
318816,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, I would like to give a big hug for the guys at the reception When i arrived at the hotel I was not feeling good and cried a little You guys was very kind to me and take so good care of me i will never forget that I will sure come back to your hotel when i visit Barcelona again Best regards 
318817,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Didn t like the fact when the room was cleaned they set the air con to very cold and left it running returning back to our room at the end of the day was like entering a walk in freezer People also put there towels etc on the sun beds in the morning and left them there all day even though they weren t using them so no chance of sitting by the pool unless you bagged one really early , Breakfast was fab with added bonus of been able to eat outside in the courtyard brilliant staff very helpful good location within walking distance of most attractions
318818,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing it was lovely, Quiet part of Barcelona but nice restaurants in walking distance 15 min walk to central shopping area and sagrada familiar We had a beautiful room with terrace Bed was comfy and room exceptionally clean Pool was small and shallow but lovely to cool off in Large variety of food for breakfast and lovely outdoor area for a quiet drink Car parking underneath the building was great and easy to get into 
318819,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Small room and no draw space but everything else lovely , Location was perfect for us So many lovely bars and restaurants in walking distance Hotel also left bubbly and chocolates as it was our honeymoon 
318820,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, There are only a small number of pool bed so not easy to relax around the pool unless you are there very early in the day Some music could have been nice around the bar area on main floor the ambiance is a little plain , Nice and confortable 4 star hotel Location is great for a city trip Great bathroom and amenities 
318821,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff was attentive and helpful conversant in a number of languages including English Artwork was exceptional The outdoor terrace on the first floor and rooftop pool were serene places to relax after full days in the busy city 
318822,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, I was travelling with my 4 year old daughter and it probably wasn t the right hotel from that point of view other guests weren t keen on her splashing about in the pool there were no other kids there but that was no reflection on the hotel itself , The staff were fantastically helpful and friendly which I found unfortunately wasn t the norm in Barcelona The rooms were great and the location was amazing 
318823,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, nothing , Great location quiet but within walking distance of the centre Clean comfy and classy hotel Plunge ball deck is a massive bonus perfect place to cool down with a cocktail after a hot day sightseeing shopping 
318824,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Loved this modern hotel it was well situated and close to great restaurants and shops Both of the rooms were lovely and we really enjoyed our stay We will stay here again 
318825,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, While the staff was mostly good and very polite I did witness other guests experience better service It was little things like not being greeted immediately offered drinks or help with bags where I saw others were Since I look young it could be age discrimination even though I had paid the same as any other guest , I loved the aesthetics of the hotel and the various areas to work or have a drink the terrace lobby and pool area The pool itself was almost laughingly small but it s mostly for looks anyways The pool area is super nice and well serviced The a la carte menus were quite reasonably priced I also appreciated the amenities of the room 
318826,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, I wish we could have checked in earlier and not have to leave our luggage and other valuables in a ground floor closet I loved the small rooftop pool but there were not enough lounge chairs or seating chairs , This was an adorable boutique hotel located in a semi residential neighborhood with cute restaurants and shops The breakfast was excellent and creatively prepared The staff was attentive and spoke english fluently would definitely stay there again The bathroom was modern and came equipped with a cute toiletries kit and enough shampoo soap and cream rinse 
318827,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Stylish well designed hotel Great selection of toiletries bathrobe provided iPod iPhone music system etc Allowed early check in Eixample is a vibrant funky area Many restaurants nearby 
318828,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Lovely hotel Interior is spot on Staff were really efficient and helpful We checked in early without any extra fee Bar prices reasonable and roof top swimming pool absolutely wonderful Going to Lisbon next year and will be booking into the H10 there hoping it s as good 
318829,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The pool on the roof was very small and often busy Room was very small Slightly out from the main attractions but very close to the metro which was really useful for getting around , Staff were friendly and helpful Welcome drink on arrival was a nice touch Room was modern and very clean 
318830,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The pool at the top is too small for all customers to get the oportunity to use People often left towel to save places and empty drink food packets even tho it states not to Should be supervised by a member of staff so it is kept to the same standard as the rest of the hotel , Lovely place to stay with nice rooms and a great breakfast with fresh fruit each morning Helpful staff always at the desk to answer questions about the hotel or local transport times and directions to find places 
318831,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Breakfast a little costly , Lovely hotel A little off the beaten track but then all of Barcelona is nice Very high class everything at your fingertips Lovely toiletries everything you could need Bar a little pricey I had a room with a balcony not a fabulous view but nice to sit out Pool area lovely but small Overall one of the nicest hotels I ve used 
318832,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Everything was great , Perfect location Very nice modern hotel in an excellent upper class neighborhood Extremely satisfied with the facilities and cleanliness of the hotel well done 
318833,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, More of a restaurant to be available in the evening serving similar quality of food to breakfast , Breakfast was excellent lots of choice fresh and lots of healthier options Lobby very stylish and hotel very clean and tidy 
318834,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, the hotel its very nice little bit away from noisy touristic area but close enough to walk anywhere some good restaurants around very clean and all the staff very friendly love it 
318835,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, This hotel is amazing Everything about it was perfect The only thing I can t comment on is the food as we are out every day but apart from that I can not fault this hotel at all Staff were super friendly and so helpful We also hired some bikes from the hotel too great added facility save hunting round for someone in the tourist area and having to find them again to give them back at the end of the trip I would recommends his hotel for anyone who just wants to relax or if they are on a tourist holiday like myself It was great to come back to a freshly cleaned room and get an amazing shower I would definitely stay at this hotel again or any of the H10 hotels around the world Thankyou for your hospitality 
318836,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The small double rooms could have had slightly larger beds, The staff were so hospitable even offering complementary cava for me and my group as it was my 50th birthday
318837,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, This is a great hotel the only issue is that the rooms are a bit too small in terms of size , The hotel is amazingly designed Very artsy and modern and welcoming The facilities are great the bathroom is very well equipped as well as the room amenities The rooms have great natural light with big windows One of the best designed hotels I ve stayed in Barcelona The location is very convenient as well 
318838,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The check in service was terrible with rude staff that did not make us feel welcome at all We asked to change rooms as we felt a little claustrophobic in the room we had booked We needed to pay the upgrade charge but we were not told that at the time After going out for the afternoon we came back to a room that we were locked out of I paid the upgrade and they gave us new cards I would not stay here ever again it ruined my last three days in Barcelona The other places we stayed at were fantastic , Overall the location was good Close by to attractions with lovely bars and eateries in close proximity 
318839,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Incredible experience comfortable rooms beautiful design very quiet The service was perfect very helpful staff The rooftop pool was a great addition Would come back again and again 
318840,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The hotel is overpriced for what you get The rooms are not comfortable and quiet small The atmosphere is very cold and unpleasant The swimming pool on the rooftop is small , Nice location Clean Staff are friendly and helpful 
318841,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, , The bedroom was very comfortable The breakfast each morning was delicious and had a great selection Great design and style in hotel and the location is great for the town 
318842,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Some of stuff were pleasent some not The bed was unconfortable We left the room everyday in morning and returning around late afternoon still the cleaning were not completed very strange same with terrace which was full of fallen leaves When I have request reception to booked me a taxi to the airport in very arogant manner they respond to me that there is taxi station only 30 mtrs further so I can take it from there It was so unprofessional from thair said as it took me only 5 min via internet to book the taxi Looking that I have paid 240 Euro per night is not matching the quality overall , It is done more like butique hotel modern type and it looks pretty Morning brekfast is good with a lot different choice The position is also not to bad about 5 min walk from Rambla De Catalunya shopping area and about 15 min if you know the way to La Rambla 
318843,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, underground parking hugely challenging with winding single lane slope forming both entrance and exit , Good location clean modern stylish Good wifi good shower
318844,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing to add , Flawless experience at the hotel I had no issues Staff was very accommodating and helpful Will probably stay there again The H10 chain always seems to do a great job 
318845,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Could have been clearer about the bed situation on booking , Hotel was trendy modern and spotlessly clean Great location away from crowds but within 5 minutes of metro Diaganal Stop or 10 minutes walk from the Ramblers Only bug bear was the rooms are small and I travelled with a friend and had to share a bed with her as the cheap rooms are large double beds only 
318846,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The cooked food at breakfast was not hot The bedrooms were stylish but there are no proper drawers for underwear and other items , Location excellent hotel classy staff friendly and helpful The breakfast good except the cooked food 
318847,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The rooms are a bit small which was not a problem for us but could be for people with a lot of luggage There was no lock on the bathroom door which is an issue if you are travelling with friends , Location is excellent Art theme is interesting The beds were really comfortable Wifi was excellent
318848,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Housekeeping could plan in starting cleaning the rooms a bit later the walls aren t thick enough so you can hear the vacuum in the room beside you Not great when you are on holidays and want to sleep past 8AM , Amazing breakfast fantastic location 
318849,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent check in helpful staff fabulous breakfast comfortable bed clean room sound proofing not the best we could hear the guy in the next room snoring I would stay there again and would recommend to others 
318850,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, fabulous room nice terrace extremely quiet due to soundproofing The air con was superb the bedding was cosy and the rooftop pool area though compact was lovely 
318851,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, No showers or changing facilities to get changed if youv had to check out your room at 12pm and you have a late night flight Had to get changed and freshen up in the toilets, Modern comfy rooms
318852,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Standard room a little small Door between bedroom bathroom only a glass partition not a full door , Staff very helpful excellent breakfast Quiet location but ideal for exploring Barcelona Plenty of restaurants within walking distance 
318853,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Good location everything around the corner and las rambla is 20 mins walk Great staff and very nice hotel overall along with the nespresso machine Ask for the room with the balcony the view is nothing to look out for but it is chilled out 
318854,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Decorative pillows that fail to provide proper head neck support is antiquated Memory foam or firmer pillows should be standard at hotels of this quality Quieter location than central Barcelona but poor insulation flooring that propagates noise does not make for a very quiet stay unfortunately , Beautiful hotel nice attention to detail and lovely artwork Very nice breakfast as well 
318855,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, From the moment I arrived at the hotel everyone to include the hotel manager front desk representative and another employee was helpful and professional The parking was free and convenient During my check in I was offered a refreshment drink and my daughter was provided a coloring book and crayons they clearly love kids I asked for a dinner recommendation which was above my expectations and very close to the hotel The hotel is in a great location in the city near several restaurants and shops you can easily walk to The small gym was located on the top floor but was just what I needed to get a morning run in Afterwards I stood outside on the top floor taking in the fresh air while looking out at the city Lastly the room was located on the 5th floor with a balcony everything was clean organized and comfortable I frequently travel and I have seen many hotels rated 5 stars that are clearly not this 4 star hotel gets 5 stars from me I WILL be back Thank you March 2016 
318856,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Would have liked the room to have a smart TV with the ability to connect hdmi chromecast Apple TV and with faster Internet connection , Lovely modern hotel and we ll equipped nice rooms and breakfast Great location to explore the city 
318857,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The only thing I would say is the hotel rooms are a bit on a small side and being so small they would become warm very quickly We would wake up in the night wanting the air con on It didn t matter so much as we were only sleeping here and out all day Also I expected the structure in the middle of the courtyard to be taller and grander you ll see what I mean if you stay here , I received a warm welcome and better still a free glass of champagne upon arrival The hotel was clean and fine for what we needed The breakfast was extensive and there was always something to eat There was a nespresso machine in the room and a great bathroom and shower We had dressing gowns and the towels were extra fluffy It was a great hotel stay
318858,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Breakfast is really good but I am not sure if it is worth the price 18 euros per person , Excellent decoration inspired from famous artists The location is great as you can walk to the city center or take the metro two stations are close to the hotel The hotel staff is really helpful and kind The room was very clean and we found great the fact that a coffee machine is in the room 
318859,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The staff at our arrival not very helpful and friendly only 6 umbrellas for 90 rooms very practical when it rains and rains Quite rosy you can hear the noise from the street during the night and as well inside you are disturbed from your neighbors , Location is quite good
318860,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Front desk staff was not always helpful One lady in particular Can t remember her name but she worked evening shift Also a smaller breakfast should be provided, Loved the art and vibe of hotel
318861,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, There was a feeling of space on the ground floor with open plan areas and a beautiful terrace The artwork everywhere was brilliant and made for a very relaxing atmosphere The balcony in our room was great and breakfast was just the best 
318862,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nothing , Staff were the best i ve seen in 10 years that includes mo in Hong Kong and w in la Fabulous David reception walked 3 streets to find us a place to park an over height vehicle Adorable staff cant say enough 
318863,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The staff are rude 3rd time now and it s not necessary and probably the reason it s empty We wanted a late check out and the guy on reception lied by saying the hotel was becoming very busy so it was not possible but when we collected our cars the hotel was generally quieter than the day before , The concept general feel breakfast bedrooms location and secure parking
318864,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The price of the breakfast 38 euros for 1 breakfast for 2 people Also the rooms where very small And the iron was of really poor quality, Friendly staff Good central location Everything new and spotless clean
318865,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup,No Negative, Lovely hotel very clean and comfortable Breakfast of high quality with great variety Nice welcome glass of cava on arrival and a quick checkout on departure

318868,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Noise The window couldn t close well We had a problem with the window of the room and they were very fast and we were moved to a new room However the problem was the same , Breakfast was really good Room and bed were very good too Localisation 
318869,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Breakfast selection is not really great for the price I ve had much better selection in hot food especially, Very nice location with a friendly staff
318870,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, nothing, Excellent location lots of lovely cafes and tapas bars around clean modern friendly staff and in walking distance to the more touristy areas When we made the booking we notified reception that this was a special occasion we were upgraded and received a bottle of Cava fantastic service 
318871,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The room we had was very small we as we had an internal room in the hotel But it didn t matter as we were out at the beach or site seeing most of the time , Location was great within walking distance of the city center Staff were helpful and friendly Roof top pool although small was fantastic to have Rooms were lovely and clean Coffee machines in the rooms were a nice touch 
318872,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Room though comfortable is not as large as it looks in the pictures Breakfast seems a bit overpriced at Euro 18 person though it offers a good variety for most people to have food they like , Nice and helpful staff Clean rooms Fast internet Nice variety in breakfast And excellent locations to see around many top locations in Barcelona Front desk tried its best to be flexible to my request for a late checkout 
318873,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The only aspect that we would criticise is that the walls in our room 209 were somewhat grubby , The art theme was brilliant The breakfast looked brilliant but unfortunately our schedule didn t allow us an opportunity to have it The staff were most helpful and pleasant We ll definitely be back 
318874,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, There were two beds but asked for one when booking but that did improve the rooms and had to pay in connection with the history of the bed did not have to pay , All was good breakfast is chic the rooms are clean and comfortable Room has everything you need to stop for 2 3 days perfect hotel for traveling light proximity to all the attractions nice staff 
318875,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Wish Bar Outside terrace was open later with some entertainment Otherwise quite peaceful hotel which I really appreciate as well, Great location clean modern hotel very helpful friendly staff 
318876,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, I felt the concept is great as hotel art gallery but i feel it could be more exploited The lobby is amazing because it has a very nice setting and exhibition but not the floors I felt the floors are taking the theme of painters without really applying a nice identity The carpets reflect the main identity but they could have been done better My room was very tiny I don t know about the other rooms, The very artsy fartsy aspect of the hotel
318877,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, my room was facing inwards and always seemed gloomy The hair dryer you had to hold down a button to make it work which was annoying , wifi drinks on arrival
318878,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, None, The staff were lovely The welcome drinks and food on arrival The decor and atmosphere in the hotel The rooftop pool area The food I loved everything about it really 
318879,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Slightly disappointed about the size of the pool which is a plunge pool rather than anything more substantial but it was only a short stay and did not use it in any case , Excellent location within walking distance of metro stations and city centre Loved the art work in the hotel the helpful staff and overall facilities
318880,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Nowhere to sit in bedroom except on the bed Room wasn t big but even a small armchair would have been much appreciated Apart from that couldn t find fault with anything at all , All staff friendly efficient and helpful Everywhere very clean foyer lounge areas very welcoming and spacious with a good choice of chairs Room very comfortable and spotlessly clean though not big might have been a squash for two people but lots of extras much appreciated automatic bathroom light coffee machine great Super walk in shower Really glad of the efficient air con too All in all a great hotel 
318881,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Our room only had a window facing the entryhall No fresh air, The location and the hotel itself is great Lovely terrace excellent breakfast nice staff

318884,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The front desk folks were not the friendliest There were a few confusions around my reservation that seemed to never be fixed too The gym was also just so so They could add some free weights in the space , Great central location for Barcelona Definitely worth the price and the pool was very relaxing too 
318885,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, Two seperate beds turned into a double bed The street is noisy on weekends if you sleep early, Great location Eixample area is a good choice for first time Barcelona visitors easy to walk everywhere The concept of the Hotel is nice rooms are simple but comfortable and tasty coffee is great Next to the Hotel there is a good Italian Restaurant and across a place to taste Vermut

318888,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, The double room was very small and not big as the pictures the double bed is not comfortable and too small for 2 and should be used for only 1 the air conditioning in the room was the big problem each time we put the temperature at 24 degree for example it will remain to 16 degree and the room will be very cold and we are obliged to turn it off we reported the problem to reception but no changes was done, The staff are helpful
318889,H10 Art Gallery 4 Sup, There is a great minus in the hotel as the balconies are near to each other and they are separated by walls with holes you have to suffer from smoke smell all the time because lots of guests go to smoke on their balconies So if you do not smoke it will be hard for you to sit on the balcony or sleep with the open window because of this smell It s very inconvenient in summer , Wonderful interior very exciting New cosy and conceptual hotel with great design There are even 2 real pictures of Miro in the hall and the art gallery in the hotel Very good breakfast and good personal they are very tolerant to guests The view from rooms which are on the inner side is exciting and atmospheric
