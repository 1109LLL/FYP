32668,My Bloomsbury, The shower was poor and the bathroom door had no stopper so slammed into the tiled wall when you opened it Also only 2 English breakfast teabags and a couple of milks in the room a couple more would have been nice , Rooms were spacious clean and the room amenties were excellent The location was excellent and the restaurant adjoining the hotel Gails Kitchen was excellent for breakfast 
32669,My Bloomsbury, We were very happy with our stay and look forward to a returnvisitlocationperfect, Bed lovely and comfy room small but perfectly formed everything one needed for a stay Breakfast was delicious and staff very helpful and friendly
32670,My Bloomsbury, The bathroom was so small I couldn t use the sink properly i e I couldn t bend over while brushing my teeth I kept running into turning into things Confusion as to what was the front desk given that the lobby is between a cafe and a restaurant Not clear what was and was not included in the price of my room , Chic room amazing location staff were polite
32671,My Bloomsbury, The hotel does not offer any iron service and the provided iron and iron board was outdated Secondly my provided credit card has been charged before arrival that I haven t approved in the first place and wasn t mentioned in the confirmation I preferred to pay with an alternative payment method The receptionist offered me to rebate my card and pay with another but she mentioned that it my take up to one week that the bank is holding the funds Keeping the rates in mind I have paid per night I found the hotel out dated , The hotel has a great location very close to station Tottenham Court Road only a two minutes walk away in the middle of a dynamic area of the city The check in went very smooth and the breakfast in the morning is very delightful as all is freshly prepared and you can choose from a very detailed breakfast menu The amenities in the bathroom as well as in the living room and the minibar menu are great Good selections 
32672,My Bloomsbury, The first room we were in was really disappointing I d booked the stay for my first wedding anniversary The furtniture was shabby with chips and scratches everywhere there were scratches and blotches on the walls scuffed carpet and the wallpaper was cheap and dated For 189 and a 4 room it wasn t acceptable I have never done so before but requested a change of room which the man at reception kindly and quickly sorted so we were switched to one of the much nicer updated rooms They later brought us complimentary champagne and patisserie from the bakery downstairs for our anniversary Unfortunately at about 3am we heard dripping and water was dripping rapidly through a light fitting I rang reception and they said someone would come to check The water then started coming through another light fitting and through a crack in the ceiling I had to put both bins underneath to catch the water There were no other rooms available so we couldn t be moved we just had to move the bed and put up with it We were given 30 off our bill in the morning apparently it had happened in every room due to heavy rain but being from Yorkshire I didn t think the rain was heavy enough to warrant every room leaking Overall I was satisfied with the staff and the location was excellent but I d been really looking forward to this anniversary stay and no pun intended it was rather dampened by these issues I ve stayed in comparable hotels in London a lot and leaking ceiling aside I don t think it was worth the 189 price tag , The location was great staff very friendly free toiletries all vegan and eco friendly
32673,My Bloomsbury, The rooms are incredibly small The so called double bed could not realistically accommodate 2 adults The wardrobe is non existent just a mirror with hanging space at the back , the location is excellent Easy access to the centre of London and all its attractions Easy access to Tottenham Court Road tube station 
32674,My Bloomsbury, Wardrobe was very difficult to get too , Really comfy bed Very quiet considering it is just off Tottenham court Road Very clean Staff helpful but not intrusive 
32675,My Bloomsbury, The manager was meant to call us back regarding the trouble we had but didn t When we called they weren t there The sink was broken dirty water from other pipes flowed up It was disgusting I stayed here 8years ago and the rooms were nice but the 200 per night room we had was tiny I mean you had no room manuevring round the bed or bathroom This is no worth the money AT ALL The walls were dirty and marked the bathroom seemed nice until the mouldy sealant and the sink me and my friends came back from an exhibition I brushed my teeth and the water didn t go down it came up along with old hairs a glops of nastiness The next morning we told reception we got back really late and had to be up early for the Harry Potter tour she said the manager would call but never did We called but they were never there , The location 
32676,My Bloomsbury, Though the room amenities were good and generally comfortable the room was quite small for the price It was fine for this trip as I was mostly out exploring the city But I found that there wasn t much space to move about the room I think looking at the layout for fire exit it was the smallest room on Level 3 or perhaps the building , The location is ideal and very accessible It s close to shops and restaurants I like that it s close to Tottenham Court Road and Goodge Street stations It was also quiet which lends much to comfort The room and bed linens were clean Very close to the British Museum and Oxford Street Breakfast was great and the pastries and bread from Gail s Bakery are excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful 
32677,My Bloomsbury, nothing, elected to upgrade to suite fantastic room up in the attic brilliant place to stay in London lovely breakfast in the bakery attached A very positive experience overall strongly recommend 
32678,My Bloomsbury, The room is a bit small But it is adequate for us , Excellent location Close to anywhere My son went to a summer camp near U of London and this hotel is close to the venue Friendly staff Value for money 
32679,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, I let them know it was part of a birthday gift for my partner and asked for a view They went out of their way and gave us a balloon and birthday cake Small gestures like this make such a difference to a night 
32680,My Bloomsbury, I left a small tip for housekeeping and it seems it was nicked by the person who checks the minibar since it was gone when I returned to my room even though housekeeping hadn t yet visited , The room was very comfortable the location fantastic front desk staff helpful and friendly and the bakery downstairs was delicious 
32681,My Bloomsbury, Room had an L shape form so it wrapped around the elevator and was therefor very noisy Toilet flushing did not work , Great Location only a short walk to Tottenham Court Road tube station Very powerful airconditioning system 
32682,My Bloomsbury, Some parts of the carpet on the stairs were looking a bit worn and the single room was fairly small although comfortable with enough room for a desk , Good location and near to tube station and next door to nice caf and pub Good value for money in London 
32683,My Bloomsbury, I thought the amenities were sparse I missed having a reading light by the bed as well as a clock The air conditioning was odd and the controls hard to manage and across the room The first two would be easy to fix , The staff was great and I loved the location I had a small single room which was fairly comfortable and quiet which is really important 
32684,My Bloomsbury, On day the restaurant was really slow They did not keep track of people arriving and were serving people at a random order They luckily took our feedback in positive way , The staff was super friendly approachable and ready to help Got troubles with the internet connection and they helped right away The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable The room was also big enough and fully equipped All the good things at a walkable distance Will definitely stay here next time in London 
32685,My Bloomsbury, People people people Very busy time of year to visit London , Great location easy public access and walking to many attractions Great breakfast but a bit pricey
32686,My Bloomsbury, Room was cramped and bedside table was propped against wall and collapsed when I moved it to plug in charger Perhaps some of the furniture and fittings could be upgraded and re designed to make better use of available space , Small and very comfortable quiet and cool room with a spacious bathroom on 4th floor Staff are very helpful towels large and fluffy and bed perfect It was a very small double so glad I was on my own Had a cool vibe too Great location within easy walking distance of major venues like the British Museum 
32687,My Bloomsbury, My room Room 102 has a sudden unmarked step in the floor and I tripped on it a few times I told the girl at reception and she said they knew about it and that it was the only room Luke that I said it was dangerous and cloud they get back to me but they didn t It should be properly marked before they let another guest stay there,No Positive
32688,My Bloomsbury, Rooms very small and desperately needing a coat of paint High ceilings make them look smaller and shabbier No cupboards or drawers No way to shut out the glare from street lamps and signs , Very good location excellent friendly staff
32689,My Bloomsbury, Room small and furniture that was too big for it so space was tight Extremely expensive for what you get accommodation wise Very hard to get in and out of the shower over the bath without slipping Hated that Made a booking for a taxi at reception to pick us up so we could make our tour the next day early start got to reception and they had failed to make the booking Th guys at reception were not able to be very helpful and so we had to take a chance on the street for a cab and luckily just made the tour Would not stay again , Location was really good Breakfast was great 
32690,My Bloomsbury, The 3rd floor hallway and room smelled musty the bed sagged and the AC didn t work so we had to prop the one window open with the rubbish bin , The location was great within walking distance of many good bookshops 
32691,My Bloomsbury, The hotel is really small but still cosy No elevator Room is really small but if you travelling without kids its fine , Room was really clean and very well decorated AC in the room was excellent 
32692,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Excellent location Nice boutique hotel Very personable staff Booking com confirmed booking didn t show up for some reason but they accommodated us at the same price because I was able to pull up the confirmation email 
32693,My Bloomsbury, The single room was a tad small but the good aircon made up for this , The hotel reception staff were very helpful and friendly The book access and exchange was a novel idea The air conditioning was fantastic as the temperature during my stay was 30 degrees Good location with on site bakery and bar area with outside seating
32694,My Bloomsbury, The bathroom was not 4 star standard bad soundproofing of the room could hear the people in the room next door cough sneeze shower etc , Fab location decent sized room very clean very effective airco great since we were in town at one of the hottest weekends of the year nice coffee tea facilities
32695,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, This hotel is in a fantastic location just off Tottenham Court Road it is within very easy walking distance of the shops on Oxford Street and the British Museum It is also within walking distance of places like Covent Garden Soho Regent Street and lots of theatres but if you can t walk to these the underground is very close and there is always a taxi going by The hotel itself is very clean comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
32696,My Bloomsbury, I had a bit of an strange breakfast experience food was good as was the venue but the person that seemed to be running the tables managed to spoil everything After waiting for a bill I left to check out and came back to be greeted with insinuations that I had left without paying and an aggressive attitude about how I wish to pay If you are having a bad day that early on don t come in as it ruins the experience of your clients I flagged this at the check out desk when passing by again in the most constructive way possible got an apology but no offer to sort things about I ended up paying more than the normal breakfast charge which should not happen on top of everything else , Location is very good as is the overall feel of the hotel lift may be in need of some maintenance Room was small OK for London and a bit noisy but clean and comfortable 
32697,My Bloomsbury, We were woken at 03 00 and then again at 04 00 with what sounded like furniture being moved around the hotel Breakfast was mediocre to say the least, Lovey hotel rooms well appointed comfy bed Good selection of tea and coffee including espresso machine Good shower bath
32698,My Bloomsbury, Room 106 is next to the lift If you want to hear the annoying robot lift voice telling people they are in floor one late into the night and again from very early in the morning then stay in this room This room should not be a hotel room when it is this close to the lift Worst hotel room I have stayed in for as long as I can remember ,No Positive
32699,My Bloomsbury, For 188 a night this hotel achieves the standard of a travel lodge at best The staff are not as well versed in English as you might expect and I found myself having to repeat myself several times to get them to understand simple things like I took two bottles of water out of the minibar I would not stay there again , not much actually
32700,My Bloomsbury, The staff at the breakfast caf could do with better training We had mixed up orders and forgotten items every time we went for breakfast , The room was clean and comfortable The location is outstandig within walking distance to most attractions yet on a relatively quiet side street 
32701,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable location is great Close to shops restaurants and public transport Staff was very helpful we will stay there again next time we are in London 
32702,My Bloomsbury, air conditioning didn t work in first room they sent someone to fix it but it couldn t be fixed so they moved me to a better room but it was tighter and not as good bed was not as confortable pillows were worn a bit plus air conditioning on coldest setting was still not very good it was noisier because I was closer to the housekeeping storage and housekeeping starts early and they bang that door constantly don t choose 301 or 302 also no porter its a 4 star why is there no porter , conveniently located staff were great very helpful and accommodating not noisy from the street 
32703,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, We wanted a hotel near SoHo and My Bloomsbury was just close enough to get into the action but still affordable It was a great homebase for our brief stay in London 
32704,My Bloomsbury, we were originally given a room that was quite small However the staff very kindly accepted to give us a different room which was very nice So in the same price range you could get a small or bigger room We would advise that the smaller rooms are advertised and charged as such e g small double room so that visitors know when booking , excellent and helpful staff that was attentive to our needs very convenient location comfy bed all necessary facilities available in the room very nice cafe at the ground floor of the hotel would definitely stay there again
32705,My Bloomsbury, I was a bit let down by the size of the bed and duvet cover there s probably some disparity with European sizes from NL Carpet needed cleaning as there were visible stains in an otherwise nicely furnished room , Walking distance to British Museum Oxford street and Soho several subway options in the near vicinity This hotel is definitely at the top of the list for our next trip 
32706,My Bloomsbury, Had to wait for the room to be ready No mirror near any of the sockets Bathroom very small , Liked the location Liked the adjoining cafe bakery Liked the style ambience of the hotel 
32707,My Bloomsbury, Extremely small room Could hardly fit my suitcase in the front door and had no where really to put the suitcase Bathroom was also very small and smelt a bit mouldy Big air conditioning units outside my window that were noisy , Lovely staff clean comfortable room 
32708,My Bloomsbury, Did not like cushions on the bed These cushions are not washed after each guest so don t use them Don t allow pets it s not sanitary , Loved the location cafe down stairs and the front desk staff are friendly and helpful 
32709,My Bloomsbury, Room could do with an upgrade Also when we returned at 4pm the cleaners hadn t cleaned the room and we had to go and find one To their credit they cleaned the room very quickly after this , Location near theatres excellent
32710,My Bloomsbury, The room was very small and had a desk that was way too large for the space The window was high and small and combined with the size of the room was almost like a jail cell , Hotel was very clean Close to British Museum Close to two tube stops The bathroom was great Bed was comfortable Huge tv 
32711,My Bloomsbury, Room was a bit tired felt like student accommodation and the mattress had seen better days was a bit lumpy so not a great night sleep , Great location and friendly staff The reception is lovely really modern and stylish
32712,My Bloomsbury, Two major problems I faced have been quite annoying 1 frequent internet disconnections at 4th floor at least 2 sudden extreme hot water During the shower whatever the degree of the water is For every 1 2 mins theres a second that exteremely hot water flows and make you burn , The bed was comfy and the location was great 
32713,My Bloomsbury, Breakfast was in the public caf in the entrance area good food but service and atmosphere a bit hectic , Spacious funky suite with comprehensive equipment 2 large tvs apple mac good minibar Overall a modern state of the art hotel great for young people We were much older than the average guests who looked like google employees Close to BM and Tottenham Court Road station but our room looked out on a quiet roofscape There was a private terrace which would be great in summer 
32714,My Bloomsbury, Our cards in Egypt don t work through the internet and that was the only payment methods available so we had to pay cash which is something we didn t like you pay way more than what you get I find it overpriced honestly , The location is more than perfect Walking distance from Oxford street Primark Sainsbury s banks tons of restaurants Tottenham station and Goodge station Its really clean the bathroom was big the room was convenient 
32715,My Bloomsbury, Flushing toilets takes a knack, Incredible location and most helpful staff Design Wonderful linens and towels Speedy wifi This was my second visit to the hotel 
32716,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, We were not happy with the room initially given to us too small window but after we explained this at the reception the staff David at the reception was extremely helpful in finding another room for us that was much better king size bed bigger room We wish to thank him in particular for his help and for giving our stay in London such a good start 
32717,My Bloomsbury, The staff at the restaurant where the breakfast was served was the only down side of the hotel They were completely incapable of running a organised breakfast service people had to wait long for tables and then for the waitress to notice their presence Though when you got the breakfast it was brilliant both the complimentary breakfast and the food on the menu for the customers that where not staying at the hotel make sure to try their sourdough as well as the Swiss cheese they use they are brilliant , The staff was really friendly the complimentary products offered were really generous though would expect a bottle or two of complementary water Location is perfect short walk to few tube station on different lines
32718,My Bloomsbury, The room was small but it was fine for one night break , Staff were very nice and the hotel was very clean it was nice to have a small breakfast included 
32719,My Bloomsbury, Superior twin bedded room was extremely tight on space and was very disappointing because of that The desk was unusable due to one of beds up so close to it on one side and against second bed on the other The door to room couldn t open fully due to lack of space , Bed and bedding were very comfortable Heating in room was flexible and quick to heat up Breakfast was very good 
32720,My Bloomsbury, Would have liked more choice at breakfast It was either English muffins with fried eggs and bacon or a continental platter of granola and yoghurt with toast cheese ham and marmalade , The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious 
32721,My Bloomsbury, Though friendly the staffs efficiency is sometimes lacking especially at the Gail s kitchen downstairs, The rooms are well appointed and generally the hotel staffs are very welcoming
32722,My Bloomsbury, Toilets were broken we mentioned it on the first day and we ve been told that maintenance would come and fix it They never came and when we mentioned it again upon check out the answer was just oh yes it s an old building that s normal Well I don t think it s normal to have a broken toilet for almost 200 eur night The room was very tiny especially for 2 It was also rather noisy although that s normal in such a central location Breakfast is nice but rather overpriced , The location was very convenient and the breakfast was nice 
32723,My Bloomsbury, The receptionist that checked us in was a bit miserable however the following morning the lady who checked us out was very professional and smiley , We were upgraded to a superior double Great location Excellent facilities in the room 
32724,My Bloomsbury, The Location was the best and the food was really good, Room was nice clean but so so small no AC no view And really small Breakfest was amazing 
32725,My Bloomsbury, There is nothing to complain about The only reason I didn t give perfect 10 s was because I didn t stay long enough to enjoy all the facilities , Everything was excellent Staff helpful and friendly Room facilities excellent Everywhere accessible by public transport Clean I enjoyed the breakfast choice Stay too short Will come again I will recommend this hotel to friends without hesitation I bought a lemon cake from Gail s Bakers it was delicious
32726,My Bloomsbury, The hotel is very basic but when you are in London there is so much to do and see so all you want is a comfortable bed , The staff were very friendly and helpful I felt very safe in the neighbourhood The room was clean and comfortable I loved all the mini bar items 
32727,My Bloomsbury, The bedroom was a little small, The bed was very comfy getting good sleeps But i most like the staff they were very kind friendy y giving good suggestions and recommendations The best for sure Sara Ela and Annita thanks a million
32728,My Bloomsbury, The bed sheets are very uncomfortable for a 4 hotel very scratchy The hotel bed was TINY for two people the smallest double I ve ever seen in the UK We had a horrible night sleep The room was too hot We put the aircon on and opened the window and it was still hot , Nice staff great location
32729,My Bloomsbury, Staff weren t very smiley and nothing was explained about where to go for breakfast in the morning or what to do if we came back to the hotel late we only found out becuase we asked Snacks in room are stupidly priced would probbely make more money if they were cheaper becuase we would of eaten and drunk more , The bed was really comfortable Shower was amazing hotel was so clean 
32730,My Bloomsbury, The room that we had was on the small side but not really a problem , The location is perfect Easily get around central London with everything you need on your door step 
32731,My Bloomsbury, We had bought the breakfast option while booking but we had it only the first morning The reason The service was just TOO LONG we had to wait for 1 full hour to be served two cups of tea and the standard menu option We solicited waiters like 10 times we started our morning nervous and with 1 hour delay that was just not nice So in the next mornings we gave up on the breakfast option despite having paid for it Also the room had a tiny window too high to be able to see outside a bit claustrophobic given also the tiny size of the room , Small room but quiet Bed was comfortable The hotel is connected to a bakery Gail s bakery which is open all week long and is just amazing Very well placed five mins walking from the British Museum 
32732,My Bloomsbury, I d booked a twin room When we arrived it was still set up as a double The receptionist noticed and dealt with it very quickly but we had to leave our room while it was changed round , Reception service was great 
32733,My Bloomsbury, Walls very thin you practically hear everything your beighbors are doing Breakfast is served in a small restaurant next to the hotel that can also be used by external guests We wanted to have breakfast around 9 yet the restaurant was overcrowded and we had to wait 20mins to even enter Once seated we had to wait ages to even get the menu Our hotel reservation included breakfast of 20 per person yet there is a separate menu with 2 choices only for hotel guests For the regular menu or any additionl requests you need to pay on top Service was a disaster they forgot to serve us coffee the other day orange juice and spoons Also they served the wrong dish and treated us rude prior to being seated at a table In the end we were charged on top for black coffee even if it should have been included in the hotel menu Had the impression personnel was stressed out and completely overwhelmed so better have breakfast elsewhere if you want have a relaxed start in the day , Very friendly reception personnel great location very central to city center bars shops perfect Room was small and simple but clean Beds comfortable Good for a weekend in London 
32734,My Bloomsbury, But nothing else was truly good the bedroom was very small it didn t match the pictures shown for the same type of room in the Booking description Very hot even with the AC on , The location is very good 
32735,My Bloomsbury, Narrow room with small window Breakfast is good quality but not enough quantity if you have a long busy day ahead and service in restautrant can be a little bit slow sometimes Shower water flow should be stronger , Excellent location in Central London yet relatively quiet street Clean modern room with comfy bed and good bathroom Helpful friendly staff 
32736,My Bloomsbury, This is my first time to write a review 1 It is tooooooo noisy some decoration noise and construction noise freak me out Until 2am in the morning I report to the hotel reception they told me they are talking and solving the problem But NO Staff told me they got the permission I can t believe this 2 am in the morning still have drill voice around you 2 I asked for a twin beds room they told me should pay more and upgrade I said yes and they let me to choose the level of the room When I enter the room it s not the twin beds it s king size bed room I came to talk with the hotel staff They told me no more twin beds room Excuse me Why don t you tell me before 3 Bad flush water, Good location
32737,My Bloomsbury, The service in Gail s kitchen was very poor due to being very busy and understaffed There was a hole under the table in our room 109 through to cavity which was blowing in kitchen smells Unfortunately not the fantastic bakery smells There was also a confusion over whether breakfast was included in rate , Clean Gail s Bakery is excellent and we regularly visit when in London Location
32738,My Bloomsbury, Room was very small, Excellent location Friendly staff Clean room with attractive modern decor Location was quiet overnight which was a nice surprise in such a central location Did not use the cafe or any other hotel facilities Reception can store bags before after check in A great hotel with very reasonable rates 
32739,My Bloomsbury, It was not possible to warm the room enough and there was a constant feeling of a breeze coming through the closed window , The whole experience was very good I would recommend it 
32740,My Bloomsbury, I was visiting with a friend and booked a twin room but we had to move some furniture around to get the beds separated The pictures are a bit misleading our bathroom was very decent but not as fancy as the pictures show Same with the room It was hard to get the room dark and there is a lot of space under the door to the hallway getting a lot of light from there Door to the bathroom is glass and there is no way to cover the bathroom windows , The bed was really comfortable The location is great Just a bit away from the crowds but close to all the fun The in house bakery that is providing parts of the breakfast was nice too Breakfast choices are very limited but the quality is good 
32741,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, The staff were outstanding attentive and very friendly The room was exceptional modern and comfortable Would highly recommend this to anyone The location of My Bloomsbury was perfect and so easy to get around town and back whether walking or on public transport 
32742,My Bloomsbury, You could here people s conversation in the next room so clearly ad my room had an adjoining door the toilet didn t flush properly due to a plumbing issue with the whole building the shower went very hot intermittently while I was showering every time the double room was really small with very limited hanging space for over 200 I would not stay again, Breakfast was really nice and the location was excellent
32743,My Bloomsbury, The restaurant did not have a wide variety of food There were also some damages to the furniture in the room not a big issue though , Although the room was not very spacious I found it very cosy and comfortable The bed and LCD screen were great too 
32744,My Bloomsbury, Service for breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced certainly not good enough for a 4 star hotel On Saturday morning the waitress forgot the orange juice I got a latte instead of a regular coffee which was only lukewarm Sunday morning I had to ask three times for the coffee milk was forgotten got from next table , Location was excellent Even though the room was small it was well furnished Good supply and variety of teas and coffees 
32745,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Bed was so comfy We were able to check in early at no extra cost Friendly informative staff Good cafe downstairs and close to all London has to offer 
32746,My Bloomsbury, 1 Standard rooms are very small Worth to upgrade to bigger one 2 I had a bigger one my friend wanted to upgrade paying the extra they said ok you can go out and when you come back at afternoon you can switch to the bigger room When we have arrived they told that they have sold the room and can not upgrade the room This is very amateur or very opportunistic 3 In todays world I can not believe that a hotel is out of european to english electiricty converter to charge a phone ,No Positive
32747,My Bloomsbury, Having to ring the bell to get in even at 23 00 Get a key entry system Roadwork noise waking me up at 0700 on a Saturday , The breakfast was excellent exceeded expectations The location is also very good Rooms exactly as pictured and very comfortable 
32748,My Bloomsbury, Not much to mention good overall quality and good value for money Small hotel so naturally some lack of facilities inside the hotel , Very good location in a quiet side street to the more busy neighbouring area Clean room and a very good bed Short walk to the nearest subway Positively surprised by this small hotel and a good alternative to the large business oriented hotels Has lots of charm and good service Good quality breakfast being served Continental or full English are available and is served to the table Nice location of a quality bakery cafe behind the reception area Overall a good place to stay and I will come back 
32749,My Bloomsbury, The breakfast choice included is a bit limited and my egg was not cooked so I had a food poisoining, Clean room and really nice shower room as well staff was very nice
32750,My Bloomsbury, Toilet not flushing Left a note to the cleaning personnel but it was still not fixed the second day of my stay Really pricey for what it offers very normal and small rooms , Breakfast was good 
32751,My Bloomsbury, The photos featured on Booking are not realistic at all The hotel is much older Rooms are also tiny and you can hear all noises in the room , Location is really good for shopping staff is kind
32752,My Bloomsbury, I was on the first floor and had a really really tiny room The bathroom was totally rundown see fotos and it smelled badly Room itself didn t look nice at all I was in a hurry and there was just no time to complain so I decided to take it as bad luck Well it s only two nights At around 12 30am there was a weird noise coming from the aircon or heater that I couldn t turn off No chance to sleep with that noise and I am usually not sensitive I called the reception they showed up and offered me to move to another room So I packed all my stuff in the middle of the night and moved to the third floor Uff Room was slightly bigger bathroom looked at least nicer no smell That was a huge win Really uncomfortable situation but I have to say that the night staff was really friendly So in the end my stay was ok My business colleague on the other hand was on the 4th floor and had a nice large room Apparently it totally depends on the room if this hotel is a good option or not Hard to know in advance , There is a really nice little bakery downstairs Location is great 
32753,My Bloomsbury, Could be some more bedside table space the coffee cups etc were on it No conditioner in bathroom Partner thought bathroom was small ish for drying off but I thought it was fine , Clean modern nice designs great location nice staff environmentally friendly products nice minibar selection Will return again 
32754,My Bloomsbury, The carpet could be cleaner and if you have a room with a street view Tottenham Court this is rather noisy So you are not able to open the windows , Perfect location Nearby center of London and main historic monuments and museums Nice small hotel with spacious rooms We have choosen the superior double The small restaurant provides a nice breakfast with a lot of choice Friendly staff 
32755,My Bloomsbury, The rooms were not nice and up to the standards of a 4 stars hotel, The location and the wifi and the staff Stefania in particular was very helpful and did do all she could to help improving my experience in the hotel 
32756,My Bloomsbury, As the building is old you could hear everything even people walking on the corridor or opening the doors My room was also really small and not as in the picture Also breakfast is not included so the price is quite high for what you get , The bed was very comfy and the location superb The coffee and tea selection was also very good 
32757,My Bloomsbury, Room was a little cold owing to a very draughty window casement we had to keep the blind down at all times just to help keep the heat in , Very attentive and friendly staff Simple and stylish decor Truly excellent location can t be beaten 
32758,My Bloomsbury, A slight inconvenience Sound proofing from a room to an other , The staff was very helpful and it was a good value for money Even though our room was not big everything and every little space were thoughtfully organised to provide a quirky and fairly comfortable room 
32759,My Bloomsbury, Pretty shabby decor in need of an upgrade Impossible to get the lighting right in the room Small annoyances like only one bedside table and set of lights for a king side bed , Excellent location and good coffee making facilities 
32760,My Bloomsbury, Would have liked a hairdryer in the room and conditioner would have been much more useful than body scrub in the toiletries , Room and bathroom very clean and bed was comfy and bedding smelled fresh Staff very pleasant and location excellent a couple of minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road tube Exactly what I required for a business trip 
32761,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Small boutique hotel in great location Staff was very accomodating I wanted to switch to a diffrent room The coffee shop and brasserie next door are great Just whole concept works to every detail 
32762,My Bloomsbury, Shower head a bit dated and holder for it too high or too low Room was warm so opened window overlooking TCR then a bit traffic noisy, Beds are really comfy Room nicely decorated not too flashy Tea coffee water selection is good Shower pressure good Overall really liked it
32763,My Bloomsbury, For a superior room we expected a bigger room and were disappointed that the window was small with obscure glass and a blind looking onto roofs and a fire escape Disappointed for the money paid , Area fine nice reception girl and attached cafe for food 
32764,My Bloomsbury, Bathroom window looks like it needed a touch up Bath tub chipped Noise from corridor services closet , Great location Comfortable bed Clean and tidy 
32765,My Bloomsbury, Messed up on one of our reservations we had a confirmation from them with the nights but they did not in their system They told us that they were full and could do nothing to help One of our group members had to rush to find another hotel and pay a premium for it We found out later that they were not full when we looked online They took no responsibility and the customer service was awful Rooms are not as pictured some are closet sized and terribly old They downgraded us and did nothing about it Customer service was awful downgraded us and then pretended like they didn t and did nothing to fix rude staff after that No amenities no room service no helpful concierge The only good thing about this hotel was it s location but there are plenty of better hotels in that area and much more worth the money We will be making sure our company does not use this hotel anymore , Location
32766,My Bloomsbury, Bedroom furniture definitely tawdry And bathroom was tiny with deficient plumbing, Terrific location and fantastic staff these could not have been better five star Linens and towels were exceptional Tea coffee and biscuits every day in the room A real must for London travelers 
32767,My Bloomsbury, London really is very expensive but MyBloomsbury is still pricey all things considered My single room was located right opposite the elevator and had a lot of noise from that 209 GBP a night for a fairly small even if very tastefully decorated and noisy room is a lot , Great location After some help to catch the internet it worked just great Cool interior style helpful staff 
32768,My Bloomsbury, A miscommunication resulted about my free continental breakfast the wait staff did not explain it properly Th toilet was difficult to flush House keeping came at irractically so we had to hang out while it got done a number of times Good for the money but some quirks , Staff very helpful and friendly The decor was comfortable and chic 
32769,My Bloomsbury, Very nice suite on 5th floor but unfortunately had no functioning guest wifi Superior room on 1st floor rather tired but good wifi Bed rather tired and hot rooms on Tottenham Court Road side 1st floor very noisy Bathroom very cramped and tiles need grouting , Staff very pleasant Location is excellent Nice cafe 
32770,My Bloomsbury, I liked it all , Good location and good price friendly staff Rooms small but perfectly designed nicely decorated a great boutique hotel all you need in the room and beds and pillows really comfy 
32771,My Bloomsbury, Having to leave, Good location with very helpful and friendly staff It was my 21st birthday and we received a complimentary glass of champagne each and a birthday cake in the room Wonderful
32772,My Bloomsbury, Furniture and lighting pretty basic Fourth floor rooms have small high windows, Location is great among other advantages nearby Charlotte St Has many good restaurants and staff is very helpful 
32773,My Bloomsbury, Our room was rather small I had expected a larger room for the money but as we weren t really there to hang around at the hotel this was okay Our room was at the front of the building but wasn t noisy at all A great sleep had by us both Shower seal leaked and water got on my clothes I was going to put on There was a mix up with our booking and therefore extras I was aware that there were two bookings with the same surname so this could have been the reason but we were given free prosecco for the inconvenience which was very kind , Location was great staff friendly Gail s next door offered a lovely selection of patisserie 
32774,My Bloomsbury, I thought the breakfast was poor for 15 00 per head and slow and poor service Also we arrived back from the theatre at 10 30pm to find everything closed and had no alternative but go straight to our rooms ,No Positive
32775,My Bloomsbury, The access to the room that we stayed in was very tight with the door not opening fully , Staff were very helpful and provided additional provisions when asked i e milk etc 
32776,My Bloomsbury, The only very small thing I would say is the walls are very thin So you can hear what is going on around but it didn t bother us that much and we would still stay again , Staff were very friendly and the room was nice 
32777,My Bloomsbury, Room was on the small side , Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly Excellent location with lots of amenities nearby Would definitely stay again 
32778,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Hotel staff is very nice atmosphere is relaxed and rooms are modern comfortable Locations is great for exploring London Walking distance to soho and multiple underground stations 
32779,My Bloomsbury, Bathroom is a tight squeeze but perfectly functional , Compact and bijou but perfect for an overnight stay in London Easy access I prefer to walk than tube and everything was close by that I wanted Clean modern excellent room facilities big soft towels and friendly efficient staff 
32780,My Bloomsbury, The room cooridors and inside the room are very narrow hardly you can pass in the room The bath is very hard to get in and out Maybe the room is designed gor small people , Location is very good
32781,My Bloomsbury, The bathroom was a little small narrow , They have a really nice artisan bakery next door I recommend the scones and the croissants It is also located in a good area with Oxford Street within a walkable distance 
32782,My Bloomsbury, We had a superior room but it was still fairly small , The location was great near 2 tube stations and easy to walk to Covent garden Oxford Street Gail s bakery attached to the hotel had delicious pastries for breakfast 
32783,My Bloomsbury, We booked a superior double room that according to the pictures of booking and the hotel website would be light clean and just in general very nice We came in the hotel and this wasn t at all what we had in mind The staff was unfriendly and very bad to understand The room was old small dark en just overall dirty The bed wasn t a kingsize the blanket was too smal for 2 people and the carpet on the Floor was discusting The bathroom was far from clean the bathtub had a broken watertap the toilet didn t flush properly ans so on Breakfast wasn t in buffet for 15 per persoon we could only get scrambled eggs with Some bacon and 1 english muffin Overall we are very unhappy we never ever had such a bad experience hotel before This isn t even worth 2 stars I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone they should be ashamed to ask so much money for such horrible rooms We were in London for 1 night only and this really ru ned it for us ,No Positive
32784,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Very professional and accommodating staff who happily went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and valued Great access from TCR tube and close to Shaftesbury Theatre we will definitely re book 
32785,My Bloomsbury, The 1st room our friends had was great but mine and my friends room was awful The heating was not working the bathroom was freezing as the towel rail wasn t working we had someone come and see it but couldn t mend it Also the heating system units were outside our window which all came on at 5 45 in the morning making a terrible noise there was a step between the bedroom and bathroom which you could not see The room seems like a room that was used for over bookings did complain but won t go back As I booked it at the beginning of year I was very disappointed, Been to this hotel before and been really pleased so was happy to go there again but not after this trip
32786,My Bloomsbury, Our room wasn t as fancy as we expected like in the pictures but it was clean an nice anyway , Cool and modern atmosphere The breakfast was very good and much better than what we usually is served in a continental breakfast Very friendly staff The location var perfect We loved this hotel 
32787,My Bloomsbury, delayed check in was told to get a drink in the bar while we wait but this was not complimentary which I feel it should have been, The apartment was great rather than just one room Staff friendly Very good value for location
32788,My Bloomsbury, the room was ugly everything was askew from the bed to the towel hangers The bed was old and uncomfortable Nothing like the pictures on their website had I paid half the price it would have been fine but for the price it was a real disappointment The only good news is that London is a fabulous city so we didn t spend much time in the hotel , good location friendly staff but that s it 
32789,My Bloomsbury, Wifi signal poor and wifi support not given towel heater did not work the chair has a partially open back and cushion keeps sliding out housekeeping staff poor in English extremely slow service in Gail s Caf TV channels seems very UK centric adding DW NHK AJ and CNN may be good, Very helpful front desk staff really nice bed linen pillows and good size TV
32790,My Bloomsbury, We booked the hotel three months ago only to arrive and say the hotel was fully booked and we had to move from the booked double superior rooms to a single superior room the bed was 3 4 not a double as initially stated when we asked and with a 6ft partner it was not the ideal scenario we agreed to the change as we knew another hotel that short notice was going to be impossible without paying a lot of money but I am unimpressed and will not be returning as I paid for a luxury room and instead was left with what reminded me of a student halls room which was bang in front of the lift so meant we heard whenever anyone used it ,No Positive
32791,My Bloomsbury, The price of the mini bar was extortionate 2 25 for stubby bottle of spring water Thats more than a Litre of FUEL Small box of Pringles was roughly 3 50 also i could probably buy 3 jumbo sizes from shop round the corner First sign of a bad experience The Room had a constant sound humming throughout the night The soundproofing from the corridor was horrific also For a hotel charging people 140 240 a night in central London its pure robbery , The location was great the staff were friendly and the breakfast looked good but i wasnt paying 15 for it Croissants for 15 why bother when there is a Pret A Manger over the road 
32792,My Bloomsbury, Bath water hold the water Coffee machine didn t work Room was cold despite turning heating up Noises from the air vent unit or whatever it was kept me awake Handyman was banging early in the morning and the step as soon as you get into the room nearly broke my neck , Bed was comfy Location was really good 
32793,My Bloomsbury, Cost of room was a joke for a single room Room was untidy and very dusty Blind did not work correctly Mini bar and snacks a bit of a joke 3 50 for a 30g bag of popcorn Staff were a bit rude , Not a lot 
32794,My Bloomsbury, Wifi doesn t work on the 4th floor Floor in the bedroom was unbelievably squeaky everywhere No hot water after midnight Terrible soundproofing between room and corridor Old knackered and slow lift Depressing room decor , Location 
32795,My Bloomsbury, Lots of dirty stains on the carpet Carpet badly puckered and illfitting The mock brown leather sofa in the room The lack of voil curtains or voil blinds for privacy from the office buildings retail outlets The wardrobe would not accommodate hanging anything more in length than a shirt or Jacket The colour scheme applied to the bedrooms The constant noise throughout the night from the room below a neighbouring public house , Excellent location on main thoroughfare so close to Soho the shops and nightlife Large 3 cornered room with good views of the cosmopolitan and busy Tottenham Court Road Very comfy and extra large bed The nice white bed linen fluffly white towels and bathroom accessories shower gel etc 
32796,My Bloomsbury, Room was too small TV was mounted on the wrong wall sideways not opposite the beds , The location the bakery Bathroom is good size with plenty of natural light 
32797,My Bloomsbury, The single room was incredibly small no space even to put a suitcase You could touch opposite walls at all times The single bed was creaky and the toilet was very hard to flush required at least two goes Very old and inefficient lift , The location was great and the hotel staff friendly and helpful with any requests 
32798,My Bloomsbury, Everything was perfect , We upgraded our room once we got there to a penthouse suite for a small fee and we were so happy we did that We absolutely loved the room and the bathroom was amazing We also had a balcony with a view The location is amazing Loved everything about the hotel 
32799,My Bloomsbury, Disappointing continental breakfast We were not offered the option to pay for a cooked breakfast which we would have done , Excellent location for theatre Rooms had everything you could need but we re very plain 
32800,My Bloomsbury, Small room Mattress was definitely too soft A little expensive for the value of the room Yet fair price for London it seems , Excellent location close to Soho
32801,My Bloomsbury, Didn t get the twin bed room we ordered Hard to get good help from staff on the night we came Bought breakfast our first morning got wrong food We were not pleased with the service we got at the breakfast restaurant Slow and the staff didn t seem to hear our requests or pay attention to us , Excellent location Clean rooms and comfortable beds 
32802,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, This is a very good located hotel and the room was comfortable and spacious The staff is absolutely the best I ve ever met they re helpful have humor and will help you with anything you need 
32803,My Bloomsbury, The rooms are tired and small Plumbing is awful with toilet not flushing and water not draining from basin Complained and was moved to another room but not before being told that it was an old hotel therefore these problems were to be expected If this is the case it shouldn t be rated 4 stars and room prices should be adjusted accordingly The photos of the rooms on the website are not representative of the reality Hotel website also describes rooms as being designed in accordance with feng shui principles I really can t see how this is the case as hardly any room to swing a cat Apart from the location there is little to recommend this hotel It s tired and dated no way it s a 4 star and as such over priced , The location
32804,My Bloomsbury, Very loud Kept awake late into the night by noises from down stairs and woken up early by beer delivery Disturbed sleep very broken , Great food great location and very clean Bed was extremely comfortable and well decorated room 
32805,My Bloomsbury, The carpet in the room needs replacing and the toilet flush needed attention Otherwise the hotel was good There are external factors which you may wish to consider if you like the window open at night be prepared for some rowdy behaviour and early morning deliveries but that s par for the course in central London , The staff were helpful and friendly and the bed was comfortable The room and bathroom were clean A good location with tube stations within easy reach We would use the hotel again 
32806,My Bloomsbury, Only complaint was a housemaid knocking on the door at 9am on our last morning when check out wasn t until 11am Woke us from our sleep When I answered the door in my nightwear the idiot smiled said sorry and walked away That was my only complaint about My Bloomsberry , Location was excellent The rooms clean and the toiletries a nice touch mini bar was sell stocked Staff friendly and helpful A nice quiet hotel would recommend 
32807,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Rooms are small but nice quality touches such as the selections in the mini bar and hot drinks Also the toiletries were a nice brand Fantastic location for exploring the west end and throughly to st James and Westminster 
32808,My Bloomsbury, The cold tap to the bath did not work and when mentioned to front desk staff the offered to send matainance but did not apologise or offer a refund which for a room that cost just short of 150 for one night was not good enough , Quiet room comfy bed and good breakfast fabulous location
32809,My Bloomsbury, First room allocated had non functioning toilet Replacement room provided right beside Hotel lift Lift mechanism noisy so sleep affected Replacement room Key Card didn t work the first time either , Friendly and Helpful Staff Really well located for Shops and Restaurant s Tube station just a few minutes away Rooms kept very clean but are a bit small 
32810,My Bloomsbury, We weren t given a choice at breakfast we just got what was given a lot of it we didn t like so it went to waste We managed to get into someone else s room through our room by opening a door we thought was something like a walk in wardrobe which was very embarrassing we asked if we could have some kind of compensation and after waiting around 1 hour for a response by phone we were upgraded to another room which was basically the same although the window s weren t frosted, Most the staff were very friendly location was fairly good only 5 minutes walk from the underground station also they had a very easy and quick check out system
32811,My Bloomsbury, Wrong room standard double to start off with instead of booked superior when moved no additional seating as advertised interlocking room not correctly locked so had our next door neighbor come into our room breakfast not that good either , Location great staff in the hotel attentive 
32812,My Bloomsbury, Our room wasn t ready at check in time due to a larger amount of late check outs than normal This was the day we arrived from the States so we were exhausted They upgraded us to the penthouse , Nice cozy hotel just off beautiful Bedford Square easy to walk to Covent Garden West End theaters Trafalgar Square British Museum closest attraction of all plus lots of young working people felt like an area where people live and work not just visit 
32813,My Bloomsbury, I booked a twin room We took the last flight of the day and when we arrived the room was ready as a double bed and they had to make it as a twin at almost midnight , The bed were extremely comfortable and the location was perfect for the appointment we had to go to just 15 minutes away 
32814,My Bloomsbury, We couldn t stay any longer , It was my boyfriends birthday and they added a balloon cake to our room I am really grateful for this thank you
32815,My Bloomsbury, Two bathrobes would have been better than one to share The room needs a mirror two in the bathroom but no good if that s in use , Clean and comfortable Pleasant staff We had a superior room 502 which was very nice Excellent shower nice bathroom 
32816,My Bloomsbury, The restaurant is not really open at night you can have a drink but the kitchen was clised which means no room service either but there s lit of take away shops around ,No Positive
32817,My Bloomsbury, Water temperatures in the shower were a bit hard to regulate would briefly turn scalding for a few seconds then return to normal but really not a big issue , Great location very helpful staff cute room a lovely personal feel
32818,My Bloomsbury, Couldn t check in til after 4pm that s 2 hrs after advertised time we were busy lots of check outs Half eaten cracker found under the bed where they rushed the cleaning I guess Mirror in drawer for hairdryer impossible to stand anywhere Constant aircon noise from unit outside window Superior room was not impressive site photos are flattering furniture tired Could hear guests in next room 2 70 for bag of crisps in minibar Phone to reception barely worked All in all a bit rubbish , Good location nice bathroom
32819,My Bloomsbury, We were in a room which was right on the busy road On the first night Friday the noise didn t bother me from the outside however on Saturday it did This was due to toothache though so if you re a heavy sleeper it ll be perf , Bed was comfy and location was fab about 5 minutes from Oxford Street The staff were also very friendly and helpful 
32820,My Bloomsbury, None , The staff here are very nice and help me with a lot of things as I come here alone Warm and cosy small room The bathroom is also clean and tidy 
32821,My Bloomsbury, Incredibly noisy from the street so no fresh air and even when both windows were shut noise was still audible I get it London is a busy city There was also a lot of noise through the plumbing at regular intervals and a rattley air conditioner although it was not in use The room was never quiet , Comfortable bed good coffee provided and a bath 
32822,My Bloomsbury, The room was not as appeared on the booking com website Apparently there are newer and better furnished rooms i wasn t in one Carpet VERY dirty stained TV in awkward position drab room Not nice at all for the price The entrance is nice but as soon as you get out of the lift it is disappointing , Staff were responsive when I explained the room was sub standard However why charge the same for older rooms which are in desperate need for an upgrade and don t reflect the website Location very good 
32823,My Bloomsbury, We paid a bit more for the superior room which was very disappointing Scuffs on the walls battered furniture not enough room to open the door properly and only one bedside table because it was that small Disappointing when you ve seen the photos and description on this website and the hotels own website and are lead to believe you are staying somewhere totally different Not a nice feel to the room at all Also paid extra for Continental breakfast which was insubstantial if I was to stay here again which I won t I wouldn t bother with the breakfast , The bed was very comfy and the reception staff were friendly The best thing was the location walking distance to so much in central London 
32824,My Bloomsbury, The only problem was that the walls were too thin We could hear the tv noises and other people talking from the other rooms all the time , The interior design of the hotel was very lovely very London like And the staff were super friendly which was really nice coming back from a long day of seeing only grumpy faces of londoners Hahaa
32825,My Bloomsbury, Three false fire alarms in the night and no apology or real response from the staff We had to go down to the front desk to be told there was a fault with the system We then had a wake up call at 4am with explanation or APOLOGY Tiny room could barely pass between the bed which was fold up and the wall shocking for almost 300 GBP a night No help with luggage on arrival or departure These are five star prices with three star rooms and two star service ,No Positive
32826,My Bloomsbury, Room not being ready yet booking com asking what time I wanted to check in and the fire alarm waking us in the night , Friendly staff Access to a shower room as our room wasn t ready as we re there for an event Great location Clean and modern 
32827,My Bloomsbury, Furniture in the room a little dated and flooring shabby No doubt due for a refresh was a late ish booking Having said this the painted walls were clean fresh , Fantastic location nice urban relaxed feel to the hotel Very clean 
32828,My Bloomsbury, Poor air conditioning although I was offered a fan Back room noisy next to all the vents and not able to have the window open, Location just off Tottenham Court Road and walking distance to Covent Garden Lovely bakery next door is great Lots of choice nearby for breakfast and better value than the hotel at 15 
32829,My Bloomsbury, We were a party of 5 persons in 3 rooms Review above is for our room However one room was very poor being very small and with no air conditioning One of our party was therefore disappointed and the others embarrassed Rather took the shine off of our weekend ,No Positive
32830,My Bloomsbury, Very oddly greeted by a chance to upgrade from a superior twin room to two non superior singles which I assume based on reviews I had read before booking were small and uncomfortable rooms not to be recommended and very unhappy staff when we wanted to keep our prepaid superior room instead of checking us in they thought it more important to go on the phone to say that room XX will be staying to whoever wanted to sell our room twice bad manners to do that before finishing check in of the customers in front of you The toilet in the bathroom had a loose flushing handle it was badly attached at an angle and looked and felt like it might fall off any second and did not flush properly Told staff and they dismissed it with oh it s like that you just have to pump it a few times The bar cafe in the lobby had extremely loud music in the evening It was painfully loud Actual my ears hurt and I can t think get me out of here loud so impossible to have a drink or snack there , Great location superbly comfy beds and bedding Surprisingly decent mini bar wine Would not stay again 
32831,My Bloomsbury, Nothing , Great location large single bed great air conditioning pleasant staff express checkout comfy bed All round good for 118 which was a discount But for central London I can t complain 
32832,My Bloomsbury, Hotel was very tired I won t call it boutique I would say pokey Everything looked grubby My sink was blocked Needs updating bedcover and cushions were very dated looking, Relaxed atmosphere and good location for Covent Garden
32833,My Bloomsbury, We booked a superior room Quite small but adequate for one night A little disappointed on the bathroom Fixed shower screen and so difficult to get into the bath for a shower as toilet so close Plus there s a nack to flushing the toilet , Location fantastic Staff excellent and friendly so accommodating Value for money Bed comfortable 
32834,My Bloomsbury, The room was very small and there was not a desk in the first room I got Airconditioning was not working staff were okay about it but couldn t offer me another room the first night but was offered a fan Also internet was not working proporly slow and tedious to log into , Common areas and staff where nice
32835,My Bloomsbury, The room itself Extremely small Even the TV didn t fit in front of the bed The mini bar was next to my head when I laid down on my bed The bathroom horrible too Booking must show room by room pictures so each Customer can really know what are you paying for Not nice to see 42 pictures where 20 are from the best room and the rest are miscellaneous photos from a lamp a meal or the city Weird thing about the breakfast If you order it from menu is cheaper and more generous than the continental offer Same products but cheaper , Front desk were very kind They allowed me to do an early check in Very nice location Price was OK 
32836,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Great location and value for money was informed Air Con in room not working on arrival which wasnt a major problem However we were given a large fan in the room and free breakfast each which we hadnt booked
32837,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Great location with fairly well sized room for London standards The hotel has a small reception without concierge and has a lift The room included complimentary water a coffee machine kettle and fridge We had a cot available for our 2 year old with adequate space left in the room for our luggage There are lots of places to eat nearby with the tube being close also Would stay here again 
32838,My Bloomsbury, The photos of the place look incredible like a 4 star hotel and really boutique however the room we had felt tired with cracks in the wall and basic furniture could do with a bit of TLC as the photos of the place were not what we got in reality, Location was great and was a clean and welcoming hotel
32839,My Bloomsbury, air con was broken on arrival at 10 pm and a very warm evening although I was upgraded the room was poor No ironing facility in the room and the phone did not work to call down to reception to get an iron The bathroom was not clean Overall cheap but very dated good location and the staff were polite,No Positive
32840,My Bloomsbury, I don t know if we got a superior room we did not have a seating area , The location was very good for everything The room was very clean and had a modern feel to it
32841,My Bloomsbury, shower door was broken so water leaked out to the bathroom floor it was room 416 , extra friendly staff lovely interiors for room roomy bathroom comfy bed yet slightly small close to oxford street 
32842,My Bloomsbury, Even though we arrived after check in time we had to wait over an hour for our room as it had not been cleaned Despite booking a superior double room it was pretty standard and not like advertised on website , Location was good
32843,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Extremely polite friendly staff AC problem in my room as was the case with most hotels in London on the day fan supplied discounted rate offered happy days
32844,My Bloomsbury, Air conditioning in the bedrooms didn t work it was very hot but we were provided with a fan on request , This hotel was brilliant We ate at the onsite restaurant the food was fabulous Would highly recommend the French toast with bacon or fruit the freshly baked cookies milk Also recommend tryin something from the onsite bakery too 
32845,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Really lovely decor excellent location clean and new Eco friendly shampoo and conditioner was lovely Tea and coffee was of good variety and free Staff were very helpful and accommodated many needs including an adapter to charge my phone Towels were large Rooms were spacious nil complaints 
32846,My Bloomsbury, 1 The toilet didn t work properly and the staff didn t particularly care to fix it 2 Staff needs retraining on customer service or find another job doing something else they d prefer to do London is a large city and destination for international travelers if your front desk staff isn t interested in giving simple directions to the City of London s largest attractions they should work in the back do something else or fix their personal problems in which they may have with helping guests Laticia 3 Change the name of the hotel why do you have same name as another hotel in walking distance to yours My phone died and I had trouble finding this property by name ,No Positive
32847,My Bloomsbury, Wasn t given the correct room had booked a superior double and was given a standard Even though I had confirmed the status of the room when being given the room key After seeing the room and questioning it I was then informed there weren t any superior rooms left They d given me a less superior room in the hope I wouldn t notice ,No Positive
32848,My Bloomsbury, Quality of room poor especially for the price Bathroom layout very poor loose toilet cistern and difficult to flush due to position Bath sealant in need of renewal ,No Positive
32849,My Bloomsbury, Some people noisy when using the passage to get to their rooms lift slow but always working , Towels were large thick and soft Internet was fine Not big rooms but large enough especially when out most of the time 
32850,My Bloomsbury, The flush on the toilet didn t work properly and you had to push down on it a few times for it to work Air conditioning was a bit ineffectual , The bed was very comfortable and facilities were more than expected in the room 
32851,My Bloomsbury, WiFi was very slow and partly non existent There was a fire escape outside my room which someone was moving up and down on at 11 30pm and early morning , Love the Gails being in the lobby very handy for snacks and coffee 
32852,My Bloomsbury, If i was being really picky the lift was a bit squeaky and small but that wouldnt stop me going back , Big TV comfy bed posh teas and coffees in the room And the main reason i would return are the amazing helpful and friendly staff 
32853,My Bloomsbury, The room itself and the ensuite were tiny Also the breakfast was very overpriced at 30 for the 2 of us for a continental breakfast So we chose to use one of the coffee shops right outside the hotel at a fraction of the price , The location was fantastic and the main reason we chose to stay there The room was clean too 
32854,My Bloomsbury, Our room was not ready when we arrived We had also booked a z bed which was confirmed on our arrival at reception but wasn t in the room , The staff were friendly welcoming and helpful We requested an iron and ironing board which was bought straight up to our room The restaurant was amazing Generous portions and very attentive staff 
32855,My Bloomsbury, Superior room quite small with no curtains only blinds Breakfast tray in lounge included ham and we are vegetarian Ham was removed and extra cheese added to same tray No evening meal available at the hotel as dining closed at 3pm , Bed good 
32856,My Bloomsbury, The staff seemed slightly undertrained There were a few hiccups with our room and the staff members were all a bit confused It would be good to have at least 1 senior member of staff on duty at all times However the hotel runs such that you really don t ever need to interact with the staff even for checkout so normally this shouldn t be an issue , The superior room was excellent Really spacious and with a large bathroom which came with great products Very clean and well maintained Many notches above your typical London hotel standard Gail s bakery and kitchen was also excellent Perfect location 
32857,My Bloomsbury, The windows are sometimes not easy to open and the blinds chains rather delicate Mine came undone but luckily I was able to put it together again The down side of the quiet rooms are the kitchen smells that waft up through the window , The room I was in was bright and quiet and had everything one needed for a one night stay 
32858,My Bloomsbury, The toilet wouldn t flush it took several attempts to work It was quite noisy but there was work being done on the 2 floors above us so we understood , The hotel was perfect location and the staff could not do enough for us the rooms were spotlessly clean and comfy bed 
32859,My Bloomsbury, Had a double rooom as a single traveller Not much space in room shower temperature fluctuated to very hot which was worrying Minibar prices a bit on high side so shopped across the road at local Sainsburys for snacks, Hotel location was great close to transport links good restaurants with lovely English pub on the corner I didnt have breakfast so cant rate food offering Staff extremely helpful
32860,My Bloomsbury, the washroom was very unsafe and dangerous the tub shower was raised off the floor and had a stationary glass partition at the front of the tub shower you had to step over the toilet to enter or exit the tub shower there was no grab bar but there was a very hot towel rack which could burn you if touch when trying to enter or exit the tub shower the toilet was quirky you had to flush at least two times after each use you could hear people in other rooms,No Positive
32861,My Bloomsbury, I tried to pay for the crisps eaten from the mini bar when I checked out was told we could have them on the house only to find when I returned home that they were charged to my card Not a major issue but the only thing I could think of to change , Everything the decor the bed the roof terrace 
32862,My Bloomsbury, Room not very clean Restaurant totally shut for a private party Toilet roll holder cleverly positioned so that only the tiniest person would avoid being jabbed by it whilst using the toilet Nice view of a wall , Location
32863,My Bloomsbury, They charged 10 extra the only things we had in our room which we had was the tea and coffe even used tap water to fill the kettle and the shower gel which in other hotels are free, Bed comfy
32864,My Bloomsbury, Knock on the door just after 8 00am asking when we were checking out, Comfortable and quiet room on top floor which is what we requested Good firm bed clean bathroom wide selection of complimentary teas and coffees Excellent choice of restaurants in streets opposite the hotel 
32865,My Bloomsbury, I have no idea very deceptive very different with your detail I arrived too lately that room was too big with one double bed and one single bed at the corner very far away from room to elevator I made a reservation for me one single small room nearby elevator first floor but I found very different with photos because of my big heavy broken down luggage, kichnet
32866,My Bloomsbury, Very small room very warm even with aircon toilet wouldn t flush properly damp patch on carpet had just gone to sleep with young daughter when extremely loud fire alarm came on for a short while twice , Was able to check in earlier than expected Polite efficient staff Good location Modern Good bakery next door 
32867,My Bloomsbury, nothing, Service on check in was excellent They were properly prepared and aware of some special requirements I arrived early and was given an office to work in while I waited Attention to detail was fantastic as my sister and I were surprising our mother for her 80th birthday A cake And an upgrade for her Nothing appeared to be too much trouble 
32868,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Loved location style of room and Gail s kitchen Carpet in the hallways and room make it look a bit run down though Maybe floorboards or a sterdier plain new carpet would revamp what doesn t look right Everything else was perfect Thanks
32869,My Bloomsbury, The room was tiny and not represented as such on the photos on the website Barely any decoration in the main bedroom no curtains a plain blind pictures or decorative elements other than simple cushions , Location was convenient
32870,My Bloomsbury, Booked a superior room but the room was not what I expected the pictures I was shown when booking where not what I got the room was nice enough but not as nice as the one I thought we d be in , Good location lovely little bakery underneath comfy bed clean which is my main concern in any hotel 
32871,My Bloomsbury, I was very suprised I did not like my experience here as I had high expectations First thing was there was feather everything pillows and duvet The staff changed the pillows for me but I was allergic to the room the whole time so much so I had to take anti histamines Secondly the toliet did not flush well You had to press it several times And despite the bathroom looking clean there were hairs on the towel and when my room was cleaned the second day my toothbrush was just placed down on the sink And finally the elevator was incredibly slow And there was only one Since my room was near the elevator it was also very noisy So not the most restful stay , The location was great I really liked the lighting in the room It was very bright I also liked the placement of the mirrors in the room 
32872,My Bloomsbury, Room is small We were a bit disappointed when we walked in It s the same as in the picture if you look carefully but I guess the picture makes it look with more space , Great location The stuff are welcoming The atmosphere is cozy and vibrant 
32873,My Bloomsbury, Single room bathroom was very small there wasn t enough leg room I m only 5 10 between the toilet and the shower cubicle The room was also quite noisy rooftop units not street noise , Very good location for the British Museum and Oxford street 
32874,My Bloomsbury, The double bed is actually two single beds combined it s uncomfortable if you are used to sleep in the middle of the bed , This is my second stay in this Hotel and hopefully won t be my last Very friendly staff Room and bathroom were very clean Gail s Coffee is one of the best in London The location can not be more central You are a walking distance to the trendy restaurants of Charlotte st and shops of Oxford st 
32875,My Bloomsbury, The rooms are a bit on the smallish side although to the hotels credit everything is clearly mentioned upon booking , This is my second stay at MyHotel Bloomsbury and each time I love it even more The hotel has a comfortable cozy feel to it and great staff the staff are really really attentive and polite I am a fan of the Bloomsbury area and this hotel is perfect for it The location is great a couple of minutes walking to the British Museum and the great restaurants on Charlotte Street Covent Garden the West End Oxford Street and so many more nice areas are also nearby The area is also well connected as there are numerous bus stops as well as Tottenham Court Road Station which is a few minutes away Also an added plus is that upon reaching the lobby area in the morning you re greeted by the beautiful coffee aroma coming from Gails Bakery on the ground floor and a gorgeous array of pastries that are hard to resist 
32876,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, We stayed here for my birthday The staff were amazing and had even left a birthday cake and ballon in my room Lots of nice toiletries Large robes and slippers given as standard The pillows were huge and the room was extremely large We will definitely be returning 
32877,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Surprisingly quiet and spacious rooms clean and comfortable accommodation great central location wonderful breakfast spot downstairs I couldn t recommend this property any higher It will be my choice of place to stay for any future visit to London 
32878,My Bloomsbury, The shower unit was awful The water splashed out of the bath tube no matter how careful you are The whole bathroom will be wet after a shower The decor is tired The bed was too soft , The location is perfect for a short trip It is close to oxford street and tube station It s great The staff are very friendly and helpful 
32879,My Bloomsbury, There was no room service available or rather there was a room service available but nothing to order with the exception of a toasted sandwich, The area neighbourhood and breakfast
32880,My Bloomsbury, Booked a superior room with breakfast didn t get a superior room and they tried to charge me for a breakfast that I had already paid for , Location
32881,My Bloomsbury, Mini bar was very expensive 3 50 for a small bag of M Ms is day light robbery Also whatever was above our room it was extremely noisey my girlfriend didn t sleep all night, The room was clean and the bed was sooooooo comfy 
32882,My Bloomsbury, Don t bother with the standard breakfast it was really poor considering the expectations of Gail s Kitchen If you buy their breakfast up front you get a tray of continental breakfast my toast was burnt and offered no extras none of their raved about pastry or coffee Only allowed standard tea Shame , Great location Nice hotel Room considering it was supposed to be a larger double was a bit small and bathroom was very cold Good tea and coffee and comfy bed 
32883,My Bloomsbury, didnt like feathered pillow would like different option toilet pressure was poor takes 10 attempts to flush traffic noise was quite loud , very close to the centre coffee facilities were good shower pressure was good 
32884,My Bloomsbury, My room was a shame It s not deserves to be called a room it was a large closet that I paid 200 sterling a night for The toilet can t be used for people over 5 years old ,No Positive
32885,My Bloomsbury, I booked a superior room for my other halfs birthday we got to the room and it was tiny looked nothing like the pictures on the Internet We had 2 single beds pushed up together which made us both extremely uncomfortable I do not understand what was superior I will not be recommending this hotel ,No Positive
32886,My Bloomsbury, Staff did their jobs Functional not very engaging Condition of room was sad and needed a bit of care Bathroom ceiling is peeling Remote for tele did not work iPod dock did not work either and was a really dated model Glad for the extra space offered Daughter left her scarf returned 4 hours later and staff could not find it Waited 20 mins and gave up , Location great Upgraded to suite but only after being asked to take two singles Think this was more about over booking than a nice gesture Did leave a cake for my daughters 21st Which was nice 
32887,My Bloomsbury, No soap Scuffed edges on bedside table A double room but only 1 side table on my own so not so important Breakfast Gails very over priced , Perfect location
32888,My Bloomsbury, It s quite noisy and you can hear everyone s movements doors closing etc , The location is great with lots of shops and facilities near by The room is a decent sort of size for London though the shower and bathroom is really small The staff are friendly and helpful 
32889,My Bloomsbury, after a hour of being in the room a maid decided to walk in without knocking Thought that was a bit strange Could have been embarrassing , Beds were very comfortable and room was lovely and clean 
32890,My Bloomsbury, Double standard room very small for cost Bathroom barely enough for one Bathtub so deep hard to get out of safely Beds made up late in the day , Location Bakery restaurant downstairs nice staff
32891,My Bloomsbury, The room was a bit colder than I expected Didn t know how to activate a heater The room was not equipped with safe box , Friendly staff cozy room though very small 
32892,My Bloomsbury, The photographs of the superior rooms are NOT the superior rooms these are photos of the suites the superior double felt like a standard double not designer or boutique hotel standard the beds are not king size do not be fooled I think there are only a couple of suites and these are booked usually I was disappointed in the room but we paid 120 only if I had paid more I would have been unhappy as i hate being mislead or tricked in this way change the photos please thank you, Good location Nice lobby and bar breakfast area Just behind british museum Clean enough 
32893,My Bloomsbury, The blackout blind in the room was ineffective as it was fixed a few inches away from the window so light spilled through anyway Not great when surrounded by bright lights and traffic through the night , I enjoyed the locality of the hotel as it was so close to all amenities I also appreciated ease of booking as it took no time at all 
32894,My Bloomsbury, House Keeping knocking on door at 830 am on the morning of check out and twice after 10 even though check out is not till 12 , Excellent Location clean rooms and comfortable beds
32895,My Bloomsbury, bathroom outdated very difficult getting into and out of bath shower around bath shower screen and hot towel rail shower head would not stay in upright position bath would not drain toilet would not flush heat in shower was very irregular , location was brilliant beds and pillows are amazing very quiet no noise from street bakery below was beautiful and fresh 
32896,My Bloomsbury, The bed was a bit hard Noisy on a Friday summer evening from the pub next door, Cleanliness of the room and style Air conditioning Close to tube entertainment and parks
32897,My Bloomsbury, First standard doubleon the 4 fkoor was not nice We needed to switch It was So small The walls needed painting and the toilet handle broken Also no place to relax No lobby or bar , Location price
32898,My Bloomsbury, The room in my opinion was not up to 4 star quality the furniture was a little tired and the room was not as nice as the pictures looked on the internet the ceiling was very dirty in the room along with the tired skirting and walls , The effort put into my daughters birthday had balloons a note a cake and a teddy bear which was so sweet 
32899,My Bloomsbury, Only the somewhat small space in the standard room albeit totally adequate for purpose i e short stay on this occasion , Friendliness of staff room quietness very comfortable bed exquisite shower nice coffee tea facilities
32900,My Bloomsbury, The room I had was facing the backyard another building and had some really loud AC machine noises so it was not entirely quiet but otherwise it was not too bad Definitely not a problem if you are not a light sleeper , Location interior and friendly staff
32901,My Bloomsbury, MyHotel Bloomsbury is a bit overpriced but for us it did worth every penny couse of its location Breakfast comes as an extra for 15 person and it s not much but incredibly delicious Besides the hotel is the indoor connected neighbor of a good restaurant and bakery The toilet doesn t flash easily you have to be tricky and find the way , Perfectly located clean little hotel with kind helpful stuff comfortable beds and a delicious breakfast possibility It s two minutes walk from everything you ll need underground main bus lines restaurants and so on 
32902,My Bloomsbury,No Negative, Loved the hotel It was beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice Our room was quite clean cosy and spacious enough for 2 people The staff were lovely I was emailing them before arrival and the service was perfect Qaiser was a great help and sorted out an issue for us so thanks again Will be booking here for my next stay in London
