372609,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, We didn t pay the breakfast inclusive rate and glad we didn t The breakfast buffet in hotel is very basic with much better options in restaurants close by , Hotel was clean functional and ideal for the beach Less than 10 minute walk to metro and an abundance of good restaurants within short walking distance 
372610,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, The hotel shows areas of getting worn out This is visible in many ways in the room floors elevator rust in bathroom shower going from cold to very hot broken seats on balcony TV not working For a room of Euro 200 night for family rooms we stayed in much better hotels in Barcelona The worn out is visibile in the surrounding area as well , Location is great as it is on walking distance of the beach and withn 10 minutes walk from the subway Breakfast was included with plenty of choice Friendly staff Quiet area balcony with side sea view Good price for a family room Good beds and it was clean When you just need a good and quiet sleep this is a good choice 
372611,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, Booking a double room and being given a twin with a disabled bathroom surly singular receptionist basic food menu dirty top bed covers no duvet broken curtains didn t close poor view Not attractive at all basic budget place for mid price Not value for money , The clean white sheets
372612,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, Cleaning should be better Maid should clear the waste in the bin everyday , Good location for me to do business at CCIB Diagonal Mar It is near the beach good weather and I have a good scene 
372613,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, Bit overrated overpriced given rooms are very basic No kettle in room Some Staff members need to consider a simple smile, Excellent location Some of staff were very helpful David was great thanks
372614,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, Beds were uncomfortable and were very squeaky Bathroom was not very clean Breakfast was overpriced and was very disappointing We flew in early in the morning from the US the staff was not at all accommodating in trying to find us a room They just recommended we go out and come back at 2pm for check in, Was close to the beach with options for restaurants 
372615,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, The reception staff was not very friendly The equipment of the room was minimal for the price paid The hotel is not very new in relation to the price paid and considering that it is a 4 star , The location of the hotel is very close to the beach Marbella and the room was nice clean spacious bright and the bed was comfortable 
372616,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, the bed sheets seemed not clean yellowish and it didnt smell crispy fresh we visited during French Rugby championship and there were a lot if interested customers and i think Hotel knew that there will be a high demand so it wasnt superb care of how the rooms will be Also they provide shaving kit but not a body lotion why ,No Positive
372617,Eurohotel Diagonal Port, Although towels were changed and bed made every morning but the room and bathroom was never cleaned Uncomfortable beds , Staff were friendly and polite
