193679,The Marylebone Hotel, The rooms are VERY SMALL and the bathroom is even SMALLER Though it is very clean and updated The staff was extremely helpful and the doormen are terrific The nightly chocolate and cookies are a nice treat The hotel is in a great safe location just a 5 minute walk to the Bond St tube stop Terrific Italian restaurants just around the corner and lots of local pubs and shopping ,No Positive
193680,The Marylebone Hotel, Slightly odd smell in room didn t raise to reception as we were hardly in there and used a scented candle for a London location hotel security a bit weak have known hotels were every door and lift is key card controlled and whilst that s a nuisance getting around these are sadly the times we live in , Service first class superb location good quality food nice mix of things included in price e g Wifi gym pool etc felt well looked after good reception very helpful storing lugggage after checkout so we could enjoy our last day in London air con in room welcome for unexpected warm weather we had sweets and cold drinks on arrival in room Nice interiors Just a very good hotel 
193681,The Marylebone Hotel, Taking 30 immediately off my card on arrival for incidentals wasn t a problem but having to wait days to have it put back onto my card is Since we didn t have any extras Im still waiting for it to be returned to my card Not happy at all about this This needs addressing , Well situated easy street parking close to bars restaurants Mix up over the booking but staff put us us at ease offering coffee whilst it was sorted Very pleasant 
193682,The Marylebone Hotel, Rooms are a little dingy and need a facelift Housekeeping was pretty poor the first few nights then we complained and they improved , We loved 108 The restaurant the waiters were great Good gym and pool downstairs concierge very helpful Area was the best part 
193683,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing , We were here in early July 2017 for one night something like 2PM 5AM in order to attend a concert at the nearby Wigmore Hall The walk being all of five minutes the location was clearly superb for that purpose Our early flight and the resulting short stay did mean that we did not experience many facilities of this property but our stay was fine in every way we needed it to be 
193684,The Marylebone Hotel, The lighting in bathroom was very poor The addition of a aluminated vanity mirror would help greatly , The overall feel of the hotel was very relaxed It almost felt like a boutique hotel 
193685,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, We arrived in the middle of a heatwave and were greeted with cool lemon water and hot towels at checkin Bottled water was available in the lobby to take with you on leaving the hotel each day Staff were lovely
193686,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, this hotel was perfect for me healthy room service menu complete with juices and amazing salads bed was the most comfortable I ve had in a hotel and the staff were amazing everyone Also appreciate the free water in the room and the nice chocolates as well as the aromatherapy body lotion
193687,The Marylebone Hotel, The room was a standard European twin room It was very compact and hard to walk between the bed and the desk I always hit my shoulder on the TV that was mounted on the wall So the value for the room was quite low for such a small room My room faced the roof of the building below with a view of the AIR HANDLERS And a little bit of sky I had requested a nicer room and none was available I had also requested a 2 pm checkin and the room was not available untile 3 45 during which time I was nicely treated to a free cup of cappuchino The bathroom was very very small and needed some minor repairs as there was water damage to the floor boards around the tub and the sink granite top was splitting The gym is a private facility chain called the THIRD SPACE and the entry is complimentary since is is in the hotel building Although the gym was superb it was VERY VERY CROWDED between 0730 and 0930 Basically the entire gym was crowded with Trainers working 1 1 or in small groups I am a U S national figure skating champion and highly athletic and was made to feel unwelcome during peak hours Basically the trainers glare at you like you are in the way You have to be very assertive to find a free space and stake your claim to it otherwise there were about 9 trainers at any one time There should be some limit on how many trainers can be monopolizing the entire gym during a set period Obviously there were people using the gym from the hotel and without a trainer and it was VERY hard for us to find a piece of equipment or room available The hotel should list the times for the group classes so hotel guest don t bother showing up then since I was only able to use the Ballet room and Ceiling cables with bars in late afternoon or evenings , The room has a tea maker and Nespresso machine with endless amounts of coffee refills Toiltetries provided were very nice Room service was outstanding Breakfast at the 108 Pantry was OUTSTANDING Highly recommend it Location was OUTSTANDING The gym included in the hotel stay was SUPER and the pool was very large There was a great steam room and sauna and all of the changing facilities were like a major gym 
193688,The Marylebone Hotel, The rooms are very small , We loved this hotel Modern fresh decor Super friendly staff who couldn t have been more helpful Fantastic location around the corner from Harley Street where we had an appt the purpose of our stay and to the rear of Oxford Street for shopping The hotel provided a helpful little booklet map about all the individual and interesting shops in Marylebone High Street also round the corner where we had a very pleasant afternoon exploring The pool was one of the nicest of any London hotels we have stayed at Beautiful decor soft lighting smelled heavenly A tranquil spa like experience We would stay here every time we are in London if we could but they had no family rooms when we tried to rebook Cafe and restaurant on site and complimentary fresh fruit flavoured water on tap 
193689,The Marylebone Hotel, It was rather expensive but on the whole we were glad we chose the hotel, The room was extremely comfortable nice temperature and very clean The beds were extremely comfortable The staff were so friendly and courteous and always had a smile for you 
193690,The Marylebone Hotel, The bathroom was very small and difficult to get into certainly not big enough for 2 people to be in together , Could not really fault the hotel other than the bathroom it was clean well maintained and well presented My wife enjoyed the spa and swimming pool Breakfast was very nice too 
193691,The Marylebone Hotel, Toilet didn t flush properly door to room would get stuck on the carpet when you opened the door , Flavored water at the reception area was a nice touch Super friendly staff 
193692,The Marylebone Hotel, The size of the room was VERY disappointing It would have been fine for X1guest The bathroom was especially small and the extractor fan didn t work As a result the room smelled of stale water and when we showered the room was then full of steam Given the temperatures outside during our visit this led to a very unpleasant experience I did alert the reception staff but the problem wasn t rectified I would have expected at the very least a response from them and maybe even another room I sometimes think that unless you book direct with hotels you are allocated inferior rooms and that complaints etc are not at the top of their list The first night Thursday was very expensive for what we got not value for money , The staff especially Shaun at the door was very helpful We could have missed our train home had he not alerted us to road closures re pride march We were then able to travel to KX earlier than we had planned The location was good for us as we were attending the cricket at Lords 
193693,The Marylebone Hotel, Rooms very small with little storage space Ok for overnight stay but problem for longer stay We had to upgrade to a bigger room for our ten day stay , Staff were most helpful and welcoming Location was convenient two minutes from the Wallace Cillection Marylebone High Street quite near Oxford Street too 
193694,The Marylebone Hotel, It is a bit pricey and renovation works for their events facilities started at 7 am it was a week day and it is not permanent however it was quite unpleasant to hear someone drilling when one is trying to get some shut eye relatively early in the morning , The location is amazing smack in the heart of the Marylebone area the staff is very friendly and professional the bed and the pillows are extremely comfy Guests have access to gym facilities part of a chain so not your typical sparse hotel gym 
193695,The Marylebone Hotel, Vent was leacking so the floor under it was wet all time my room was right across the rubbish room and staff room So every morning early morning I ve been waken up by sounds of breaking glass and staff laughter Not what you expect from your vacation Defenattely not for this kind of money ,No Positive
193696,The Marylebone Hotel, Everything was fine , GREAT LOCATION friendly staff very near Oxford Street and Marylebone High Street Lovely local shops and restaurants Quiet hotel very welcoming A pleasure to stay there We will return 
193697,The Marylebone Hotel, I found the room rate too high given the size of the room etc , Very friendly staff Having the use of the large gym and pool was very fantastic Bed was very comfortable 
193698,The Marylebone Hotel, Everything was to my satisfaction , The lobby was especially homey And when the staff saw how jet lagged I was they hooked me up with a different room ASAP instead of making me wait for my room 
193699,The Marylebone Hotel, To start off with the room was VERY small but considering the price for London it was acceptable The room was basically falling apart the window rim was lifted off so you can see the inside of the walls The bathroom had a leaking problem and water was drilling from the gap between the light and the ceiling I was transferred to a smaller room for one night All bedsheets and pillow cases had weird stains or black marks on them Also the towels were dry and old you can tell they ve reused them for a longtime The food from 108 Brassiere is very average and they charge a 4 tray charge which I haven t seen at any other hotels I ve stayed at If you don t hang the do not disturb sign AND lock your door there will be staff knocking every 30 mins sometimes I open the door and they just say sorry and leave Overall you should spend a little more for a better hotel I would say this one is a three star level by my standards , The staff were very friendly
193700,The Marylebone Hotel, The bathroom was too small for two people Overall the hotel was excellent the thing that most let it down was the restaurant food okay but waiting staff not great service took too long and although had booked room only as wanted to have freedom in terms of breakfast choice venue when using the restaurant the constant reminder of not having a package coupled with long delays was a little annoying to say the least , The bedroom and bed were very comfortable well presented etc Reception and Concierge staff very good friendly and attentive Great location close to lots of shops bars restaurants etc and 5 minute walk to Oxford Street 
193701,The Marylebone Hotel, Curtains and carpet old some stains need cleaning and or replacement given the high price and luxury rating , Great location Excellent service Heated floor in bathroom 
193702,The Marylebone Hotel, Very small rooms even when booked the superior room Breakfast not replaced Asked for meeting room but there was no interest from reception desk to be anyway helpful , Excellent location near to everything especially for shopping Restaurant ok 
193703,The Marylebone Hotel, Advised no hot or cold water after 10pm Fire alarm going off in the middle of the night only briefly and obviously a false alarm but no explaination given , Thought the guys at the entrance were great full of enthusiasm and created a good first impression We were celebrating our anniversary so great to find a bottle of Processco macaroons waiting for us late afternoon Bar had a good atmosphere Location
193704,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, The staff was brilliant kind enough to offer an extra drink as I was wrecked after the British Airways cancelled my flight and I was stuck in London The room was perfect clean and modern I used the swimming pool that was also great Close to restaurants and some shopping 
193705,The Marylebone Hotel, Couldn t fault it, My new husband and I stayed at the hotel after our wedding The staff went the extra mile with bubbly rose petals and chocolate covered strawberries The breakfast was extensive with quality items and unlimited coffee and juice delicious 
193706,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Great location for walking around a lovely part of London We arrived on an early flight and the staff were very helpful and gave us a large room which had everything we needed 
193707,The Marylebone Hotel, That we didn t get a good view from our bedroom window, The hotel was in a good spot for easy to get to places walking staff L Staff were very happy and easy to talk to we both had a laugh with the staff The whole building interior we re area well sorted 
193708,The Marylebone Hotel, We arrived early and had not made arrangements for an early check in We mentioned to the staff at the desk that we were fatigued from our trip and would appreciate any efforts at getting us in to a room at their earliest availability Not only were we not given a room early but our room wasn t ready until 35 minutes past check in time We had 5 nights booked that was not a great way to start out a trip We had a second issue My son had ordered a gift certificate at the spa which was to have been delivered to me as a surprise on Mother s Day I didn t receive the gift card had to track it down and the surprise was ruined , The location was excellent The common areas were clean and comfortable 
193709,The Marylebone Hotel, Bathroom is ridiculously small One person can barely fit , Beautiful hotel with very nice staff and perfectly located Design of the hotel is very nice
193710,The Marylebone Hotel, Window locked wouldn t unlock Staff no help with this Construction downstairs from room on 2 mornings Loud voices from bar smokers in Street right under room,No Positive
193711,The Marylebone Hotel, We didn t have breakfast included as we found this to be quite expensive however I realise this is not unusual The breakfast room looked nice however we can t comment on the food We found a pret a manger just around the corner which was perfect , A very nice hotel with lovely friendly staff I travelled with my sister for a shopping trip and we had a fabulous time The hotel was in the perfect location for the shops and close to Bond street tube station and hyde park The staff were very welcoming and even put a bottle of prosecco in our room in the evening which was a lovely touch after hours walking up and down Oxford Street and we would like to thank the member of staff who did that for us We unfortunately didn t get to use the pool but it looks lovely and we would certainly return to the hotel in the future Thank you 
193712,The Marylebone Hotel, To find a pool prepare for a quest wandering in endless labyrinths and corridors Signs wouldn t be extra, Lovely hotel right in the heart of London Very comfortable bed helpful staff
193713,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Service was excellent and in particular thanks to Diana who left a little something in our room to apologise for a small inconvenience we had experienced 
193714,The Marylebone Hotel, only the wooden veneer of the bathtub which doesn t work in combination with water and therefore was little damaged , One of the best stays in London so far After all the disappointments in other hotels in the past the Marylebone Hotel was a great experience Rooms are nice and so the general hotel design but most important has been the friendliness by the whole stuff Amazing and very helpful 
193715,The Marylebone Hotel, Be weary of the construction at the back of the hotel which seems to start at 8 a m every day including Saturdays The windows provide zero insulation to the outside noise and so unless you prefer relaxing in your room to a symphony of jackhammers stay elsewhere The senior staff could do with a refresher on treating customer complaints too I arrived at 1 p m and being told the room wasn t quite ready left to explore the area In return I was given a smallish room in the back of the hotel The ONLY reason I checked in for the night was so that I could get some sleep prior to travelling the whole of the following day so I was understandably perturbed and having been woken at 8 a m I called to speak to the Manager who rather unhelpfully informed me that she can t control what happens outside Granted but the hotel can very much control what happens inside and given the noise has clearly been an issue on that side of the hotel for other guests I would have expected to either have been told about the noise in advance or offered an upgrade which I would gladly have paid for had I known the premium the hotel places on a full night s sleep A 30 discount on the room rate and a late offer to swap rooms was sadly too little too late , Great location and the doormen are true gentlemen and a credit to the hotel Rooms were clean 
193716,The Marylebone Hotel, The rooms were slightly small but thats to be expected in London Outdated A C system and key card access for lights to power to the room , After doing some research I found this hotel as it had a great central location within the massive city of London You are within walking distance of Oxford St Hyde Park Marble Arch and Regent St which can provide access to Piccadilly Square and Leicester Square 
193717,The Marylebone Hotel, Try to give us a basic room when we had book a superior room and then told me it was a superior room it was so small you couldn t walk round the bed We was then moved to a superior room Breakfast wasn t great or explained, Door staff very helpful and friendly
193718,The Marylebone Hotel, Door key didn t work initially Tried to phone hotel whilst out in London to find out when room would be ready and got passed around through various staff with no definitive answer Some parts of the hotel appear a little worn , The pool and gym facilities were above expectations Very classic bar area for drinks within hotel 
193719,The Marylebone Hotel, We would have liked a breakfast english or continental in with the stay , The staff were friendly helpful professional Hotel and facilities great location just right The beds and linen were wonderfully comfortable The room quiet We didn t experience the breakfast or restaurant 
193720,The Marylebone Hotel, The staff at breakfast were flustered and too busy to be attentive They failed to wipe the table next to us of the previous diners crumbs despite two requests by the next occupants and it was hard to get their attention to remind them of things that were forgotten They were however very courteous and friendly and it should be pointed out that we were seated at a very busy time , The rooms are stylish and comfortable and the staff friendly In particular the marble bathroom was very luxurious The location is hard to beat 
193721,The Marylebone Hotel, Breakfast gets busy but there are nice options outside , Love my fitness so the Gym and Pool did the trick Both are well managed with great training staff and equipment even finally managed a spin on the Watt Bike Trendy neighborhood with nice restaurants and pubs all over Good for shopping as close to Oxford St but still feels far removed from the hustle and bustle Great and attentive staff check in and check out was seamless Top place with a boutique feel 
193722,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Every member of the staff friendly and helpful Made us feel welcome the entire time Staff gave my daughter plenty of attention She loved the gift teddy bear Rooms small but immaculate and luxurious Bistro has good quality food with healthy options Great cocktails Desserts actually worth the calories we had baked Alaska every day This is a great neighborhood quiet streets just steps away from the hustle and bustle of of Bond street We will be back 
193723,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, We had a wonderful repeat stay at the Hotel and would come again as it is close to shops and bars but also has a POOL and GYM onsite Great welcoming staff and a superb 108 Brasserie which is part of the hotel Taxis on you doorstep ready to take you to your desired location 
193724,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, A modern comfortable and relaxing hotel which is close proximity to Oxford Street Covent Garden and the Theatres but is far enough away from the hectic city life of London Has all the amenities you need for a stop over in the City 
193725,The Marylebone Hotel, I forgot my shopping bag at the reception with my wallet in it my whole money and my stuff were stolen They found my wallet in the trash but no money inside apprently the cleaning guy took all the money and threw it to the trash don t stay in this hotel Very rude staff,No Positive
193726,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Warm welcome nice upgrade smiling faces well trained maids Hotel is clean comfortable and great for doing business short stays Everything is 3 minuts walk away and away from the crowd at the same time 
193727,The Marylebone Hotel, We booked spa treatments and used the pool facilities but they had children swimming lessons on But the all children hated it and screamed the whole time Felt like watching cruelty And ruined made it impossible to relax Wouldn t use the spa facilities again and would never send children to swimming lessons there ,No Positive
193728,The Marylebone Hotel, The price central London prices are quite high , The beddings mattress pillows and sheets were superb the room was so quite we could leave the window open the staff was super friendly there was free coffee in the morning at the lobby very handy and convenient and common areas were very stylish 
193729,The Marylebone Hotel, The room and wash facilities were very small and the bath would only suit a child not a fully grown adult , The staff were very accommodating and friendly
193730,The Marylebone Hotel, We didn t find anything wrong really if I have to find something petty bathroom was a little small but not to much of a problem, Every thing was spot on the room was ready early which was perfect for us The staff are very friendly and helpful and bed and pillows were very comfy
193731,The Marylebone Hotel, Slightly noisy near aircon units outside and room with internal view , Staff very friendly and doorman great recommending places to eat and directions We also found a complimentary bottle of prosecco in our room after returning from dinner after they learnt at check in that we were recently married We ll stay again 
193732,The Marylebone Hotel, Not enough tv station selection without buffering from US CNBC Bloomberg would have liked to see CNN occasionally The carpeting was quite dirty 3 try s to get a kettle that worked for hot water Resolved promptly Shower hot water mixer was broken inside the wall and needed to be replaced by maintenance Resolved promptly Would have liked a more personable and proactive concierge couldn t tell me where to buy a high quality thank you card Seemed very uninterested in his job and uninformed Front desk personnel seemed rushed and disinterested , Bed was super comfy bathroom large with new marble and fixtures good hi def tv Door personnel were fabulous and remembered you couldn t do enough to help loved the free neighborhood tour conducted Friday morning Super great spaces in lobby area for meeting OR reading working quietly Lobby staff servers were pleasant Very quiet and easy to operate climate control in room Marylebone Village is a gem Yet close to everything you could ever need 
193733,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing, The hotel was lovely clean fresh the staff were really excellent nothing was too much trouble they were always friendly and helpful food was delicious we would definitely stay there again and have already recommended it to friends
193734,The Marylebone Hotel, A very cold pool Poor service for breakfast on the Sunday Hotel were informed about a 30th celebration apparently knew nothing about it even though I had an email confirming they would organise something ,No Positive
193735,The Marylebone Hotel, Cramped shower room WC poor quality toilet paper despite excellent toiletries and facilities , Food was excellent and staff delightful excellent toiletries liked Nespresso machine in room 
193736,The Marylebone Hotel, bathroom bath didn t empty very quickly and shower knobs were loose However overall though this is being a little petty as i would definitely stay there again, Great location great staff good facilities
193737,The Marylebone Hotel, The first room we were put in was tiny and nothing like the pictures We then ask to move and we were given a room that was two single beds pushed together and was extremely uncomfortable We had two really bad nights sleep It was made worse as we were put on the 1st floor when we had asked for a higher floor because you can hear so much noise coming from the brasserie bar in hotel and also the other bars just outside the hotel The breaskfast was completely over priced for what it was , The location was great and the decor was nice It was also clean 
193738,The Marylebone Hotel, This was our second visit and it was just as good as our first Nothing to dislike , Friendly staff and perfectly situated in tranquil Mayfair Efficiently run with a boutique hotel feel Fab continental breakfast Close to great shops and restaurants 
193739,The Marylebone Hotel, My wife has been seriously ill for over a year We had to travel to London at short notice for her to receive urgent treatment at 7 00 am on the day of us leaving the hotel so our stay at the hotel was short I ve got to say that the hotel was very clean and of modern design but for some reason known best to the hotel staff we were allocated a ridiculously small and extremely uncomfortable room number 309 We felt as though the hotel had taken advantage We will never stay there again , Reception staff
193740,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, The accommodation was excellent and the service was great The breakfast was rich and they even had gluten free products to offer We are really pleased and we will surely book the same hotel for our next visit 
193741,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing, Fantastic stay Woman on reception welcomed us with a smile they had upgraded us which was a total surprise the room was fantastic Jack the Manager rang our room to see if we liked it and asked what are plans were for the evening as it was 8 30pm we went to their restaurant 108 and enjoyed a wonderful meal the menu was extensive Slept really well Breakfast the next morning was great set us up for a good days shopping 
193742,The Marylebone Hotel, seating at breakfast could have been better organised we were put to sit too close to other guests when there was plenty of room Perhaps it was just our own preference to sit with plenty of room around us , the staff were friendly and welcoming and couldn t do enough for you from the staff at reception Maria who always had a smile to house keeping The location was excellent close to attractions or within a short taxi ride doorman was friendly and helpful 
193743,The Marylebone Hotel, strange pool smell in the bar we booked a superior room instead of a deluxe this time the difference is huge in terms of bathroom space, Excellent location friendly staff very fine sports accommodation lovely bar
193744,The Marylebone Hotel, Liked it all , Breakfast was superb Room was small but comfortable Location was excellent Area was lovely lots of small independent shops bars eateries 10 mins walk to tube

193746,The Marylebone Hotel, Initially given a room which was rather small and a bit noisy near the service lifts but then offered without even asking a larger quieter room when one became available Thanks , Staff were exceptional and hotel facilities are excellent Gunther was especially helpful We didn t take advantage of breakfast or pool and spa but the room and service were superb 
193747,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Stayed here for 10 days whilst undergoing medical treatment nearby and cannot fault it Perfect Location extremely helpful and friendly staff tasteful and comfortable rooms plus great facilities 
193748,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, I always stay at this hotel when visiting London at least once a year and for me this is the best hotel in the area However i must mention that stuff members that work at the hotel for a longer period of time like Gunther at the reception are way more polite and willing to help guests than newer employees 
193749,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Gorgeous hotel in a wonderful location We loved the friendly staff the fluffy bathrobes and the handy outlet that fit our American laptop plugs The a la carte breakfast items blueberry pancakes were wonderful and high tea was a nice treat 
193750,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing, I loved the staff Gabriel at Breakfast was so kind and took my son on a tour Loved the orange juice punch at reception Loved the location and the hotel itself 
193751,The Marylebone Hotel, Not the hotel s fault but the spa had a swimming pool which should have been 5 degrees warmer am not worried about cold water but the swimmers and myself did find it tooooooo cold, Most of everything staff is very professional and kind great hotel and its location good bar and great restaurant lovely places to sit in on the ground floow
193752,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, We have stayed in this hotel several time and have never been disappointed Marylebone is a beautiful area of London with excellent resturants and bars I would highly recommend the Marylebone hotel 
193753,The Marylebone Hotel, The pool was not usable on the day of our visit Additionally the photographs on the website are misleading One of the reasons we chose this hotel was due to a picture of a terrace bar seating area Unfortunately this is not for guests but only in the penthouse room Very disappointing stay with two of our reasons for booking not being available or as described ,No Positive
193754,The Marylebone Hotel, That when we arrived loads of people were in the bedroom sorting the bed shouldn t this of been done before Also we had a unexpected 8 30am wake up call and we didn t say anything so she just walked in which we didn t appreciate she shouldn t of done that she should of come in after we have checked out , The door staff were so kind and helpful and the bed was amazing 
193755,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location close to central London short walk to Oxford St and Bond St tube station lots of great places to shop and eat nearby try the Ivy caf standard rooms are quite small but the Delux and above are good size for London very comfortable and well decorated generally staff all extremely helpful breakfast was good quality in a nice space but the high point is the access to the private gym spa and pool which are outstanding
193756,The Marylebone Hotel, Rooms a little on the small side we had a suite and I d hoped for something a little bigger particularly when compared with the photo on the website I thought the room could have been a little cleaner chairs were a little dusty and bathroom didn t look like it was thoroughly cleaned enough We wold stay again though , Staff were fantastic location was great Reception areas were beautiful 
193757,The Marylebone Hotel, The Breakfast didn t have a good enough selection for a continental breakfast The bedrooms require a little more detailing paint and bathroom required repair to grouting and a little paint bathroom door surrounds , Bedroom was very good Staff were very professional and helpful 
193758,The Marylebone Hotel, The air con was either extremely hot or extremely cold we couldn t get it to the right temperature, V stylish I particularly liked the bar restaurant etc

193761,The Marylebone Hotel, Perhaps the superior and deluxe rooms need updating in decor now to match the high standard of the suits that you picture on your website , I love the Style and location as well as the friendly busy bar 
193762,The Marylebone Hotel, Booked this and thought it was gonna be wow judging by photos and was hugely disappointed Rooms and facilities for superior were small and basic Had to pay service charge of 4 50 at the bar ,No Positive
193763,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing, The staff was wonderful Specifically Gunther at front desk doorman concierge can t remember name Would stay again at Marylebone or a sister property 
193764,The Marylebone Hotel, Rooms quite small and not enough light available at night The breakfast was nice but the service was quite poor very slow always a different waiter and at 14 for a full English I at least expected it to come out warm The ironing board had bits of metal poking out which put a hole in my top Becareful , Very modern and the staff were very pleasant As there was a wait on one of our rooms they kindly offered a free bottle in the Bar to keep us busy in the mean time Great location very close to tube stations and 5 mins walk to oxford street Cocktails in 108 bar were lovely Rooms were modern and had a shower and bath 
193765,The Marylebone Hotel, Broken heater in the room hotel fully booked they offered us breakfast to apologies maid service badly organised we ve request to clean our room few hours after check in but no one did our bed was so dirty on the metres cover during breakfast too many people standing around waiting for the table chaos slow service , location staff

193767,The Marylebone Hotel, They refused to accept early check in we asked for it and they confirmed in the morning around 2 00 am when we arrived they answered to don t have room without previous advice We payed 398 for new room in the Holiday Inn silence is better about it nearby the Marylebone After sleep hours we come back and they offered a larger room to excuse themselves thanks to manager a very polite person the solution for inconvenient can be defined an abbreviated piece of nothing , Free breakfast politeness 
193768,The Marylebone Hotel, I did not obtain a quiet room on the back of hotel as requested The room has torn net curtains which i asked to be replaced I got stuck in a faulty lift for 2 minutes going to the gym at 645am , Staff are helpful and very professional 
193769,The Marylebone Hotel, I ve stayed several times and I find the smallness of the rooms appalling To get round the bed you scrape yourself on the wall mounted tv screen The lobby bar service can be slow , the lobby staff are very friendly the pool is enjoyable the general effect is most agreeable
193770,The Marylebone Hotel, Laundry service needs to be accurate with the cloths my wife lost her high nick shirt , We loved the food how clean our room and excellent friendly staff 
193771,The Marylebone Hotel, The swimming pool was out of order and was going to take 5 weeks to fix I booked months in advance because I wanted a hotel with a pool Nobody notified me of the pool problem before I came so no chance to change booking , Very comfortable beds Staff all nice and friendly excellent location
193772,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location for the Oxford and Marylebone Street shops but down a quiet side street Staff were amazing including the yoga instructor at the gym on Saturday morning Beautiful breakfasts excellent room service and the beds Don t remember much except my head hitting the fluffy pillow after a long fun filled day Loved the Marylebone Hotel from the moment we arrived until the moment we sadly had to leave 
193773,The Marylebone Hotel, If the website has an option to allow the customer to provide an additional requirement it would be nice for it to have been taken into consideration I requested a twin room but got a double Also booked breakfast via a hotel booking website but was unable to change the option from continental to a hot option even thought the hot option was cheaper reception confirmed we could have anything off the menu but the restaurant staff were not if we could change what we had originally paid for , Lovely toiletries and friendly staff nice quiet room
193774,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location for West End and Marylebone High Street plus close to railway stations Great bar and restaurant attached but also plenty of choice for other places to eat nearby Would recommend Le Fromagerie on Moxton Street plus The Cavendish for a late breakfast 
193775,The Marylebone Hotel, As superior room felt was on compact side only 1 bedside cabinet Room 359 had awful and noisy outlook, The bathroom was lovely and roomy and the hotel was within good walking distance of where we wanted to be 
193776,The Marylebone Hotel, The double room was the smallest I ve ever stayed in Suitable for one but not two Make sure you check what room size and layout you re given Bathroom even smaller At close to 6 feet tall it was very uncomfortable having a shower Coffee machine didn t work in room Room size means I can t see this as value for money despite location and gym , Location Close to Marylebone and Oxford St Staff very friendly Public areas of high quality Gym very good 
193777,The Marylebone Hotel, I bit of street noise at night at the back of the hotel , Large comfortably bed Excellent quality linens and toiletries Lovely neighbourhood with lots of shops and restaurants 
193778,The Marylebone Hotel, Staff were generally great apart from one who when I asked for my bag directed me to the luggage porter who was busy attending to a car Better service would have been to take my tag and sort it out Biggest negative however was very poor speed WIFI had to use my mobile phone 4G instead Not great if you are an overseas visitor , Good location and comfortable quality bed with excellent bathroom etc etc Good breakfast too if a bit noisy and crowded 
193779,The Marylebone Hotel, I picked this hotel specifically above others and paid more for it as it had a pool available I swim everyday When I got there the pool was out of commission There was no indication on the booking com website that the pool wouldn t be available and I received no update and the hotel said that it was mentioned on their website which was no use to me as I used booking com ,No Positive
193780,The Marylebone Hotel, Tiny but nice bathroom You had to squeeze next to the toilet to open the door to get in and out of the room They should have fitted a sliding door very bad design , Fantastic location very good breakfast 
193781,The Marylebone Hotel, Bedroom was small for the price and bathroom particularly small , Excellent staff great location hotel is in great condition with a relaxed upmarket feel Food was good value 
193782,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic staff nothing was to much trouble it was my birthday and they made it very special I have stayed in The Savoy and The Ritz and although completely different in all ways I think the staff had more time for their guests Sandra Jolly
193783,The Marylebone Hotel, The junior suite lacked something I consider essential namely a night table on either side of the bed There was only one night table so the second person had to put watch glasses phone etc on the floor As the bed was pretty high that meant getting out of it to reach for any of these things I talked to the reception manager who said she would look into it I hope so because I really like the hotel The bathroom was also not comfortable One had to actually get into the bath to open the bath water tap I will definitely try for a better room next time , Staff very friendly Breakfast very nice Public spaces very comfortable location excellent 
193784,The Marylebone Hotel, The only thing is we came with a baby and rooms are quite small but beautiful so if you are more then two people go for the suit , Feels like home in London Kind and helpful staff always wanting to do more Bottles of water hot beverages and croissants all free in the morning Excellent location lovely warm decor Many good restaurants near by Thanks for everything the Ostashinsky Hanam family
193785,The Marylebone Hotel, Ate breakfast out in a nearby patisserie as 13 per head in this hotel for a like for like meal was very expensive, Maid service was excellent lovely clean room and was kept up to that standard Lovely linen and natural down in the pillows made our bed very comfortable
193786,The Marylebone Hotel, When we arrived they couldn t find our reservation This was dealt with quickly Bathrooms are a bit awkward and small , Food was excellent in the Brasserie and Pantry Bed linen and comfort very good Ambience very calming Staff attentive 
193787,The Marylebone Hotel, For the price the room was very small and the bathroom even smaller I do not think I will be using this hotel again unless I am desperate , Location for what I wanted was very convenient
193788,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, We were excelently attented by Mr Gunther Schildwachter qho has recived us in the reception at the check in he was extremely kind and helpful counselled us vey well about practical topics of our stay in London and he spoke perfect Spanish with us The hotel very clean modern and plesant The bed very comfortable 
193789,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing The staff were very keen to please and we really enjoyed our stay Will come back again , Lovely quiet room on 6th floor Very welcoming staff great location just a few walking minutes from Oxford Street Selfridges end The full English Breakfast was one of the tastiest we ve had for a long time in a very attractive restaurant

193792,The Marylebone Hotel, Staff clearly didnt want to be there Ordered breakfast room service and it came minutes before i had to check out after i chased them on it Staff need to learn they are there to make the stay pleasant This was not the case in my stay , was upgraded
193793,The Marylebone Hotel, I was told I wouldn t be charged an extra 50 pounds for a bed as there were three of us living in the suite However I was charged for it We were running late for the airport so did not have time to contend this , Stayed in the one bedroom suite The suite was extremely comfortable with a beautiful view looking on to Marylebone High Street Beautiful comfortable furniture the bathroom was large and perfect for all three of us It contained a shower as well as a tub that also came with a shower All in all we had a wonderful stay 
193794,The Marylebone Hotel, The design of the bathroom The door should be a sliding door as it really cramps the entrance, Very helpful staff a very busy intimate hotel with a personal flavor Loved all the attention to detail The products to the chocolates at night Fantastic gym with complementary entrance for hotel guests One of the best 
193795,The Marylebone Hotel, Room was quite small but very nice decor but bathroom was too small shower flooded the bathroom every time u showered , Very central warm welcoming standard was excellent food was great staff were really friendly 
193796,The Marylebone Hotel, The room wasn t spotless Tiny bathroom Couldn t swing a cat in it A light bulb had blown Didn t get sorted until we left The bottom drawer wouldn t stay shut The coffee machine didn t work on arrival Sorted straight away though Value for money Not great I would expect a larger room and bathroom Some areas need some attention to detail No draught beer lager , The staff are very friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble 99 of things catered for Restaurant very good Food and service excellent Catered for some dietary requirements 
193797,The Marylebone Hotel, We loved everything to be honest but if we were to feedback anything it would be that in the guest info it said brunch was served from 11am onwards after breakfast but it is actually 12pm so you have an hour gap But honestly that s the only criticism we can give as everything else was excellent, We were on honeymoon and the staff were just amazing especially Jack He gave us lots of ideas of things to do and made sure we were treated well and had a good laugh The hotel also gave us a complementary bottle of prosecco and put real rose petals on our bed in a heart shape It was just out of this world 
193798,The Marylebone Hotel, Reception staff could have been more genuine and friendly however we were offered water and warm cloths when we arrived at the hotel which was nice , The swimming pool sauna steam room and shower hair drying facilities Including ghds in the spa area Also the coffee machine in the room was a very welcome touch 
193799,The Marylebone Hotel, Some rooms have very small bathrooms , Very professional helpful staffs value and understand the importance of customer satisfaction Great location complementary water in the room is a plus excellent wifi speed You will like the gentleman with luggage scale gadget to check your bag wight before heading to the airport Do not miss the Marylebone Village one hour tour 
193800,The Marylebone Hotel,No Negative, Besides the actual hotel being incredible the location was excellent everything we wanted was only a short walk or uber away moreover every staff member we spoke to was helpful and attentive 
193801,The Marylebone Hotel, Staff trying to charge us for the mini bar which we didn t use And staff being rude about this when I complained Cleaners come into the room when you re not there and move your things around Only one bath robe for two people Uncomfortable bed, Friendliness of staff

193806,The Marylebone Hotel, Since it was meant to be a double room two armchairs should be provided no offer of a Sunday newspaper a fridge instead of the well stocked mini bar would be better too Tiniest bathroom ever seen although everything you could want is provided , Clean very comfortable bed great turn down service efficient friendly staff Quiet room able to open a window bliss Fabulous steam room with adequate pool 
193807,The Marylebone Hotel, Actually for once I though cooked breakfast was pretty poor Sloppy scrambled eggs sausage not nice wife s bacon very fatty Really wasn t very nice First time and I ve stayed there a few times , Position staff and

193811,The Marylebone Hotel, Maintenance being carried out on the property which was all afternoon post check in and commenced early morning when in bed Very Very loud I felt we d been given a bad room perhaps as we d booked online but at 187 this was not a cheap stay and didn t include breakfast Overall v disappointing for what was meant to be a treat for my daughter and i, Location
193812,The Marylebone Hotel, They charged us for room upgrade more than Booking com , The staff was very friendly and helpful The location was excellent The rooms were relatively spacious compared to nearby hotels 
193813,The Marylebone Hotel, Arrived at 220pm and only one room was ready I had to wait over 2 hours until my room was ready The only thing staff could say was they had to many late check outs I don t see this as a good reason, Area and room was ok
193814,The Marylebone Hotel, Superior room was very small had to squeeze down both sides of bed to get into bed Unable to have curtains open as another room looked in to us , Excellent location

193816,The Marylebone Hotel, Only issue was size of room for price but I guess that s London and other big cities, very comfy bed beautiful decor didnt have enough time to use leisure suite but maybe next time Only had 1 night stay so didnt sample the cuisine as wanted to take in some of the sites and early start next am home 
193817,The Marylebone Hotel, Room was on the small side for a superior room Bathroom was very small only one person in there at a time Very noisy outside room early morning Swimming pool could do with updating, Bed was really comfortable Bathrobes slippers Turn down service with water was a nice touch Location was superb for what we wanted
193818,The Marylebone Hotel, For the rate I paid it should have included breakfast though That said breakfast was very good and glad we ate there , Hotel was great for special stay like a birthday or anniversary Rooms are well appointed and plush Location was a short walk from Bond st tube station and out of the way from the noise of Oxford street
193819,The Marylebone Hotel, Room size ridiculous Double bed had barely enough space either side to allow getting into bed and bathroom so small you had to straddle wc to open door all for 225 a night , Good location staff friendly and helpful 
193820,The Marylebone Hotel, Very poor Airconditionning in normal summer temperature Unable to refresh the room during our 2 days stay , Location 10 minutes Saint Pancras 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street many restaurants in the street just behind Very clean and calm 
193821,The Marylebone Hotel, The in room air conditioning struggled in the warm temperatures and the room was a bit stuffy as a result We would think twice about coming back in the summer The bathroom heated mirror still came on every day as well contributing to the heat build up in the room Not very energy efficient for hot summer days , Staff were friendly and efficient except for the first delivery of suitcases which took around 15 20 mins to be brought up A bit too long considering we were keen to shower after a day of Travelling We appreciated the provision of an extra mini fridge for our purchased cheese overseas 
193822,The Marylebone Hotel, The rooms were dirty we had to change rooms because it was nothing like the images we were shown of the room we booked Another couple we had spoken to changed rooms five times because of how poor they were , The location

193826,The Marylebone Hotel, The lift was slow should have taken the stairs really , Bed was extra comfortable Slept really well was also really impressed with how close the hotel is to Oxford Street 5 we would stay again without doubt 
193827,The Marylebone Hotel, The only thing I would say is that we didn t get enough time to experience the spa facilities so I can t comment on them but if they are anything like the rest of the hotel I m sure it s worth making time for next time, The staff were amazing We stayed in the Marylebone for my birthday and receptionist arranged for us to come back to a bottle of prosecco and chocolates AND we got a free breakfast The hotel itself was beautiful I really couldn t fault it Next time we stay in London I will not be staying anywhere else

193832,The Marylebone Hotel, The cups in the room were overpowered with a taste of lemon and I was a little disappointed a cooked breakfast wasn t included in the price of the room , Lovely staff and comfortable room
193833,The Marylebone Hotel, The standard rooms are a bit small so if possible try upgrading to a larger room it is well worth it, The breakfast is excellent and also the fitness centre Bed was very comfortable and service was very helpful The location is superb quiet and feels like living in London yet walking distance to everything
193834,The Marylebone Hotel, Everything was amazing the position of the tv in relation to the bed was a little strange but it meant less tv watching and more quality time which is always a plus on an anniversary , The hotel was outstanding as expected with friendly staff We were given a complimentary upgrade as we were staying at the hotel for our anniversary The room service breakfast was fantastic and the complimentary nibbles provided on our first night sealed the deal Overall great hotel in a great location with amazing staff The only let down was the spa did not have a jacuzzi which we were hoping for 
193835,The Marylebone Hotel, Nothing, Best Location only had continental breakfast and it was very good cooked breakfast looked delicious this is a lovely comfortable hotel with lots of different seating areas and the friendliest of staff this was our 2nd stay would highly recommend 
193836,The Marylebone Hotel, Some of the staff although trying to be helpful were a bit slow to respond , Problem solvers Great location Upscale property Great fitness Center Excellent Restaurent
193837,The Marylebone Hotel, Shower leaked everywhere Like flooded the whole floor in over an inch of water Called housekeeping and no one was sent up so I used all the towels available to sort it out I think this was just an oversight as they were hugely apologetic on reception when I told them , Comfy bed and very clean Service from staff excellent They gave my daughter a teddy bear when they learned it was her birthday 
193838,The Marylebone Hotel, The Rooms should have had shades or drapes That darkened the room our room was light at four am drapes did not fit prime purpose of staying there was to sleep when informed we were promptly moved to another room for the second night Very dark corridors,No Positive

193842,The Marylebone Hotel, Everything Family room booked for 4 And 1 double bed Son slept on the floor and took payment out of my bank twice, Absolutely disgrace Nothing at all 
193843,The Marylebone Hotel, The bar is part of the bistro and it just didn t work for me Purely a matter of personal taste , Its new its clean great d cor the rooms are comfortable although bathrooms in the standard rooms are very small and it is a problem to close the door you squeeze yourself around the door as you close it 
193844,The Marylebone Hotel, Even in slightly larger rooms the bathrooms are on the small side, I stay at the Marylebone regularly and am always well received and they do what they can to accommodate my needs Access to the full gym is a big plus too The 108 pub and restaurant is lovely
193845,The Marylebone Hotel, There was nothing that I didn t like however a little suggestion to maybe have ice dispensing machines on the floors of the rooms Then guest that may have water in their rooms cud access ice if needed , The area the hotel was in was great the bar was lovely and staff were very attentive to our needs The cocktails were very nice from the bar an the breakfast was lovely Over all a very nice stay 
193846,The Marylebone Hotel, Just a couple of things that we were disappointed with firstly we had a deluxe suite and the room smelt musty and damp although it was probably the air conditioning unit The second thing was that my friend had scrambled egg for breakfast and there was a lot of egg shell in it She was offered a fruit juice as an apology but it should not have happened in the first place On the whole the hotel was great but just a couple of points to avoid future disappointment from customers , The staff on check in were friendly and helpful We arrived at 10am to drop our bags off but our rooms were both ready which was great as we could check into our rooms ahead of the 14 30 check in 
193847,The Marylebone Hotel, Room noisy plumbing noise and noise late into the night in deadend street below, Location great and staff on reception and concierge very helpful and friendly
193848,The Marylebone Hotel, We ve stayed here often paying more than similar London hotels but service seems to have slipped Really poor that they won t serve drinks to guests in their lovely lounge at 10pm only option to go to their very crowded noisy public bar real missed opportunity At check in ordered morning tea in room at 7am chased twice arrived at 0740 Maid is tapping on door with keycard at 0830am to clean room despite not having checked out and the hotel making virtue of 12 noon checkouts All fixable come on management , The rooms are very comfortable
193849,The Marylebone Hotel, the spa is more like a health club gym rather than a spa facility very small sauna steam room and a fitness pool Quite difficult to access but clean with good shower vanity facilities , The staff were friendly the atmosphere welcoming the style chic the rooms comfortable and plush The location was excellent for shopping cafes and the park 
193850,The Marylebone Hotel, Size of bathroom cramped Room OK for one but small for two , Staff were excellent Lounge Areas were comfortable Iced water on reception very welcome 
193851,The Marylebone Hotel, The rooms are a bit tight but I guess that s the case for most hotels in Europe , The location is amazing a variety of coffee shops near by Oxford st is 5 min walk and it s a fun 15 min walk to Regent Park a personal favorite spot The service and staff are very friendly and helpful My favorite thing about the hotel is that has a cozy lobby seating area that has a homelike feeling the couch by the fireplace is perfect to relax after a long walk in London Love it 
193852,The Marylebone Hotel, Size of bedroom and bathroom, The location is great the staff are wonderful especially the doormen The only down side is the size of the rooms so not worth the money the bathroom has no bath but a modern shower unit but you have to shut the door if you want to stay in the smallest bathroom to towel dry 
193853,The Marylebone Hotel, Breakfast buffet a larger variety of fruit or fruit salad would be nice , Bathrooom Aromatherapy Associates products a lovely touch and scent Bathrobe slippers and great shower Extremely friendly staff

193866,The Marylebone Hotel, We arrived the hotel and got a room next to room under construction We where not informed while ordering the room AND NOT during check in We came with 2 years old baby and we all suffered from the noise and smell It is really not appropriate to offer a room without letting people know there are construction work that will continue during the weekend We did called the reception and they they were nice and understanding and even refund us for the baby bed but they didn t stop the work I tried to let my baby sleep with a horrible noise I don t think it is ok to charge fulll rate for a room in hotel that is under construction and eve not notify the costumer , Clean room good breakfast
193867,The Marylebone Hotel, nothing, I used to stay with Marylebone since 2009 I like the quite location even it is located too close from famous district which is Oxford St Furthermore the hotel surrounded by famous restaurants bars such as Tommi s burger joint 108 bar and one of the oldest fish chips in London regarding the hotel The staff are gentles professionals Especially Mr GUANTER The hotel servicing the rooms twice daily The breakfast is nice contains both continental Full English breakfast NEspresso available in rooms with nice collections of tea Iron with board available in each room water heaters 2 bottles of still water every day in the room Business center Fully equipped gym including indoor pool steam bath sauna as well as Spa Taxis are available in front of the hotel until mid night From my point view as priority when I travel to London I love to stay in this hotel rather than others 
193868,The Marylebone Hotel, We have now stayed at the Marylebone several times this stay was for my birthday would have been a nice gesture to have been upgraded , The beds are very comfortable
193869,The Marylebone Hotel, The view wasn t the greatest with scaffolding on site but we all need a bit of work doing sometimes , Very clean mini bar is excellent bathroom is perfect I will be stopping here in future for London visits

193871,The Marylebone Hotel, No negatives , We were made very welcome and the staff seemed genuinely interested in my husband and I The pool and the sauna was a real treat We had room service for 6am which was prompt 
193872,The Marylebone Hotel, The door to the room we found it hard to operate the card reader spen a bit of time each time we wanted to get back into the room, Really freindly staff brilliant place to stay
193873,The Marylebone Hotel, The room is small compared to the other room that my friend was staying I booked two rooms supposed to be the same The prices are the same However my room was smaller than the other room It was the side room of a suit room and small The wardrobe is not good The bed cover was not clean The waiter give the spoon which was dropped on the floor 5 minutes ago to one of the guests having his breafast next to my table when he asked for a spoon , Location is not bad
193874,The Marylebone Hotel, The room was small and dark Outlook was inside of high building No ceiling lights just two table lamps and two tiny reading lights on the bed Maybe two foot spare either side of bed No clock I like to do stretching exercises in the morning but no space here to do that The bathroom was small A trolley in there with towels etc took up space Tiny space to dry yourself The thermostat for floor heating didn t work Again not much lighting here 3 small ceiling spotlights absolutely no good for putting your make up on No shaving magnifying mirror Fixed shower over bath which was slippery The toilet roll holder is fixed on the wall the wrong way round so when you use the paper the roll falls off the holder The room wasn t very sound proof as I could clearly hear my neighbours moving around I did venture down to the gym pool to have a look You need key card to operate lift there Twice I got stuck when the door wouldn t open so I had to press the button to another floor To me it looked as if this gym is used by outsiders not many hotel guests and was busy The pool was claustrophobic and so hot like walking into a sauna took your breath away I should have realised the mini bar was automated meaning when you lift a can up it registers on a computer I moved some cans to put some medication in the fridge so ended up with these items on my bill When I explained to reception what had happened they quickly rectified the matter , I arrived early before check in time but was able to go to the room straight away which was a bonus All the staff were very polite and helpful and service was quick I was given some extra pods for the Nespresso machine which was great The room was clean and the bed was comfortable Toiletries were lovely Nice touch with bottle of water and chocolate placed in the room in the evening
