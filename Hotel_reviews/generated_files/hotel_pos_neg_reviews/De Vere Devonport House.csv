357196,De Vere Devonport House, Bathroom very tired and floor tiles need re sealing and just all a little grimy Windows need sorting in the room I was in, Good location free wifi friendly helpful staff
357197,De Vere Devonport House, The perception of the hotel on Booking com is one of a luxury fine dining hotel well thats how we perceived it from the pictures I should have got the hint when i reserved a table for dinner they said there was no need The hotel has a conference centre so is geared towards corperate guests My wife and i were vastly overdressed for dinner and looked out of place against the IBM delegates jeans and short sleeve shirt brigade , We loved the location in Greenwich could not be more centrally located Parking was good too Staff were very friendly and helpfull 
357198,De Vere Devonport House, Stairs tricky our nearest ones didnt go to the gtround floor it wasn t ckear until we got to the bottom , The location the view the friendly staff Good breakfast Great car park 
357199,De Vere Devonport House, The room was very hot the bathroom needed a good clean on the floor around the bath Everything in the room felt sticky the one chair was dirty For what we paid I would have expected better facilities Travel Lodges are the same standard but cheaper , Perfect location in Greenwich for everything Easy to walk to the shops restaurants museums the beautiful park We drove there was parking available The staff were very good we were able to check in very early 
357200,De Vere Devonport House, Parking is for a fee but good to have available Breakfast buffet at hotel is for a fee but places to eat are with walking distance so available choices , Excellent location 
357201,De Vere Devonport House, Poor check in process kept waiting for a long time and was in a hurry Not enough front office staff at a busy check in time This first impression reflects the overall feeling of the hotels efficiency, Location
357202,De Vere Devonport House, The room was very warm so air conditioning would have been a bonus although there was a table top fan provided in the room The sink which was located directly behind the door of the bathroom was inconvenient It would have been nice if bathrobes and slippers were provided , The location is excellent for sightseeing and public transport and the parking in the grounds a real bonus given how difficult it is to find parking in the area 
357203,De Vere Devonport House, Bar prices 2 drinks 19 Hair dryer has no get up and go, Quiet hotel friendly staff great location for O2 Easy walk from DLR Cutty Sark station to hotel Comfy rooms big towels tea coffee facilities in room fan in room very much needed Nice toiletaries 
357204,De Vere Devonport House, Booking com stated that if there was parking available on the property it would be free Parking was available but we were charged 10 per night , The room overlooked an inner courtyard which made it quiet and peaceful 
357205,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The location was perfect for us very close for our visit to the Royal Naval College for a concert Really near to the Thames and only about 5 minutes from the DLR station too Lots of places to go out and eat and the Thames is nearby too for a nice walk The hotel itself was a really outstanding building from the outside and the room was a decent size too and had everything we needed for our stay The staff were friendly and the breakfast was well stocked with plenty of variety and good service 
357206,De Vere Devonport House, No air conditioning It was very warm during stay only had a fan in the room The room was booked for a special occasion daughter s graduation but given a room looking out onto tops of buildings would have been nice if it had overlooked the beautiful gardens it was one of the reasons I booked the hotel Its location was ideal for Greenwich Uni as my elderly mum cannot walk very far , Beds were lovely very comfy Staff helpful 
357207,De Vere Devonport House, No air con Room very noisy with party outside and directly underneath Breakfast fairly poor standard and waiter attention poor, room reasonably furnished
357208,De Vere Devonport House, Our room on the 4th floor was a bit small and without AC Would not recommend to take a room in 4th floor during summer time again too hot , Location location location We went for my wife s graduation at Greenwich University and enjoyed our stay at the hotel Used public transport for arrival visiting London and departure All easy going with bus station just in front of the hotel Recommend to visit Shooters Golf Club just 30 min away Great place 
357209,De Vere Devonport House, The room was very warm even with windows open and we didn t really want a fan on all night We were right opposite windows which meant we couldn t have daylight and privacy at the same time also people outside in area below windows could see if we didn t have curtains pulled or blinds down The armchair in the room was very badly stained , Staff were very friendly and helpful our room was clean a nice size and very comfortable as was the bed too The location is excellent and it s a beautiful building also the grounds gardens were lovely and well kept 
357210,De Vere Devonport House, Everything else fine But 6 for a bottle of sparkling water from the bar Really Good quality water should be available at a reasonable price especially when London water tastes as it does ,No Positive
357211,De Vere Devonport House, They provided winter weight duvets 13 5 tog in midsummer when 4 5 tog would be normal We were much too hot even with window open , Location on the National Maritime Museum site 
357212,De Vere Devonport House, Room was over a party function room loud noise meant we had to request to be moved fortunately there was a spare room available and staff were helpful in moving us Bit disappointed that although we have stayed many times at this hotel there is no recognition other hotels are much more on the ball and although I don t want to be best mates with the reception an acknowledgement would be nice , Basic amenities good location 
357213,De Vere Devonport House, One small thing missing from the room was a hairdryer even though it said there would be according to the booking com page of the hotel , Breakfast was a good amount to get your day started with Staff was also very friendly and accommodating Will definitely come back 
357214,De Vere Devonport House, Vending machine removed from hallway which was a good idea to have as the bar did not have snacks or soft drinks , Good breakfast comfortable room clean great location 
357215,De Vere Devonport House, Very warm in halls Only adequate amenities No hand soap for washing Breakfast and coffee was very mediocre, Location and the ability to leave luggage stowed away Very professional and helpful staff 
357216,De Vere Devonport House, The room was so hot and the fan made an extremely obnoxious noise when we had it on We had trouble sleeping because of the heat , I really enjoyed the location and the staff was very friendly and helpful 
357217,De Vere Devonport House, There was a bad odour of stale mops or water at the top of the stairs when we turned the corner to walk along the corridor to our room Possibly coming from a storage cupboard for cleaning supplies , The bed was so comfortable and the view from our room took in the front view of the Hotel So central to the whole of Greenwich village Such a delightful setting with wonderful attractions literally minutes walk away We will be back 
357218,De Vere Devonport House, The blinds rattled against window frame when window was open making it noisy to sleep Only 2 tea bags in the room when we arrived in the afternoon so did not have enough to have tea in the morning this should have been filled with enough for us to have had a few drinks over our one night stay also little choice of drinks I e no hot chocolate , bed comfortable good size room good choice at breakfast
357219,De Vere Devonport House, We were put in a disabled room which I couldn t understand why as this wasn t pre booked The bathroom wasn t very inviting and had an uneven tiled floor which I felt was unsafe for bare feet There was mould in the grouting and on the tiled floor We couldn t sleep at all as our room looked out onto the generator which kept us awake all night as it was so loud This was particularly annoying considering I had a six hour drive the following day The corridor leading to our room was extremely dirty and tired looking and didn t give a very good first impression when you got out of the lift Overall we were very disappointed and because of that we wouldnt return , Staff were friendly and breakfast was lovely 
357220,De Vere Devonport House, Rooms poor no air conditioning bathroom needs a good makeover cracked tiles no shower cap Very disappointed due to a fabulous location Breakfast not good Tables far to close together staff kept bumping into the table when moving between to clear other tables Bar food poor quality , The location and parking facilities were great
357221,De Vere Devonport House, No air conditioning due to it being a listed building , Great location next to Greenwich Park and near to local market and the Cutty Sark Good links into London via train or boat Lovely Breakfast and very friendly staff 
357222,De Vere Devonport House, the only evening meal was served in bar on very small tables or one very low table food was cold sent back and was told that this hotel didn t have a microwave not what is expected of this standard of hotel, location excellent
357223,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable There was no air conditioning but they provided a fan which was great as it was very hot I thought it was good value for money 
357224,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Stayed before and all good The only reason I haven t given it full marks for staff is that reception staff were quite surly and not very helpful in comparison to the waiting staff who were excellent 
357225,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Location was very convenient for our night at the O2 arena Just a ten minute taxi ride away Lovely staff very helpful and friendly Even sorted us out some biscuits and hot chocolate when we returned late and just missed the complementary drinks snacks which were a nice touch they do put them away over night Had a lovely walk around Greenwich Park the following morning which is just a stone s throw from the hotel 
357226,De Vere Devonport House, Under staffed Poor bar service with the bar almost 1 2 cover in used glasses most table dirty with used plates and glasses employ a pot man , Great breakfast clean room
357227,De Vere Devonport House, on 3rd floor room and corridor extremely hot but reception very helpful with window and came to investigate and check my concern which I really appreciated, reception staff excellent proactive location in Greenwich close to what I came for sense of history in building and park close by generally a good mood and spirit among staff which I liked
357228,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, This hotel with beautiful fassade benefits from a gorgeous location The Living Room offers a warm cozy and comfortable ambiance with a nice bar Watermelon and pineapple smoothie are my favorite on the breakfast table In general they have old facility decent rooms friendly and helpful staff 
357229,De Vere Devonport House, The only thing I thought could have been better was the brightness on the TV , Staff were very welcoming friendly cheerful and helpful Dinner in the dining room was superb Room was nice and quiet really comfy bed spacious bathroom Great all round Will definitely stay again Excellent value for money 
357230,De Vere Devonport House, No air con but historic building and understandable Fan was available in room , Check in welcoming efficient and friendly from Esther room was clean comfortable and well equipped for a short stay Breakfast excellent with great buffet style choices and waiter with ponytail was a joy in the mornings Room service was excellent with an above average menu for this type of hotel Location perfect for me Would not hesitate to recommend or return 
357231,De Vere Devonport House, The lifts were busy The shower was over the bath having had a knee replacement it s harder to get in and out of , The beds were very comfortable It was good value for money as it included breakfast A fan was provided in the room The staff ver friendly and helpful 
357232,De Vere Devonport House, The Bathroom needs serious overhaul and update , Beds where really comfy and enjoyed a good nights sleep hair dryer iron etc was all available The only down side was the bathroom which could use a serious update black mold everywhere which gave it a very unclean feeling The Staff where lovely and very helpful Despite the bathroom I would use this hotel again as the location is superb and you are so close to so many things plenty to do and visit 
357233,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Unhappy with the room we were allocated on arrival and had a word with Sean on reception the next morning He undertook to try and resolve the problem in a professional manner When we returned to the hotel later in the day we were delighted with his efforts Had a lovely room wine and cake in Greenwich for my husband birthday luggage moved and no effort had been spared We stay at the hotel on a regular basis and will continue to do so Congratulations and thanks to Sean always great when a person exceeds expectations Maggie and John Blackler
357234,De Vere Devonport House, Problems checking in at first I was allocated a room that was already occupied then given a key card which didn t work Sandwich ordered from the bar was stale , Bedroom was light and relatively spacious with large desk Full sized bath with lots of space around the sink Attractive sash windows overlooking a grassed area and beehives The hotel is located in an former nurses hostel has retained some traditional character and is a pleasant size set out over three floors Friendly staff pleasant relaxed atmosphere comfortable quiet lounge In an excellent location next to the National Maritime Museum and other attractions and shops in Greenwich Generous buffet breakfast 10 per cent discount voucher offered off next stay Some background traffic noise but generally quiet at night 
357235,De Vere Devonport House, Generally good if I wanted to get picky the hall carpets are a bit grubby but I presume they take a lot of footfall traffic , The hotel is a beautiful historic building with many photographs and pictures explaining its original use The interior and the bathrooms are a little tired but the staff cleanliness and general ambience make up for that two fold Couldn t have wished for a better location to stay in Greenwich 5 minutes from the park and observatory and 5 minutes to the pier and shops Highly recommended 
357236,De Vere Devonport House, One of the lifts was broken The room and hotel was hot but the historic nature of the building I understand prevents too much modernisation But it isn t too inconvenient , Excellent breakfast comfy bed Perfect location Cooling fan in room Lovely location and genuinely historic buildings Right in the heart of Greenwich and easy access to the O2 arena
357237,De Vere Devonport House, Had a meal in hotel restaurant which was busy and under staffed the staff were lovely and hard working but only two servers People were waiting along time between courses The food was very good when it arrived , Excellent hotel Hotel location excellent for the O2 just 15mins on bus Great restaurants within walking distance Great street food in market Lovely views and walks in parkland Breakfast excellent room excellent all very clean and quiet 
357238,De Vere Devonport House, Bar staff not good in serving people in the right order We were two ladies waiting to be served but had to wait around 15 minutes people were coming in and getting attended to before us not happy about that Only one person serving the evening we were there plus one who didn t seem to be doing anything Need to sort this out or customers will go elsewhere to have a drink , Excellent hotel with great facilities and good for O2 concert we were attending 
357239,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The bed was extra comfortable we booked a table for dinner food was amazing shower was nice a powerful my view from the room was gorgeous bright Breen trees we absolutely loved it it s a shame we couldn t stay just alittle longer
357240,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast had the useual problem with a buffet as the food was not very hot and a long wait for the coffee to arrive For my sat nav the hotel was hard to find as its in a one way street but did get good direction when I rang recption Rather overpriced for its facilities, Very freindly staff carpark very handy and good room on the 3rd floor
357241,De Vere Devonport House, Your parking charges were not evident from my booking although I do appreciate that it was there in the smaller print Previously you did not charge for this , This is our third stay here and we like particularly the comfort and the position of the hotel
357242,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Great location at Greenwich We loved the history of this area and De Vere Devonport House was a lovely place to stay for our short visit Comfortable clean room with breakfast provided 
357243,De Vere Devonport House, Nothing really , A nice hotel located in the centre of Greenwich with very friendly and helpful staff ideal for local visits and a short bus ride to the O2 arena with bus stops 2 minutes walk away An excellent buffet breakfast in all an ideal place to stay if your visiting the area 
357244,De Vere Devonport House, Exposed alcove edge and height of bed from the floor Not easy to see the hotel sign De Vere in the dark needs illuminating , The room was an alcove room on the top floor Meaning the window was a Dormer type So when you went to the bathroom if you weren t careful you d bang you head on the edge of the alcove Only other disappointment was the height of the bed My partner is only short and the bed was very high off the floor meaning that it was awkward getting in 
357245,De Vere Devonport House, concerned if you had a late arrival would you be able to find a space to park your vehicle, comfy bed electric fan to use fresh food great location customer service excellent
357246,De Vere Devonport House, Overheated Reception staff distinctly offhand on arrival Buffet breakfast good but staff assumed we d gone so took away our coffee and tea while we were helping ourselves to the cooked food , Location quiet at night Very substantial price reduction 
357247,De Vere Devonport House, It was very hot in the room the windows do not open well in fact the window in the bathroom didn t open at all We had the fan on and it was still uncomfortably hot The hotel could do with a face lift , Good location
357248,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The hotel was easy to find and welcoming The room was clean and tidy but a little tired with the lampshades looking a bit worn but everything you needed was there and the beds were very comfortable Breakfast was plentiful and pleasant and with an 11 o clock check out breakfast didn t feel rushed We used the MBNA Clipper service from Cutty Sark to get in and out of the center of London and it worked really well as we had wonderful weather 
357249,De Vere Devonport House, Room was much too warm but opening the windows meant having the noise of the outside fans presumably for the air conditioning somewhere in the building all the time There was a wedding on so lots of guests were congregating by the only working lift making it awkward to get in at times also the noise from the disco was very loud into the evening The staff on reception were not altogether great , excellent location comfortable room and beds lovely breakfast too 
357250,De Vere Devonport House, Quite expensive which was made particylarly apparent as the discrepancy of room prices between guests was quite extreme, The location of the property was absolutely perfect scrumptious breakfast and the staff were very kind and helpful 
357251,De Vere Devonport House, The standard evening meal was disappointing We both wanted smoked salmon starter and it was off I had goats cheese but it was not hot and creamy My friend had 3 tempura prawns with no side salad or bread My main of chicken curry was just curry and rice No chutney poppadums naan or anything Very ordinary The tortellini again was mediocre Breakfasts were fine , The sat nav said we were there before we were but once we found it it suited our needs very well The staff were extremely helpful food was good and the whole area is very pleasant with lots of greenery around Relatively easy acces into London by the DLR or riverboat We have stayed in central London previously but this was convenient coming down by road from Norfolk and out of the hustle and bustle of the city We ll definitely stay there again and a pub just down the road for a good meal 
357252,De Vere Devonport House, Because I d added my daughter s and granddaughter s name to one of the rooms there was a problem checking in but it was sorted out eventually , The rooms and accommodation were adequate for our needs good breakfast and not bad value for money for London 
357253,De Vere Devonport House, Bathrooms need an update and some of the decor is a little tired , Very welcoming staff Beautiful old building Great location Great variety of produce for breakfast Ability to request the bedroom we are comfortable in 
357254,De Vere Devonport House, Nothing really we were very impressed with our first stay at this hotel, The location of the hotel was just great we could easily walk to all that Greenwich had to offer and the hotel facilities and staff were excellent We will certainly return to this hotel in future 
357255,De Vere Devonport House, We understand from the hotel that the building is listed which restricts the amount one could open the windows but to have been able to have had the windows open a little more would have been good , Breakfasts were very good plenty of fresh fruit and a variety of other food in addition to the cooked breakfast all well laid out and easy to find The staff were very friendly and most helpful We also liked our room which was very quiet 
357256,De Vere Devonport House, The bathroom was a little frayed around the edges in some respects and could do with a little refurbishment soon , Comfortable room good location didn t check out the other facilities 
357257,De Vere Devonport House, We have stayed there three times and will return because of the location However we have always found the reception staff very unfriendly answering phones before dealing with customers at the desk On one occasion a staff member saw me approach the desk and she left her seat and went into an inner office while we waited at the desk She did not return for several minutes , Location and facilities suit us very well 
357258,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Location was excellent and the rooms were larger than you usually get in London only problem was that the duvets were extremely thick and as such were far too hot for May We did have a couple of issues but the staff got them resolved immediately Would certainly book again 
357259,De Vere Devonport House, The sink in the bathroom didnt work and although we reported it straight away it was not resolved during our stay and was extremely inconvenient Unfortunately because we had not booked directly with the hotel but Booking com the Manager was unable to offer a refund on the bill only a discount voucher on our next visit As that is unlikely we received no recompense for the inconvenience experienced , Hotel is ideally placed to explore Greenwich
357260,De Vere Devonport House, Understaffed bar in the evening The poor bartender Ricardo was left to serve over 100 wedding guests by himself The guy had a great attitude though and was a credit to the hotel Just a shame it took over 90 minutes for some of the supervisors to come and assist him only once he d run out of glasses and draught beer Bar prices are very high 13 for a pint of beer and a medium white wine is steep even by London prices It s a De Vere not the Savoy and when you consider it was understaffed too it was disappointing Staff were rushed off their feet at breakfast and we had to wait a long time just to get a tea coffee , Great location in central Greenwich We managed to get parking on site though it is limited The receptionist kindly gave us 2 hours extra for free the next day too Room was nice and spacious everywhere was clean Friendly helpful staff just poorly managed with no communication and organisation apparent Food at breakfast was good
357261,De Vere Devonport House, Fact due to various reasons I could not get an evening meal on the 30th April I was asked did I book Apparently they had some special offers on I complained as the same thing happened at Breakfast on the morning of the 1st May I could not get a breakfast I told them that Residents must be told and be provided with a Booking time by the Hotel so as to be able to eat This spoilt my second visit to this Hotel , The restaurant evening meal is excellent
357262,De Vere Devonport House, There was nothing to dislike It is an old building so if you don t like traditional decor and sash windows and you are looking for modern then bear it in mind Probably could use a refresh but great for us , Really good breakfast and very comfy bed 
357263,De Vere Devonport House, Staff quite rude and grumpy and breakfast both days was poor Cleaners very noisy each morning from 8am onwards so no chance of a lie in , Great location and bedroom was good
357264,De Vere Devonport House, Quite strict rules about breakfast we had to leave early Saturday morning 15 mins too early for the starting time of breakfast 7 30 and we couldn t get a croissant and coffee to go before The room had single glazing and was on a courtyard therefore it was a little noisy , Great location just one 1 walking to the park staff was friendly and helping 
357265,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The customer service was impeccable It is a long time since I have received service like this in a British hotel Your staff are wonderful We went out for a run early to be greeted on our return by a doorman proffering a bottle of water and fresh towel 
357266,De Vere Devonport House, Although the room was supposed to be suitable for people with disabilities the shower arrangement was quite wrong for Peter Impossible for him to climb into the bath for a shower Also toilets for disabled people need to be higher than usual Our toilet was quite low though the rails at the side were just right , Staff excellent very helpful Bed very comfortable room quiet Excellent communication before our visit due to my husband s particular needs 
357267,De Vere Devonport House, Tiles around bath tub were crumbling and in need of replacement Room was the smallest and most cramped I ve ever experienced at the Devonport Not enough room to position the guest chair so that tv could be viewed Very sad that the Devonport does not have rooms to accommodate all my relatives and myself for my son s wedding this June 13 19 so have had to book my family group into the Ibis rather than being able to introduce the positive Devonport experience to relatives , Everton the breakfast manager is the primary reason I ve stayed at the Devonport 6 times in the last four years He is so exuberant and friendly and always remembers me Also the property has no surprises and feels like my home whenever I visit Front desk operations were the best this trip ever Previously confusion was the operating style at the front desk with communication skills with guests and among staff being poor a refreshing Improvement this trip 
357268,De Vere Devonport House, The only toiletries were shower gel No hairdryer Only used the bar once as the barman kept pouring the drinks flat and at 5 a pint this lack of training was disappointing , Lovely historic building Excellent location for visiting Greenwich landmarks and for access to the Thames transport links 
357269,De Vere Devonport House, Having to pay gor car park Price should include parking as we were guests of the Hotel It is an extra cost and would be an extra incentive to chose the Hotel IF free parking was included We had a nice room but we were not told that it was directly over a Wedding Disco Maybe reserving the room for Wedding Guests would have been appropriate However this did not spoil our overall stay for the 3 days , Liked the location Staff and breakfast
357270,De Vere Devonport House, Decor and room and hotel in general the decor was dated overall In our room 103 worn out bathroom floor tiles broken and cracked toilet roll holder was too close to the toilet practically sat on it the blinds were water stained and split and broken the tiles and grout awfully dirty carpet old and worn in places The bed was cumfy but the pillows were flat and well used wardrobe handles missing 2 nights 596 not cheap , Thought your staff were excellent reception restaurant staff and room staff all excellent 
357271,De Vere Devonport House, We had a twin room and The beds had casters on unfortunately the beds were only held in place by gravity hence if you sat up in bed and put your back on the headboard the bed rolled across the room good fun but not practical although it did give us a few laughs Tip if you intend to read in bed put the lounge chair at the bottom of the bed problem solved , Our room was bright and quiet 
357272,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable and although we were in the centre of Greenwich it was very quiet Also we were a little worried that because there was a wedding reception at the hotel we wouldn t be able to get any sleep but the band finished at exactly midnight which ensured we got slept well 
357273,De Vere Devonport House, windows only open about two inches the room was to warm however there is a portable fan , location excellent for all of greenwich really good breakfast 
357274,De Vere Devonport House, Room had a sloping roof not brilliant for a tall man Double bed was dreadful Mattress at some stage had been stored on its side as a result it was misshapen and uncomfortable to lie on , Very central for Observatory parks museums Cutty Sark etc Good choice of local restaurants cafes Good breakfast
357275,De Vere Devonport House, Was expecting the a la carte menu which is still on the website instead was only a limited set menu Also dessert described as a fruit trifle contained only fruit jelly no fruit , Secluded relatively quiet location excellently located adjacent to the Greenwich museums good sized room and bed well furnished Pleasant restaurant and bar Very comprehensive breakfast Convenient car parking at reasonable cost for London 
357276,De Vere Devonport House, The temperature of the room was too hot and no air conditioning Plus there was no fridge and the tv was small Overall a decent hotel but nothing wow, Staff seemed friendly enough and accommodating by holding our bags after check out
357277,De Vere Devonport House, a couple that we were with had to change rooms because the room had stains on the bedding and the carpet looked as if someone had been ill on it The room was generally not very clean,No Positive
357278,De Vere Devonport House, Room was too warm even with the small window open The restaurant was too cramped which made it tricky to move from table to the servery The bathroom could do with a refurb , Good location Easy car parking Good breakfast 
357279,De Vere Devonport House, the beds are quite firm but that is just a personal choice as I have quite a soft mattress at home The room got really warm at night so don t forget to crack a window , Staff were really friendly and helpful both when we got there and during breakfast It was a great location for getting to the o2 we talk a walk along the Thames path in the morning to get to our event and it was lovely just under 2 miles As a bonus we were right by the Cutty Sark Lots of places to eat and drink nearby too Breakfast was good nice choice of hot and cold and the coffee tasted great 
357280,De Vere Devonport House, Incident with room but addressed well by hotel, Staff very professional in manner and personality Food plentiful and quality Had issue with our room the night staff offered to move us straight away 3 30 am very pleasing gesture however decided to move after breakfast as not to disturb other guest but well done to night staff Would definitely stay here again 
357281,De Vere Devonport House, I found the bed a bit uncomfortable but I m quite fussy The room was also quite hot at night but I didn t feel comfortable leaving the window open , How spacious the room was The bathroom was lovely 
357282,De Vere Devonport House, The curtains The pillows the curtains didn t close properly and the pillows we found rather lumpy ok that s personal opinion , The location of the hotel is excellent right in the middle of peaceful park gardens but close to all the amenities and visitor attractions Excellent breakfast 
357283,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast is far too expensive Get the same thing half price in a number of local places , Great location and good rates for London Lots of history with the building and located next door to the Maritime Museum and Greenwich park If you re going to the O2 Arena it is 5 mins from Greenwich pier where you can get the river bus No traffic no queues bonus 
357284,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Excellent full English breakfast and comfortable bed Nice view onto the park in front of the hotel towards the Cutty Sark Relax in the evening with a good pint of beer in the officers mess in a comfy chair 
357285,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast food offering was rather ordinary Ate out on the third day as couldn t face the same selection again Porridge only offered on one day Had to ask for it the second day but no additions offered e g Dried fruit and honey Fruit offering included tinned fruit and a fresh fruit salad which was about 90 apple , Peaceful location Prompt check in and checkout Breakfast staff in the restaurant 
357286,De Vere Devonport House, Room was scruffy with mouldy and broken tiles in the bathroom Noise from the air conditioning plant outside the room was excessive Carpet dirty with stains , Breakfast was very good 
357287,De Vere Devonport House, Can t think of anything Just perfect , The room was very pleasant Bed extremely comfortable Breakfast very enjoyable and good selection of fresh food Greenwich lovely place to explore and so much to see and do Bus stop right outside Who could ask for more 
357288,De Vere Devonport House, Could be more tourist information available Reception have maps but need to ask , Ideally situated for museums and Cutty Sark Easy to get around by water bus on the Thames buses and train station nearby too Only one stop to the O2 for concert Quiet location very close to gardens and Greenwich Observatory and museums Good choice for breakfast wonderful yogurt and fruit pot and selection of cooked buffet food 
357289,De Vere Devonport House, Too be honest was a superior room but would have the same facilities in a travel lodge The only real difference was parking and location , Can not fault the location and parking facilities 
357290,De Vere Devonport House, Bathroom definitely needs to be refurbished but was fully functional , Bedroom was spacious if a little tired Breakfast selection was excellent though the coffee could have been a little hotter Good service from hotel staff thanks 
357291,De Vere Devonport House, Nothing , Central location in Greenwich with car parking at 10 per day which was good for London Beautiful grounds and plenty of places to eat and drink in the area Plenty of choice for breakfast and tasty sausages We were visiting Excel and it was easy to get to would definitely stay here again Used the river taxis to get to central London a more relaxed trip than the underground Love Greenwich 
357292,De Vere Devonport House, Old hotel in need of major renovation to make it worthy of its fabulous location Total disappointment that a hotel in such a historic site was in need of update and essentially shabby Also it bills itself as a conference center but the facilities were poor Nothing worked in the way a true business professional needs them to Has the potential to be so much better but no one has bothered , Superb location in a beautiful and historic part of London 
357293,De Vere Devonport House, Plastic Loo seat I ll fitting taps need rescale Curtains didn t quite close, Location staff food fantastic Only let down was ill fitting curtains and bathroom needed maintenance
357294,De Vere Devonport House, The breakfast was not up to the standard expected in a hotel with this starring Croissants were small hard and cold possibly stale The whole place needed a good renovation and overhaul as it just looked tired and a bit shabby in the public areas The bathroom in our room had a smashed floor tile and the washbasin was cracked , The location was superb This lovely old building was situated in the heart of Greenwich and within a comfortable walking distance of everything we had come to see Royal Observatory National Maritime Museum etc 
357295,De Vere Devonport House, Bed a little hard Card needed to be reset twice to use lift , Room was warm and comfortable Breakfast was really excellent Loved the lounge area with coffee available and bag storage

357299,De Vere Devonport House, Stray pubic hair in the bathroom when we arrived but otherwise very clean , Location was excellent Tea included two peppermint tea bags which is rare compared to othe hotels I have stayed in normally only breakfast tea 
357300,De Vere Devonport House, Nothing to complain about , Loved the beautiful spotless room overlooking the grounds to the front Really comfy bed it was an effort to get up for breakfast but having stayed there before we knew how good the breakfast is and didn t want to miss that Always stay here when we are going to the O2 and like to travel to the O2 by the river boat which is a 5 minute walk away Relaxing clean hotel with really friendly staff 
357301,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Car parking is easy particularly for Greenwich which can be busy with visitors Visited several times and always possible to get space and at fair price for guests 
357302,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast is very poor of choice one of the worst I ve seen Bathrooms are a bit old , Location is really good close to the museums and the park

357305,De Vere Devonport House, Sandwich in the bar came with nothing no serviettes sauces or salt peppernot even butter plenty of ham and cheese but that was it bread ham cheese I know it was late could not eat poached eggs on Fri morning full of vinegar breakfast better Saturday morning, Location
357306,De Vere Devonport House, The bed was too firm for 2 old crocs with bad backs memory foam toppers as an option would have made the stay perfect , The staff were always smiling and helpful
357307,De Vere Devonport House, Tatty around the edges bathroom window peeling and no fan in bathroom Very small rooms , Great location for O2 and central London Great to park in front of hotel for a reasonable price 
357308,De Vere Devonport House, Beds were very small narrow very high and very uncomfortable Got no decent sleep for 2 nights and woke up every 2 hours due to the awful beds Went home for a rest Bill was overstated and I was charged for room service I did not order items on bill made no sense and were unrelated to what I ordered very misleading Hotel had a cold and uncaring atmosphere Residents were subjected to 8 hours of TV Sport on Saturday and there was also sport on the radio at the bar 50 yards away playing in counter harmony to that on the TV Awful There was hardly ever anyone on the bar to provide drinks or information to guests and you had to go looking for someone each time you wanted something, Location was very close to Observatory shops and restaurants
357309,De Vere Devonport House, Small negative had to ask for shampoo Not a problem as believe in saving on plastics but would have been good to know about having to request in advance , Great location in Greenwich and short walk from Cutty Sark DLR station Asked for a quiet twin on the top floor and got a large corner room on the top floor at end of several halls Did not mind the distance from the lift as large rectangle building since room dimensions were generous Ironically there were others in that hallway as one could hear voices through the room doors but luckily this old building has thick walls so once in the room it seemed ok Also great that windows actually could be opened 
357310,De Vere Devonport House, BBC1 not available on TV in lounge very disappointing as we wanted to watch England v Wales Rugby match Bedding although clean and soft did have a hole in it and duvet was much bigger than cover and seemed a bit tired No Fridge shampoo or body lotion just shower gel , Comfy bed clean room 
357311,De Vere Devonport House, The restaurant is disappointing Limited choice which can indicate fresh local cooking The menu is VERY limited if you have an allergy which doesnt indicate local cooking Not up to the standard of the hotel Its a bit of a maze and security locks on lift and stairwell doors are annoying when you have your hands full , Beautiful character and historic property in quiet location in the heart of Greenwich close to many good restaurants Reserved but professional staff are helpful there is parking on site and good wifi 
357312,De Vere Devonport House, Room was cold and windows were breezy No air conditioning had to turn the radiator up Bed side lamp didn t work Room was small and had brown and orange dated decor looked nothing like the pictures on the website Paid more money than a premier in and this was far worse , We were able to check in early Location was good to get to the o2 Short bus journey away 
357313,De Vere Devonport House, After at least a dozen visits to this hotel we never seem to appear on their database as regular customers , Central position to Greenwich and direct access to London city centre Competent management and friendly staff 
357314,De Vere Devonport House, Room was located on 1st floor over a Conference Room which was very noisy with music first thing in morning Was woken to Star Wars theme music blasting at 7 30am someone was checking the facilities were working apparently Request room away from Conferencing Centre , Location is very good handy for all attractions and transport links 
357315,De Vere Devonport House, That cleaner knocked door at 9 30 am To ask if we had finished Check out is 11am At least wait till 10am or check at reception who has checked out Felt harassed to leave , Location location x
357316,De Vere Devonport House, There was nothing they would have had improv d upon , I had told the hotel by email that this was a 21st treat for my son and his girlfriend The two were blown away by the effort the hotel put into welcoming them and recognising the occasion They loved their room and the surprise of a Happy Birthday Cake Thank you so much 
357317,De Vere Devonport House, The food which was part of the deal was disappointing Breakfast was adequate but watery yogurt in a jug tasteless melon dry croissants The evening meal was mixed both soup and risotto were too salty Too little care taken Though the service for both breakfast and dinner was good , Brilliant location for views across the river and access to river and rail transport into London Right next to Maritime Museum and Greenwich park Comfortable room recently furnished and decorated Pleasant staff 
357318,De Vere Devonport House, Room could have been a bit warmer This is likely not a big deal for most of the year I visited in a cold spell in January A warm shower really helped , Wonderfull staff very responsive nice and clean with a modern appeal Great restaurants all around 
357319,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast selection is good but could have been hotter croissants not the best Our bathroom could have done with a face lift Single glazed windows still allow noise from road to spoil mornings , The location is excellent plenty of transport links but also plenty to do in Greenwich great market shops and eateries plus some very interesting pubs The hotel is good too very close to the park a walk in is not to be missed especially for the view of London from near the Royal Observatory at the top of the hill 
357320,De Vere Devonport House, Bathroom and bedroom carpet looking worn TV a bit small for me , Location is fine once you know but satnav can take you the wrong way Beware Bathroom ours was looking a bit tired but shower was good 
357321,De Vere Devonport House, Didn t get a wink of sleep Door outside keeps banging and there were lots of heavy footsteps upstairs, Location was great and perfect for us as seeing a gig at the o2

357323,De Vere Devonport House, There wasn t really anything I didn t like It was a little more expensive than I m used to but then the convenience for access to Royal Museums Greenwich is superb , The room was spacious beds comfortable and the bathroom very well equipped 
357324,De Vere Devonport House, Evening meal set menu was disappointing no a la carte menu on offer , Very convenient location for Greenwich and surrounds south side of London Transport links a bonus 
357325,De Vere Devonport House, We had requested early arrival times and a cot for one of our rooms however we arrived later than planned but the rooms still weren t ready and that was after checking with Booking Com that everything would be ready The cot was in extremely poor condition and too dangerous for us to put our Grandson in We reported the fact to the desk but nothing was done about it We are waiting to hear from management about that issue The shower areas could do with a anti mould and mildew remover in our room anyway There needs to be a sign post directing you to the car park at the rear of the hotel as it took a bit of searching for that s not really a complaint , We loved the location for us it was perfect The rooms were comfortable not massive but fine for our requirements The gardens are a bonus especially for the little one to run around safely There is a very useful business suite with computers and Tea coffee available on tap The hotel is next door to the Maritime Museum and a few minutes from the Cutty Sark If you like history then this is the place to stay The underground is just a short walk not clearly signposted there are the ferry boats and river cruises a stones throw away You can use Oyster cards on the trains busses and some ferries The O2 is just 2 miles up the road So a thumbs up 
357326,De Vere Devonport House, No fridge or safe in room as we stayed for couple of nights it would have been preferable, Lovely hotel excellent parking facilities location was absolutely great staff so helpful we will definitely use again the icing on the cake literally as it was our wedding anniversary they had put some lovely muffins on a plate decorated on chocolate with Happy Anniversay such a wonderful gesture really appreciated 
357327,De Vere Devonport House, Slightly wider range of tea coffee in the room could include hot chocolate and biscuits Room too hot but was able to adjust , Location very good for museum pier and village Hotel parking very good Very helpful pleasant staff room clean 
357328,De Vere Devonport House, The chef managed to decorate the smoked salmon with the lemon posset pudding rather than the lemon mayo which made an interesting starter Hallway carpets look as if a good shampoon might be in order but rooms fine , Fantastic location during tube strike We were going to boat show which was accessible via the DLR Dockland Light Railway
357329,De Vere Devonport House, The bathroom was a bit dirty but I think that was because it needs to be updated , The staff were all very helpful and friendly The breakfast was really good 
357330,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Staff were fabulous very busy in the bar on the friday as there was a wedding and a conference but all served with a smile No atmosphere on the Saturday it was very quiet but we were out so it made no difference to us The location was fabulous right at the entrance to greenwich park opposite the naval college and a 5 minute walk from cutty sark station Loads of lovery bars and restaurants a stones throw away We will be back 
357331,De Vere Devonport House, The room was small it was extremely warm and couldn t open the windows , The Location was brilliant The Hotel itself was immaculate The staff and the booking in process was the best I ve experienced 
357332,De Vere Devonport House, The rooms are quiet dated and the beds arent the most comfortable They also move , The building is in a great location which is close enough to the inner city with the added luxury of Greenwich park and shops The staff were helpful and tried to resolve things quickly Our room had a small infestation of ladybirds and my partner requested a new room which they changed promptly

357335,De Vere Devonport House, There was no wow factor in the rooms They were very utilitarian with drab dated decor , The location and views were nice The breakfast was lovely but for the price of the room breakfast should have been included 
357336,De Vere Devonport House, Being in the heart of Greenwich I suspect that this wonderful building is Grade 1 listed This means that the windows are single glazed and on occasions there can be traffic noise in the rooms that face the main road It s worth remembering that parking is extra In this day and age it is fairly normal for better hotels to have rooms fitted with safes but not here Some of the rooms have been updated and I suggest that you ask for one of these if you intend to visit , This hotel is in a wonderful location the staff always keen to help especially Tim and the discounted breakfast is good value for money 
357337,De Vere Devonport House, It would be preferable to inform customers that the restaurant is closed due to a function possibily by email so that the customer can make an informed choice about whether the hotel is suitable for their needs ,No Positive
357338,De Vere Devonport House, Staff were unhelpful and had to ask numerous times for a hairdryer It s too expensive for what you get but it was in my old neighbourhood and that s why I booked , location
357339,De Vere Devonport House, We only stayed for 1 night and found nothing to complain about , Breakfast was really nice with good choice and the staff were very helpful The location was great too only 5 min walk from the station Hotel was spot on for what we wanted 
357340,De Vere Devonport House, The rooms were basic and in desperate need of decoration Extremely dark and dowdy and sparsely furnished with what looked like odd 2nd hand furniture There was mould in the grouting of the tiles in the bathroom and ingrained dirt and staining around the edges of the bathroom floor It was superficially clean We had been upgraded to a superior room when we arrived I dread to think what our original room would have been like The windows were single glazed and did not fit well therefore the traffic disturbed our night It certainly wasn t four star standard and not worth the money We have stayed in better budget hotels which are cheaper We are not normally picky but we were very disappointed and would not stay there again or recommend it , The location was very good for accessing places of interest in Greenwich and the staff were quite nice

357344,De Vere Devonport House, If I m being picky some cracks around the windows which let in a bit of a draft but the heating corrected that Perhaps a little updating needed e g Taps looked a bit tired and old but this did not detract from a very pleasant stay , Staff were excellent friendly and couldn t do enough to help Rang them as I was running late and asked them to arrange a taxi which they did and then rang me back to confirm and inform me the taxi may be a little delayed due to local traffic congestion Very helpful and informative 
357345,De Vere Devonport House, Staff attitude was dreadful It is run down Has a cheap and uncomfortable Bar In addition Booking com let us down and when I turned up at the hotel my booking for 5 rooms was not recorded even though I had an emailed acknowledgment Poor performance by both the Hotel and Booking com , Needed to be in the area for a function Good location 
357346,De Vere Devonport House, Nothing , Easy walk from mainline station Very helpful and friendly staff The manager was particularly helpful and proactive Great credit to the hotel Hotel felt very safe and secure for a single traveller Hotel very well situated with wide selection of bars restaurants and attractions within easy walking distance Walking directions were very easy to follw Would most definatetely stay here again
357347,De Vere Devonport House, Dinner in room on night of my arrival was not nice Ordered breakfast in my room for following morning It never arrived Wifi was not usable No bottled water in rooms, Bed soft but comfortable
357348,De Vere Devonport House, I think for the price breakfast could have been included also the tray in the room could have included a bottle of water and perhaps some biscuits like most other places nowadays We got back to the hotel at twenty past midnight and wanted drinking water We asked at reception if we could get a bottle to be told it cost 6 and they would have to charge 5 room service On the plus side we were told that there was a water dispenser on one of the floors that was free So was all good in the end We were in room 312 which had a generator or something outside the window so was a little bit noisy With the windows closed it was ok but wouldn t be so good in the summer , Great location Lovely building Nice staff Good sized room comfortable bed Nice shower 
357349,De Vere Devonport House, The towels were rough and there wasn t any robes which I like to pop on after having a bath and then getting ready to go out for the evening the windows were a little drafty and the radiator was making a funny noise but had to have it on as the temp outside was freezing and the tea and coffee facilities were 1 milk each and that s it so wasn t able to have more than 1 and when you come in freezing after walking around the markets you need a nice hot drink and then another one in the morning , The location was amazing and the view from our window was fantastic had a brilliant nigh night out in Greenwich hotel looks beautiful and grand

357409,De Vere Devonport House, Sadly the property was severely let down by the fact that the rooms and bedroom hallways were like saunas no air con The windows barely opened This led to a very poor nights sleep made worse by our room being overrun with wasps whom were trying to attack the sluggish dying bees from the hives on the ground below The livestock is natural and nothing can be done about it but despite the provision of a room fan which sadly just blew the boiling hot air around if there had been air con units you would not have had to open the windows which let the wasps in The provision of a fridge would have been helpful too so if you wanted to you could take a cooling drink Sadly this was not provided and rendered you having to drink very warm water in the middle of the night I would not recommend staying here in the height of summer as a consequence To get dressed for a wedding or function would be horrendous as you d be sweating so badly As a consequence I d definitely recommend this place as a mid winter hotel , The staff were outstanding The building lovely The location brilliant

357490,De Vere Devonport House, Male receptionist His rude and arrogant manner on our arrival was only redeemed later by the other staff who were most helpful Especially the young lady who sorted out a problem with the parking charges which had already been agreed on our booking We personally escort and arrange tours for clients from many parts of the world and pride ourselves on good interpersonal skills I gave him warning that his manner was offensive and inflammatory but he really didn t have a clue In spite of this he really couldn t have cared less and probably never will I would certainly not employ him maybe in the kitchen washing the dishes It left a nasty taste in our mouths which made us feel critical and disatisfied with the wholeplace It was not until the young lady came up to our room resolved everything and gave an apology did we start enjoying ourselves as we were having a short holiday ourselves prior to picking up clients Please send him to charm school or let him go he will do nothing for your business , Excellent location and once we had got over Mr Nasty enjoyed our stay read some reviews think they were a bit picky in the main Ok decor was a bit old but breakfast good though one member of staff funny but a bit OTT Beds comfy and clean too Other staff very pleasant

357500,De Vere Devonport House, Staff did not really seem like they wanted to help Too many doors in the hallways Breakfast is very pricey , Close to Cuty Sark and Greenwhich attractions Very tidy and situated on beautiful grounds 
357501,De Vere Devonport House, Black mould in the bathroom the bathroom facilities were quite dated and needed to be refurbished with quite a lot of dirt between the tiles Disappointed with the lack of cleanliness of the bathroom for a four star hotel The view from our window was a graveyard which although is not the worst thing in the world I would expect a bit a clarity that was a possibility when booking your stay Our major gripe was the poor service provided by the reception staff who were generally not helpful had absolutely no common sense and could not comprehend the concept of good communication or customer service The s standard response that was given to everybody with a request or a complaint was I will have to ask the manager After taking payment upon our arrival which we assumed was payment for our accommodation we were informed on check out this was in fact not the required payment for the room and we had to make another payment for the room The receptionist decide to cancel my previous transaction and request full payment rather than charge me the outstanding 8 Due to this I am currently unable to access to the initial payment of 200 as it is still allocated or within a shadow by my credit card provider Overall we were generally disappointed with our stay ,No Positive
357502,De Vere Devonport House, Very few facilities eg coffee shop leisure facilities Decor tired could do with refurbishing, The staff went out of their way to be friendly welcoming

357505,De Vere Devonport House, We booked 3 rooms The rooms are very dated and need modernising We asked for a cot in one room and an extra bed in each of the other rooms The cot was there when we arrived but there were no extra beds in the other rooms We had to contact reception and request the two beds When we returned much later on the evening only one bed had been delivered so it was an uncomfortable nights sleep as there was three in the one bed , Location of the hotel
357506,De Vere Devonport House, Reception staff Booking a room for three people being given a very small room for two Having to ask about third bed Staff blamed booking com despite me ringing to confirm Noise from room next door and above Disorganised breakfast service although food was good Unable to get through to reception when calling externally just went to answer phone 3 times , Location and parking prices were good Hotel was generally clean 
357507,De Vere Devonport House, Very noisy at night Noise from weddings went on very late Couldn t sleep Think the noise insulation not adequate we were on 4th floor Would have been worse lower down maybe made worse by wedding guests being able to get out onto balconies below rooms were people were trying to sleep , Very nice breakfast Nice to have space to leave the car and at a reasonable fee 
357508,De Vere Devonport House, For the price we paid it should have been free for breakfast and lunch, The bed was comfy good channels on the TV staff were so nice to us and gave us advice on how to get to places
357509,De Vere Devonport House, A bathroom light and a bedroom light did not work in addition to no full length mirror and no air conditioning We were supplied with 4 tissues and one small shampoo shower gel between us and the towels were of very poor quality I had requested a quiet room on a high floor but was given a room on the 1st floor above a wedding reception , Location
357510,De Vere Devonport House, One of the rooms was so small there was nowhere to put the suitcase Carpets in public areas and tiling in bathrooms in need of updating Very much a wedding hotel think we saw 3 brides , Great location walking distance to everything in Greenwich and beautiful exterior Staff very pleasant 
357511,De Vere Devonport House, Poor hanging space in room 126 and NO drawers especially as we had requested large room with space for extra clothes for the wedding , Excellent parking especially as our son s wedding reception was next door in the Brasserie at the Maritime Museum and we had lots of setting up to do so access through the back door there was easy 
357512,De Vere Devonport House, Old wood structure people stepping hard on top of your head while sleeping made my life miserable Unfortunately they were a lot didn t complain as there is no solution against people with such education Single glazing do not ensure sufficient soundproofing against the 24 7 road and air traffic Toilet flush not efficient need to flush 3 4 times No minibar in the room despite the high cost of the room per night , Decent number of parking lots modern single water tap at the sink so I can shave and brush teeth without using the shower Excellent position close to DLR tram stations lots of restaurants in short walking distance True high speed internet Very decent cost of parking 5 GBP day Heating was on so I could adjust the temperature using the radiator s thermostatic valve 
357513,De Vere Devonport House, Check in was quick and easy the first room we were allocated was a real disappointment bathroom floor tiles were cracked and uneven fan didn t work and generally the room was tired and in need of refurbishment Second room was better although I still think the hotel is overdue a refurb Breakfast was lovely great selection from the buffet friendly staff we had it included in our package but quite expensive if you didn t Booked in for the special pre marathon pasta buffet the evening before the race and were bitterly disappointed No buffet just a menu of three choices Waited almost 40 mins one dish was not at all as ordered Ended up not paying for any of it Think the fact that they had a wedding in the hotel impacted on staff availability in the restaurant Added hugely to the stress the night before the marathon Managers v apologetic not just us who had problems that night virtually everyone in the restaurant did Moral don t advertise a special putting flyers in rooms to encourage take up if you can t deliver , We used this hotel as the base for the London Marathon The location was excellent being an easy walk to all the starts Also right in the heart of Greenwich with the Cutty Sark just down the road and all kinds of eateries on the doorstep 
357514,De Vere Devonport House, Couldn t think of any improvements that could be made, I stayed for the virgin London marathon and on arrival in the room were bags containing a cerebral piece of fruit and bottle of water which the hotel had provided for every guest in acknowledgement of the marathon They had also provided a special marathon evening meal for this who wanted it and started breakfast extra early on marathon day All in all very thoughtful
357515,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The location and views for the start of the London Marathon it couldn t have been closer So impressed at how accommodating the hotel was for marathon runners bag of fruit and water in the room early opening for breakfast Thoughtful My second de Vere hotel in two weeks and standard is really high 
357516,De Vere Devonport House, Considering I ve lived for many years in London slightly shabby rooms were expected Definitely not a 4 rather a good 2 Bathroom floor tiles broken low cost amenities installed so everything feels quite cheap fragile shower dripping protection Bedroom bed ber uncomfortable soft like an inflatable dinghy the kids extra bed looked felt like it was used in One Flew Over The Cuckoo s Nest no Air Conditioning the bedroom was hot as at Adriatic in the summer The walls the doors have to be made from plaster as you can hear people walking way away even from the other hallway , Location Accommodating staff clean 
357517,De Vere Devonport House, Bathroom was tired but functional room was very hot on arrival and window would only open a small crack , Bedroom was clean and modern bed was comfy Very handy for Maritime Museum and Cutty Sark 
357518,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, We were visiting for our second visit and last time travelled as a family with children This time we were there for the London marathon and were impressed that they had gone out of their way to accommodate the runners with extras in the room and a special menu laid on There are lots of pubs shops and restaurants within walking distance and very close to the Tube station Views from the park are amazing Very happy with our stay and will be visiting again Reasonably priced accommodation 
357519,De Vere Devonport House, I was disturbed in the night by a loud buzzer that became increasingly more persistent I think someone was locked out The room was too warm , Girl on reception was helpful and very friendly and the breakfast was good 
357520,De Vere Devonport House, The curtains were broken in my room and didn t shut entirely properly which meant some sunlight getting in early morning , Nice big bathroom comfy bed hairdryer included good location 
357521,De Vere Devonport House, As there is a one way system in the locality we could see the hotel but weren t able to work out how to get to the car park Sat nav unable to help as it didn t have a number for the address I know this is not always possible Perhaps an explanation of which road to go down to access the car park would have been helpful , The location and parking facilties are brilliant
357522,De Vere Devonport House, We wanted some information about parking before we left but there is only a premium rate phone number to ring on We tried that but the person we spoke to was unable to give us specific info relating to this particular hotel I emailed instead and an automatic reply told me that the email would be responded to within 48 hours which wasn t helpful at all Apart from that though everything was great If you have a query email it early , Great location lovely staff good sized rooms nice big windows and comfy beds
357523,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, We didn t eat at the hotel at all but our room was clean and comfortable and the location couldn t have been better it was perfectly situated for everything to do in Greenwich and all within easy walking distance excellent 
357524,De Vere Devonport House, The wedding reception that went on until 1 in the morning the lack of warning the lack of an alternative quiet room The poor discount , Room and bed were great 
357525,De Vere Devonport House, Room Rock hard bed Filthy dirty radiator in en suite bathroom Dirty dusty venetian blinds in en suite No shampoo conditioner or body moisturiser and tissue box had one tissue No safe or fridge in room Reception staff not overly welcoming or interested in how we found our stay For a five star rating very disappointed with de vere group , Breakfast offered good choice and cooked breakfast well cooked Staff at breakfast friendly and helpful Good position for exploring Greenwich and a bus ride away from o2 
357526,De Vere Devonport House, Excellent location but I agree with other reviews that the hotel is a bit tatty in places and could do with a refurb and the price does not reflect this Bar and restaurant prices quite expensive but I expected this in London I stayed there as I was doing the London marathon and was hoping for an early night on the Saturday however there was a wedding reception taking place and the disco was incredibly loud This did spoil my stay so if you are looking for a peaceful location check first whether there are any functions booked ,No Positive
357527,De Vere Devonport House, Rooms were fairly basic small wardrobe and toiletries etc set up for only one person not two No aitr conditioning , Good location as we were there for the London Marathon 
357528,De Vere Devonport House, would have been nice to have a map that covered that area London for less street map in reception area does not cover Greenwich , the beds were very comfortable Very quiet and relaxing beautiful location 
357529,De Vere Devonport House, They had a wedding on which ruined my night sleep before the run It started at 8 30pn and went on until midnight although they did have a message in the room welcoming runners they had this function on which totally negated the message , Location for the London marathon
357530,De Vere Devonport House, There was alot of noise from a wedding party on the Saturday evening not ideal when alot of guests were up early for the marathon However the staff did state this would quieten down after 10pm and be finished by midnight Luckily I did manage to get a good nights sleep and staff were true to their word , We came for the marathon and the location was absolutely perfect both for access to the start but also to see the sights of Greenwich when not running The hotel also put on special marathon food and opened early for breakfast 
357531,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Helpful staff On site parking Excellent location with easy access to Greenwich attractions and Central London via Thames Clipper or DLR Overall good value 
357532,De Vere Devonport House, it would have been nice to have had a bottle of water in the bedroom 11 00 for a glass of wine in the restaurant we felt to be excessive so we would eat elsewhere next time The bedroom on 3rd floor was a bit small , Excellent choice of food at breakfast and friendly staff Ideal location for the O2 and general sightseeing of London 
357533,De Vere Devonport House, 2 O Clock check in breakfast cost, Very comfortable stay nice breakfast free parking stones throw from Cutty Sark DRL station so not difficult to get into London Centre

357535,De Vere Devonport House, Poor menu on Friday and wait of 40mins for main coarse Public lounge being disturbed by seminar meeting and on second day commandeered by party ,No Positive
357536,De Vere Devonport House, Didn t appear to be a bar area always useful when travelling on business If there was and I missed it then maybe a better sign would be a good idea , Great spot Comfy bed plenty of space in the room Decent choice for breakfast Friendly receptionist 
357537,De Vere Devonport House, Housekeeping staff yelling and arguing in hall early in am Thought it was drunk people only to find it was two maids arguing loudly over shift and room assignment complaints , Nice hotel great location
357538,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The hotel was very good no complaints The locations was excellent 3 mins from Cutty Sark and the Thames not to mention Greenwich Park 1 min walk Transport services were excellent both the train and clipper One member of staff was outstanding his name was Averton Grant always obliging and a very happy person he greeted everyone with a smile 
357539,De Vere Devonport House, The hotel bar is a tad too expensive 3 drinks came to 20 , We liked the option to extend our car parking We could leave our belongings securely whilst we explored the area 
357540,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The location was great for what we needed The hotel itself is stunning Staff very helpful and loved the brollies in the foyer in case it s raining Great idea 
357541,De Vere Devonport House, didn t have the best view from our room and the fan that was provided was very dusty and I had to clean it myself , it was a perfect location for sight seeing close to bus train and boat services lots of shops and food places near by the hotel itself was beautiful staff were friendly and offered help and information and even printed us a map with directions the room was spacious and clean would love to stay again 
357542,De Vere Devonport House, There was nothing I didn t like, We stayed in room 113 and it was big with a massive bathroom and bed was comfy nothing bad to report would def stay again
357543,De Vere Devonport House, The room had an awful smell despite the window being left open The towels had someone else s hair on it, The location was great and the staff was friendly and helpful
357544,De Vere Devonport House, Buffet breakfast although good selection was overcooked due to time left on display , Great location for o2 Near cutty Sark and good access to city sites Quiet location 
357545,De Vere Devonport House, Our room was located next to a fire door which woke me up with a loud bang very early The receptionist was extremely up himself The complimentary biscuits had already been eaten in our room , Bed was comfy The hotel is beautiful from the outside 
357546,De Vere Devonport House, Weather was mild but rooms were pretty hot even with radiators turned off and windows open , Comfy bed seemingly endless supply of hot water lovely deep bath yummy breakfast with masses of choices only a 2 min walk to the river taxi then 02 only 8 mins away on river taxi 
357547,De Vere Devonport House, The rooms are very very dated curtains ill fitting at windows bathroom tiles stained with mouldy grouting very small tv on low table difficult to see when in bed Carpet had seen better years Breakfast poor quality ingredients eggs solid beans cold tea grey coffee brown liquid , Was expecting a lot better for the 170 ish per night price Difficult to find something good to say nice to see some green grass at front of building 
357548,De Vere Devonport House, Bathroom was a tired as was the bar lounge Bar prices were excessive, Great location Good staff Peaceful atmosphere Really good value car parking
357549,De Vere Devonport House, Not sure the room reflected the price paid In need of TLC The extractor fan didn t work in the bathroom and the shower screen didn t align therefore the floor was soaked after each shower , Beds very comfortable hotel very quiet and staff very helpful Location perfect and parking costs incredibly good value 
357550,De Vere Devonport House, Light dimmer or lamp in bathroom as the light in here was very bright, Location room lovely baby cot offered Parking a bargain great for black Heath visit too 
357551,De Vere Devonport House, The basin in the ensuite was blocked They did fix it next day after I brought it to their attention An annoying constant low pump noise in the bedroom Room 201,No Positive
357552,De Vere Devonport House, The corridors are a bit of a labyrinth and the rooms on the top floor are a bit small Otherwise no complaints I ve stayed here a few times now and find it very restful, Lovely grand building in central Greenwich not beside a main road so not much noise at night Rooms vary in size but generally bigger than you d find in central London with spacious bathrooms The breakfast buffet is extensive and the staff are very friendly and helpful Prices can be really good when the hotel is quiet Close to DLR and overground trains so a great alternative to staying in the centre of London
357553,De Vere Devonport House, Pillows weren t very comfortable and the room overlooked the kitchen so the extractor fans were very noisy meaning no sleep , Very good choice for breakfast and freshly cooked 
357554,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, The beds were extremely comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful and the cooked breakfast was great I paid 98 including breakfast which was excellent value Will definitely be staying again 
357555,De Vere Devonport House, Hotel rooms bathroom a little tired curtains and blinds do not block out light and quite a lot of noise early in the morning , Great location with good transport links and local amenities on the door step Staff extremely friendly and helpful 
357556,De Vere Devonport House, Hotel is generally well kept and clean but some aspects of the decorations and finishes in the bedrooms particularly the floor and wall tiling in the E Suites need some attention Windows are not all well maintained and are not easy to open and close and let night sound in depending on what side of hotel you are sleeping I appreciate that this building might be a Listed building and the windows cannot be changed due to Planning restrictions which can only be expected in such a location Mattresses a little hard but may be OK for some , Location superb and my favourite in London so far and great to be near the market park waterside etc We had a reasonable view but not the best in the hotel Access to transport excellent Historic Elegant Buildings Class Architectural Heritage all round Lots to see for visitors Hotel facilities we used were good Rooms are good comfortable size and well appointed generally all rooms have En Suite I guess Staff pleasant friendly willing and accommodating Breakfasts great Car parking really good Would recommend hotel 
357557,De Vere Devonport House, Room was at top side of building so kept bumping my head on the sloping roof where my bed was positioned under, Staff very friendly especially in dining room very impressed with standard of the Hotel for the price paid even taking into consideration it was not based in Central London 
357558,De Vere Devonport House, The bathroom Smelt STRONGLY of damp and had black mould in several places Had to keep the door shut to the bathroom because of the smell We did report the problem to reception when we booked out the next day Yes we should have done it as soon as we realised there was a problem but as it was my birthday I did not want to waste time complaining at reception and moving rooms It is a problem that a guest at a De Vere hotel should not be having in the first place , The location allows easy walking access to all the attractions in Greenwich Old historic building with plenty of character Breakfast was good varied and plentiful Staff were pleasant and efficient Room 117 was good 
357559,De Vere Devonport House, Wedding reception disco being held in the function room below bedroom Would have beneficial to have been informed that it was taking place when checking in , Idea location for the O2

357561,De Vere Devonport House, Room overlooked bin store but that s being overly critical just to answer the question , Great location friendly staff free tea and coffee good sized rooms and good breakfast included Car parking also good and reasonably priced I left the car there for three days whilst in central London for a 15 pound fee 
357562,De Vere Devonport House, The only problem I had which was probably down to me Was that the room was very hot and I couldn t work out how to turn the temperature down , Staff were friendly and welcoming The hotel looks very grand and classy but I felt very comfortable with my 6yo daughter The room was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom The buffet breakfast was well stocked fresh and tasty 
357563,De Vere Devonport House, Very hard mattress Afternoon tea was a little overpriced, Friendly Staff Nice Big Room Clean Up to Date Bathroom with very powerful shower Nice bar area Excellent Location and Close to the O2 We had a very warm welcome from the staff at Devonport House they listened to our request to be away from the function room and bought up lovely decorated cakes wishing us a happy anniversary They were also extremely helpful and always smiled The location of the hotel is great and right next to a lovely park and its easy to get into central London by DLR or by the London Clipper Also a nice change for many hotels the shower was fantastic so powerful 
357564,De Vere Devonport House, Cleaning staff entered room without knocking Very busy with functions Not enough staff but they did their best On checkout two receptionists more intent on their private conversation whilst queue got longer Given wrong times for breakfast , Breakfast choice good 
357565,De Vere Devonport House, Room 310 tv very low down when in bed person furthest away can not see , Plenty of choice for breakfast Very light room Perfect location for walks in the park

357567,De Vere Devonport House, For the price should have included breakfast also awoke covered in around 8 ladybirds on my body even though i kept windows all closed i developed a rash due to an elergic reaction, The location and the room
357568,De Vere Devonport House, thick mugs for coffee tea and kenko sachets needs updating please, location good sized and comfortable room and excellent staff and lovely breakfast with plenty of choice 
357569,De Vere Devonport House, Most of the staff were very helpful but the information from reception particularly about having guests for breakfast was confusing It worked out fine in the end , The location is wonderful right next to Greenwich Park and the Naval Museum and the price great for a London hotel It is close to the DLR too Our room was comfortable and quiet 
357570,De Vere Devonport House, Carpeted floor aged bathroom cobwebs at the ceiling One day I came back all windows were open the heater was in full action and all lights were on , The location and the breakfast is great especially if you like the English breakfast style 
357571,De Vere Devonport House, strong smell of tobacco in lift Bedroom cold and heating very noisy D cor very dated Breakfast lacking variety for continental option , The staff very helpful and polite
357572,De Vere Devonport House, Poor quality pillows in our room However bed linen great we slept well, Great hotel with friendly staff good facilities a short cab ride 10 from O2 Greenwich has so much to offer
357573,De Vere Devonport House, No information on Greenwich although the receptionist did produce a map of the area when asked , Very comfy bed and great variety of breakfast items Although a central location it was nice and quiet 
357574,De Vere Devonport House, Room 219 The windows are old wooden ones They were mouldy and steamed up every morning The bathroom could have done with some TLC but everything worked , The reception and the restaurant areas were immaculate The staff were friendly and attentive 
357575,De Vere Devonport House, Would of eaten there in the evening but no one in the restaurant so looked a bit soleless , Lovely hotel Our room wasn t a very nice room there is probably better ones It was adapted for disabilities so sink very low and other adaptions Very recommended hotel though and I would go there again 
357576,De Vere Devonport House, A few more tea and coffee sachets in the room One coffee and one tea each feels stingy , The site of the hotel is great It feels like a wing of the maritime museum and is right by Greenwich park 
357577,De Vere Devonport House, The room was a nice cosy size for a double bed BUT we booked a twin room I was staying with my mum and so it wasn t really big enough accommodate twin beds Other reviewers have pointed this out too Basically 2 single beds are pushed together with no space between them This was actually ok for us but I imagine some guests wouldn t like it Also my mum is very short and has restricted mobility so struggled to actually get in her bed I didn t have any problems tho and loved how high and comfy my bed was , Staff excellent very friendly and conscientious Breakfast was very nice good selection of food Room clean quiet light and airy Shower didn t look like much but it was lovely hot powerful and consistent Architecture of the building impressive in beautiful in grounds and with Greenwich park behind 
357578,De Vere Devonport House, The restaurant menu for the one evening we ate on site was very limited There is quite a comprehensive menu advertised with some good sounding choices but for some reason this was not an option to us , A well located hotel in an area that we don t normally consider for trips to London for some unknown reason only 20mins into the City via train tube boat We would definitely look to stay in this area again in the future Decent rooms with enough space and facilities for a couple Good breakfast with a good variety of options available for all Restaurant food in the evening was of good quality and tasty Free wifi good connection and speed throughout Well priced parking on site 5 00 per 24hrs as a hotel guest Staff were all very good and friendly breakfast staff especially We would likely stay here again
357579,De Vere Devonport House, Buffet breakfast was ok On our first morning we missed out on bacon and on the second morning the bacon was too crunchy and overdone Everything else was fine Service good We only got one packet of biscuits on our tea tray on each day and there was two of us in our room , The room was very comfortable and warm The staff very accommodating The location was perfect for our stay as it was close to everything we wanted in Greenwich The tube station was a short walk so we could visit other parts of London easily 
357580,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast was a bit of a disaster the morning we were there queues waiting repeatedly for eggs and bacon to arrive Food not great quality eg black pudding inedible , Staff all friendly pleasant and efficient perfect location 
357581,De Vere Devonport House, breakfast is not very good could be improved, clean room quiet extremely friendly and assistive staff at reception desk good location for greenwich or for canary wharf
357582,De Vere Devonport House, More seating needed in foyer for waiting for friends taxis etc Only room to seat six or so Breakfast was only ok buffet style for the cooked elements so bacon black pudding etc were hard , Brilliant location for Greenwich s attractions Modern decor in room 
357583,De Vere Devonport House, We were lucky to stay during a time of low occupancy but the stud walls are paper thin here and not surprising in view of the historic nature of the building there s no soundproofing at all Take ear plugs if you want an undisturbed night s sleep Our room was clean but worn as conference event hotels in the UK tend to be , If location is important to you and you re not looking for creature comforts this is the place for you 
357584,De Vere Devonport House, There were a few hairs in the bathroom and the general fabrication decor is a little tired in places , The staff were great when I had to detour because the Blackwall Tunnel was closed and check in late at 1am 
357585,De Vere Devonport House, As the building is listed there is no double glazing therefore we could hear the road As we live in a semi rural area it was a problem , Lovely room overlooking the gardens at the front Staff charming and helpful
357586,De Vere Devonport House, There is nothing that we didn t like or enjoy about our stay, The parking was really useful the barman was excellent ensuring we had the wine we liked best and the hotel is in such a peaceful location 
357587,De Vere Devonport House, It took about 11 2 hours to get our meal served to us in the bar too long to have waited, The hotel was fine all except the length of time we waited for our food o
357588,De Vere Devonport House, One of the two days there was no warm water but that was not the mistake of the hotel and I got a compensation therefore I numbered the comfort 10 too ,No Positive
357589,De Vere Devonport House, We like fresh air and the restricted opening of the bedroom windows limits its availability We have stayed here in the past on a hot summers day and it was rather warm , Room clean quiet comfortable excellent breakfast Ample hassle free car parking We use it to visit nearby relatives but it is also a great and fun location from which to do London with its fast ferry service to the centre 
357590,De Vere Devonport House, The bathroom was in desperate need of refurbishment the buffet breakfast selection was good but the food and plates were cold , The staff were friendly and efficient the beds were comfortable 
357591,De Vere Devonport House, Although the choice at breakfast was good because it was buffet service some of the items were not quite hot enough e g the scrambled eggs But no other complaints, The position could not have been better for the sightseeing we did in Greenwich just perfect There were many places to eat close by We were less than 5 minutes walk from the Cutty Sark and the Maritime Museum Comfortable and quiet room with good wifi
357592,De Vere Devonport House, beer and snacks to expensive , Bedroom very spacious comfy bed and clean room good location only cost 10 to get to 02 by taxi Worth a stay and would stay again location is close to a few shops and restaurants 
357593,De Vere Devonport House, A shame the heating was not working in the reception and resturant especially on Valentine s Day , Within an hours walk to the O2 and very enjoyable on a fresh winters day Also close to park and water ferry 
357594,De Vere Devonport House, Windows slightly draughty only cos they were original sash , Bedroom nice and clean Iron and ironing board in room so at least you can run iron over creased clothes from your case

357600,De Vere Devonport House, The breakfast had a good range and was generally really nice but I really dislike watered down scrambled eggs that look pale Toiletries were also poor, Staff were so friendly including the breakfast staff which was a real novelty Great location
357601,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast slightly cold but we were eating quite late so cant really complain However we did NOT appreciate a phonecall very late at night enquiring whether we had ordered sandwiches Im sure it was just a rare mistake but maybe it could have been done differently Took ages to get back to sleep , Beds very comfy Reception staff and generally all the staff were helpful and friendly thank you 
357602,De Vere Devonport House, The rooms were a little basic in terms of creature comforts no safe no mini bar an empty tissue box one small tube of bath gel a broken TV remote no pens I expected more from a place that looks this good , Excellent central location and very clean hotel Free Wi Fi worked exceptionally well for a hotel Bar was comfortable and roomy 
357603,De Vere Devonport House, I would have liked a shower cubicle rather than a shower over a bath There were very limited electric sockets in the room I would have liked afternoon tea but this was only available if pre booked , The staff were friendly and helpful Car parking was easy and exceptionally good value Dinner was delicious The bed was very comfortable Breakfast service was extremely efficient and entertaining I even photographed the most exuberant waiter I ve ever encountered

357612,De Vere Devonport House, The wifi in the main conference hall wasn t adequate at all and negatively impacted on my conference experience Quick web access is really important when presenters are mentioning websites and resources so often so this was a major issue for me , The staff were friendly and often greeted us in corridors which created a positive genial environment around the hotel The food was good in terms of taste and variety and the dining room staff were quick to provide anything requested My bed was firm and comfortable and the shower was great Didn t hear other guests in nearby rooms so was able to get a good night s sleep 
357613,De Vere Devonport House, I made at least three phone calls for room service I was told that somebody would call me back but to no avail Either a management failure for understaffing or of an individual I feel there is no excuse It wasn t 3am it was 7 30am In contrast to many other hotels where I had to stay at during that season and where I really fell welcome as soon as I stepped in this one really fell very short on that front I was going to extend my stay only for one night but I preferred to sleep elsewhere without necesarily paying more Lovely buildihg absolutely amazing location but unfortunately they haven t caught up with the times , The location and the size of my bedroom 
357614,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Great location Staff all very helpful polite and friendly Very good choice for breakfast The dining room was not too big so did not feel like a cafeteria
357615,De Vere Devonport House, The original price per night quoted by Booking Com when we booked in October When we realised later that your quote was so much higher than others we had to phone up to get it reduced but it was still higher than if we had booked with the hotel direct I m afraid you have lost our business in the future , Great hotel have stayed there before Good location for all sorts of events in Greenwich and central London
357616,De Vere Devonport House, Outdated bathrooms Not a Good choice for room and bar meals Choice for breakfast was good but ran out before end of sitting , Location and view from room Room cleaning staff very friendly

357618,De Vere Devonport House, Unfortunately we were unable to use the restaurant for an evening meal because of an externally booked Christmas party , The facilities and staff were all to a high standard The location of this hotel and the parking are an added bonus The buffet breakfast is substantial 
357619,De Vere Devonport House, The postcode given for the hotel sends the satnav crazy returning you time and again to Greenwich Park in front of the Observatory a dead end Staff admitted they had been told this but were uninterested in passing on the message Tip substitute N for the W at the end of the postcode We requested a quiet room but it wasn t at all quiet The room was only just about big enough for two with one hard chair or the bed to sit on so not very comfortable , Parking in front of hotel though we didn t enjoy having to pay extra for it Being able to walk to the river museums Cutty Sark the market cinema restaurants etc 
357620,De Vere Devonport House, The noisy aeroplanes but we know that is out of your control , The happy welcome especially the chap who seems to run the restarant at breakfast time he is always so welcoming and friendly 
357621,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Greenwich is a great place to stay with the National Maritime Museum Observatory and Curry Sark Look out for Jamie Oliver Restaurant in the High Street Best of all travel from central London or O2 by Thames Fast Catamaran along the Thames and see history from the Tower to the Shard stunning at night

357627,De Vere Devonport House, On the Friday night 11th the place was rammed with Christmas parties It was not possible for anyone to provide a coffee when I got back to the hotel about 10pm The bar did not have a coffee machine and the dining room had become a disco Disappointing , Convenient location 
357628,De Vere Devonport House, The only thing that let the hotel down was 1 moody staff member at the bar late evening she was detetmined that i should get my own coffee as it was free if i went up to the first floor i just wanted a coffee and really did not want to go get it myself and i really did not mind if i had to pay for it Had to ask twice before she reluctantly went to get a coffee for me annoying , Great lication for O2 only a 2mile walk Arrival very welcoming chap on reception was lovely Room seevice excellent quick delivery and lively food Breakfast was excellent great service really welcoming very cheerful staff 
357629,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Lovely friendly staff Excellent location with parking The the only downside was that the beds were quite hard so it wasn t the most comfortable of nights 
357630,De Vere Devonport House, They had a wedding on whilst we were there and were clearly understaffed so facilities and staff were affected Our experience was also impacted by the wedding party noise directly under our room On a positive note though the hotel have been very quick to respond to my feedback and offer compensation , Really convenient base within Greenwich only a few minutes walk from DLR underground or city cruise transport into central London Parking on site was easy to access and good value Beautiful courtyard and gardens

357636,De Vere Devonport House, Booked a twin room in error asked to upgrade the young man was not very helpful My brother arrived the evening before me and was upgraded to a double without ant fuss or cost I feel that the male member of staff was out if his depth Reported to only been there two weeks and it was quote apparent, Breakfast very good
357637,De Vere Devonport House, Upgraded from a budget hotel as wife s birthday No restaurant booked out for a function Bar too busy advised long wait for food Booked only a couple of days earlier and not advised that restaurant would not be available Felt like a second class guest , Location excellent
357638,De Vere Devonport House, The Reception staff whilst not unhelpful seemed a little distant and disengaged An itemised Receipt couldn t be printed off as the printer wasn t working No effort to say they would post or email it to me Only a very small gripe but would expect better from this standard of hotel , The staff in the Restaurant serving Afternoon Tea were excellent Glad we could open the bedroom windows as it was a little warm even in November Excellent location Parking charge very reasonable for location 
357639,De Vere Devonport House, The matress was very hard The toilet hadn t been flushed when we checked into our room and then didn t flush properly for ourselves The rooms need an update bed side cabinets veneer had peeled away , Location Free coffee and biscuits Nice bar area

357641,De Vere Devonport House, Room was ok bathroom not so good and in need of refurbishment cracked floor tiles grubby tile grout some mould build up, Great Location for Greenwich and events at the O2 arena 
357642,De Vere Devonport House, I have stayed about 7 times and it is always clean and comfortable However they often forget to replace used toiletries biscuits in the room a minor point but it happens a lot and I would prefer not to have to phone down for them , Great location for Greenwich culture and boat to city
357643,De Vere Devonport House, Value for money it was overpriced The hotel is often used for training event and unfortunately it shows The room was on the fourth floor which could be accessed via four flights of stairs or a lift which was not reliable on and on one occasion was held open on the ground floor Bizarrely this was precisely at the check out time on a Sunday morning , Location location location beautiful The view onto Greenwich park was special 
357644,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, For the price it s amazing So central to Greenwich It s a little tired around the edges but totally forgiven because I wasn t paying an arm and leg 
357645,De Vere Devonport House, I got a room with the view to the restaurants they had a wedding so it was very noisy during the evening I would expect at least to be prevented about that by the receptionist They need to improve cleanliness we found hair in bathroom , The location is excellent near Greenwich park close to O2 The breakfast was very good 
357646,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Great location on site parking 5 for 24hrs clean room friendly staff Rooms are basic but hotel is perfect for events around Greenwich eg O2

357650,De Vere Devonport House, The breakfast on Saturday was excellent and a good variety of food On Sunday the breakfast was very disappointing told to find your own table had to ask for tea and bowls for cereal and there was a poor selection of hot food , We liked the location next to the park The lounge area was lovely and relaxing Our bedroom was comfortable 
357651,De Vere Devonport House, The hotel was good but the rooms are in a little need of an update , The hotel was in the centre of Greenwich and perfect location for the O2 Water boat just at the end of the road near Cutty Sark 
357652,De Vere Devonport House, The receptionist who booked me in was very new and would benefit from more training Pleasant but not very efficient , Good position for central Greenwich and easy parking
357653,De Vere Devonport House, No bad experiences but the restaurant which served excellent breakfasts had quite long queues to get in at certain times , Part of the old Royal Navy hospital a beautiful building in an excellent location for visiting Greenwich observatory Cutty Sark and the O2 arena Very helpful staff a comfortable room 
357654,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Ideally located close to Cutty Sark tube station and river bus jetty Very close to Greenwich attractions including Royal Observatory and Maritime Museum 
357655,De Vere Devonport House, When we arrived there were 2 mugs with used tea bags in unwashed from the previous occupants and the tea coffee had not been restocked on leaving for our evening dinner we told the reception staff However when we returned at midnight they were still there so we had no drink the following morning when we woke up,No Positive
357656,De Vere Devonport House, I booked this hotel because it was supposed to be 15 walk from 02 arena it s 40 mins so was not impressed but it s well situated for other things, Had parking and a reasonable price
357657,De Vere Devonport House, Far too noisy Trying to sleep in our room with a wedding party going on below us Staff not very interested when I complained twice on first night of our stay about the noise ,No Positive
357658,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Perfect location for the O2 20 minutes on the bus Greenwhich is also a nice area to stay 119 including breakfast and parking only 5 for 24 hours makes it excellent value for money

357661,De Vere Devonport House, Was looking forward to the full English breakfast in the morning but while the fry itself was nicely cooked it was cold Very disappointing as i was down first thing and expected a warm breakfast The lack of information both in the lobby room was a annoying as i had to phone down to reception a few times The thump thump of music from the bar meant i didn t sleep well , The room was excellent and the addition of an Ironing board iron very useful A very friendly helpful staff

357668,De Vere Devonport House, The rooms are looking a little tired and jaded could do with a refit in the bathrooms in particular , Amazing old building in the centre of Greenwich Gardens and courtyards around mean that external noise is minimal The rooms are large and comfortable the staff very helpful and the breakfast has a wide choice With London Bridge station only 8 minutes on the train and the DLR stop close to the hotel this is a great value alternative to staying in central London 
357669,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Great hotel if you want a value for money Greenwich was a park like area with lots of restaurants Really liked taking the ferry on the Thames into London 8 pounds each way but quite lovely Also a bus tube option is available Best to take the outer beltway tort there as we encountered the congestion tax Enjoyed Cutty Sark museum too 
357670,De Vere Devonport House, room is ok but interior is very basic a little reminiscent of student accommodation Corridors and general fringes of room staring to look a little worn tired Ridiculously early check out and breakfast only til 9 30 , location is great bed was very comfy good pressure in the shower

357674,De Vere Devonport House, I left a comment that the scent in the lobby is overpowering Hopefully management will find something less potent Very small item in the grand scheme of things , Our second stay Much quieter than staying in the City and yet easy to go into London either by DLR or Thames Clipper Helpful staff comfortable clean room good hearty breakfast and the parking is a bonus And so close for a walk up onto Greenwich hill 
357675,De Vere Devonport House, Rooms were too hot in the evening Room was of an average standard bearing in mind that you are trading on the De Vere trademark I didnt find the staff unpleasant but they were not excellent Interior could do with an update Signage to car park not clear as nearly missed it , I loved the location very central to Greenwich Found car parking facility reasonably priced with our stay Perhaps you could include this in the booking fee 
357676,De Vere Devonport House, There wasn t anything I would say I disliked about this hotel , Great value for money Rooms clean quiet and warm Bed was really comfy Car parking was just 5 00 for 24 hours which meant we could leave our car after we had checked out and take in a few more sights of Greenwich
357677,De Vere Devonport House, Thought the rooms a little tired Had to get a kettle replaced Someone had clearly been smoking in one of our two rooms which was disappointing The smoky room was overly hot , Location superb Access to historic Greenwich sites all in easy walking distance 
357678,De Vere Devonport House, Went to the Officers Mess at about 9 30pm for a liqueur before retiring but there was no Baileys or Drambuie available and quite frankly the staff did not know what liqueurs they had so we retired without any , The location was excellent for our visit to the Old Royal Naval College Chapel 
357679,De Vere Devonport House, We felt that the reception staff were poor Having asked for a room on the upper floors we were offered one on the first floor When we said that we had wanted a room on a higher floor we were reluctantly given one on the floor above Obviously there was a room but our preference had not been considered We both like a firm mattress but the bed was way too hard , Really liked the location and convenience for transport connections 
357680,De Vere Devonport House, Had to pay 50 for any extras up front didn t bother with breeakfast nor hotel bar with plenty to chose within 100m Rooms a little tired with chipped paint work and stained carpets very hot in rooms even with windows open , Location Location Location great for all the sights in Greenwich

357682,De Vere Devonport House, Room had a funny smell and was too hot when we arrived Window did not seem to open very far to help us cool it down and get rid of smell, Quiet location with car parking is excellent Breakfast very good and tea coffee facilities in lounge good Lovely to have Greenwich village and park and the museums on the doorstep 
357683,De Vere Devonport House, Breakfast could have been better, Excellent location parking was a bonus Hotel left a bottle of champagne cake chocolates as it was my birthday very pleasant to find upon arrival
357684,De Vere Devonport House, The hotel is in need of a makeover The walls of the corridors were scuffed with suitcase marks and the ironing board cover was torn in the room making it all look a bit tired The service was average At 9 30pm on Bank Holiday Monday guests were told there was no hot food and were given crisps and takeaway menu The bar meal my husband had was awful and was refunded Cold plates at breakfast and dusty light shades in the restaurant Not very 4 star at the moment , The location couldn t be better Car parking is great 
357685,De Vere Devonport House, Not a bad experience the room was just a little run down and could have been a bit smarter, Location excellent and staff very friendly Room was small but comfortable and very good value for money 
357686,De Vere Devonport House,No Negative, Booked through booking agent for 3 nights room only with a 48 offer The hotel was ideally situated for a visit to London The room was clean and nicely decorated The beds were comfortable Would visit again and recommend 
357687,De Vere Devonport House, Rooms were quite warm However having a fan in the room helped to negate this poblem , Staff were polite friendly and always happy to help The rooms were really clean and had everything you need in them 
357688,De Vere Devonport House, The room 102 was small and hot would have liked air con the fan provided was noisy bathroom was grubby not dirty but could have been improved , Location of hotel for visiting Greenwich and its attractions free coffee in lounge availability of car parking for a very reasonable rate 
357689,De Vere Devonport House, We didn t have a bad experience but the grouting needs lo be sorted as it spoils an otherwise perfect stay, A warm greeting and helpful receptionist The room was large well laid out and clean The bathroom was a little dated and the grouting around The bath black We cannot comment on the breakfast or the food as we didn t eat there
357690,De Vere Devonport House, The hotel is very big and a little impersonal Unfortunately one of the beds in our room still had bedding on it from the previous occupant We didn t find this out until we were ready to retire so had to get dressed to wait for housekeeping The girl who came was very apologetic but could not explain how this could happen The other bed was fine No comment was made when we checked out next morning Obviously no communication between departments and no further apology Not good customer service , Good location within walking distance of the many attractions of Greenwich Reception staff were pleasant and helpful and there was tea and coffee in the room which is one of my pet likes although supplies were a bit sparse 
357691,De Vere Devonport House, Although the bed was good the pillows were not They were quite uncomfortable and there was only one for each person , loved the location easy access to O2 arena The hotel is very close all shops etc and it sits in a lovely location 
357692,De Vere Devonport House, Not enough staff in the bar in the evening I waited 20 mins and didnt get served so gave up, The location was very good for Greenwich Food was good 
357693,De Vere Devonport House, The breakfast was awful It was a buffet breakfast but was not topped up regularly which meant items such as beans did not arrive for 10 minutes The quality was poor and selection limited , Location was great 
357694,De Vere Devonport House, It was unbearably hot in the room and the window didn t open hardly at all We were woken at 0530 by the laundry delivery and were above the wedding reception , Location was perfect and parking was ideal When I realised that we were directly above the room where a wedding reception was being held I asked if there was an opportunity to move rooms This wasn t a problem We packed our belongings and they were moved to our new room Lots within walking distance 
357695,De Vere Devonport House, Welcoming this time was extremely poor with receptionist close to being completely impolite and not willing to just do her job I had a better experience on our first stay in this hotel two years ago , We always appreciate the fantastic location of the hotel Sufficient parking space right in front of the hotel is another plus Breakfast expensive but good 
357696,De Vere Devonport House, The window in our room is designed not to open very far we were there in hot weather and could not get enough fresh air into the room Breakfast no gluten free sausages Simple solution provide ONLY gluten free sausages they taste just as good as normal sausages , Car park

357700,De Vere Devonport House, Well I choose this venue as it was a 70th Birthday Present for my friend as her son had bought tickets to see Neal Diamond And to be honest seeing the venue on line and the comments thought this would be perfect for her Was not impressed when arriving there was an issue regards payment on booking Then when we entered the room very disappointed Two holes in one of lamps bathroom had mildew on the tiles and surroundings on the floor the bin in the bathroom had no liner and was dirty inside the window facing one of the beds would not shut so all we heard was a generator all night as this was broke on the advice of a Duty Manager coming to look but as it was Sunday no maintenance to fix The air vent in bathroom was broken the valance on my bed was stained at the bottom I have taken photo s regards the issues with the room Then when leaving was told had to pay for disability parking which was not explained on arrival The receptionist asked for our car registration but we thought this was just checking what cars go with guests We were not told this was for payment Cannot blame receptionist as apparently she was new and still training but no one with her to supervise Kind Regards Patricia Finan,No Positive
