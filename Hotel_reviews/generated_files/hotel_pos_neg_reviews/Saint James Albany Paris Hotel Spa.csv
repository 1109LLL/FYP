102541,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Wifi didn t work in room We had to spend time in the lounge if we wanted to get Wifi Facilities seem to be in need of updating Airconditioning was not working and in July Thought that also came up in someone else s prior review One of the buttons to flush the toilet was not working The safe was not functioning For the price of the rooms I would have expected better not broken , Excellent location across beautiful parks and close to metro and different types of restaurants The room was a good size with a big comfortable bed The bathrooms were updated 
102542,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Our room was large and more like a one bedroom which was great But we were surprised that it was not renovated little run down looking and the shower leaked into the bedroom We called and they were supposed to fix it but never did It was clean but needed a face lift The hotel lobby was beautiful so we were surprised by the room Also there is no air conditioning anywhere in the hotel That was shocking and a big problem , Location lobby restaurant and staff were great 
102543,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Could not enter the restaurant to sit and have a bottle of wine outside bit of a pain Outside bar closed at 10pm , The room was perfect for the family Breakfast was ok but confusion over when it finished 
102544,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Incredibly comfortable beds Very large rooms my husband and I were on the top floor with our own bathroom and large walk in closet and the boys had their own downstairs Kids were 8 and 9 and had a blast they were super impressed with the room On the write up air conditioning was not mentioned and therefore I just figured the hotel was not equipped with it an incredibly nice surprise when she walked into the room and a big waft of cold air hit us the air conditioning was perfect The accommodations couldn t have been better We are at the restaurant for one dinner and we re quite disappointed with the quality for the cost poor value The pool is dark and tranquil heavy chlorine Seems only kids use it but because it is within the spa section the employees kept asking for everyone to be quite veryhallenging with 10 kids under 10 in an echoing environment We all had fun The location was super 5 min walk to the Louvre and right across the street from the park Definitely great with kids Subway across the street 
102545,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Restaurant for dinner very expensive And poor Two shared steak extricate wanted medium well got raw I and my wife had a burger a half which was actually steak tartare between wet bloody bread Worst meal anywhere in years , Staff and location
102546,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No bar service in the terrace garden dirty old gym beds are hard no airco nice building put poorly managed Could have been turned into something wonderfull , Location that is the only positive
102547,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The bathrooms were very nice but one day ours wasn t really cleaned , The staff was amazing and offered help and assistance Great location for Paris tourists Family friendly large rooms 
102548,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The toilet and the basin is small , The location is great close to the public transportation the Luve museum Champs Elysees and in front of a nice garden The staff delt with our request and gave us quiet room window to the inner hotel garden Also the breakfast is great The staff are friendly The room is large comparing to a lot of other hotels in Paris 
102549,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The pictures on the website are lovely but our room had a horrible view of a plain small interior area There was no art in the room The air conditioning throughout the hotel was broken They did put in a portable air conditioning unit that helped keep things cool but it was very noisy We asked for a new room with a view but were told those were mostly private apartments We paid 200 euro for a room about as interesting as a shoebox The location is great but we won t stay there again For the cost the room was very disappointing We ate there for dinner seated inside because the lovely courtyard in the pictures was closed The steamroom and pool both closed at 10 30 so we were unable to use them but they looked lovely , They provide L Occitane bath products The bed was comfortable The location is great It s right across from the Ferris wheel at the Tuileries Garden The staff was pleasant 
102550,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We were in a 2 bedroom apartment The size was good but the furniture was old and pices like lamps functioned but were broken, Location was fantastic Down the street from The Louvre Staff was very friendly and helpful All spoke some English
102551,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We arrived early in the morning after a long flight with a 3 years old We were told the room needed 1h30 after 12 to be cleaned when we came back it was not done the guy at reception just did not care Generally a bit old Air conditioning was broken and we had a portable air cond but we needed to open the window to the restaurant area noise till midnight , Location and the layout of the duplex room The concierge service
102552,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No wifi in room No USB points , Good central location the room we stayed in was clean and confortable but not 4 There are suites at up to 800 per night that would be definitely 4 But the general rooms are basic clean and confortable 
102553,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great location for all the attractions of Paris Excellent location for guests arriving from CDG Airport Metro is just across the road from the Hotel Room was comfortable clean and quiet 
102554,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, It is very stupid policy to give only 2 bottle of water during stay even we have 5 night Give 2 bottle per stay not replenish every day like the normal other hotel 
102555,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Our room was run down Rug was stained and room was generally in need of an update The waiter at the restaurant for dinner was surly and told us that an open table wasn t available I think because it was in his section and he didn t want more people in his section His colleague interceded and told us not to listen to him and pointed us to an alternate table , The location was great right across from the Louvre The front desk staff concierge and bellman were helpful and friendly 
102556,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Very tired hotel smelly damp dark and very depressing Definitely not deserving of 4 star No complimentary water to drink in room which you would expect And they have no idea how to read booking com confirmations They tried to charge extra 76 euros for breakfast we had already paid in advance, location but should be impressed by hotel also shame that the owners can t be bothered to look after this old building
102557,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The weather was cool during our visit if it had been hotter the temporary lack of air conditioning could have been a problem , The room had a separate toilet shower and bath which was lovely The staff were very helpful and were well informed about local attractions and events 
102558,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We arrive the reception staff are horrible our rooms at 1 30pm are not ready they give us rooms without air conditioning that are in dire condition There is no valet no car parking not even a luggage man in front of the hotel to Take our luggage in It was a nightmare This hotel has gone down from a 4 star hotel to a 2 star hotel Staff are unfriendly with bad attitude property and rooms are shabby and disgusting 2 days passed without room being made up , Nothing I have used this property over ten times for the past 15 years and it has regressed very badly 
102559,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, If you travel from the USA the rooms are not ready early and no space to rely If a room is ready by 10 they would charge you an extra day That s want the front desk told me While waiting in the lobby sometimes you had water sometimes not If no water don t ask they refused my wife for a glass of water , The location only but it was so noisy in the street that I would not recommend the hotel if you get a street room
102560,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I was very desappointed No airconditioning dirty carpet holes in the walls I had no mini bar but a washing machine in my room They 220 Euro breakfast not included which is by far too expensive for this , The location is good 
102561,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Do not go there if you are not Parisian The room for 500 Euros for a night does not cost it if the hotel discriminates you in any way Service was horrible even the restaurant at the hotel refused to receive an order for a dinner Plus even cleaning personal was rushing us to leave the room to clean it I am shocked with this service I do not recommend this hotel It was the most expensive and the worst hotel I have ever been , The location is good It was the reason for booking the room 
102562,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, hotel is un secure everybody can walk all parts of hotel and we had stuff stolen from our room Also part of staff has no language skills and is arrogant if you do not speak French fluently, concierge service efficient
102563,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, As a four star hotel with a pretty pricey stay we never even thought to question whether or not there would be air conditioning Upon arrival on a hot summer night after waiting for a taxi at gare for an hour the last thing we expected was to walk into a 90 degree room We were unable to sleep and could not book elsewhere at sort notice Staff was helpful and we ended up being comped the room but it wasn t that fun of an experience The hotel overall is beautiful the hallways and walls definitely need some paint attention and upgrades to bathroom but building has a lot of Parisian historic charm , The location was amazing right across the street from the Louvre and Tulieres Jardin 
102564,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, NO HVAC Too Noisy Old Small Cramped Falling apart Worst hotel in a long time , This is a two star very low quality hotel run down poor maintenance pretending to be a four star hotel Does 4 star really accept no air conditioning Does 4 star allow noisy parties in public areas with shouting music and drunks singing until 3 am A total dump to avoid Will ruin your stay in Paris
102565,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No air conditioning in the hotel so the room was very uncomfortable to sleep in This was a surprise for a 4 star hotel, Free wifi Lovely terrace restaurant which was reasonably priced Polite and friendly staff
102566,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, service was poor and arrogant sometimes refusing to serve saying that they had already dressed tables for breakfast sometimes even aggressive our EUR 500 room a night was the oldest of the building with a rotten carpet , location
102567,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, AC didn t work Told the staff before going out for the evening Got back to the room and it had not been fixed nor had they moved us etc It was a hot summer night Had to call again before getting moved to a room that was habitable No offer of refund discount was offered for the inconvenience of having to move room at an ungodly hour after the initial alert to the issue being ignored The next two nights were fine as was the new room ,No Positive
102568,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The rooms are way too small coridors too narrow ceiling too low you feel trapped in a little box With the price you pay you imagine much better rooms , The location is really good
102569,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Nothing could have been improved upon , Staying at the Saint James Albany Hotel is like coming home for me I ve stayed there several times in the past The staff is welcoming and friendly the rooms are comfortable and complete and the restaurant is very good for both breakfast and dinner It is an historical landmark a charming older smaller hotel located within walking distance of most everything one would want to see in a visit to Paris There is also a Metro station directly across the street for those who don t want to explore Paris on foot as well as a very helpful staff who will assist in planning that exploration It is a perfect home away from home for the solo or frequent traveler 
102570,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, The room was very spacious and nicely arranged to separate business and leisure Friendly personnel extra nice The whole service The personnel was perfect and the room very comfortable 
102571,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Was lied to Our air conditioning wasn t working and I was told that they had no more rooms and that they could bring me a fan After much persistence which a guest should not have to do they were miraculously able to get me a new room , Very nice and helpful bellman and gentleman that checked us out 
102572,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was worn out Needs a renovation for the price point Bathrooms were dirty and smelled Was disappointed for the price point that we paid, Location was great
102573,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I didn t like that neither booking nor the hotel let me know in advence that the air conditioning of the whole building wasn t working so when I got there with 33 degrees I found out in my room that there was a portable fan Opening the window was out of the question as all the kitchen and smoking smells from below would get in the room I didn t sleep well not even one of the three nights I was there It wasn t possible to ask for a refund and move to a different hotel The SPA does didn t have a good service and the receptionist was totally unkind , Location is good but quite unsafe during nighttime
102574,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Nothing, Great location in the heart of Paris Very near to all the major museums Very professional and friendly staff Excellent advice and assistance available from the concierge Very nice restaurant and bar in the inner courtyards Good sized swimming pool Very comfortable feel to the hotel overall 
102575,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, If you are looking for a typical Parisian atmosphere a small hotel in a narrow alley you will be disappointed better you should stay at the St Louis Island that is really romantic this one is a great hotel on the busy Rue Rivoli But if you are looking for a 4 star comfort hotel with a great location in Paris that is a very good option, Large 4 star hotel near Louvre metro station just in front of the entrance for Paris unusual large rooms excellent breakfast The hotel we booked for a 50 discount on a black Friday so we were personally excited even out of the price
102576,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, AC in the room was provided by an external device not enough sockets in the rooms so we had to take turns charging our phones We had double bed booked but we had twin beds pushed together wasn t really confortable to sleep , Swimming pool was wicked and we also we enjoyed the spa massage 
102577,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The aircon was not working so they gave us a fan but this was ok for a short stay, The service here was fantastic They really looked after us and surprised us with a bottle of wine for our special occasion
102578,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No air conditioning in a quite hot weekend no flexibility to use the SPA after 12h the day of departure despite prepaid no courtesy room breakfast poor quality although varied and just one coffee machine for the whole hotel I was expecting better service in a 4star hotel, Great location comfortable bed nice refurbished rooms courtesy water in the room
102579,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, It was hot in Paris and we had a fan to cool the room It is not as effective as air conditioning The room was small and the fan was awkward to handle ,No Positive
102580,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The breakfasts were fabulous but the one dinner we had was a little disappointing, We were overjoyed with the junior suite Unbelievably spacious with two bathrooms and two separate loos Perfect for families 
102581,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room on small side Wardrobe definately not big enough Air conditioning not available on first night although housekeeping did provide a fan Airconditioning was switched on on second day as temperatures outside went up to 30 , Staff were excellent friendly helpful and professional 
102582,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The second night there was awful construction noise Not the fault of the hotel , The staff was extremely caring and accommodating And the ability to walk to the Lovre and other museums was a bonus Plus it is on the 1 metro line 
102583,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No airconditiong due to time of year understand the logic but our 4th floor room was incredibly hot at night Opening the windows to cool down was an option but that led to lack of sleep due to noise , Fantastic location Ease of access to metro virtually opposite hotel Helpful and attentive staff Spacious room Very nice pool and spa area
102584,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, nothing of importance , The location was excellent the hotel is close to many places you would like to see when you are at Paris The concierge gave us a good hint to spend time in a night time entertainment at the city 
102585,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Economy class flight seat cramped, Perfect outdoor seating at the Joan D Arc golden statue near Louvre and Touillies Gardens Paris City Vision tour office and L Hotel Regina 
102586,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The walk in robes from the lift to the pool through the foyer was a bit weird The corridor outside of our room had a strange odour , Staff were excellent and friendly Room was lovely Location was fantastic Many areas of interest were easily walkable 
102587,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Once we asked for a spoon a bit over midnight and they said they couldn t give it to us It was annoying , The hotel location is amazing you can go by walking to most of the important touristic places The hotel in itself is amazing with an incredible structure 
102588,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I had seen the propertys availability on Booking and since I have had positive experiences in spa hotels I was looking forward to it Unlike most 4 hotels there was no real welcome Eventually a young woman asked me what I wanted I said to make a reservation for two nights Without consulting any kind of file she announced nous sommes complete I looked back at the page I had opened where the hotels availability was still plain to see At that moment I should have left already the hotel had displayed poor customer service Eternal optimist I booked it on line and cheerily announced that I had done so Rather than apologizing or offering me a coffee while they put the situation to rights they turned away from me and fumbled with their computers After a while a shabby room was ready No charm rather bare soulless room I thought never mind I ll go and relax in the spa only to hear that the hammam was out of order again with scarcely an apology so all that was available was a chlorine filled swimming pool I must admit they did carry my case to my room but when I left obviously struggling towards them to make check out and claim back the 50euros they suspiciously demanded from me as guarantee there was no offer to help me with my luggage not when there was no longer the possibility of more money they drop the customer I told a man that i was disappointed and he announced mechanically that he was sincerely sorry and blamed it all on the young woman who had dealt with it rather than offering any kind of compensation or making a personal gesture to show that the customer is valuable to them Maybe they could have offered me breakfast which they were selling for 19euros I had glanced at the breakfast and like everything else it looked shoddy and rather vulgar The only nice thing was the little courtyard And maybe its proximity to the louvre , Leaving
102589,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Our room had a proper shower Our room was very quiet it pointed inwards but this was ok Across the road from a beutiful Jardins and metro we can t complain 
102590,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Very uneven staff some are ok some are really not interested in being nice or helpful big hotel without personality rooms need to be renovated and refreshed , Location 
102591,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel is in a great location steps away from the Tuileries m tro stop Hotel is very clean and easy to find When the rooms came available to check in the staff took forever to bring the stored bags out for us to take to the room They wanted to take the bags themselves though after waiting forever it wasn t worth paying them a tip since they took so long to give us our bags We were also short on time to get to a reservation but they didn t care The management also tried to tell me which elevator to take when ultimately I could have taken either elevator to get to the room Two of the rooms were across the hall from each other but the man insisted that we take different elevators Pointless Checkin was very antiquated with printed papers and folded forms and I feel like extra fees were paid at check out ,No Positive
102592,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Staff did not take the time to tell me where the spa facilities were did not offer to keep my luggage on check out did not tell me where the breakfast room was located They gave all this information to the guest checking in in front of me I thought it was not value for money I have paid 100 less per night and had just as good a room in Paris before I have been travelling to Paris at least once or twice a year for 7 years now , Location was good and bed was comfy
102593,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, My room was next to the reception so not very quiet The cleaning lady insisted at coming in everyday while we were in bed despite us shouting inside for her not to come in The prices for the mini bar are outrageous 6 Euros for a water , The bed and location Only had the hotel been inside the Louvre would the location be any better 
102594,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I d booked a junior suite It basically is a double room with a very high ceiling with a small staircase leading to the ceiling where the bed and en suite is The room though is quite dark and not very modern It seemed like it hadn t been refurbished for 30 yrs , The location is excellent and the staff were very friendly 
102595,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Bathrobes disappeared after one day in the room never returned The room had no adequate storage For a double room there was no comfortable seating for 2 people There was no way to look the room door from the inside, The location of the hotel is brilliant
102596,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The sauna was relaxing but I didnt feel the spa warranted the extra cost I have seen better The staff were friendly enough but seemed a little put out all the time , The room was comfortable and the location was amazing Breakfast buffet had a good selection 
102597,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Rather public sitting areas courtyards hold the smokers in it which encourages one to have to shut the windows Needs a bit of a real livingroom , Lovely staff extremely helpful and forthcoming with ideas Lovely breakfast and restaurant which we also had dinner in as they had a discount Also excellent Got a surprise upgrade which was amazing Wish we d stayed here for the entire trip rather than half of it Pool and hamman very nice extra Didn t seem like a big hotel 
102598,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Second stay in a month it feels like coming home Staff are happy to see you always helpful The location is just the best in Paris central to everywhere you want to go L Occitane bath amenities are fabulous Bed comfortable and my room on the 6th floor has extra space for luggage 
102599,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Family room smaller than expected and was a little underwhelming on arrival however they were comfortable and clean and modern, The staff were excellent concierge recommended and booked a couple of fabulous restaurants modern and traditional which the family loved 
102600,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Reception staff surly Bedroom small bathroom small bath tiny toilet pokey Booked a Queen sized bed but got twins pushed together Air con not working Breakfast expensive Randomly disturbed by housekeeping way before checkout , Location perfection Comfy beds Quiet at night L Occitaine smellies 
102601,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The rooms are a tired looking and really need to be renovated , Great location Opposite the Jardin des Tuileries which was great as I was traveling with my dog Very professional and helpful reception and concierge staff 
102602,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Spa, Rooms and service good Spa disappointing needs a lick of paint and up dating Gym is a very small room with a couple of machines Disappointing Location is perfect room very clean and huge bedrooms 
102603,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The food was very disappointing And so were the food service people The restaurant bar and lounge was pretty much deserted the entire time we were there and there were good reasons for that , good location housekeeping staff did a good job and were very nice 
102604,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The layout of the suite was poor one tiny toilet for 4 people Shower in un ventilated room poor design soaking wet floor Taps wobbly Tea coffee milk cups in the room was very stingy 2 between 4 not replenished daily I would expect better coffee in a hotel of this standard not have to queue for a machine to help yourself , Breakfast buffet was good 
102605,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, We got upgraded to a two bedroom appartment which made our stay even more enjoyable The hotel is great Without a doubt one of the best choices for Paris 
102606,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The two rooms facing the street could be noise at times however we were able to change the two rooms , we had booked four different rooms for greater family Absolutely great location many many restaurants and coffee shops are within two to three blocks Many shops as well Very central to everything The breakfast was nice the rooms are clean some have upgraded bathrooms other rooms don t 
102607,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Although the location of the hotel is great the asking price is on the high side The breakfast was poor for the price When I checked in I was charged for the whole duration of my stay which is ok but I was also asked for an extra deposit which I find it excessive I have not met this before It s either the hotel room rate or the deposit not both during any of my other check ins at various hotels throughout the world and I do travel a lot mainly for business I didn t also like during check out when I was asked whether I have used anything from the room bar that morning after my negative answer the hotel clerk told me to wait for a minute in order to check that with the room service personnel I ve only seen that before at a second rate Chinese hotel and it certainly left a sour taste for goodbye , The staff was very helpful initially I didn t like the small window my room had and I asked for another room with bigger window The staff obliged immediately The room I was offered was not to my taste nor an alternative one I was shown and I asked to have the initial room back The staff throughout this process was very polite and helpful 
102608,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was good but with no view The restaurant food was good but overpriced with no ambiance and is used as a breakfast hall , The location and staff were great
102609,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The check in process was too long and we were only a half hour early but weren t allowed into our room even though to was ready We were given a family room that was two rooms with an adjoining door I had requested a quiet room and shortly after arrival realized that it was not remotely quiet It was on the street side and had such little room insulation that you could hear everything including other people s plumbing However I called the front desk and the manager promptly found a few rooms for us to look at which might be better for our family of four She was very kind and helpful and we were able to move into a bigger and somewhat quieter room without incurring a fee I had also asked about a fan for the room as they were very warm and we were graciously given two fans , The helpful staff with the exception of check in Close to the metro and directly across from Tulleries Pretty older hotel that feels very Parisian 
102610,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was a little bit antique although was very clean I also remarked a problem the room was on the first floor with the window at a small side street If a big lorry was parked right under the window someone coud easily enter the room if the window was open The pool was ok a little bit to darker the atmosphere The water could be also warmer , The location is superb Next to the subway station and the Tuilleries The hotel public spaces are well maintained although is a very old building The staff is very proffesional and friendly in the same time The bed was very comfy The pool represents an excellent facility 
102611,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The welcome staff in particular one woman was very rude to us as she looked down her nose at us as if we weren t worthy of staying there which made us feel uncomfortable As there was a mix up with payment we sorted it in the end however she made us feel as if we didn t belong there However the consierge staff were amazing so friendly and so so helpful along with the breakfast staff and spa staff , I liked the wide range of breakfast selection and also the location was brilliant as it was right outside a metro and was in walking distance of many famous landmarks we wanted to visit 
102612,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The gym is a tiny room with nothing but 2 3 cardio equipment which are poor I was expecting a lot more and the pictures of the gym in the hotel are far from accurate , Very nice staff and the brunch buffet is one of the best I have ever had The hotel is situated at the best place if you want to see the most popular places like the Louvre Arc de Triomphe Mus e d Orsay The rooms are nice and clean
102613,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, I came to Paris for 4 nights to celebrate my birthday really glad I came to this hotel The staff are friendly helpful even got upgraded to a suite The hotel is central so easy to get around Paris even a metro across the round I highly recommend this hotel and am coming back again 
102614,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Drinks in bar expensive Noise from room next door Rooms a little tired for four star hotel, Location excellent Staff very helpfully and friendly Beds very comfy
102615,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, People at reception apart from one person can not understand simple things in English Placement in bad room first and than upgrade with a lot of waste time for tourist Ventilation worked like a broken propeller impossible to sleep old beds very uncomfortable and uneven at some places despite 3 people we always got all for 2 telephone did not work wi if works whet it wants , Location
102616,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, You advertise that the hotel has offered Hamam There is a steam sauna you have so we were disappointed by this that you had Hamam is a Turkish bath can be screwed treatment You gave false aspiration of this But otherwise the hotel was nice experience good food nice staff ,No Positive
102617,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room a little tired pool closed for cleaning during stay English language TV stations limited to news only Bar very expensive 20 G T , Good location clean room friendly helpful staff 
102618,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Bed is two single beds pushed together which come apart during the night Rooms look bare and not very cosy The pool isn t heated and there is no hot tub or jacuzzi in the spa We kept finding long dark hairs we are both blonde on the bathroom floor I think we were dragging them in from the room carpet with our feet but there shouldnt be hair there anyway , Location is amazing and late check out time of noon is great however for us unfortunately those were the only take home positives 
102619,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Breakfast staff they are under serious pressure to clear your table and get you out as fast as possible to prepair for lunch almost to the point of being rude It s a good breakfast so you need time to enjoy, Location is perfect for all the main sights
102620,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Paper cups in a 4star hotel is a little cheap 1 English speaking Chanel on the TV Half of the lights in the room didn t work The door to the room required the strength of Charles Atlas to close it and charging guests 5 to place 2 proper cups in the room was a taste of things to come just to put the cherry on the cake the pool was not available and only disclosed once the payment was taken Bring a chest of money if you wish to use the Spa facilities , The location was spot on Staff pleasant 
102621,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No need to be hospitable Rarely experienced such an unfriendly staff Thumb down E g the porter would stand and wait near the reception not willing to help with the heavy luggage No one to show the room ,No Positive
102622,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was not the one shown at booking when I made the reservation It was disappointed , What I liked the most was then location of the hotel It was closed to main attractions and shops 
102623,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Nothing , Big room by Paris standards though is a 4 star hotel right in heart of Paris but very tranquil and quiet Very helpful and pleasant staff 
102624,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Was told taxi booked at hotel was a fixed price to airport Taxi driver asked for more but as I just had exact amount he waived extra The toiletries were rather small sized for 2 people In order to use the swimming pool we were told we would have to go down in robe For that reason we did not use the facility The lighting in bathroom could have been better devised , Beautiful room immaculate and clean Lovely bathroom Looked newly refurbished Pretty courtyard which would be fantastic in summer Breakfast was good value for money Plenty of options Breakfast in local cafes about same price and not so much choice so would definitely recommend eating at hotel Excellent location and beautiful area Very relaxing and peaceful ambiance throughout hotel Would definitely stay here again 
102625,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Breakfast was on till 10am We went down at 9 30am Did not feel welcome packing up around us No cutlery I was shocked at how unprofessional it was Great location staff in Spa were very helpful but it ends there I m afraid Room v disappointing Needs an update broken bulbs etc,No Positive
102626,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No drawers for clothes only hanging space, Excellent location Staff efficient friendly and helpful Room and bathroom both spacious especially by Paris standards 
102627,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I liked everything but the lady in the restaurant , We liked the guy from Argentina very much He worked in the restaurant He made us feel so welcomed and he treated us like king and queen We went back the next day and a lady was there Friday She was not nice at all We were leaving and probably won t go back there again Probably not recommend it to anyone either 
102628,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Could ve been a little more updated , The concierge was AMAZING and super helpful The hotel was in literally the best location for showing my sister Paris for the first time Literally in the center of EVERYTHING Beautiful hotel 
102629,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Not the standard for 4 stars at all We had to change rooms twice the first night noisy and smelled damp , Staff responsive enough to our issues changed rooms to finally upgrade us to thei suite was well needed
102630,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, On checkout I had to report some issues and the person at reception took me for an idiot broken air conditioning with a label from the hotel stating it was out of order he told me the whole hotel was on winter mode which is why my a c was out of order the bathroom sink was blocked he told me that I didn t know how to operate the tap the shower was leaking badly he didn t believe me On a 230 room he offered the 6 bottle from the mini bar How to make you feel like an idiot and I tend to travel a little Will not go back there, Friendly staff on arrival at check in But on check out it was a different story
102631,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Uncomfortable bed Two small beds pushed together with visible crack between the two not fitted correctly so fall between them Asked to have this fixed or change rooms but could not Unfurnished and thread bare Used vanity set Pool and spa area too busy to enjoy with water everywhere not properly cleaned or maintained Stayed 4 days and told absolutely no chance of a spa treatment as all fully booked hadn t even said what treatment we wanted , Good location Cheaper than most in the area Pool and gym 
102632,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Well nevery did get a hot copy of coffee with breakfast delivered each morning annoying restaurant lunch food and coffee was not hot when served , Concierge was awesome the one on Thursday morning that is patient and very helpful with a rescheduling issue I had housecleaning staff friendly and efficient
102633,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The standard sized room was so tiny it is not comfortable to share with another person almost impossible to move insode the room without touching each other the closet space was size of an A4 paper it cannot be called a closet So we had to ask the staff to change our room but they were really not helpful and very unfriendly and implied us to be demanding Finally we had to pay 30 Euros per night to upgrade our room The new room they gave us was another case where there is no toilet in the bathroom toulet was located on the other side of the room It was the most uncomfortable hotel experience for me As if all these are not enough hotel concierge lost a document delivered to our name to the hotel It is definitely not value for money we were a group of 5 and had 3 rooms in total i was the one to choose the hotel After all this bitter experience i had hard time with my friends ,No Positive
102634,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Check in time is very late makes it impossible to book this hotel for a weekend when you loose half a day waiting , Staff were lovely in the hotel itself The spa staff were not very receptive or welcoming and more like policeman waiting and watching you Children in the pool makes it impossible to use the pool and the pool was one of the main reasons I booked the St James in the first place 
102635,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great location for the money hotel is a little old but totally lovely Buffet brekkie is really really good Staff weren t bad but we didn t get a lot of interaction with them Facilities are good Overall good experience
102636,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel rooms are spread out like a warren so it can be quite a trek from the elevators to one s room Also they are not at the same level , The bar was great Alex runs it beautifully and makes a wonderful Kir Royale Breakfast was good plenty of yummy stuff 
102637,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Sound proofing was on our and the Hotels list of inclusions The 1st night was sleepless as we heard every cough of an ill man in 414 There were two narrow doors seperating 412 and 414 so it was not sound proof Luckily he left after 1st night , Staff extremely friendly and helpful A lovely cleaning lady outside 412 Concierge so helpful and organised V impressed that he remembered my name on 2nd visit to desk 
102638,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The Junior Duplex needs renovating The toilet was in a very tight space with the paper dispenser positioned so you risked a bruise and I am not a large person The shower stall was so small I caught the faucet when I turned to wash my back and upped the hot water to scalding There was a tub fortunately but as it was old it seemed dingy None of the niceties one would expect from this spectacularly positioned hotel , Great location
102639,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We liked how the hotel is presented on Booking com we made a reservation based on that However the reality is that the hotel offers totally different rooms than advertised and in fact the hotel rooms are terribly different and worse than the ones Booking com present The hotel managers chose the nicest rooms and put them on Booking com after making the booking and arriving to the hotel we faced an total shock the hotel room was awful it didn t even remotely looked like the photos The hotel room looked incredibly old it was a total extreme You can take a look at the advertised photos and compare them with the photos of the room there s captured the bathroom we have been given When we complained about this to the hotel staff the were rude to us insulted my girlfriend and couple times lied to us straight to the face along with the hotel manager later when solving the matter The hotel charged us for the stay didn t refund anything The Booking com team said that they apologize They didn t do anything and keep supporting the hotel on their website WE HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BY THIS ADVERTISEMENT STAY AWAY FROM FROM THIS HOTEL , We liked how the hotel is presented on Booking com we made a reservation based on that However it was a lie the reality is that the rooms look terribly worse this advertisement is a scam 
102640,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, This hotel lacked soul It was cold literally and lacking any warmth or atmosphere No welcoming reception or bar We were sent to the bar for a free drink when the computers failed and nobody could check in However noone was working in the bar which looked like it had never been used No one seemed to be looking after the guests anywhere apart from the few receptionists The breakfast was poor value for money Lack of choice no non surgery cereals cold coffee and cold dining room too which seemed to be heated by tiny stand alone heaters Such a disappointing stay We won t return , Excellent location 
102641,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel is outdated desperately needs an update Also the some of the rooms are not as pictured which caused some issues on arrival , The staff were very accommodating and friendly Every request was met in a timely manner 
102642,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was super warm even without the A C Also the plug next to the bed didn t work , The room was massive the bathroom was an absolute dream though it did take a while for the water to get hot Breakfast was strong 
102643,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Every thing The hotel is awful Noisy also quite old Really terrible hotel thanx to Paris changed our mood hotel was awful , Only location 
102644,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Showers didn t work properly poorly fitted and disreapair in the joins Kettle had mould in it which is an easy fix just ask for a new one these things happen , Access to spa and steam room is fantastic the staff are all wonderful and easy to deal with 
102645,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Towels in the pool area would have been nice, The Concierge Andrew was very accommodating picked 2 perfect restaurants for our dinners The location was perfect 20 min walk to Eiffel Tower Notre Dame Left Bank and the Louvre 
102646,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Overall condition is not what you would expect for a 4 stars hotel Facilities are old not well maintained the doors had some cracks and holes The bed headboard leather was rough and ripped off at the bottom The door of the room were very loose and in bad state , Location
102647,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Lovely room with floor to ceiling windows which is saying something given the family room has a loft with a bed full bathroom above and a sitting room w pull out couch downstairs Downstairs also has a toilet sink which was so unusual for a hotel room Faced the courtyard so no traffic noise Very comfortable bed even the sofa bed 
102648,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Hotel looks good on main floor but on upper floors a bit refreshing is needed Hotel is clean just needs a little paint and new draperies , Location cannot be beat Staff very helpful 
102649,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Our room was disappointing with very little light and the bathroom was not very pretty No specific issues the room was clean and everything it just didn t meet the expectations we had for a four star hotel especially in such a beautiful building , The location is good staff is nice the building is beautiful pool relatively big for indoor Parisian standards and so is the steam room 
102650,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The layout of the hotel is a bit strange and the reception isn t very inviting The room we were in had an adjoining door which meant we heard the couple next door a lot Including them having sex The lady at the spa was really rude Someone took my robe and slippers and instead of just getting me a new pair she made me wait for ages soaking wet and there were no towels then reluctantly gave me a pair of flip flops and told me to bring them back otherwise we would be charged for them , Great location beds were so comfy and it was a nice quiet room as requested Room was newly refurbished
102651,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Nothing , Amazing Everything was first class and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable upon check in we were given an upgrade to a duplex room
102652,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The air condition was broken in our room The hotel looks much nicer online than in reality The spa and the gym max 16sqm are too small for a 4 Star Hotel expected more Especially that they didn t offer free toothbrushes pastes like any other 4 Star hotel we could have asked yes but it should have been in the bathroom in the first place Glad we brought our own The best thing was the location everything was close by , The room service Very efficient quick and super delicious Had dinner in bed after arrival ordered a shrimp lime salad which was amazing The radiator in the bathroom a it was always super warm b they actually put the towels over the radiator so every time after having a shower your towel was warm and comfy 
102653,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Very old fashioned needs immediately renovation Too expensive due to the status of the rooms We ordered on line booking room duplex for three Persons and prepaied On arrival this room was not available unless prepaied I do not undertand how this is possible When asking to refund the perepaied money there was suddenly no problem anymore , restaurant not so best quality lesser bistro
102654,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The spa not really a spa cold swimming pool and steam room Hotel a bit over priced for what you get very standard room, Location was great easy access to the attractions Unfortunately the room was up 2 floors and not accessible via stairs and one member of the party does not use a lift The spa was not a spa it was a very cold swimming pool with a steam room there was no jacuzzi like in the picture The breakfast had a good selection of pastries and bread along with cereals fruits and cooked breakfast Drinks were very overpriced with an OJ being 8 The room was spacious very late comfy bed found a hair ball on the floor but otherwise clean Staff seemed friendly and helpful Lots of work going on in and around the hotel on our last day which if I had just arrived it would ve been a little disruptive Understandably it has to be addressed 
102655,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, no drop off parking while emptying the luggage for clients arriving by car nor any service to park the car by hotel staff Swimmingpool white border line could be cleaner as grease stains Rerservation manager not very commercial to our request ,No Positive
102656,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I didn t like the room in the older part of the hotel Old Timer Duplex Room 241 I don t want it anymore It was cold downstairs and very hot upstairs Old Fashioned Bathroom I had the impression to be in an old appartment in the Mountain Not my taste , View on the private Garden Location of the hotel
102657,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, the overall maintenance of the room has plenty room to improve The public areas are in much better condition than the rooms where the finish of furniture is poor and even needs repainting and perhaps a full refurbishment Also the rooms facing the side streets are loud and could benefit from double glazing , Amazing location from the hotel you can get anywhere in the city by foot and there are several underground stations within 5min walk Family room is perfect for a family travelling together that want to make sure they stay in adjacent rooms 
102658,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The spa facilities were very limited consisting of a small pool and a sauna The rooms need a lick of paint Bar prices were ludicrous even by Parisian standards , The location couldn t be bettered Right across the road from the metro 
102659,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, The hotel was lovely and the staff were really friendly and welcoming Our room was upgraded at no cost and was really nice The hotel was situated in a great area with access to all amenities We will definitely be going back 
102660,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The shower space is too small and is even flooded when we got some showers after a long day Bathroom could have been more modern with the price per night , The room is well equipped a simple kitchen space is also included in our room I love the location so much It s just in front of Jardin des Tuileries a 3 mins walk from Musee Louvre and we can easily sea La Tour Eiffel from the way back to Hotel Reception people are also friendly to help us all 
102661,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The concierge gave us bad information regarding our tour of the Effiel tower and dinner Because of this we had to cut out your short to get to the dinner on time ,No Positive
102662,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The aircon had been switched off in the whole hotel for winter however it was a surprisingly warm October so the room was very warm The bar was expensive The bill for two gin and tonics was 44 , Location is excellent within a few minutes walk to the Louvre 
102663,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The rationality of the bathroom was not satisfying We stayed in a junior suite The bathtub was not necessary plus there was no bath curtain with it while the shower room was too narrow that as an Asian with average height and weight it was still too cramped for me , The food of room service was very tasty and the staff were friendly and efficient 
102664,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, When I forgot my pocketbook in the dining room the head waiter remembered me and our room number and had one of the wait staff run it up to our room Fantastic it would have ruined our entire trip had I lost it 
102665,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Maybe could be a little more organised at breakfast table Sometimes no cups available breakfast table had something missing every morning Wasn t offered tea or coffee but other people were do I just used the coffee machine WHEN I could find a cup , Excellent location Very comfortable beds pillows very clean
102666,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, WiFi was slow , I booked the Saint James Albany Hotel because of it s location and price point I was very happy with it s location the tentative staff but that s where the praise ends The Breakfast was good but lacked variety and quality 
102667,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I would rate this a 3 star hotel not a 4 star The service particularly the bar service late at night was really poor and the housekeeping service was inconsistent The biggest issue we had was we could not use the changing room when visiting the SPA and were asked rather rudely to change by the swimming pool in full view of other swimmers This was totally unacceptable , Location is excellent
102668,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, My room was of a small size but as I was there on business I did not spend much time in the room Nevertheless it was very clean and Comfortable, The staff were friendly Nice bar and courtyard
102669,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Quiet room comfortable bed great location metro across the street lunch in Gardens great restaurants near by plus laundry bakery Pauls convenient store just a few blocks away could not be better
102670,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, On arrival we were originally put in a tiny room about 12 14 sqm that stank of smoke had broken fittings in the cupboards scuff marks over the walls and significant stains on the carpet and chair with a small double bed As the room was supposed to be 25sqm with a king bed it was far from what was expected I declined the room and requested to be put somewhere else Was told the property was fully booked and I would have to pay more to get a superior room I then stated I would not stay in the given room under any circumstances I Demanded a refund then suddenly there was a room available The room was a disabled room with a wet room i e Not a proper shower bars all over the place and again nothing like what was advertised They then found another room that was similar to what was advertised The bathroom with this room did not have a proper shower only a hand held When our chauffeur arrived the reception staff did not alert us , Good location and a nice spa 
102671,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The staff was very unfriendly and once I bought something for breakfast and left it in the room and it was not touched but they just threw it away, Location
102672,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We booked a family duplex suite which was very uncomfortable At the first floor we had toilet but without a place to wash your hands Bad was too small a short for a 180cm man The additional bad for the kids was a I noisy sofa bad that adult couldn t use since it crashed inside Hotel was very expensive for what you re getting, Perfect location very welcoming and nice stuff l occiten shampo and soapwere
102673,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Was expecting more in the breakfast but its just enough for the guest i think More menu better Nevertheless its very satisfying meal , I like the staff Very accommodating and polite Very happy to have chosen this hotel
102674,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, The duplex junior suite they gave us no 42 was located on ground floor next to the patio ensuring very quiet nights and that in the center of the city Moreover for the moderate smoker that I am it was very convenient to just open the back door and light a shag on the patio The suite itself was spacious and warmly decorated redolent with the history of an old palace on the other hand the bathroom and the restroom are a bit too reminiscent of old days and could use a little refurbishing Nice 15m indoor swimming pool and hammam They should provide a few more hot showers in the Spa with more of those Occitane en Provence products as in the guest rooms Great continental breakfast with fresh grapefruit juice every morning 
102675,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The shower was clogged and you had to wash quickly if you didn t want to drench the whole bathroom floor with water The toilet could have been a little cleaner , Excellent location with a beautiful indoor court to look out upon for a sneak preview of the sky and the wonderful day waiting ahead A true Parisian treasure 
102676,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, This is our third stay at the St James I used to stay at the Ritz up the road and which of course is more luxurious but the location of the St James is unrivaled 
102677,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The check in and check out was painfully slow I think the hotel needs to send their staff on a hospitality 101 refresher , location of the property was great 
102678,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, 2 x huge connecting rooms Beds comfy Loved being on the top floor among the rooftops Great location Can t beat Rue de Rivoli Hotel was beautiful 
102679,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I thought my room was the oddest shape with a column right next to the bed I had to be very aware of this when going to the bathroom at night The mini bar cabinet has seen better days further it had a mobile safe on top of it that I could carry I miss the objective of keeping my belonging safe here what an eyesore SO I had to move it out of site and put the bed cover over it A poor room for the money The hamman was not hot enough and pointless even sitting inside When looking up at the newer part of the building the paint is flaking all over the wall not a pleasant site to see whilst lapping us the sunshine with guests , Location and the outside space are great Waiting staff are nice Food is good value for money 
102680,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room was located behind reception through a strange passageway behind doors The room overlook on booking com showed a view of the restaurant and garden area however our view was of walls and a cement area with dead plants and vines There was no air conditioning in the room at all and no mention was made of this from the booking or the reception on check in , Great location Great sized room with Kitchen and Washing machine Lovely high ceilings
102681,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room we stayed in was very old fashion and a little too small, The hotel lobby is beautiful the room was OK and clean the staff was friendly and the location was very good
102682,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, When it comes to the corridors and rooms it looks like the hotel needs in depth renovation Carpets smell Lifts are sketchy Room was somewhat equivalent from what you would expect in a budget hotel , Entrance courtyard and breakfast areas are beautifully renovated in typical Parisian style Location was perfect for a short stay Being able to enjoy a swimming pool in the middle of Paris is luxury 
102683,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The shower would not keep a constant temperature and by turns was either very hot or very cold most unsatisfactory The shower door would not close properly either and as a result the bathroom floor kept flooding The air conditioning was not working The television reception was poor and the music system was not working I reported this but it was not fixed and no explanation was given I did not like being charged 6 every time I took a small bottle of Evian from the mini bar The double bed was in fact two singles pushed together and there was a crack in the middle which was uncomfortable the resulting bed also sloped from the sides towards the middle On reflection I think I should have asked for a substantial reduction on what was a very steep price I expected none of these demerits , The pool and steam room the public spaces the separate WC from the bathroom the efficiency of the staff The bathroom was beautifully tiled Good in house restaurant 
102684,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Location is great for sightseeing shops and the metro So close to the Louvre I was very grateful excited to be upgraded to a lovely spacious superior room overlooking the courtyard Many thanks Staff lovely Concierge very helpful with directions and convenient for buying tickets to sightseeing spots 
102685,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, i booked a room with 25 square meters for 3 days when i got to the hotel at night they told me i was upgraded to suite for free however i didn t go paris for work no one would visit us i don t need the living room in the suite the bedroom is extremly samll and very uncomfortable but it was too late at that time what i need was to sleep asap next day when i came back to hotel from a tired trip in the city I asked them to change my room they told me it s too late and suggested me to change for the last day and the last day they did change for me but it was just room with 20 squaremeters and surprisely they overcharged me when I checkout I would like fight against them but the flight wouldn t wait this is the worst experience of my trip in Paris becareful about this hotel , nothing except the location
102686,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, It was good that there was a gym and we used it even though small but aircon in that area poor and quite hot, Room was well laid out with separate toilet Lovely Lochitane soaps and shampoos Staff were great in particular Andreij who spoke excellent English had a great local knowledge about restaurants etc and a good sense of humour Location was great and able to walk to most attractions
102687,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff is so friendly and helpful Particularly Stan who remembers my husband and I every time we come even after 6 years break Great location across from the Louvre 
102688,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room could have used a comfortable chair for seating , Staf was very professional and courteous Housekeeping was very thorough Location was superb Facility is magnificent and well maintained Dining services were excellent 
102689,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Impossible for me to think of anything I disliked it was such a pleasure from start to finish thanks for the memories , I could not have chosen a better location absolutley everything was 1st class from the location to the staff to the spa to the food I most certainly will be back and would urge anyone pondering over wether this is the right hotel for them to just do it you will not be disappointed A special mention goes to the staff they were so polite and helpful with all our questions and queries and I could tell they took genuine pride in and enjoyed their roles in this gem of a hotel nestled right in the beautiful heart of Paris 
102690,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was in need of refurbishment and in our mind it did not warrant the money we paid and the fact it was a superior room The shower ran hot and cold all the time not very nice , The bed was fantastic Best hotel bed I ve slept in Location was absolutely perfect Breakfast was wonderful with a really good selection 
102691,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, I love that the Albany St James the hotel is nestled like a perfect secret amongst the busiest and most central locations in Paris Almost facing the Louvre and the most wonderfully decadent high end boutiques The beauty of the Albany St James for me is that after an exhausting day of shopping or visiting galleries you simply step foot into the hotel and immediately your in a luxury haven of tranquillity The principal reason I booked the hotel was it s historical connections Marie Antoinette who visited the oldest part of the Hotel when it was a private home The Hotel staff are charming and extremely helpful particularly a very friendly bar tender Lighthouse who gave us some useful local information 
102692,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, This hotel is really benefitting from a great location and has many rooms on inside courtyards Great is also the possibility for breakfast on the terrace outside the good check in and check out service The spa is a good extra facility 
102693,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel decor has seen better days very much in need of redecoration and some much needed paint this doesn t seem to filter thro re Tha costs as drinks and snacks were very expensive 3x vodka and coke and 3 dark rum and coke 114 euros , The location is very central for all the tourist attractions
102694,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, senior bar staff were too rigid in where guests should avail themselves of service OK for some to sit in areas but not for others Took shine off a great experience ,No Positive
102695,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The evening restaurant staff was the worst I have ever experienced in Europe The evening of Sept 1 2016 the first night of our arrival we ate at the hotel restaurant The food was decent we had 3 fish dishes but the waitresses were lazy forgetful and did not bring us bread despite repeated reminders until we were served the main course They forgot to bring the butter and despite repeated reminders they finally brought the butter by that time we had already finished our meal and lost all appetite The saddest part was that the restaurant was not even busy it was empty or 3 4 tables remaining 2 waitresses working It was clear that they do not care about their jobs This slaos explain why on a Thursday night the hotel restaurant was close to empty at about 10 p m No wonder France is in a decline I will never stay at this hotel again Lastly the carpeting in our hotel room looks dirty For an alleged 3 4 star hotel it only has paper cups in the room not even glass , location and the helpfulness of the concierge
102696,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Too much service sometimes instead of having 1 room service you would get someone knocking every 30mins for each thing Checkin not to 3pm but they do look after bags Also note its not double pullout sofa but a sofa that gets made into a single bed only , Old french style accomadation that has slightly been modernised Great location for getting around to tourists sites 
102697,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Booked this for our honeymoon we chose this hotel because it has a pool and gym Got there to find out the pool was out of order and the air conditioning didn t work So all in all it failed on all reasons as to why we booked it , Location and room size
102698,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Only problem was that our room and apparently some others had no aircon like that since May which is hard to believe that it couldn t be addressed To their credit the team moved us after night one to a room which did Pool water was milky didn t seem right to me , Loved the location and the room size and layout was wonderful Staff very accommodating with advice 
102699,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room was in need is some renovation things were starting to fall apart in the bathrooms Bathrooms were very small Wifi was most of the time slowfi Pool was closed during our stay , Very friendly and helpfull staff Good restaurant Two nice and most of the time quiet patios for relaxing 
102700,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Our check in was late and we got the wrong room We did eventually get the correct room but 4 hours after check in time They did give us free breakfast however we had to ask several times to be compensated with this otherwise no compensation was offered ,No Positive
102701,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, It s time to maintain parts of the room The reception could not provide plans with suggestions of walks in the city Neither could I get a plan of the bus lines Very narrow shower cabine , The location is excellent A metro station is almost in front of the hotel Taxis waiting on 25 meters from the hotel entrance 
102702,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Pool was closed which was unfortunate and also had a leak in our room Although once we informed the hotel staff of this we were upgraded to a different room Very helpful staff , Amazing location very pleasant staff great grand hotel Courtyard for breakfast is gorgeous 
102703,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, My phone was stolen at the closest metro station The staff were wonderful and helpful but be careful when getting on and off the train , Great location Close to the louvre and walking distance to lots of other great locations including shopping and restaurants 
102704,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room provided at first was a great disappontment The roof was so low that you could touch it if you put your hand up high there was no hanging room for any cloths and no room to put two bags plus no tea facilities So you had no choice but to demand an up grade and pay the extra The desk staff were not the same as what we had on our prior 3 visits Plus on one occassion our room was never made until 5pm that evening Additionally the breakfast cost was expensive if you only wanted a basic snack They charged a tax even though we had pre paid our bill with Booking com that was a joke Overall we could not believe in the change in this hotel in less that 2 years since we had been there unfortunately to the worse and not the better As stated before this was at least our fourth visit in this establishment BUT its very central to all you need to do in Paris I would closely look at it again and ensure the same issues DO NOT ARISE IN OUR NEXT VISIT TO OUR FAVORITE CITY , Close to Paris central Conceriage was very good 
102705,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The seal on the shower screen had gone which left the bathroom a little flooded but otherwise superb room , Excellent location and very friendly and helpful staff Beautiful hotel and delicious breakfast Wonderful Spa facilities and an excellent masseuse 
102706,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The air conditioning was not working making it very uncomfortable to sleep , The location was very central Size of the room was very comfortable The hotel was clean 
102707,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Gym is small and has no ventilation room had little light water temperature was erratic Pricey , Excellent location elegant hotel good breakfast for a fair price compared to what you may may pay in the area nice staff nice dining patio
102708,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Beds were very comfortable excellent location with excellent travel links but everything was within walking distance anyway Would stay here again Nice little caf down on the corner towards the louvre served breakfast for roughly 15 euro which was decent to get the day started 
102709,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The toilet room was far too small separate from the bathroom we could hardly get around the toilet to close the door and we are not big people The toilet seat didn t fit the toilet Round toilet bowl with oval seat , Very friendly staff we were always greeted with a Bonjour or Bonsoir when we entered or left the hotel The swimming pool and steam room were lovely at the end of a tiring sightseeing day Excellent choice of foods for breakfast Fabulous location We would definitely use this hotel again 
102710,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Staff in bar area , Excellent location Wonderful staff other than in cocktail bar They needed a lesson in service Front desk and concierge couldn t be more helpful Room wonderful 
102711,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Breakfast not fantastic Bathroom layout is odd and shower is very small Babysitting expensive, Duplex suite is spacious and nicely laid out for a family of four Steam room was great Good wine in the minibar
102712,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, See above , What was good and what was not Pool steps very thin and treacherous meaning we only used it once Filet steak excellent steak tartar in room service was a mushy burger shaped offering rather than a tasty item Concierge and staff very friendly apart from pool beautician who was a less so insufficient shower gels left daily but bed very very comfortable Shower without a mixer tap hard to get temperature correct Breakfast buffet very good 
102713,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, The room junior duplex was comfortable and clean with working AC much needed during the hot weather Good breakfast selection lovely outdoor eating area Really good location near the Louvre Great service from the concierge with advance tickets purchased for the Pompidou Centre a river cruise 
102714,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, 1 Carpet was very very old and needs to be changed 2 We were in the junior suite and the supplementary bed was like a youth hostel bed 3 The entire hotel seemed old and rickety and in need of updation 4 The paint was chipping off the walls 5 it felt like a 2 star hotel at best 6 Hopefully we don t ever stay here again , Location
102715,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The receptionist seemed to be taking about air conditioning not being available in some rooms but mine was fine It s a bit difficult to find the lifts but the reception staff helped me The location opposite Rivoli gardens can be a bit noisy at night , Room was divided into several different areas giving it the feel of a small suite Breakfast was good value for a Paris hotel and served in the outdoor courtyard which was a nice touch 
102716,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room with twin beds did not resemble the online photo accurately The photo online showed the room having a couple feet at least between the beds and surrounding the beds to separate them The room I was given had twin beds that were abutting the walls and could only be separated by a 2 3 inches A key factor in choosing this hotel was the amount of space shown in the photo between and surrounding the twin beds I ended up paying extra for a room that looked almost as spacious as the one shown online They negotiated with me on the price but this was a disappointment after a long trip We were spending a week there so i paid the extra It would have been nice if the pic that was associated with the room chosen approximated the actual room size and space between the beds At least I could have reserved another room online ahead of time and I would have known what to expect We also had to wait and it took time to look at the other rooms At one point they mentioned that they might not have another room After traveling all night this was not an ideal welcome The staff was really nice and did their best to accommodate me and all other experiences as the hotel were great , The staff was really professional and earnestly worked with me when the room was not up to expectations The location could not have been better and enabled us to go to key points in the city and return to the hotel throughout the day with ease They accommodated my dietary needs and the hotel had an elegant atmosphere and was very clean 
102717,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Menu could have been a bit more varied We had a noisy room which I think was near a lift Room itself was lovely though , Spacious hotel plenty of areas to sit and talk or read Bar open at sensible times We were with our daughter and grandchildren who had a family room which was really nice When we babysat for them we could be on the sofa bed downstairs and the children in bed upstairs It took moments to put it back to a bed 
102718,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Booking com pricing Total was confirmed and completed then when actually charged on my card it came through around 20 Blamed on exchange rate but I also had a separate charge for that Poor , Hotel was well presented staff were friendly 
102719,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The staffs attitude It was 35 degrees during our stay and we checked into our very small room that had no air conditioner The staff treated us like we should have expected this because it s not listed as a hotel feature on the website When checking into a nice hotel we do not expect to walk into a room with 3 fans on a stand generating more heat in the small room Staff the man at the front desk had attitude which made the experience that much worse We checked out after the first night, Location 
102720,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Water in the room our room was on a street so was noisy in the morning with the windows open air conditioning didn t appear to work , Staff so friendly good breakfast
102721,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room was too small for this price There was only one socket in the room No sockets around night closets no socket in the bathroom , Location was great and breakfast was great
102722,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel needs a refurbishment and a fresh layer of paint The rooms were not very clean and the value for money is non existent , The location is great 
102723,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The air conditioning and steam room were broken upon arrival and throughout our five day stay which was unexpected but the staff provided portable air conditioners for each of our rooms that kept the temperature very comfortable Since it was summer we didn t miss the steam room , The staff were very friendly and helpful especially the concierge staff who helped us plan excursions private tours and dinner for our family almost every night of our stay The location was perfect for sightseeing shopping and even taking in the last laps of the Tour de France and the comfortable beds spacious rooms and updated and clean bathrooms made this a perfect hotel for our family of four Recommend highly for the value 
102724,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Air con wasn t working so a portable air con was placed in the room however this meant we had to compromise security as a pipe had to be placed through the doors which then couldn t be closed , Lovely hotel opposite beautiful gardens close proximity to everything The staff were extremely helpful tolerant of our young children 
102725,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Check out was disappointing the person who dealt with us was different to the person who checked us in She offered to store our bags and then left them in the lobby for 30 minutes which was not safe I ended up taking them to the porter for stowing myself , At check in we were very well treated and received an upgrade However the room which was nice did not have functioning air conditioning and it was hot Breakfast was OK and dinner was very nice The concierge was excellent simply superb 
102726,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Air conditioning wasn t up to the unusual heat wave in Paris that week , Location location location could not have been any better across the street from the Tuileries and a metro station with access to all of Paris Friendly and helpful staff Breakfast buffet had everything we wanted Comfortable bed Unusually large room for Paris 
102727,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The aircon was either not working or non existent Fans were supplied but on two extremely hot days the room was stuffy unless the windows were opened which made it too noisy to sleep , Perfect location for walking around Paris and the metro is close Our room was very spacious and the windows opened for some fresh air 
102728,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, more help in getting onto wi fi but really wasn t a must, Bed was comfortable Location within walking of Eiffel Tower Notre Dame Louvre Arc de Troimphe Champs Elysee Plus lovely coffee shops Angelina Plus lovely gardens across from hotel plus swimming pool at basement Honest helpful staff 
102729,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Everything was perfect , We stayed at the Saint James Albany hotel and Spa this year and last year It is a wonderful hotel with a perfect location It is close to everything We stayed both times in one of there suites which are really perfect I would recommend this hotel for everyone The staff were amazing 
102730,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel has no airconditioning and our room on the top floor was like being in an oven The room did not get any breeze as it faced an internal courtyard We were told there were cooler rooms and requested a move however we were instead given a second fan We did see some portable airconditioning units being delivered to other rooms however again our request was declined Our room was also located next to the lift well with inadequate soundproofing so we could hear the lift moving day and night The staff in the restaurant and bar were somewhat disinterested in serving us and sent as back and forward between them both arguing over who was still serving drinks in the evening The fitness centre was nothing more than a few bits of cardio equipment in an unventilated basement room It was just too hot to use in the heat I had high expectations about this hotel and was disappointed I ve stayed in far cheaper hotels with better facilities and airconditioning If you are visiting in summer I would advise you to choose somewhere else , The location is fantastic 15 min to les grands magasins 10 min to Louvre and 15 min to Musee D Orsay There is a large 24 hour supermarket near by on Avenue de l Opera and plenty of cafes near by Our executive room was generous in size compared to usual Parisian hotel rooms The bathroom was also newly renovated with a separate toilet 
102731,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I did not get the room I booked I asked the concierge 3 times to book a taxi that took pets and he did not do it so we had a huge mess in the morning and a lot of stress with the taxi that arrived and did not want to take our dog to the airport The room was very run down , Location was great 
102732,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Despite I have booked a suite in order to have a more comfortable room The room was with really low ceiling I am not tall but I could easily touch the ceiling with full hand I guess the ceiling was 2 meters maximum There were rooms with higher ceiling but I I guess as always the hotels give the worst rooms to people booking from booking com The furnitures were very old The room was like made 20 30 years ago and never renovated My friends who also booked their room through booking com had a room with higher ceilings but this time the air conditioning was not working They had some kind of portable air condoning with some pipe going out of the window Booking com should really do something about that This is the reason I less and less booked through booking com I choose the hotel at booking com but then I am making the reservation directly at the hotel web site Usually the price is more or less the same but even little more expensive I have a proper room , The location is good Very central 
102733,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We were disappointed that the hotel air conditioning was not working While we were there it was sunny and quite warm But it would cool off at night and we left our window open so we got used to it , Absolutely loved the location Close enough to the Louvre to walk and rented bikes and rode to the Eiffel Tower It was a perfect location Lots of cafes within walking distance The room was very comfortable with a large bathroom vanity and walk in shower Nice amenities Had a pretty view of the courtyard from our window The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly 
102734,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Rather catch as cath can Tidy room with small window and no view Run of the mill food Casual service , It is convenient to the louvre where my grandson wanted to do some research
102735,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The fact that the air conditioning had been turned off for the whole summer they say its a technical fault it isnt my uncle is a air conditing engineer and there is no fault that cannot be fixed in days slightly longer if a certain part is needed but rarely and that the hotel had not let people know that and give them the option to cancel They also always show on their website pictures of rooms you will never stay in The actual rooms they give you are horrible When you ask for a change the staff will lie and say the hotel is full This is not true my recommendation check on line if they say this But really my recommendation is dont stay in this hotel unless you like tyrolean style rooms in the attic with no air conditioning , The location 
102736,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Personally I felt it was too impersonal and lacked vibe I d hoped for in the centre of bustling Paris I could have been anywhere in the world , The bed comfy The room spacious for Paris Bathroom amenities good and nice fluffy towels Little TV but not really a deal breaker Good location to walk to louve and many other attractions Lots of touristy shops out front of hotel but great shops one and two streets behind 
102737,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The staff is terrible No value for money They offered us rooms with no AC while we booked superior rooms for more than 260 Eros per night The spa is not good and the pool is very dark I would never go there again , The locations is very good and the rooms are big enough 
102738,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Rooms are dusty and dirty as you can see on the picture the carpet of the junior duplex suite has black patches This is not considered 4 star rating at all for rooms like that If you are going to stay in this hotel booked the Duplex Suite these room would be much more rated as 4 star and worth your money than the other rooms My kids and I fell sick due to the room being extremely dusty They should up kept their rooms if they want to call themselves 4 star hotel Very disappointed , Location is fantastic People in hotel are friendly The concierge is excellent 
102739,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, About the only complaint was that there was not enough sugar and creamer for the coffee , Couldn t beat the location The room was well kept Extra charges were handled quickly with great resolve 
102740,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, the service was slow they dont have air conditioner i was so upset never coming back and really didnt recommend to stay at this hotel didnt deserve 4 stars hotel , nothing
102741,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I did not use any of the spa or restaurant facilities of the hotel The breakfast was expensive considering the many nearby places for a good pastry and coffee The hotel has had a lot of wear which shows in the carpeting and hallways but was clean and convenient , I chose this hotel based on its location which is close to a couple of Metro stations the Louvre and Tuilleries The room size is average for Paris small but comfortable 
102742,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, Excellent location in the heart of the city with easy assess to tourist sites with great restaurants nearby The concierge did a fab job in his recommendations 
102743,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Hotel is super old Bathroom has leakage problem My dister s room had no aircon The carpet is dirty The spa is spa and gym was tiny End up my sister change hotel and found westin hotel and was even cheaper too and closer to shopping location , Good location and room size is big
102744,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The safe was on the floor of the closet so uncomfortable to try to open We were three and the cleaning staff only supplies two bath towels The Breakfast was good but lacked variety and quality And of course my biggest pet peeve is when hotels offer FREE WiFi but it doesn t work or it s non existent I even had their Hotel It Tech come to our room and he wasn t even able to connect us One day I had to use their Business Center Hotels at this price range should at least offer paid in room WiFi or more routers on a floor instead of one by the elevator for 20 rooms , I booked the Saint James Albany Hotel because of it s location and price point I was very happy with it s location the tentative staff but that s where the praise ends The Junior Suite Duplex was nice but it had some downfalls 
102745,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Odd shower configuration WiFi had to sign in each day Safe on the floor , Swimming pool and steam room were great Location perfect Staff and breakfast no problem 
102746,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Some lights on the room wasn t totally working but that s it s little details , The welcome desk people was very kind and nice our little night spend in the hotel was magnificent totally would come back next year 
102747,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Some slight remodeling is due Upgrade bathrooms and carpet in halls But for most part I loved this place and would completely stay here again , The staff and location were excellent 
102748,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No early check in after long overnight flight with kids and no late check out luggage storage available , Concierge very helpful and friendly Location is very central
102749,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No air condition very stuffy Very uncomfortable during my stay Too expensive for the very limited facilities and basic gym , A very nice building licated in the centre next to the Louvre Easy access to metro and walk tinplate de la Concorde st Honore and champs elysees 
102750,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, No air conditioner for Suite Room is very terrible experience and they don t even replace with something to make us comfortable Room have old furniture and small room size ,No Positive
102751,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, It is not luxurious but you cannot beat the value for the money if paying 220 Euros The location is perfect The breakfast is lovely The rooms are old but the beds are comfortable 
102752,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Lots of mistakes made by hotel which they were reluctant to take responsibility for told okay to store our bicycles then when we arrived having cycled from London they said not although eventually after protracted arguments with charmless duty manager they agreed to store bikes overnight forbidden in rooms When check in staff put me and my daughter in wrong rooms on first night and she checked out they suggested I move to the original room for second night their error another argument with charmless manager Building has potential if sun was out but rained ,No Positive
102753,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Air conditioning only worked in one of our two rooms , Beautiful hotel wonderful breakfast polite and helpful staff lovely courtyard quiet rooms well insulated windows perfect location 
102754,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Hammam rather than sauna as advertised supposedly superior room had a view of roof and air con unit breakfast poor for such a nice hotel, Terrific location friendly staff
102755,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The gym is to small with few equipments, The location is great The pool and the steam sauna are fantastic The hotel s employees are very friendly and helpful concierge and front desk The wifi is working great
102756,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Spa could have hot tub with jets instead of just a sauna Beds could have better mattresses Air conditioning or fans, Staff was very helpful Bar was very inviting Courtyard was charming 
102757,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I really missed tea and coffee making facilities in our room We are so disappointed this seems to have become normal in Europe Such a simple thing Any hotel that brings it back will be our choice over others, The location so close to many tourist sites
102758,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, As an environmentally conscious traveller the full replacement of towels each day was unnecessary I thought But a minor quibble No other issues noted during stay by any of us Weather was out with hotel s control , Lovely hotel and staff Was a good base for exploring Paris Duplex room was better than expected Pool was good Tolerated my abysmal attempts at speaking en Francais with a polite demeanour 
102759,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Using booking com I filtered on parking and this hotel came up even though they say they have had no parking for 3 years had to park a block away at an unexpected extra 42 euros per day, Concierges were very friendly and helpful
102760,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, the hotel was easy to find arriving at reception felt like you are special the room had everything we need soft fluffy towels the bed was just right might be noisy when you open window but that is Paree 
102761,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The size of the rooms small as usual in Paris, For knowing PARIS very well and living there several weeks a year i have to say that the location is great
102762,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The only thing that can get better is bathroom which was a little bit leaking , This hotel is one of the loveliest hotels I have ever stayed in The rooms are perfectly lovely and each room has beautiful antiques and furnishings The staff was incredible always ready to help in any way and room service couldn t have been better 
102763,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, There are stairs inside the room it is two story not good for older people after a long flight , We enjoyed the pool so much after our long plane flight The staff were friendly The bed was very comfortable The garden view lovely 
102764,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, N A, The position of the hotel is very good in the central part of the city The room was big enough and clean with wide windows and the bed was comfortable The staff are friendly and helpful 
102765,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room no 160 itself requires a overhaul in terms of heating general maintenance broken tiles panels etc electric connections For the original price I paid discounted the expectation will not be met Very VERY expensive parking and paid 54 euros for 25 hrs , The room an apartment allotted room no 160 was big and comfortable facing the Louvre with excellent view and no building in front looking into the room Very spacious and clean The location is also excellent The breakfast and SPA are good The staff service is exceptional including the concierge in help and directions Especial mention of desk staff Laurent to support us in our special needs of earlier check in and other minor stuff 
102766,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The shower pressure was not good the aircon can not be adjusted to your own liking we were approaching summer however were told that it s still a little cold outside so the aircon will heat only The WiFi was terrible Kept dropping out and then couldn t reconnect Decided against saying anything as looking at other reviews this has been happening for the last 2 years they are not going to go fixing it now , Great location in Paris opposite the Louvre The hotel is clean and has a great little bar Staff were very accomodating and always friendly 
102767,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, This hotel charged a security deposit of more than the full cost of our room to our credit card upon arrival At check out we were asked to pay the actual cost in full and were advised that the security deposit would be refunded This can take several days 4 in our case so beware , Very well trained friendly and attentive staff 
102768,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Our room was hidden away in an area in need of decorating but the reduced rate more than compensated for this , Easy walking distance to some great sites Loved being able to relax with a swim after lots of walking around 
102769,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, unfortunately I booked one night for 1 93 Euro and at check in hotel holed 250 Euro from my VISA At check out my invoice was 201 Euro but the 250Euro while I am writhing this comment after a week of check out the 250Euro still not refunded, hotel location
102770,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The menu at the restaurant could have been a little broader , The staff were exceptionally helpful conscientious and cheerful Just about everyone spoke English and were happy to be of service It was unbelievably quiet for the busy location across from The Louvre Highly recommended
102771,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, rooms very average powdered scrammble eggs very poor machine coffee poor not what to expect in Paris wifi terrible, Hotel was well positioned front desk and concierge staff good nice looking building
102772,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We paid extra for a garden view but we were on the 7 th floor and could only see rooftops Also the room had a funky smell , Location was perfect great service great breakfast
102773,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The breakfast buffet was too small for the number of people and the quality was so so, We had a great room really large overlooking the courtyard The bathroom was smart and very clean
102774,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, the bathroom needs grab bars for the elderly and the disabled to steady themselves at the shower because even the shower floor gets slippery Also it seems un French to have coffee from a machine and not brewed, the bed was sensational I usually take several days to adjust to a new bed but not the St James bed 
102775,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa,No Negative, everyone made you feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble The breakfast was great and the rooms were very comfortable and would definablely stay again The location was superb

102778,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, being on 5th floor made it quite a journey to the spa All was fine except for mornings when waiting times for the lift were very long I would have booked a room nearer the spa had I known about the tricky route from 5th floor to ground with lift changes and floors that couldn t be accessed by stairs etc, nearly everything about the hotel was great
102779,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The deco was a bit outdated in the rooms I expected more from the spa access and for the price we pay I expect table service for breakfast We were interrupted twice in the morning from cleaners before check out hours , Comfortable bed breakfast was good
102780,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The wifi bandwidth could be better , Confortable bed 2 toilets in duplex room nice view on the quiet courtyard good breakfast for the reasonable price The hotel is just in front of the metro station Very friendly personnel

102783,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We particularly wanted to use the spa but it was only open during the day so not possible to use it on return from sightseeing The shower tray did not drain very well , Very good welcome from the staff Clean and very nice room Great location The bar The room service prompt and good quality
102784,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We were in duplex junior suite which was on the ground floor facing the conference room s court so lack off privacy A little bit hot in room despite air conditioner , Great location near Louvre shopping streets Rue St Honore and Pariscityvision departure point for day trips outside Paris Tuileries Metro station was just across the street Carrefour express was in a short walking distance Friendly and helpful staffs 
102785,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Hard mattress but didn t realise the hotel would have changed if we had asked so our fault, Brilliant Location not far from most attractions there is even a beautiful park opposite the hotel great for chilling out after seeing the sights Hotel facilities really good Recommend Spa Treatments Hotel staff very helpful Rooms very nice 
102786,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room had tea coffee but stupidky small milks which were replaced in ones and required even more stupid conversations to get more Stupid check in time after 3 which could mean anytime after 3 Hopeless for travellers, Location nice rooms 
102787,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room 324 was like a shoe box The ceiling was only about 6 5 high Good thing that we don t sleep standing up The temperature would not regulate and we opened and closed the window all night long Good thing it was early April and it was cool out The room and furnishing were over due for an update , Friendly and helpful staff in a great location 
102788,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Room beside lift shaft led us to a very disturbed sleep the night before resting for the marathon The price of food and drink was too high WiFi in our room was intermittent The gym was very basic and there was huge charges and a booking system for use of jacuzzi which was the main reason we booked here for marathon recovery , The staff were very friendly and accommodating The location was perfect The interior of the hotel was very nice and clean 
102789,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The pillows were not soft and there were not extra blankets in the room , The breakfast area was great but with jet lag we missed them sadly We did get a continental breakfast which was excellent 
102790,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Check In slow and they did not advise that although we ordered a twin that it was currently set up as a double Had to go back to reception queue to be told this very simple thing , Excellent Room with lounge
102791,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Stains on the carpet and returned to the room with a random man in our room cleaners tried to come clean a room at 11am before we left and woke us up we were told we had views of the gardens yet are room was looking into another room ,No Positive
102792,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The hotel is very old Room are out of date and facilities are not great for a 4 star hotel The walls are very thin so you hear everything that is going on outside your bedroom , The hotel finally gave us a much better room when we submit our complaints regarding the buzzing noise 
102793,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, since many years am staying in Paris in this Hotel For the first time they gave me a room on the street side t was too much noisy in the night next time will write this before booking the room,No Positive
102794,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We were in room 730 no direct lift to spar from this floor Ensuite did not have a toilet this was in the lounge area Room was dated could do with being freshened up , Location was brilliant both from Eurostar and well located to walk to all the tourist attractions Breakfast was very good staff very attentive 
102795,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Too few English speaking TV channels I wished the pool was 2 degrees warmer The gym was tiny and missed cans for garbage disposal, Tuileries Metrostation just across the street Excellent startpoint for all of Paris and travel to from Disney and airport Pleasant atmosphere and staff 
102796,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, 1 I do really wonder why in FIVE DAYS after my check out on Feb 21 THEY STILL HAVE 400 FROZEN ON MY BANK CARD guarantee deposit The reason behind downgrade on value for money so far I guess five days is more than enough to check and communicate if there are any claims minibar etc 2 NO VIEW AT ALL Both windows of two room family suite looked into really smallish 5x6 meters internal court patio not enough sunlight even during daytime and full lights were not quite bright to my view 3 Both Internet keyboards part of smart TV didn t work properly enter key stuck 4 Very expensive 20 30 per person breakfast even didn t see their in house restaurant for that reason 5 One bathtube missed original outgoing valve plug one that you can open by turning upper overflow lid and replacement was not quite fit leaking and difficult to unplug under water and foam by your water IMHO to replace and get a normal one shouldn t cost more than 1 5 at any plumber s store Hey it s 4 stars eventually , EXCELLENT EXCELLENT location cosy building with ancient history Very friendly and responsive staff 
102797,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Paper cups in room, Location was perfect All staff were so friendly and professional Special mention to the barman for helping with info and excellent service
102798,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, One of the spa staff was a little funny We were not allowed to use the toilets showers and towels in the spa if we hadn t booked treatments , Beautiful hotel Decor lovely
102799,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, If I had to absolutely find something to nitpick about the WiFi could have been better But again this is a petty remark in light of everything else , Staff were friendly and accommodating We had a family room which was a well sized room with a lofted area that had a queen sized bed two night tables and individual light switches on each side a tv closet and bathroom Downstairs had two full twin beds tv small table with 3 chairs a desk closets with a room safe and a second smaller bathroom My husband and o were travelling with our niece and nephew 16 14 respectively and it served our needs quite comfortably Location was great Louvre right down the road a few blocks two very serviceable metros within walking distance plenty of little cafes and shops and Rue St Honore is one block over for those who like to so some serious shopping We ordered room service one night and it was very delicious my nephew used the gym and my husband used the pool and both were apparently very nice as well Overall a fantastic stay 
102800,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Few bits no bulb in shower and you have to get wet to regulate before you get in Shower shampoo a bit miserly for 2 people, Great sized bed breakfast for France very good class
102801,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room seems to be serviced by a variety of people Room cleaned but no coffee cups water replaced Room cleaned but no towels changed Towels change but face cloths forgotten No shampoo and shower gel left For a four star hotel it was strange having to phone reception DAILY to ask for these things , Location was great
102802,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, If you are paying full price it won t live up to your expectations Old carpet broken tiles no windows no bellhop or turndown Not poche , Large room good location quiet nice pool but spa is overstating
102803,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room was quite dark and the hotel restaurant could be made better But if you are in Paris to see the sights then thats not really important , The location of the hotel was perfect we walked to all of the main attractions The hotel staff were very freindly and helpful 
102804,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I never had the time to enjoy their services due to pack itinerary I was exhausted when I arrived back late each night to bathe and for sleep and off again the next morning after the buffet breakfasts , Good central location and good access to metro Very friendly and helpful staff I arrived early the first they stored my bags before check in time and off I went to explore Paris I am usually disturbed by noise disturbing my sleep but had no problems in sleeping at the top floor despite a central location 
102805,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, originally booked the slightly better double was smaller than we wanted would be fine normally but were spoilt in switzerland just before but we asked for an upgrade to a junior suite simply because my fiance likes the windows open with fresh air coming in yes it was only 4 degrees celius and the only window opened onto the emergency stairwell Junior suite was great as it opened onto the courtyard plus they didnt charge us the full upgrade cost which i find is the best thing for a large hotel to do was still 320 euro for 4 nights extra though , Great area been to paris a few times now and Rue de Rivoli is the best for getting around do have to deal with a few more tourist traps and street hawkers but ignore them and you will be fine directly opposite the Tullieries Metro station and has a little courtyard and an great pool and Hammam Great breakfast at a reasonable cost plus everyone was super helpful even had the power needing to be turned off overnight due to a fire systems check and they provided little snap lights atc just in case didnt bother us as at least i knew they valued saftey over the comfort of guests for a night

102820,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The only thing was the room was a little warm even with the heater off but we had doors that opened out instead of windows so that was fine , The hotel itself was beautiful the staff especially Ga l Clement Yuv and Francesco were amazing The hotel even organised macaroons for my mums 60th birthday as a surprise and we also think they organised the staff at the Eiffel Tower to sing happy birthday when we were having dinner there as they made the reservation for us Wifi was good breakfast was lovely too They even have gluten free bread Beds were so comfy and they even had a pool and a day spa there Prime location Loved it 
102821,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Very dark room supposedly an upgrade but it was all dark furniture and not very well designed Bedroom mezzanine area was okay but the whole thing felt claustrophobic , Staff are friendly

102829,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The drainage in the sink had to call maintenance a few times Would have to call room service for unreplaced towels The staff at the reception were very nice and my overall rating is good I would stay in the hotel again , The location size of room the view to the garden 
102830,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I know that when u check in to a hotel that they ask for a credit card for any extra charges I wasn t made aware at check in that when I handed over my credit card they would hold the full amount for my stay I only found out 2 days later when my card wouldn t work and I was abroad with no money They should make this clearer at check in , It was lovely to be able to come back to the hotel after a busy day sightseeing and relax in the hotel s spa

102834,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Maintenance not very responsive Broken mini bar fridge light bulb out both never replaced during our stay despite calling front desk multiple times Limited dinner options at hotel restaurant Lots of noise on street below window difficult to sleep, Location Great Concierge service 
102835,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, there are no daybeds in the spa Only stone hard bench against the wall No comfort there The restaurant breakfast room is very outdated and needs an upgrade rather sooner than later For a location like this and probably a 90 booking all year round they should invest in better comfort and style The chairs in the breakfast room are just terrible The elevators also need an upgrade , The concierge was very helpful Helping us order taxi s and such The courtyard is amazing and the location is of course great 
102836,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, I have never encountered staff who were more rude beds that were less comfortable rooms that were more stuffy or bathrooms more in need of an update This place is a 2 star hotel at best, The location next the louvre and Tulieries metro stop is very convenient Good food at restaurant 
102837,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Woken early by building work Very noisy Not clear whether it was in the hotel or an adjoining building Also plumbing problem in bathroom When settling the bill reported both these matters Was told we should have complained before so that the plumbing problem could have been sorted , Excellent breakfast buffet Excellent location opposite the Tuilerie gardens

102839,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The temperature in our room was high but we overcame this by opening the window We asked for continental breakfast and were directed to the bar we would have preferred to have breakfast in the dining area where the other guests were dining The quality of the food was fine and the location was a minor disappointment because we had the children with us , We loved the location and the size of our family room and enjoyed the spa at the end of a busy day sight seeing in Paris
102840,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Thursday night was great Friday night was too noisy as my room was right opposite a nightclub and there was loud music and people on the street drinking smoking and talking loudly until 2 a m making it impossible to sleep, Location excellent service excellent interiors well done with old world charm relaxing atmosphere good a la carte breakfast and good dinner
102841,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The rooms were quite dated and decor dated around the hotel , Good location for museums The hotel was fine Staff were friendly accommodating and helpful The room was clean Fine for a quick night away sightseeing 
102842,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Horrible rooms old deteriorated dirty and bad room service Worst value for money I ever encountered in a supposedly 4 star Hotel where we were paying almost 500 per night breakfast not included If it was the only Hotel in Paris with available rooms I wood not stay there again , Location good concierge service 
102843,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Rooms were appalling for the price asked even a 2 star would be cleaner Crazy price for a dilapidated room Reception staff knew the problem and did nothing In the end downgraded to get a clean room , Hotel needs a renovation Only thing good is the location The hotel rates are ridiculous for the 2 star rooms which are dirty and need renovating 
102844,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Had to wait 3weeks for safety deposit to clear back to my account problem sorted after contacting hotel , The pool and general look of the hotel Elegant and clean and good sized room in excellent central location 
102845,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The room decoration was tired and the furniture was basic even though we were upgraded to a suite at check in which when we saw it we didn t believe could possibly be an upgrade until we asked to see the rooms we should have had We weren t inspired to try the restaurant not even for breakfast , Fantastic location Comfortable bed in a quiet and very clean room Great spa with a lovely pool Pleasant helpful staff 
102846,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, 2 lights were not working in the first room the first room a junior suite was very very tiny it should be forbidden to charge 600 per night for such a hutch The night curtain did not close in the first room and window overlooked the restaurant No bottle opener in the mini bar Breakfast shabby lacked everything and the staff were completely exceeded, Staff at front desk and reception were very polite and try to accommodate our requests They made their best to change our room for the second night 
102847,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Wifi patchy This hotel oozes character is adequate for the business traveller with sumptuous meeting rooms service plus a small business centre , We like Rivoli location architecture impeccable style of this hotel 
102848,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, Unprofessional staff at the reception desk at the spa The rooms needs a make over but the sleeping Comfort was excellent and that is more important , Perfect location Close to attractions shopping restaurants metro etc And kind and efficient staff Nice historic building

102856,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, We felt like all the photo s didn t depict the hotel very well We saw photo s that were really of another one of their locations in Paris and not the Rivoli location The time of year and the room we stayed in contributed to a very warm stay for us For the price that we paid we hoped for a more modern air conditioning system They had a floor model that needed ice added to it each day in order to acquire some level of cooler tolerance It was still very warm and made for a few restless nights sleep I don t know if it was just our room or similar experiences from other guests but it was not pleasant , We loved the location We were close to a lot of things We loved the restaurant the two nights we decided to eat there It is pricey but for quality convenience and service we would recommend it The bar area was comfortable and we spent a few hours there on two separate occasions And the spa was very nice with a wide variety of services We experienced a facial and massage the pool area and the sauna All very nice and clean I would recommend for them to switch their system in the pool from chlorine to a salt water system though Much better on the skin and hair for a spa pool The service was very nice too I read about stuffy and uppity service but from my experience they were all knowledgeable and professional We didn t have ANY issues with the staff We appreciated their professionalism 
102857,Saint James Albany Paris Hotel Spa, The toilet is separate from the bathroom The toilet flush is difficult to use I had not seen one that you turn a dial to flush the toilet Definitely needs upgrading , We like the pool and free WiFi
