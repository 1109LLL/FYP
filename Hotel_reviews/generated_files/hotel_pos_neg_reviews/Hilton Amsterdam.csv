271263,Hilton Amsterdam, The schooner bar was not open during hours it should have , I ve been staying there offs and on for 50 years Always love the spaciousness friendliness location stay on a quiet canal Rooms are not large but easy to move around with a baby bed 
271264,Hilton Amsterdam, The only thing we didn t like was leaving , The staff members are world class Amazing view in the king junior suite balcony comfortable massive bed and a big thank you for the complimentary honeymoon cake and drinks We shall return 
271265,Hilton Amsterdam, Roberto s restaurant in the evening no option for eating inside sandwiched between other diners no privacy Staff unfriendly Menu poor Took away appetisers bread while my husband was eating these Very expensive And smoking permitted, Breakfast was excellent so much choice and waiting staff friendly and helpful 
271266,Hilton Amsterdam, This isn t a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star We were right next to the lifts Our room was not ready on arrival despite arriving 30 minutes after check in Bar prices were extortionate and to top it all off they had messed up my bill and charged me almost an extra 300 pounds The lady on reception was apologetic and I was reimbursed but I am still very unhappy They blamed Booking com so I will be making a formal complaint , The staff were friendly and the location was lovely The rooms are comfortable enough We were provided with flowers prosecco and a cake for our anniversary which was lovely The rooms are made up daily 
271267,Hilton Amsterdam, Rather expensive for my small dog I thought 30 Euros was far too much on top of the price of the already quite expensive room , Good location and nice for a walk around the random outdoor art pieces nearby Good neighbourhood and good access to city centre by tram number 5 and number 24 Some decent restaurants within walking distance to enjoy a breakfast for less than half of the hotel price Would stay there again for sure 
271268,Hilton Amsterdam, Tram number 16 is currently being reconstructed so there is a long walk to the other trams serving the area The breakfast is far too expensive for people who just want coffee and a croissant and the coffee bar is closed on weekends , This is one of the few hotels in Amsterdam where you can park your car easily although you will have to sell one of your children to pay the bill We first visited this hotel in 1970 the year after John Lennon and Yoko made it famous and back then it was considered a luxury hotel Unfortunately it hasn t changed much and you still have to climb in the tub to shower and the rooms are still the same size We had a canal view room and it does have a wonderful view of Amsterdam but to be honest this is probably the most expensive Hilton we have ever stayed in and really you are paying for the parking lot because nothing else warrants the rate they charge The hotel is in an upmarket neighborhood and there are a lot of restaurants within a few minutes walk If you don t have a car there are probably a lot better options for less money 
271269,Hilton Amsterdam, No pool , Large room Awesome breakfast Waffles smoothie were the best Lovely back terrace canal area Very accommodating staff Staff was wonderful 
271270,Hilton Amsterdam, I have upgraded my booking to executive room to get the benefit of lounge unfortunately the drinks and food is not provided full time only in the meals time you can get drink What I do recommend is to grant a food and drinks as long as the lounge is opened , I like the whole property in general Everything was great and convenient 
271271,Hilton Amsterdam, Euro35 to go to city center Trams is still a fair distance to walk in rain , Too far away from city center Tram tickets ran out at the concierge desk There were hardly any decent restaurants around Robertos on premise was excellent but be prepared for steep price It is well worth it if it is a one off treat Second day went to neighboring hotel restaurant and this was a mistake Breakfast staff were helpful friendly Like the time spread for breakfast Take your pace and no one there to rush you around 7am to 11am on weekends Wow thanks for letting me sleep in Lots to choose from Be prepared for the buffet spread in a large area Walking distance from buffet to the table can be a long walk for our elderly Both mornings I was there cereal bowl run out and had to wait for bowl spoon Taxi voucher Euro35 to airport well worth it Hassle free
271272,Hilton Amsterdam, Old school outdated and very expensive for what it is Need refurb and new concept overall , The staff at front desk and breakfast were very nice and very attentive 
271273,Hilton Amsterdam, n a, Beautiful decor excellent staff clean room comfortable bed fantastic food delicious breakfast experience Walk or tram to rijkmuseum and city centre 
271274,Hilton Amsterdam, Cost of 2 local phone calls was 23 euros , Very nice room and bathroom 5 blocks from a major tram route Walkable to many sightseeing spots Very nice breakfast which was included 
271275,Hilton Amsterdam, The room was very noisy You could actually hear the elevators moving day and night because the noisy from the elevators came through the pipes of the air conditioning right into the room This was extremely annoying especially at night The breakfast 27 EUR was overpriced The furniture in the room looked pretty shabby and out dated Considering the amount I paid it was definitely not worth the money , I liked the view from the room overviewing the city and the location in the south of Amsterdam not far from the city centre 
271276,Hilton Amsterdam, We booked 2 executive plus twin rooms for 2 people in one room and 3 in another The extra bed was put in the smaller room instead of in the bigger room which was very spacious , The breakfast was sumptuous They even had chia seeds and pomegranate 
271277,Hilton Amsterdam, why charge for wifi the signal was bad we also got a invoice under the door for mini bar we didn t use except keeping strawberries in the fridge the city tax wasn t mentioned when we booked we have been to many other plush hotels and haven t paid so much as we did on this one they don t need to charge so much, the hotel was lovely very clean and modern staff were lovely aswell the only downfall was the city tax we had to pay 135euros on a credit card which we have to wait upto 10 days to get back and paid 795 euro each day for wifi and signal very poor come on HILTON the prices you charge you could do free wifi and this city tax weve been all over Europe and not paid this
271278,Hilton Amsterdam, No walk in shower in our 200 night room Only shower over bath with nylon curtain Would need to pay more for upgrade if you can t climb into bath BE AWARE there are currently major roadworks going on to the north of hotel which means convenient travel is more difficult Will last a few weeks be prepared to walk or cycle , King size bed in deluxe room with great view of city Hotel in quiet select area near museums and Voldenpark Follow road to right of hotel for high end shops etc and great Italian Restaurant for pizza pasta at good price Staff in hotel very helpful and efficient 
271279,Hilton Amsterdam, Bad breakfast had to wait in line to get seated some basic things were missing Bad turndown maid service knoking on the door and shouting entering within 3 seconds if you did not answer the door immediately totally unacceptable and nerving behaviour Not in the center taxi to get to the center was between 12 20 Euros one way Booked a corner suite the bathroom was smaller than in standard rooms in other hotels , Nice view over a canal Detached and rather quiet area 
271280,Hilton Amsterdam, Sadly my partner and I experienced an uncomfortable moment on Wed evening 19th April at Robertos We did arrive late for dinner at 10 15pm At the door we stated we wished to sit down to a meal and were invited to a table Sadly we felt we were rushed to make a decision on our meals the waiter was initially quite abrupt and his body language indicated we were a bother to him He did however warm in his manners towards my partner and I after we made an extra effort to be pleasant to him Guilt methinks If the kitchen was closed at the time of our arrival 10 15pm then my partner and I would have been more than understanding if we were advised this and ordered room service At a cost of 185euros the ambience did not meet this cost , Staff were professional in manner helpful with questions and always willing to give a friendly smile Very happy with customerservice standards I am a retired manager and know the value of staff enhancing a business reputation through their presentation 
271281,Hilton Amsterdam, The meniu of the restaurant has only few ways of food not varied The price was to much for very small portions of food Old furniture in room All old in bathroom And they take deposit of 220euro on I make the chekin Nobody tell us when I make the reservation , I like cleaning of the room and breakfast 
271282,Hilton Amsterdam, Was a beautiful area but away from all the shops and restaurants Had to travel a little bit to get to the centre of town , The staff were very helpful with directions in and around Amsterdam there was gentleman from Hong Kong behind reception who was really wonderful and made our stay superb 
271283,Hilton Amsterdam, They lied and said it was only 5 min away from town centre which turned out to be 45 min and cost us a lot For cab every time we went out staff then said we had to stay there or we get charged anyway even know we stated they said It was close to town,No Positive
271284,Hilton Amsterdam, The pillows are too soft have no substance No pool Away from city highlights but being in a quieter area was attractive to me, Clean comfortable Lovely outlook over canal Attractive beer garden Late checkout no problem
271285,Hilton Amsterdam, We wanted to check out late but the late check out fee was extortianate just for a few more hours I would understand if we actually stayed another night but not a fee of 99 tons pend half a day there Apart from that excellent stay , The staff were extremely accommodating and the bed was so comfy very easy to have that much needed lie in We had a lovely weekend 
271286,Hilton Amsterdam, The interior of the room has started getting old and well used The beds were rather hard from the use , The service at the breakfast boufe was the best i have ever experienced The breakfast itself was very good too but the service was extraordinary friendly and professional 
271287,Hilton Amsterdam, Room got very hot during the night Robes were very hard Breakfast service on the Sunday was very slow, Staff were excellent Breakfast was very good on the Saturday Room was very clean And bed was comfortable 
271288,Hilton Amsterdam, 1 Breakfast buffet is way too small for a 5 star hotel 2 Furniture in the rooms is old and slightly damaged 3 Hotel is not in the city center of Amsterdam location is kind of bad ,No Positive
271289,Hilton Amsterdam, Staff a little cold was advised that wi fi would be an extra which I thought was ridiculous for what is a business hotel Got it eventually More for business people as opposed to tourists, very comfortable hotel
271290,Hilton Amsterdam, We arrived and the room that we had booked but the entire hotel was overbooked So for the first night we stayed at a double room and then we got an upgrade for a suite for the following 2 days of our stay but the room was freezing cold The maintenance department came to fix the problem the problem was presumably fixed but it really wasn t Very bad decor and really disappointing facilities I will not visit again , Really great staff at the breakfast room 
271291,Hilton Amsterdam, To have customers paying for th Wi Fi is out dated and feels being insulted , The wonderful half moon bar The tremendous breakfast The dining in the main restaurant
271292,Hilton Amsterdam, Location It was far away from city center Spa area too small, Nice view of the canal Very Clean Excellent service Nice breakfast Value for money
271293,Hilton Amsterdam, Spa health facility closed for maintenance We only found this out on arrival , Service high quality room breakfast attentive and helpful staff Sweet treats on the reception desk were an added bonus 
271294,Hilton Amsterdam, Food location prices , Very kind straff Not that close to center for this price By city train It took us 10 15 minutes To center too Cold to Walk Later on the trip we saw cheaper hotels closer to the centre Food not that good and very Expensive Have to say everything was expensive and that is okay If the standard would live up to It and IT takes 1 h for them to take the deposition but several days to get It back But clean nice hotel and very kind helpfull staff IT would also be fare to the customers IF Hilton hotel could inform you that you pay taxes each night that you stay we got a chock when we saw everything extra that vi had to pay
271295,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, The breakfast was very good Room is clean and comfortable Service is good staff is friendly and helpful Free wifi if connection not always jump off will be much better by saying that I am still very satisfied 
271296,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, All staff very friendly and helpful rooms very comfortable and comfortable bed Would stay again easy to get to from airport using the train and tram 
271297,Hilton Amsterdam, A fried egg at breakfast would have been nice as I found the scrambled egg mushy with not much other option except hard boiled , Room was clean and comfortable
271298,Hilton Amsterdam, Very expensive parking When we booked a 3 adult room we were squeezed to a 2 people room where the extra bed barely fit the booking details were very misleading Had to complain and argue with the staff to finally get upgraded All and all painful experience , Good breakfast 
271299,Hilton Amsterdam, I booked on my husbands name as it was for his business and I arrived before him They didn t want to grant me access to our room Even when I should them my booking confirmation in the booking com app I was not granted a key After I asked for the manager it was arranged At the same time I was standing at the incheck 2 more people next to me had arguments with the staff One person even walked away and said cancel my booking Also there were no umbrellas offered at the door and it was raining People were complaining everywhere in the hotel In the bar they only speak English no problem but still we are in the Netherlands at least one person should speak Dutch They recently took the Boerenkool a typical Dutch dish off the menu The staff didn t even know what we meant All a big dissapointment , Nothing all very disappointing 
271300,Hilton Amsterdam, I wasn t allowed to smoke indoors I did not see any no smoking signs and I was fined on the dot for 250 I also was not provided with a spare bed , I like the bed it was very comfortable 
271301,Hilton Amsterdam, The elevators move very smoothly You don t feel the moment they stop and the doors are opening When you are alone with your partner in the elevator and kissing enthusiastically you are not aware that the doors are opening What can be embarrassing for some people , We had breakfast in the lounge on the highest floor witch offers a beautiful panoramic view of Amsterdam especially when rainbows are present I appreciated very much the breakfast knives Not to light no to heavy perfect indentation I could cut my croissant in half without much pressure and without any crumbling and with conserving the inner en outer structure of the croissant An amazing feeling 
271302,Hilton Amsterdam, The room was outdated and not that clean especially for a five star We felt that the menu for room service was way over priced And usually at five stars water bottles are complimentary but the water was overpriced in the mini bar , The location was great and the staff was extremely friendly 
271303,Hilton Amsterdam, Didnt like the size of the bathroom with having also the shower inside the bath for a 5 star hotel i was expecting a higher standard the television had only bbc1 bbc2 also 20 for 2 glasses of wine not impressed, The staff was really good the rooms were cleaned regularly
271304,Hilton Amsterdam, Location is a real negative 45 euro for a taxi from airport or to city centre is very expensive Perhaps a free shuttle service provided by the hotel would motivate me to consider this hotel in the future I would not recommend this hotel for this reason The prices of food from room service and mini bar is way beyond hotel inflation rates 6 euro for a can of coke is extortion Although the room service food itself was really nice but very over priced We stay in hiltons all over the world and this is by far the most expensive we have ever experienced We also phoned the hotel from the city centre train station to ask for directions to be told to get on tram 5 and get off at gerrit street which was the wrong information resulting in us getting very lost with no mobile phone charge and or without taxi bus near by We landed at 4pm and never got to our hotel until 4 hours later as the actual stop we were meant to get off at was Emma s street on tram 16 This was a train tram bus and finally flagged down a taxi and all the charges we incurred Was a very negative experience for us as it used up a lot of the very limited time we had in Amsterdam , The hotel receptionist Jorge was very welcoming and accommodating upon our arrival 
271305,Hilton Amsterdam, I was pretty disappointed being charged 7 5 euro for a 0 5l bottle of still water from mini bar This is extremely unreasonable and ridiculous given the 300 usd price for the room And there was no price list If I new the price I would drink the water from the tap And be careful once you take anything from the mini bar even if you put back you will be immediately charged for that , Location nice and quiet Lobby bar is very cosy good cocktails and professional helpful waiters Room was nice and clean with large windows bed was quite comfort 
271306,Hilton Amsterdam, The d cor was a bit dated but the service made up for it , We appreciated the thoughtful gestures and the excellent service while we were there to run the Amsterdam marathon The infosheet the energy drinks bars in the room the early breakfast buffet It made all the difference between a regular hotel stay and a memorable hotel stay 
271307,Hilton Amsterdam, Very expensive 300 for one night I booked for Amsterdam marathon as it was near the start and finish line for this reason perhaps the price was over inflated As nice as it was 300 was rather steep , Lovely modern helpful staff nothing was too much trouble 
271308,Hilton Amsterdam, The pressure on the shower was not powerful enough I expected more for over 200 a night from the Hilton and parking was too exspensive , The hotel and staff were great 
271309,Hilton Amsterdam, The hotel was quite pricey for one night and a bit further from the centre of Amsterdam than we would have liked but for the good service and friendly staff it was worth it A lot of hotels in the centre of Amsterdam are a lot more expensive though , The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating The room was spacious and clean with everything you could need and more One side of the hotel faces over a beautiful canal and the area close by is really peaceful with lots of nice places to eat Vondelpark is gorgeous and not far whilst the Van Gogh museum and IAmsterdam letters are easily walkable I would highly recommend this to anyone for either work or leisure 
271310,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved king size solid and comfort bed and the location is very close to town walking distance and the hotek recommended very good restaurant 5minutes from the hotel 
271311,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, The location was excellent Right near the museums but also not in the hustle bustle of tourists We had a great view from our window to see the canal Breakfast was good all the things you could want for breakfast I noticed the chef was constantly refilling the serving dishes Very nice The staff was very attentive came to give us coffee tea immediately 
271312,Hilton Amsterdam, A small point but we borrowed bikes for a couple of hours one evening and the concierge said there is only a daily rate My husband went to the gym early and couldn t get in because he didn t see the little button to open the door Perhaps an English sign could explain how to access , The host and server in the lounge were so positive had personality and were energetic Impressive The view and setting is very special Flat rate taxi to airport most appreciated 
271313,Hilton Amsterdam, Was settling down for the night Then found that the basin outlet was leaking Had to get maintenance team in Not an easy fix so they moved us to another room Abit of inconvenience at that hour of the day but the upside was we got a room with canal view , Room cleaning service team was excellent Parking space ease of access was very good Nice terrace for an afternoon tea 
271314,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, Location to the public transportation was great The area was excellent It was in an upscale neighborhood For breakfast you could eat the buffet or order off of the menu and both were were very good The staff was warm and knowledgeable Couldn t have asked for a better stay
271315,Hilton Amsterdam, The receptionist was rude and really unhelpful our early booking hadn t been sorted out so we had to find something to do for 4 hours and they didn t call us to say our room was ready like they had promised Also there was a large 200 euro fee we didn t know about , The bed was nice and comfortable
271316,Hilton Amsterdam, Very old quite loud lots of banging and rattling in rooms construction maybe and I am shocked when higher end hotels charge for wifi a bit of a deal breaker Not only was I charged but the Connectivity was pretty terrible , Great view and good location
271317,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, No value for money and mini bar service in the room is borderline scam 7 50 for a bottle of water is it holy water or something guest should b told on arrival the price of the items instead of being way over charges in the morning 
271318,Hilton Amsterdam, Not staying longer although the breakfast was a bit disappointing for my experiences with Hilton Hotels no omelette station but still plenty to choose , We just stayed one night but what a wonderful night it was We arrived at the hotel and no problem to park our car The hotel is located in a beautiful residential neighborhood close to the Museums and Vondel Park In the evening we decided to stay and have dinner at the lovely terrace of the hotel and have to say our server Sofia was outstanding with our baby and made our experience a memorable one 
271319,Hilton Amsterdam, There is really poor internet connection must be solved the problem especially in the rooms wireless doesnt work properly There is really nice garden however nobody serves outside so you just could have walk in it dont dream to have your drink, Location is really good Room was really clean and big enough Staff were really great
271320,Hilton Amsterdam, We were charged 7 50 for a small bottle of water from the minibar When we complained about the ridiculous charges especially as there was no complimentary water we were told that the water in Amsterdam is clean enough to drink from the tap Which of course we didn t know One of the lifts didn t work during our stay which meant that we had to wait for a lift 10 15 minutes each time we needed to use it There were no stairs for alternative ,No Positive
271321,Hilton Amsterdam, Had to be escorted through the kitchen as wanted to use the stairs rather than the lift Drinks are expensive, lovely situation very efficient and pleasant staff good breakfast
271322,Hilton Amsterdam, As above, To be honest my worst Hilton experience ever and should not still have a 5 star ratihg and as a rewards member im reluctant to write this its a visit id like to forget from the dated and tired decor the worst room service meal I ve ever been served and the staff who to be honest weren t overly friendly and then on my check out they added 117 Euro for a phone call I hadn t even made In fairness they did deduct this after an interrogation on was I totally sure it wasn t me I carry two cell phones why would I ever need to call from a hotel phone at 3 Euro a minute Awful experience Location good and the concierge
271323,Hilton Amsterdam, I think all staff are great especially the porters are very nice very wellcoming the rooms cld be uplifted juat a bit more touchups , Breakfast too expensive i think it should be included with accomodation so we went out for breakfast for 18 for 2 of us
271324,Hilton Amsterdam, Probably a little pricey but you also get what you pay for , Very spacious room great view of the canal and city Within walking distance of the top museums great staff with exceptional service Away from the hustle and bustle of the city in an upscale residential neighborhood 
271325,Hilton Amsterdam, Wifi was terrible dropped out all the time Shower pressure was really bad took ages to wash out shampoo Room was clean and comfortable but very dated furniture and decor No pool or spa was disappointing there is definitely enough space at the hotel Ate at the restaurant one night which was average but expensive food , Outstanding concierge staff who helped us a great deal during our stay Good breakfast and view from room Great gym and hotel is in a nice leafy area 
271326,Hilton Amsterdam, room size was okay and nothing much to talk about, staff at restaurant and front desk were very friendly and helpful great sense of humour location was great we could rest in the evening before heading out for dinner riverside bar was very relaxing
271327,Hilton Amsterdam, Parking Charges within the property is 35 which is unreasonable It should be for free , The rooms were good The Staff is super Kind and Helpful They try their best to make your stay comfortable 
271328,Hilton Amsterdam, We didn t get any Wifi during our stay which was a little bit disappointing , The staff were very friendly bed was huge and the canal view was lovely breakfast was absolutely delicious 
271329,Hilton Amsterdam, We were about to leave to the airport around 5 and i asked the front disck for a water for my son and he refused saying we do not have really its just a water he did not want to bother himself i asked for just a water for a kid and he did not help at all so roude, The brekfast staf they were nice and very willcoming and good serveres the best staf i have ever met grate job guys 
271330,Hilton Amsterdam, Internet, Bed and pillows very nice housekeeping staff is excellent Lara the hostess for the breakfast buffet is outstanding Lara makes every customer feel welcomed and special 
271331,Hilton Amsterdam, I specifically requested a junior suite with a balcony when I booked on 13 May Upon arrival I was told that I had to accept one without a balcony for the first night and told not to unpack much This room was smaller with only 2 windows one of which wouldn t open It took over an hour and 2 reminders for this to be done The room furniture and fittings are very 1960 s and very tired Drawers and cupboard doors are ill fitting One small free bottle of water only on first night for an Honours member , The breakfasts were good and access to the lounge was a bonus Most staff friendly except for the duty guest manager 
271332,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, Very friendly staff and very comfortable beds 5 minute walk to the hotel from the tram stop however we managed to walk in the wrong direction twice and it took us 25 minutes Terrible sense of direction on our part Fabulous stay 
271333,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, Location and the professionalism of the staff The bartender Kostas was exceptional and Chef Roberto went out of his way to make it special for our group 
271334,Hilton Amsterdam, If it was within 5mins or so walking distance from the centre, 25euros to dam square an amazing hotel with the best terrace and garden to enjoy beers by the canal V helpful staff gr8 rooms defo staying here next time Book well in advance for a really good rate too if u can
271335,Hilton Amsterdam, They have a mouse in the bar Been there three times and every time I saw it I told the waiter but he said the hotel knows and couldn t fix it Other thing due to urgent circumstances had to leave the hotel two days before my actual check out They charged one night which is not fair ,No Positive
271336,Hilton Amsterdam, Staff weren t very helpful and rooms are a bit outdated with no safe and coat hangers that fell off Feels like an old hotel, Location next to the canal very nice terrace to enjoy the sun
271337,Hilton Amsterdam, Hotel charged my credit card by mistake I bought tour package from the hotel but the indication was confusing It took us extra 1 5 hours to reach destination , Clean Good breakfast 
271338,Hilton Amsterdam, No rack or stand to place suitcase , Located in a quiet neighbourhood but very accessible close to Vondelpark and museums clean good sized rooms very helpful staff good breakfast nice sit out by the canal and great tasting food at Robertos 
271339,Hilton Amsterdam, No separate shower instead shower in bath tub No free Wifi in hotel room , During check in an free upgrade to a room with canal view Despite the fact that the hotel was fully occupied friendly and professional staff at check in breakfast and house keeping Perfect price quality due to a deal of Bookings com Short walking distance to the Museum quarter district 
271340,Hilton Amsterdam, For my whole stay 7 22 7 27 it temperatures outside were below 45 degrees Farenheit and the hotel failed to re activate the heating system After spending two nights frozen in bed I finally got a portable heater placed in the room but it was too late Still walking around with a severe cold ha chou , Again loved the staff The upgrade was quite successful and the rooms nice and roomy and cozy See reason for the negative facilities in the above space 
271341,Hilton Amsterdam, When I arrived I was given a room which had not been cleaned up , Breakfast and Service in the Breakfast room is excellent After I got the wrong room the reception gave me an upgrade for a higher Level and Access to the Business Lounge The view from the Business Lounge top floor is outstanding 
271342,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, I have stayed here many times before It s a very nice hotel Clean comfortable all the facilities you might need and pleasant and helpful staff 
271343,Hilton Amsterdam, Thought the Restaurant was very expensive for the dinner menu and meant that we only ate there one night Would have made use of the Restaurant had it a more attractive price range , Hotel was in good location for our requirements Staff very welcoming and friendly Restaurant was excellent for breakfast with a good choice on offer Room was clean and the extra bed provided for third occupant was ideal The Porters during our stay were extremely helpful and made our last day very stress free in being able to leave our luggage until early evening and then booking our taxi to take us to Airport with plenty of time to spare A big thank you to them all 
271344,Hilton Amsterdam, Keys failed on 3 different occasions which was annoying as I had to keep getting new ones , Rooms were very spacious Large bedroom with a huge bed a good size bathroom I also asked for a room With a view and I certainly got one it was absolutely beautiful 
271345,Hilton Amsterdam, The wifi is shocking and the parking is ridiculously expensive There isn t much in the way of food places in the immediate vicinity The in house restaurant is expensive , Location very close to tram Lovely view from our room Brilliant concierge staff 
271346,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, We had a great room spacious and very comfortable The choice at breakfast was very good and the staff were very pleasant and helpful The location is very convenient for the museum quarter and it s a short journey on the tram into the heart of things The marina at the hotel is very pretty Attention to detail is clear here 
271347,Hilton Amsterdam, One of the elevators was out of order and all the working elevators were extremely slow, Location was great hotel activities based on holidays very upscale festive and enjoyable 
271348,Hilton Amsterdam, Parking in front of the hotel too expensive with 35 per night , Comfortable nice large rooms Situated close to the museums quarter of town Free internet 
271349,Hilton Amsterdam, Price for parking is exorbitant For hotel guests there should be a better deal Bathrooms are so so Twin beds were roll away style and quite quirky and noisy when turning around , Location in quiet area at a canal is great Terrace and garden 
271350,Hilton Amsterdam, Nothing, Staff very helpful and friendly hotel imacculate will be returning and would highly reccomend to anyone fabulous hotel in perfect location
271351,Hilton Amsterdam, The room is a little bit old especially the furnitures not look like than a 5 stars hotel The bathroom also old i expect more from a 5 stars hotel , The breakfast was amazing The staff are very kind and helpful The location is perfect for sightseeing very quiet for relaxing 
271352,Hilton Amsterdam, Cost of drinks in the bar was very expensive, Considers welcome very good and helpful with local advice for public transport and local visitor attractions
271353,Hilton Amsterdam, It s a pity the executive lounge hours for an alcoholic drink are limited 6 8 pm Non alcoholic drinks and small snacks are however always available , No need to book with breakfast if you have access to the executive lounge Although the range of items is somewhat larger at the full breakfast buffet the breakfast at the executive lounge is more than sufficient to fill your tummy The views from rooms at upper floors are really nice both sides with a slight preference for the old city views Public transport 10 min to the city by tram is in walking distance The staff were really helpful and very friendly 
271354,Hilton Amsterdam, It is not an hotel of today but of yesterday Old fashioned needs renovation lot s of uncomfortable chairs everywhere also in the conference room To sit on smith like this during 8 hours is a torture Rooms with big windows but in the evening it is very dark inside The lighting is very poor , Very nice kind careful staff wonderful breakfast good service 
271355,Hilton Amsterdam, liked everything about the place we are frequent visitors to Amsterdam and it is our hotel of choice , The location was excellent 15 mins walk to the museum quarter and probably another 20 mins right into Dam square with a lovely walk through the Vonderpark along some excellent shopping avenues Enough to do without hitting the centre and avoiding the tourist areas 
271356,Hilton Amsterdam, We could not order Bloody Marys at breakfast unless we got them from the bar I think that s how it worked , The staff was amazing They all went above and beyond to be helpful They noticed small things about us and later would bring us something or give information relavent to making our stay in the hotel and city the best it could be We will definitely be staying here again 
271357,Hilton Amsterdam, Room was rather dull and dated I ve stayed at the Hilton in Cyprus and it was far superior to this one Expensive breakfast was cold buffet style also mini bar is a rip off , Excellent service from the staff very friendly and helpful
271358,Hilton Amsterdam, Over priced hotel Room decoration in need of attention Noisy room with two adjoining doors A member of staff tried to charge an additional 180 on top of the price paid to Booking com , Canal side location Helpful duty manager resolved a potential payment dispute after room payment to Booking com had been made 
271359,Hilton Amsterdam, Took a while to get bearings so took a few days to work easy route from Musiumplein and then a 15 20 min walk has positive tho as out of way of mayhem of main city , Friendly staff luxurious hotel clean rooms
271360,Hilton Amsterdam, There is nothing executive about their executive room Very standard Gym and spa hours are very slim closed at 4pm on a Saturday Better options in town for the same price range , The staff was friendly and location is fine Walking distance to museums restaurants and shopping 
271361,Hilton Amsterdam, Need to change the staff members in room service Not polite No attitude Don t give hotel to block amount from credit card I lost money 100 cash deposit They will not provide you the receipt of payment taken from your credit card , Consergnee and bell boys were very nice 
271362,Hilton Amsterdam, 1 The staff weren t helpful and behaving and treating with guests diffrently especially in breakfast room the bar 2 I had difficulties with my booking rate with the hotel at checkout time which they were nt helpful although one week after my departure the hotel management answered my mails and solved the problem in a very good manner , 1 The location 2 Breakfast quality was excellent 3 cleaness of the room
271363,Hilton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were exceptional The breakfast was great The executive lounge very comfortable and well stocked A truly wonderful wind down from out 7 week European adventure 
271364,Hilton Amsterdam, Add costs for breakfast 27 parking 35 night Personnel is lacking of basic customer care which leaves you with a poor impression for service minded staff ,No Positive
271365,Hilton Amsterdam, PARKING Welcome customers Please park your car in our hotel parking lot at a rate of 35 Euros per day Then every time you want to leave the hotel to get food or drive around you have to wait in line to get your ticket scanned by a member at the front desk This is so disappointing that it ruins all the great things about this hotel Its not like it s located in the best spot You need to take a 10 minute tram ride to get into town My next stay will not be at this hotel for this very reason This is making me try another hotel closer to city center RESTAURANT FOR DINER I could explain in detail but I would just say don t eat here Not worth the 20 euro markup on every dish , WIFI Fast and only free if you are a Hilton Honors member tip become a Hilton honors member before your stay it costs nothing HOTEL ROOM Room was clean shower pressure was strong Executive club access not worth the extra money its a small room at the top of the hotel and you can t step outside when up there BREAKFAST Hands down the best breakfast ever Eggs bacon sausage fruit yogurt pastries they will make pancakes omelets poached eggs all is included in the price of breakfast I highly recommend you add breakfast to your stay 
271366,Hilton Amsterdam, Glass top table had several stains under glass pointed it out maid and she cleaned it Several places were dusty , Bed very comfortable bathroom clean and good towels 
271367,Hilton Amsterdam, Room looked a bit tired but at least was fresh not stuffy Bathroom has a shower curtain A glass enclosure is my preference A small bottle of water costs 7 euro, Breakfast selection and staff were the best Nice area Close to tram stop 16 On the canal Very clean 
271368,Hilton Amsterdam, The member of staff in the executive room was very bolshy and acted like what we were eating and drinking was being paid for by her She was very slow in refilling things and mending the coffee maker Also would have liked more options as aperitifs after a long day in the city than nuts Also was too far out of the main city of Amsterdam ended up needing to get taxis into Dam square which cost roughly 25 each trip In hindsight would have booked the double tree Hilton instead , The hotel should not be judged from the outside as is clean and what you would expect of a Hilton inside Check in staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful Great view from the room of the canal 
271369,Hilton Amsterdam, Nothing Everything was perfect , We had an amazing stay at the Amsterdam Hilton We stayed for the Amsterdam Marathon Every member of staff and the hotel as a whole went out of their way to make sure we had a pleasant stay A special menu at Roberto s was put on to cater for Marathon Runners and any questions or requests we had were dealt with quickly and with a smile It is also an amazing setting the bar has great views of the river and the restaurant food was perfect Thank you to everyone there we had a great stay 
271370,Hilton Amsterdam, Reception staff attitude Empty promises regarding check in and check out times Rooms not ready on time Charging 7 5 for a small bottle of water from mini bar in the room No WiFi in the room Not a value for money,No Positive

271372,Hilton Amsterdam, we faced a problem with the receptionist that she charged us for the whole stay twice not only block amount We couldn t use the credit card for 2 weeks because of her fault But the manager Serghey upgraded our rooms and provide complementary breakfast , nice place
271373,Hilton Amsterdam, The hotel is quite a long walk into town and the parking is really expensive Our room was very dusty and smelt as if it needed airing , Sitting by the canal having an evening drink was lovely
271374,Hilton Amsterdam, Expensive meals at the Hotel and having to pay to use facilities such as the gym which seems excessive when you are already paying more than 200 per night , The quiet location of the Hotel and access to the executive lounge where there is a great view to take in while having a drink Reception staff were always very helpful

271376,Hilton Amsterdam, Everything in the hotel is great Only that you have to pay for wi fi in your room i m a Hilton Honors member so i got free wifi but i still feel unfair for other people and pay Euro 30 or 35 for the parking while the room rate is not low The wifi is pretty slow so it s very frustrating , The view is magnificent it s right by the canal and you have to book a canal view room to fully enjoy it I had the Executive Room so have access to the roof top Executive Lounge which has a spectacular 360 view of Amsterdam The breakfast is amazing it s served in buffet style and has a huge selection you can also order eggs cooked to your personal preference when there are a lot of people they provide another room facing the canal so you enjoy a nice view while they will put another sets of tables serving the same food so people don t have to squeeze altogether along the same table to get the food It s only 3 min walk to the tram station and a few tram stations away from the Museum Quarter 10 mins so very convenient 
271377,Hilton Amsterdam, The Gym was is not free although I have HH membership , I have really enjoyed my stay I was there my honeymoon great location bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was exceptional I would defiantly stay again at the Hilton in my next visit to Amsterdam The location of the hotel is excellent very clean area and away from the noise of the city center the tram is 3 min walk from the hotel and have direct access to the city center in 10 min also the most famous street market is just 4 stops away from the hotel 
271378,Hilton Amsterdam, Felt the parking fees were over the top with amount already paying for stay 35 euros a night Not as though it was city centre and there was plenty of space in car park , Good location In a quiet area but an easy ride into city centre on number 16 team Excellent facilities Very comfortable Booked executive room so had access to 360 lounge on top floor Fab views and nice to have free drinks and snacks
