89541,Villa Montparnasse, No hot water in room possibly due to maintenance works so had to change rooms Renovated needed and was happening on 2 floors Lights either complicated or didn t work , Convenience to transport to airports and to Montparnasse station and restaurants Theodore at reception helpful Quirky African theme 
89542,Villa Montparnasse, lift was out of order for the two days i stayed six floors is good exercise but this was treated by staff as a minor issue sorry not our fault type response with no attempt to deal with possible implications or inconvenience, friendly small hotel near RER station
89543,Villa Montparnasse, The hotel is starting to get a tired and could do with some renovation , As always the staff and very friendly and helpful and the location is ideal for my purposes 
89544,Villa Montparnasse, The mini bar kind of smelled bad which gave the room the same smell but a little ventilation helped , It was really central without the hustle and bustle of a city center so it was very quiet and nice Plenty of restaurants around the hotel as well as boulangeries which was fantastic Just a 5 minute walk from Denfert Rochereau metro and RER station and the catacombs of Paris They have a nearby franprix and monoprix as well so if you re on a budget you can get your breakfast and lunch food from there 
89545,Villa Montparnasse, A basic renovation in terms of removing the wallpapers would make it a great place to stay , Perfect location Metro station 2 minutes away The room was very clean The breakfast was great 
89546,Villa Montparnasse, The bathroom wasn t particularly clean and gleaming and breakfast was ok but not extensive , It was charming and what I had hoped for being in Paris as a couple Very comfortable and the staff were lovely In lovely bustling market area Very close to the catacombs 
89547,Villa Montparnasse, Rooms and furniture were shabby badly in need of replacement Towels were clean but old Sink basin in bathroom cracked , Excellent location for authentic local experienxe
89548,Villa Montparnasse, The hotel has not been refurbished in too long therefore everything is quite old and shabby Also my room was at the corner of 2 streets one is a small street but the other is a very noisy big street with busy traffic throughout the night not quiet enough for sleeping , The location is excellent and the room has everything as written It is small but also nice clean with very comfortable bed Internet works fine though some previous guests wrote they had issues with it 
89549,Villa Montparnasse, Little bit pricey but that s Paris , Great location close to Denfert Rochereau station with direct access to the city centre and the airport About a 40minute walk or a 5 minute metro ride from Notre Dame Close to the Tour Montparnasse which has great views over the city Room was comfortable and quiet the wifi was fast enough and worked throughout the hotel the staff were always really friendly and helpful

89551,Villa Montparnasse, I was stuck in the elevator for 50 minutes until the rescue service arrives to the hotel I had to attend to a business meeting and I arrived one hour late A 4 star hotel should have a faster rescue service Trying to compensate this problem the hotel did not charge my breakfast In addition the hotel furniture was rather old and the double room actually was an small room 6 m2 at most with two beds and no space left for anything else In summary I would have expected more comfort and quality from a 4 star hotel , The room was cheap for a 4 star hotel in Paris 
89552,Villa Montparnasse, the single beds pushed together to make a double kept moving apart , Wonderful staff excellent location Really a great place and I will definitely recommend your hotel 
89553,Villa Montparnasse, The moquet old and dhirty the windows did not close well the flow of water in the toilette was continuously dropping and nobody fixed it for 3 days The price of the room was to high in relation to these issues, the position the view of the graveyard Montparnasse from the window
