7616,Splendid Etoile, Restaurant and bar closed Sunday evening not informed in the website Water in the room first night only why do hotels charge a lot for the room then not leave water complimentary in the room We were told to walk to the shop at 10 pm for water , Excellent location
7617,Splendid Etoile, Wifi was very weak I was able to get it on my laptop computer but could not get connection on my iPad or iPhone , Staff was incredible everyone at front desk extremely helpful and friendly They could not do enough Each day I returned I felt like I had come home Based on research I asked for a high floor with partial view of Arc de Triumphe I got exactly what I asked for Room large especially for a city like Paris bright with a balcony that had the view to the Arc Amenities in room were everything you would hope for Large and well lit bath Metro a 2 minute walk bus to both airports just across the street 
7618,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff We got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice This was our first time in Paris and we loved it Farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had Would definitely recommend it 
7619,Splendid Etoile, nothing, We had an amazing stay The rooms are very cozy with an amazing view of The Arc de Triumph I felt like home my entire stay Staff was nice all the time Would definitely stay again at this amazing little hotel 
7620,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, The staff and location of this hotel were great The hotel is located very conveniently near the Arc de Triomphe and the entrance to the Metro underground It was very easy to access my office at La Defence all the resturants and shopping as well as all the tourist sites And it also had a great view from the balcony 
7621,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, The room with the view was just fantastic Very confortable cozy and clean Amazing balcony where you just wanna stay whole day Comfortable bed Very polite and helpful staff 
7622,Splendid Etoile, Nothing no faults at all , Brilliant location staff were very helpful and the view from the room was excellent Would definitely visit again and highly recommend 
7623,Splendid Etoile, Nothing, Very helpful I got engaged and they helped in every way they could had roses in the room and rose petals on the bed and they made the occasion perfect couldn t ask for more Perfect location and views 
7624,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Rooms were a really nice size Excellent location Nicely decorated The hotel reception staff were so friendly and helpful Really appreciated this as it was our first time in Paris Would definitely stay here again 
7625,Splendid Etoile, The bed is supposed to be king size and actually it is very small and uncomfortable Too much nose because of contraction that they did not warned me about it which they should inform me once I booked The staff are very rude You asked them for a missing item in the room kleenex towel toothbrush etc they had an attitude , The location is excellent
7626,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, The hotel location was great The hotel room was excellent and I can say that it can be compared to 5 stars hotels The room was always clean with beautiful views 
7627,Splendid Etoile, The lifts are a bit small so big suitcases might be a problem , The view was absolutely amazing Very nice and cozy room Perfect location at the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees right in front of the metro 
7628,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Beautiful room friendly staff and an amazing view of the Arc de Triomphe Well placed for attractions in Paris close to the metro and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower 
7629,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Excellent hotel wonderful staff Very convenient location as it s right on top of literally a metro via lift Definitely worth getting the arc de triomphe view 
7630,Splendid Etoile, Staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat Missing a bar or place for a drink Limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the High Street Champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced 6 for a simple coke but this is a more Paris issue in general perhaps , Clean rooms no noise even when so close to the main street excellent balcony with a super view 5th floor nicely decorated safe everything you need for a perfect stay Close to the metro station and this line brings you to all good places 
7631,Splendid Etoile, Can t think of anything we didn t like , We had a beautiful room for three on the six floor with a full view of the Arc de Triumphe and a partial view of the Eiffel Tower Every detail was lovely Newly decorated I believe and tastefully done in soft colors it was a pleasure to stay at this hotel 
7632,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Had a one night stay at this hotel and have nothing but praise for this hotel Be sure to get superior room that has fantastic view on Arc de Triomphe and enjoy your morning coffee routine or wine evenings on terrace Overall room was clean and cosy and very quiet and comfortable for good night rest Hotel staff was very courteous informative and helpful I ll definitely stay here again and make sure it is more then one night 
7633,Splendid Etoile, The WiFi was extremely poor There are a limited number of logins allowed shared across the entire hotel You would have to keep refreshing the login page and hope that someone logged out of the WiFi or turned it off so that you could get connected , The Chief Concierge Farooq was extremely helpful with all our luggages It was of walking distance to the Champs Elysees and generally not difficult to find for taxi drivers The cafe across the road was also pleasant and does good cheeseburgers 
7634,Splendid Etoile, There are not many facilities like swimming pool or gym and the different areas are very smal like the breakfast room the lobby or the bar Not hot food for breakfast , Very comfortable clean refurbished and great location 
7635,Splendid Etoile, The breakfast was too expensive and 25 euros meant that I never got to try the breakfast , The staff were sooooo friendly I am a young woman who stayed alone during a business trip and I felt very safe and welcome 
7636,Splendid Etoile, All good but if the breakfast was included it would have been perfect The room was very good on 3rd floor and balcony view of The Arch , Fab location Great helpful staff Breakfast expensive 
7637,Splendid Etoile, WiFi was not working for half of my 5 day stay, Fantastic location and staff This property owner is involved and attends to detail It shows up with the clean and well maintained property along with his staff s attention to the guests 
7638,Splendid Etoile, The breakfast hot breakfast items need to be refreshed more often eg at 0900 the bacon was crispy, Excellent value for money room very clean quite and had a great view we stayed on the 5th floor Would definitely stay there again and recommend t anyone
7639,Splendid Etoile, Bed too small for a double Way over charging during the Euro 2016 Championship but I guess all other hotels in Paris where doing the same , Next to Arc de Triomphe with beautiful view Well run and maintained hotel elegantly finished 
7640,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in Paris In terms of location it doesn t get any better than this If you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all Arc De Triomphe We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around Despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately The rooms are large by European standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view Friendly and courteous staff added to our stay A special mention of Mr Farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas Thank you Splendid Etoile you truly made our stay Splendid 
7641,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, This hotel was in an excellent location just a minute or two to Charles de Gaulle metro station from where you could catch a train to any location in Paris Rooms were beautiful and staff were super friendly and helpful and all spoke excellent English Would highly recommend this hotel 
7642,Splendid Etoile, Breakfast not included cleaning lady frequently ignored do not disturb sign even though we complained about it at the front desk , Excellent location great staff
7643,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful My room balcony had a beautiful view of the Arc de Triumph and the beautiful surrounding leafy streets The hotel is directly opposite a major metro station right near the Arc de Triumph and Champs lys es restaurants and a little supermarket fantastic location 
7644,Splendid Etoile, Staff member being loudly told off by lady manageress i assume she was right but not in front of client never do that Saturday evening at 11pm left outside of hotel door locked desk unmanned not good , Location location location quiet room mostly do to double windows bf ok 
7645,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Fantastic location by the Arc de Triumph and opposite the top of the Champs Elysees with a metro station and airport transfer bus stop right outside the front of the hotel Incredible views from the balcony Very helpful staff 
7646,Splendid Etoile, The bed was a bit hard but that s probably personal preference , Very friendly staff Lovely room good size Good location Great view from our balcony 
7647,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, Very nice hotel Everything was excellent staff was welcoming the View was amazing the balcony was the best part with a view of the arc and Eiffel Tower the room was big comparing to other hotels in Paris Defiantly going back again 
7648,Splendid Etoile, The room photos on the website do not entirely correspond to reality because only newly renovated rooms are shown but we received an older room although very clan , Excellent location easy access to metro main tourist attractions nice central yet quiet neighborhood very friendly personnel much attention to cleanliness very comfortable beds coffee toiletries available Overall I would recommend this hotel 
7649,Splendid Etoile, Cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom Very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel The room was so small Very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the A C because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it , Very friendly staff Location was not bad The view was great They allowed us to check in very early 
7650,Splendid Etoile, The breakfast was really expensive 25 per person, The staff was really really helpful Recommended us where to eat how to travel around Paris etc We are travelling in a group of 5 people with many large luggages At first we decided to go the CDG airport by RER cos if we take the taxi we would have to take 2 taxis then it will cost a lot But the staff arranged us a minivan taxi to take us all together It was very convenient
7651,Splendid Etoile, loud nights during the weekends people screaming shouting from nearby bars, the small balcony overlooking the arch and the metro station which is right outside the hotel entrance
7652,Splendid Etoile, The wines provided are terrible and expensive 17 for half bottle We were very disappointed specially because France is famous for good wine We opened 2 bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible We were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have Although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it , Location is amazing very close to champs elysees Staff were so friendly and helpful doing everything to please us and our little dog We were upgrade from classic room to superior room what made our trip much more special The room balcony view is spectacular We had such a wonderful time that we decided to stay an extra night 
7653,Splendid Etoile,No Negative, The location was perfect Right outside the RER and Metro Walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe and the Air France shuttle bus The hotel staff found out that we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room Throughout the stay they were very helpful helped us print tickets quick to bring up requests like towels pillows and glasses and gave directions and suggestions for tourist to do s in Paris The rooms are a bit small but it s an average size for European hotel rooms They also look exactly the same as the pictures advertised on the site Overall a great place to stay in Paris Highly recommend it 
7654,Splendid Etoile, the beds was little uncomfortable, location was exillant staff was very nice they offer me upgrade to a privallage room with balcony ARC view specially mr farouq at the reception was very helpful and polite also he talks different languages he gave us a great help the hotel is nice and highly recommended breakfast was great specially the madlien cakes baked fresh and taste perfect sure will be back again
7655,Splendid Etoile, Leaving , I would say the best hotel we have stayed in And we travel a lot I like watching hotel impossible and this hotel passed all the tests with flying colors Super clean I felt right at home This was the first hotel i went in the shower with bare feet The staff is simply 5 stars from housekeeping room service and of course the front desk staff Just amazing thank you all Best location too We shall return
