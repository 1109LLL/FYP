422743,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful old hotel Great service and great food Excellent and beautiful location Breakfast buffet on the Asmtel River each morning was wonderful 
422744,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, The canal facing rooms were not available due to renovation rest everything was awesome , The room was spacious the best I would say available in Amsterdam The service was great the staff had a smiling face always and were very cooperative 
422745,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, The AC was just right for a good night s sleep However I was there at the end of May couldn t imagine how warm it ll be mid summer Also the building is quite old and there was a little vibration coming from nowhere which made the TV do a buzzing noise , Room layout of the room made it seem bigger than it is along with the bathroom which was very nice 
422746,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, hotel is going refubrishment so some scaffolding was up , Lovely location extremely friendly staff The breakfast was great with lovely views of the Amsel river Our room was very comfortable The hotel lobby was very grand 
422747,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, We had to wait an hour for our room to be ready I paid around 290 for one night so after a long day and paying that type of money you d expect your room to be ready when checking in at 2pm To add to the slightly annoyed feelings when we got into our room and settled in we went to sleep for a couple of hours only to be interupted by house keeping who rang the bell knocked on the door then with no answer just walked in They would have no reason to come into the room after being cleaned and tidied was uncomfortable to think that we were sleeping and someone just walks in , The pool was beautiful aswell as the hotel 
422748,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, The plastic rubber cover on the mattrass made sleeping very sweaty and uncomfortable We discovered the cover in the middle of the night and had to take it off and make the bed again Why would they spoil an excellent bed by putting a plastic cover on top of it Why not use a cotton cover to keep the mattrass clean , The Wellness centre and the pool were very nice The breakfast was super The staff very friendly and hospitable 
422749,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, But We wanted to have a glass of wine and the bar was closed for a special evenq we were asked to go to the restaurant but the staff there was extremely rude and doesn t let us have a drink though the restaurant was not full ,No Positive

422754,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, We arrived by boat an advertised option but there was no staff who could tell us where we could moor Having made our way to reception not obvious or easy from the waterfront the receptionist said we could moor anywhere on the waterfront However just as we were finishing off the roping up a very disgruntled member of the restaurant staff came out to tell us that we couldn t moor there and would have to move Not a particularly pleasant arrival at such a prestigious hotel , The room and facilities were very clean and comfortable The breakfast was excellent Overall the hotel had great charm and a warm and attractive decoration

422756,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, We were disappointed that the swimming pool and the restaurant La Rive were both closed Apparently this is usual in January and we think we should have been informed of this before we booked, The hotel is a beautiful building our room was spacious with a lovely bathroom and a view over the Amstel river Staff were helpful and discreet and hotel was well placed for museums and art galleries
