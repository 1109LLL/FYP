80470,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Maybe the room was little to small but the probelem was the missing of an ordinary chair , The bed was good and the Hotel was in the center of London near to everything Good breakfast was good

80473,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Business room was too small meaning it was a mission to use the sink or attempt to get into the shower No fridge desk and insufficient storage area for clothes , Friendly staff Decent breakfast
80474,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Though 4 star hotel and minibar as per desription it is empty there is even no orange juice available , Staff is more than friendly very very dedicated and helpful Breakfast delicious indeed 
80475,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Although the hotel was lovely and in good location it is still quite expensive 200 a night , We were greeted well and offered a smaller room that was ready early or the original room a little later and also given complimentary breakfast if we chose the smaller room The water in reception was fab as were the sweets The breakfast was lovely There was banging in the room as a result of improvement work Reception were helpful about time this and reassured us that this would stop by 4pm 
80476,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Aircon was very noisy Tea coffee etc provided but no cups to drink it from View of brick wall not very appealing , Breakfast very good Staff very friendly and helpful Great location

80478,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in No window view brick wall right outside so limited natural light , Great location good breakfast buffet friendly efficient staff 
80479,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Shame that the lift is so small and is used by the housekeeping staff but at least there is one We do appreciate that this is because of the constraints of older buildings , Fantastic location with friendly and helpful staff Happy for us to leave our cases on arrival as the rooms weren t ready these were in our rooms for us on our return to the hotel My son appreciated the sweets in reception 
80480,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Double bed was slightly small but room was quite small too but extremely clean Looked out onto brick wall which made room quite dark would have been nice to have a window view, Lunch in the restaurant was excellent service very good Came back after concert in Hyde park and restaurant about to close but still served us and staff very helpful Breakfast very good food freshly cooked
80481,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, There s a single much used lift to service the 4 floors of rooms and which is also used by housekeeping and room service so you can feel stuck on the fourth floor Bed was on the very firm side though not uncomfortable A single room is small enough there s no room for a sitting chair besides the one at the desk , The location is near the Bond Street Baker Street and Marble Arch tube stations so easy to shoot off in any directions The included breakfast offers both a cold buffet and choice of hot dishes as well as hot drinks juices If you like to shop Selfridges is nearby as well any number of shops 
80482,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Not enough electric sockets in room Three in total but two were very high up wall and with no shelf underneath I couldn t plug anything into them So just the one socket which could be used Bit of a nuisance when trying to charge phone laptop etc , Staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly Location excellent Lovely breakfast

80484,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I can t think of anything negative, Unfortunately i arrived quite late and had an appointment the following morning so i did not get chance to eat breakfast so i can not comment on that The bed was very comfy and the a c was particularly welcome due to the heatwave The room had everything i needed The gentleman on the desk when i checked in was particularly helpful also the following morning when he had already printed directions for me i thought that was fab so thank you to him sorry i didn t get his name I hope to stay again and and spend a little more time in the room and the restaurant next time
80485,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Not a first world problem but the bathroom didn t have a lot of space for my toiletires and some were on the floor For a couple the shower is a little small to fit both of you , The location was perfect close to Marble Arch underground buses or walking distance to all the major attractions A big old building so the room was really quiet and the bed and bedding was super comfortable The staff were excellent and very helpful in every way and the buffet breakfast was truly on point A variety of everything for all tastes and the chicken sausages were awesome I had a pair of extremely muddy boots from being at a festival and the hotel gave them a complimentary clean and shine I travel extensively and was really impressed with service of this place 
80486,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, See above , Lovely helpful staff Very quiet location but also convenient for Oxford Street etc Had a really good nights sleep The choice at breakfast was excellent but no pre warmed plates available for hot food which as a result went cold very quickly Scrambled egg too sloppy for my personal taste but you can t please all of the people all of the time WILL BE STAYING AGAIN
80487,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The basic room is very very tight However they quite promptly changed us to a better room due to some misunderstanding of what room we were to get , Did not try it

80491,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Nothing , The staff here are so accommodating and genuinely nice I never felt that any of my requests and I had many were too much trouble for them They were beyond helpful 
80492,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Room size bathroom size internet connection the view My room was definitely to small even for one person with two it would be like on submarine Together with terrible view from the window it is difficult to understand price and 4 stars rating , Hotel very was close to my destination The equipment interior and stuff 
80493,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, the room was very very small the shower was very tight the first night was terrible the room 403 was very small and L couldn t open my bag but they changed the room next day the wasn t isolated annoying sound coming from the corridor and the cars outside , location staff
80494,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I booked couple of weeks before travelling and I ended up in a microscopic room that was probably no more than 7 m2 Quite frankly for 200 GPB per night the room I got was ridiculous and I say it having been in London many times for business in this category of hotel It was only there for one night but I was annoyed nonetheless as I purposely avoided other less expensive hotels exactly not to end up sleeping in a cage I made my point to the reception at check out and they kindly offered to do better next time which is of course nice but maybe it would have been more appropriate to warn me upon arrival and maybe offer a discount at the point I was asked to pay at check in since I can t possibly believe the one I had was a standard room for single occupancy , Very nice breakfast nice geographical location the hotel was proper and clean
80495,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room and washroom were claustrophobic a lot of noise from lift and people passing the rooms and the curtains were not proper to hide the lights , staffs were helpful and polite and the breakfast was good 
80496,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The bed and the rooms were awfully small especially the one with the stairs it was ridiculous the showers in the bathroom were too short we had to bend down to wash our hair we could listen to everything outside of the room there arent any mirrors in the room not even slippers and the cleaning lady took a white dress my wife left on the chair mistaking it for towels and when i called they said they ll look for it and get back to me and that was it no feedback and i didnt get it back there was one elevator for service and customers and it was so slow we had to wait for it to come back empty so we could go up or down and the roof of the room was so short if i lift my hand i could touch the wall and i know there are many guys taller than me i think they should crawl around the room l the bed was small for 2 ppl and not comfortable and thats after we changed our room 2 times to find something habitable oh and dont bother spraying perfume youll get to the lobby and start smelling like lobster after that, The staff was friendly
80497,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The windows are poorly insulated so the room is cold and you can hear the noise from the street My room was in front of the elevator so again not the ideal location for a good night sleep , Staff were very friendly and helpful 
80498,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Small room bathroom had no place to hang towel Large step up to bathroom made it difficult to manage Difficult step into shower too Bathroom and room over looked by offices no net curtains so they could see in unless everything closed up, Location

80503,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Personally I believe that the room price can slightly decrease due to its room size , Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex is a superb hotel Although its room is not that large its location was perfect Tube and shopping street All staffs have service mind thus Its service was exceed our expectation

80523,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, There were disgusting curly hairs in the shower The pipes were SO noisy in our room it kept us awake Carpets and fittings really worn and grubby , The staff were really friendly
80524,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The rooms are really small and the bathrooms even smaller Had to change rooms as we had booked a twin and were allocated a double Be careful when you book and be very specific, Perfect location just off Oxford Street
80525,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The cleaner dosent clean the coffee cups And every day they take the cups and i have to order them the elevator take long time i think 2 would be enough, Staff is very friendly specially Caroline she really helped me for an early check in
80526,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room was small and the bathroom was minute A bedside lamp would have been easier on the eyes than just ceiling spotlights There was low level noise outside the room probably coming from the air conditioning unit take earplugs if you re a light sleeper , The location was good for Oxford Street and Hyde Park The choice at breakfast was good and more varied than other hotels of a similar standard 
80527,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Minor niggle no electrical sockets by the bed and aircon heating could not change the temperature, Good location for our needs Bed comfortable Staff courteous and helpful

80532,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Very small rooms I changed 3 rooms because of a noise of the air condition In all 3 rooms the noice was the same I have been told that this is normal and they could not fix it The sound was like bubbles If the air condition was switched off the sound stopped for a while and then it started again Very bad for such a hotel , Top location breakfast very good 
80533,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, It may just be the room I had but the room was very cold when entering the heating system didn t seem to be working properly The wooden trim round the mirror on cupboard was broken meaning the light inside cupboard shone through the gap and I had to stick the switch in place to turn the light off The bed throw and pillow were heavily stained and marked , Hotel reception Restuarant and facilities were of a very high standard I ate in the Restuarant on arrival and the food and service was very good The breakfast buffet was very good and plentiful with and everything and more you ask for to start the day Bathroom amenities were very nice and clean
80534,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I would prefer the pillows to be lower but this is quite personal , Overall I enjoyed my stay at the hotel The room is a bit small but contains all the facilities I need Good breakfast and helpful staff 
80535,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I didn t think the cooked breakfast was fantastic especially for a vegetarian I e BBQ beans service very poor by not replacing plates and cutlery when taken away never got asked if we would like more tea coffee Our room was next to noisy generators and in the morning you could smell the cooked breakfast through the air conditioning the pillows were like rocks and very uncomfortable and the bar did not stay open after 11pm which I thought was poor as we were looking forward to having as drink at the hotel , The room was clean 
80536,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The price excludes breakfast and the price for adding breakfast was too expensive for my opinion, The location was perfect for walk tours and to the underground All stuff helped us with bright faces and useful tips
80537,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, My room as the noise of A c was too disturbing and could not let me sleep at peace , The staff as the reception Extremly Service And very helpful and caring 
80538,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The rooms very warm Also when checking out at 9 45 trying to get from 3rd floor to ground took about 10 mins as lift always full and only one and also used by service users as well We were 15 mins late for an appointment One lift we did not feel was enough especially at busy times Very frustrating, Location and setvice
80539,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room allocated had twin beds which we didn t want so they moved us to a deluxe room for the second night with a double bed There was no tea or cups in the room so had to call house keeping at 7 30a m to get some The bathrooms are very small The room was very hot , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was great for shopping in Oxford Street

80543,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, This is not the best Radisson hotel that I have stayed in I had a single room on the ground floor which although was clean was in need of a makeover the carpet had certainly seen better days I ordered a burger from room service and this was served in a bun that was quite hard and the centre of the burger was only just cooked , As you would expect in a Radisson hotel the staff were all very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them The bed was very comfortable and I had a really good night s sleep Very good location close to Oxford Street 
80544,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Smallest room I ve ever stayed in the room lights came on at 5am the toilet and sink would not flush and drain away and other residents were very noisy , The reception service and location
80545,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room was a bit small also the lights were very dim and not enough space for three people , Great location Stuff was super friendly and helpful to us Whenever we asked for anything service was fast and efficient 
80546,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The lobby is kind of small and the reception counter is always busy , Size of the business room was really good Tube station and Oxford street are near Very quite regardless of the busy location The express check out service was really good 
80547,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Always have to queue for breakfast and most selections had run out at 9 50 only to be filled up at 10 28 when breakfast finishes at 10 30 Disorganised Wish the waiter wasn t constantly eating chewing as he came out of the kitchen , Great location comfortable room
80548,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room was tiny as was the shower cubicle the TV would not turn off and stayed lit all night which meant I hardly got any sleep The breakfast was awful spicy BBQ beans and undercooked scrambled egg and a toaster that took forever ,No Positive
80549,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Breakfast Bacon took a long time to replenish eggs looked watery and inedible Beans were BBQ flavour No black pudding Even presentation of hot food was unappetising so I had continental Was really looking forward to full English Rooms small but adequate However 2 colleagues got very small rooms and one was really noiisy, Location and great staff Back room downstairs so no noise 
80550,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, the room was the size of a shoebox downstairs on its own I felt very under valued as a customer 7am breakfast room not ready and staff excuse was that breakfast was new took 20 minutes to get poached eggs and could not even get my order right did not get even a thank you as I checked out,No Positive
80551,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I was on thr top floor and the ceilings were low I am 5ft 10 getting into the shower with just a couple of inches clearance above head not comfortable , single room bed large and comfy room at back quiet A colleague had room at fromnt and woken by bin lorries 
80552,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Poor room service no replacement for the used amenities like coffee mugs cotton buds Poor cleaning service Horrible smell at the lobby coming from the restaurant at all times Elevator feels like it s falling apart and is very slow When you wait in the lobby for the elevator your clothes will smell the food from the restaurant , Location Reception staff are friendly 
80553,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The bedrooms were nicely furnished and good standard of facilities but the shame is how that is let down by the really grimy carpets , Perfect location excellent service and reasonable value for money 
80554,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The rooms are extremely small The room I had was smaller than a dorm room The width of my room was 6 feet I could literally touch both walls at the same time , It was newly renovated and staff was nice
80555,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, We were put in a tiny room with a miniscule shower room We commented that anyone who was overweight would have trouble moving in the shower room , The central location A beautiful building Very clean Staff very helpful
80556,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I booked a single deluxe room When I entered the room I was very shocked by the size of the room which was like a shoe box There was no closets in the room and the single bed which they said was a queen size bed which took up the entire room and there was hardly any room to move around The bathroom was very tiny and hard to move around For the rates they are charging like 160 pounds 200 pounds per night the rooms are very much disappointing and later I had to pay additional money to upgrade to a bigger room I will not stay in this hotel anymore a the rooms are tiny and they charge way too much for the rooms It was more like a 2 3 star hotel and Radisson brand needs to upgrade the room sizes in this hotel if they want to maintain their standard Very much disappointing , The location was very good in the heart of central London near to shopping sightseeing restaurants underground etc The breakfast was good in the restaurant 
80557,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, If you always wanted to work on a submarine this would suit you The hallway is very small just enough room for myself and my one piece of luggage The room I got was so small it should have been called a cupboard I could reach the ceiling with my palm And had to stop low to get to the door of the room on a half floor The elevator made all sorts of interesting noises and you never knew what it would do Overpriced and aweful I will never use this hotel again and would not recommend it , Location is good 
80558,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, We didn t have any mugs in our room on both mornings , The staff upgraded us to a family room as they didn t have any twin rooms after we d requested one 
80559,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Balcony needs attendance dead plants lying around Crockery were removed and never replaced My complimentary gown disappeared after the second day and was never replaced , Excellent breakfast Lovely room 
80560,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room was tiny But I was in a standard single room so maybe the double rooms were larger , I loved the location of the hotel The staff were super helpful and friendly and made me feel very welcome and comfy the room was clean and the breakfast buffet was very good too When I first arrived they served me fruit infused ice cold water which was amazing arguably one of the best things about the trip D
80561,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The windows They re to poor and the traffic noise becomes really disturbing at night It woke me upp several times , Fantastic service A role model in guest service I must say Everyone really pays attention to every detail and with a very personal touch friendly and personal is most important I had a smile on my face all the time It was a true pleasure Thanks 
80562,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The hotel is quite old the staff though very friendly are not very helpful with the exception of italian Georgina I think that s her name who was great and super helpful during the day The breakfast was very poor the pancakes weren t fresh the avocado if mashed was not avocado but a dip etc At night the room service is awful I had to ask for a cheese sandwich and it was the worst sandwich I ever had in my life It wasn t even a slice of cheese it was a sort of scrambled cheese Almost every day I had to call to ask for toilet paper , Great location just next to Marble Arch A member of the staff called Georgina if I remember right 
80563,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Mini bar is way to expensive not sure if they sell much at 4 50 a beer small can but this is not really a big deal more of a personal preference , Great location fro work or leisure Had everything I needed I liked the fact the business centre was free This was a bonus as I was on conference in London Staff friendly too Nice coffee simple hotel but well organised 
80564,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Single room was tiny Both in terms of width and height I could touch the ceiling with my head I m 6 3 though The bathroom was smaller than my wardrobe at home However it was perfectly fine For one or two nights when you re travelling on business you don t really need more I wouldn t want to spend too much longer there though , Hotel was great location perfect for what we wanted staff very helpful 
80565,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Room a little small and wifi signal weak , staff friendly and helpful marble arch tube station 3 min walk and right off oxford street so close to shopping shows and all train stations 
80566,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex,No Negative, Brilliant location for shopping comfy single room which although wasn t spacious was surprisingly quiet and had everything I needed Great choice at breakfast Friendly staff Will stay there again 
80567,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Booked a twin room but ended up with a double bed and a single sofa bed which made the room very cramped Would have expected better for over 200 a night ,No Positive
80568,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Everything it is very very nice hotel so when they start cleaning you will never be able to sleep rooms are very small that if you are a bit fat you can t fit into the toilet It is one of the worst hotels I stayed in The only positive thing is the location on Oxford street and close to Marble Arch and Bond Stations , With exception of the beautiful receptionist who looks like Cameron Diaz nothing 
80569,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, only one lift was a nuisance at times I slipped and fell in the bath shower as the non slip safety discs were only present underneath the shower itself and I slid and fell on the way in to the shower It wouldn t cost much to make it all safe for slightly balance challenged folk like me, Very comfy beds and pillows Nothing was too much trouble for the staff 
80570,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The rooms are not worth the price not that comfortable noisy look like they are slightly run out not 100 clean But most of all I had a very bad experience at check in with two members of the staff the person at the check in assigned me to a very small room definitely not looking like the standard double room I had booked and paid for but rather a single room single bed hardly any space to open my luggage etc After I complained this person insisted that this was a double room so did his colleague at the reception one of the managers on duty that night The latter even told me you are actually lucky to have got a room in this hotel tonight I had booked 2 months ahead This person was extremely rude to me and the situation was outrageous I was simply sent back to the room it was over 23h by that time and advised to pack up for the next morning in case they could assign me to a different room during the day Fortunately and referring to the positive points the next morning I spoke to another manager who immediately did his best and was able to sort this issue and assign me to a different standard double room , Luckily the majority of the staff except see under negative points was friendly and one of the managers was actually very helpful in handling and sorting the issue I was facing during my stay and provided professional support which I very much appreciated

80600,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, First single room I had was exceptionally small and hard for me to move around in so I did upgrade to a larger room as I was staying 6 nights Was not impressed with the Steak and Lobster restaurant for dinner It seemed odd that that was all you could order at dinner time when the room service menu was much more extensive Coffee was frequently cold at breakfast as they seem to make a number of pots in advance and not to order Ask for a pot of hot coffee and the staff will accommodate One slow elevator for both guests and service personnel is not enough and was quite frustrating at times , Location is hard to beat for access to shopping and the underground Bed was very comfortable and the room very clean and attractive 
80601,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The property is OLD I mean old old Needs to be rebuilt The room size was small and the bathroom had no business being called a bath room I mean one had to hop over the bidet to reach the shower No hooks hangers for used towels either The bed was below normal size I feared rolling over to the floor in my sleep , Generous breakfast good tea coffee facility in the room and location just a few meters from Oxford street one could pop in and put one s feet up every few hours except there was no proper seating in the room only lie in on very small beds

80614,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Misleading pictures on the website and description of facilities etc had been overly dressed up in the overall description We are experienced well mannered travellers and this is the first time I feel compelled to actually write a bad rewiev Will possibly seek legal advise on the whole treatment received , Poor service disgusting food with complimentary hair in it misleading pictures King annex is more like an army barrack than a proper luxury room Wanted lo leave 5 min after arriving In fancy we checked in and out on the same day manager was unavailable to discuss our reasons for wanting to leave and refuse to give us even a partial refund for the7 nights stay that we had previously booked Booking com advided us that despite the contractual agreement with the hotel the manager should offer a refund in special circumstances like ours and he totally refused to even talk to us on the phone Appalling

80642,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Not enough dining room staff for the buffet breakfasts too few staff having to run around like crazy and result is food items constantly running out effectively little to no table service for coffee water etc This in turn causes guests to have to stay at their tables much longer than necessary and in turn causes unnecessary wait times for a table Altogether this causes a lot of time wasted for guests who have to get to business meetings , Great central location near Marble Arch comfortable bed terrific and kind staff

80658,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I think I got the smallest room available The room was in the emergency stairs which seems a bit exaggerated I can understand that you need to optimize space to increase your income but this was much worse than I expected especially for the rate of this hotel Staff was unable to extend one more additional day because the hotel was completely booked Not even my room was available for the day after Breakfast was little under standard I had better at lower star hotels in the outer of London , Location was great for my business meeting Room was clean Staff was professional 
80659,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, I literally think we had the worst room The floor was uneven and we both fell over approx 3 times each The bathroom looked like a converted cupboard it must have been 1 5 mtrs long by 0 5 wide Terrible We had a view of a wall had to side step to get to the other side of the bed as it was about 30cms away from wall Breakfast was a shambles We had to ask 3 people for some coffee no bowls and when I asked a member of staff for one she had no idea what I asked for and had to ask someone else as she couldn t understand me People had to wait for breakfast tables to be cleared as they weren t efficient For just short of 150 a night and 4 stars I expected more from such a reputable brand, Location

80663,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Bathroom too small heating in room is not enough in winter in the corridor too hot , Location excellent staff really helpful breakfast very good Room and bed comfortable 
80664,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, My daughter doesn t like lifts so we used the stairs to go up and down to our fourth floor room which was not a problem However I would not like to be staying in any of the rooms that come off the stairwell as any sounds footsteps travel Also if you were any taller than our 5ft4inch frames it would ve been very difficult to have a shower with the lower ceilings of the fourth floor rooms , The location was perfect for a shopping trip like ours Oxford street was the next street over a short taxi ride to Brompton street Harrods shopping and Sloane Square shopping districts Many restaurants around the streets to dine at Breakfast in the hotel was very filling well presented and freshly made omelets were our go to breakfast The beds were comfortable and warm

80679,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The Steak and Lobster restaurant which is connected to the hotel has extremely limited choice for dinner If you don t feel like either steak or lobster then you need to go out which is not great when pouring rain This was really the only negative part of my stay , The staff were very friendly and accommodating and allowed me a late checkout The room and breakfast were very reasonably priced The room was comfortable and quiet and breakfast had a good selection

80682,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The unavailability of 2 beds room at the day of check in, they upgrade us to business room which was big and awesome but with only 1 bed although I had a reservation with 2 bed Overall it was good experience and the hotel was excellent with helpful friendly staf 
80683,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The only thing not satisfactory was our room it was so small the bed had to be up against the wall my husband had to climb over me everytime he needed the bathroom we had no dressing table and nowhere to put things in the bathroom it felt like a single room, This is our fourth year at this Hotel it is just around the corner from Oxford street great for shopping The gentleman on the desk was very helpful and the breakfasts are very good
80684,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The room size is ridiculously small, The location was very good the staff especially Gamal from the reception is very attentive and organized Also proactive
80685,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Bad Value for money for the single room I had to pay for an upgrade Single room awful size even for single person After paying the upgrade for a Queen sized room the cost was too high for the Hotel At the end you re paying ONLY for the location Very poor variety of breakfast, Staff friendly and helpful Perfect Location Clean rooms bathrooms Free WiFi with strong connection
80686,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Price But too high keeping in mind the facilities and room size, The location of the hotel is perfect Close to metro station and very close to all the shopping ara
80687,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, troubles with checking in we had to change 2 times our room we had a prepaid room and we got a dark small room with view to wall of courtyard with noise from elevator after that we got offered almost the same room after insisting we got final a good room, location near to Oxford street breakfast value for price is good
80688,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, It fronts onto the loading docks of the Oxford street Marks and Spencer so it is noisy very early in the a m and its proximity to Oxford St and it s lack of insulation makes it noisy till 3 a m Some staff are gracious and some are sullen Kinda weird lobby decor and annoying 80 s club music always going, It is super close to great shops and subway Bed was super comfy and shower was great Get a kingsize room 
80689,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Just one thing I missed in my SNG room the fridge , I liked very much the hospitality of the hotel from top manager to all staff of the hotel I was very happy with location And I liked very much breakfast that provides the hotel for its clients 
80690,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Small room but at this price it is normal Honey not tasty but this is a detail and sincerely it is not a criteria of choice so do not worry , Excellent location Very nice personnel helpfull Quiet Very good breakfast
80691,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Whilst there was a hair dryer in the room no 120 there is no power point to plug it into where you can also see yourself in a mirror Another mirror needs to be hung , The hotel is very central but quiet which is a real bonus 
80692,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, The view from my window was ugly the other side of the building I didn t like the cooked breakfast it was stodgy eggs and the bacon was burnt on one side Fridge in room didn t work , I liked the comfortable bed and access to cable TV

80694,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, Dated furniture and smelly corridors there is only one lift and on one occasion even the one lift was not functional The hotel needs a revamp, My stay was made comfortable by Mr Akil Saeed He was always cheerful welcoming and ready to assist with any problem or issue I had during my extended stay of over two weeks The best thing about the hotel is certainly Mr Saeed He needs to pass his customercentric attitude to the rest of the staff 
80695,Radisson Blu Edwardian Sussex, extremely cramped room too small couldnt get chair out from beneith the desk with out lifting over bed not enough room to leave it under the window if you did you couln t open the wardrobe door stayed in larger rooms for less money although nicely decorated too small to walk about in , breakfast excellent staff lovely
