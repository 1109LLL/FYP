250479,Residence Du Roy, Staff wasn t friendly at all Rude and unhelpful in general Not very clean Making the room was closing the beds and putting in new towels they didn t even clean the sink or bathtub , Location was pretty good but I ve had better 
250480,Residence Du Roy, Road traffic noise at night is annoying Even though the hotel is on a street which is not too busy the road noise is bothersome at night if you get a room facing the road I switched to a garden view room and road noise was not an issue there , Best aspect is the excellent location Clean Well maintained Rooms are bigger than average Child friendly Decent breakfast WiFi with reasonable speed Able to stream Netflix Overall a good experience Would stay again 
250481,Residence Du Roy, Hotel is not very near to the Metro station has very old furniture and decoration There was a disgusting smell all over the corridors to the rooms for like 2 days Although I was staying at a suite the room was not very clean I found like 3 spiders throughout my stay We ordered breakfast to our room and it was really bad the omlette tasted bad , Actually nothing in particular its a below average hotel 
250482,Residence Du Roy, If I m splitting hairs the mini bar wasn t cold but this didn t detract from our stay , Extremely comfortable bed clean room and great to have onsite underground parking at 28 not a bad price Perfect suite stay for two adults and my grown up nephews they made the sofa beds up as two singles which was much appreciated even though we didn t request this Nice shower with separate loo it worked really well The guy who helped us with parking didn t get his name sadly was really helpful 
250483,Residence Du Roy, Not a bunch of friendly desk staff Don t they know how to smile When checked in I was informed my booking included breakfast which I knew already when I ve booked in advance Breakfast time location of the room should be informed upon arrival WITHOUT having to ask for that information WiFi is available Had to ask for that information too Not impressed with their service However the Concierge who does not speak English Male housekeeper who does speak English sorry don t know their names were very helpful Thank you Gentlemen We were thirsty on arrival the hotel so had to buy water Shocked to find 4 for a very small bottle of water So over priced so beware Asked for the nearest Supermarket was told the name of the street however not given a good direction Map of the city is not available the desk so be prepared to have the map in hand before travelling to Paris The only reason I would go back to this hotel would be the location of the property , Great location of the property Short walking distance to Eiffel Tower Louvre Museum Champs lys es Didn t use public transport so cannot comment on it Clean comfortable room WiFi worked well in the room Was given a bottle of water after we ve settled in the room I guess the reason was to compensate for having to wait for the key to the room due to the delay at the time of check in 
250484,Residence Du Roy, I did not like that i had to leave , Everything it was the perfect hotel for our stay in paris everything was clean and attended to and the bed was perfectly comfortable and the room was generously spacious and everything was nearby i recommemd this hotel to everyone
250485,Residence Du Roy, staff was not motivated unfriendly everything was difficult Not helpful Room service was very slow One hour 15 min wait for a penne with tomato sauce When we complained everything was our fault On top of that my silk blouse got destroyed by the dry clean Really not the level of other 4 star hotels near by Interior of the hotel and the rooms look old Parking of the hotel is only suitable for a small car which they don t tell you at the time of the booking ,No Positive
250486,Residence Du Roy, Everything, Location During my stay at the hotel I remained without internet complained but no efforts seen TV channels remained out of order Breakfast was the worst and more when you have language barrier Booking com mentioned wrong information that they speak your language 
250487,Residence Du Roy, The A C worked great for the living room and upstairs loft but the master bedroom needed a fan to be fair we didn t ask for a fan and may have been provided one if we had , The staff were very warm and helpful especially in giving tips about sites to visit restaurants and transportation We were given a free upgrade to a family room which was awesome since we were traveling with two adult children and a seven year old The hotel is in a great location for shopping dining and walking to all the main sites 
250488,Residence Du Roy, We booked a suite for 3 ppl there were only slippers shampoo mugs robes etc for only two guests And the internet connection used to disconnect most of the evening night , Super friendly helpful staff The hotel is close to a lot of sights in a beautiful area 
250489,Residence Du Roy, Wifi is very poor There were occasions were all the different room wifis did not work at the same time this happened more than once , Staffs are very nice and considerate When we checked out my daughter left her scarf in the room The hotel staff brought it down to us when we were waiting for taxi 
250490,Residence Du Roy, Internet was slow , Beautiful spacious room s in a wonderful location The Champs d Elysses just steps away Bateous Mouches boats and the river Seine and Eiffel Tower all so close Great staff it was delightful 
250491,Residence Du Roy, The only real complaint is that the wifi went down or was turned off two of the nights we were there and that was our only way of keeping in touch with our family back home so that was frustrating If it was a fault then I m sure it s fixed by now , This hotel was in a great location just a 2 minute walk to The Seine and 15 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower It was about a 5 7 minute walk to the Metro which is a brilliant way to get around The towels and toiletries provided were nice and it has a separate toilet from the bathroom which is handy 
250492,Residence Du Roy, We had only one morning on our stay where the room was not attended to When we brought this up with reception it was taken care of straight away , Fantastic location Having stayed in Paris on prior trips I was impressed at the quality and size of the room We had a lovely garden view that allowed pleasant smells and birdsong to greet us every morning 
250493,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, We love the room One Bedroom Suite with parents with 2 boys is perfect We are impressed with the size of the room that it s pretty big for the area especially in Paris The location is perfect walking distance from Champs Elysees 
250494,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, We love the room There are 4 of us Daddy Mommy and 2 sons with One Bedroom Suite We are impressed with the room size and the layout of the room is very convenient The location is perfect 
250495,Residence Du Roy, The breakfast was 18 euro and did not include very much so we never ate it With the options available this should have been included in the hotel price , The location was great for the hotel to explore most parts of the city including the Eiffel Tower The staff was great and I would recommend this hotel to anyone It is about a 50 60 euro cab ride and about 35 minutes to an hour from each airport so just be aware We really enjoyed our stay here with our two young kids 
250496,Residence Du Roy, The hotel is fine but I doubt it can really qualify to a four star hotel It is more a decent three star hotel maybe only because of its great location it has four stars There should be a better control to the quality of linings , Location is great Staff has been helpful 
250497,Residence Du Roy, Staff are unfriendly and inattentive to customers They told me to change into a room with a kitchen by email but they did not Three staff told me differently whenever I ask It was the worst I ve ever had , 
250498,Residence Du Roy, Nothing all was good , Great hotel in excellent location We got a duplex suite at the top floor which we really liked It was spacious comfortable and clean Breakfast was more than enough We were very satisfied 
250499,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The room with kitchenette was spacious and clean Ideal for our pack of 3 Adults For a family of 4 it will be perfect The hotel is also very central and close to all major attractions Staff very friendly
250500,Residence Du Roy, Breakfast expensive so didn t bother with it No area to hang out other than the room Bar was tiny but we were out most of the time anyway so wasn t really a huge problem , Great location close to champs elysee Seine Bateaux Mouches and eiffel tower and bus stops some restaurants near by a few mins walk away but not lots Comfortable beds Helpful and pleasant staff 
250501,Residence Du Roy, Breakfast was poor couldnt get seated and they ran out of food and would re stock Hardly any choice had to go and get some breakfast elsewhere , Great size room in really good location 
250502,Residence Du Roy, Rooms on street which is very busy Due to temperature had to keep windows open Noise from vehicles speeding past through all hours of night did not enable a good night s rest , The location was great for getting around in Paris Metro nearby 
250503,Residence Du Roy, Cleanliness could be improved, The location is fantastic it s near major attractions of central Paris including champs ilysee street Eiffel Tower seine cruising Also the suite size is very good 
250504,Residence Du Roy, staff is atrentive but gets very busy during check in check out period and at night Metro and grocery markets not that close difficult with lugagges and kids, Big room fit perfectly family of 4 Location fancy area right in the corner of pont Alexander III grand palais and one mile from tour Eiffel
250505,Residence Du Roy, We had separate rooms for the Toilet and bath kinda inconvenient Free Cable TV would have been nice the only english channels are for News at least have Cartoon Network for the kids The Parking entrance is Narrow you need to be a good driver , We had a free upgrade we booked a classic room and was a given a Deluxe room upon check in The Staff was great and courteous The location is perfect walking distance to Champ Elysee and the Metro Bus Stations You can get to the Tourist destinations easy and convenient 
250506,Residence Du Roy, They forgot our breakfast in the room order so us and the kids had to wait 45 minutes for it The made up for it though for not charging for the omelettes , The location is excellent Close to the Eiffel Tower the rover boats and the shops The room was also spacious and even had a terrace if you wanted to go outside 
250507,Residence Du Roy, 1 Internet doesnt working at all in any place at the hotel It possible to connect to wifi but pages doesnt open at all any websites from any devices 2 When the lights turn of in the room then the other room electricity turn of too 3 We need to wait a 10 min outside the hotel several times it was freezing outside before someone open the door to us ,No Positive
250508,Residence Du Roy, The room is too small for family with 3 children and the wifi was bad too , Reception aid me fast when they feeling I an not satisfied about my room and try to give me other room for 3 children dublex with extra cost 
250509,Residence Du Roy, Wifi wasn t working hotel may have offered a discount because the front desk was aware of the situation , Centrally located underground secured parking english TV channels friendly staff balcony adequate heating
250510,Residence Du Roy, Not a lot of choice for breakfast, This hotel was fantastic last minute booking as we had to change hotels couldn t of asked for more rooms were more than big enough for 5 of us 3 adults 2 children one bedroom suite On New Year s Eve we even got a complimentary box of chocolates saying happy new year 
250511,Residence Du Roy, location isn t that near to attractions metro and Christmas Market the breakfast is way too expensive , bed is comfy and the bathroom has nice facilities 
250512,Residence Du Roy, The hi speed internet was great it just cost an additional 15 for a day The English channels are all pretty much news channels which wasn t a huge issue because we weren t in the room all that long every day , I loved so much about the location It was great for us as we had the hop on hop off ticket and the closest stop was at the Grand Palais super short walk away We were there for the Christmas season and the Market was super close as well There were plenty of restaurants nearby and it was still so quiet and peaceful The on site parking garage was great for us we parked the car and forgot about it until it was time to check out It was nice to not have to worry about it The staff was excellent We felt like we truly mattered to everyone we encountered I believe this place set the mood for our entire trip to Paris we cannot wait to go back and stay again The one bedroom was great for our family of four I think it had the best sofa sleeper I ve ever seen and the kids said it was more comfortable than any they had slept on in our many travels 
250513,Residence Du Roy, Definitelly not 4 hotel but We did not mind it , Well located family friendly hotel Helpfull staff 20min walk to eiffel tower louvre notre dame 5min walk to champs ellyses
250514,Residence Du Roy, Nothing, The location is excellent for tourist here to shop It is within walking distance to Champs Elysee and a lane away from the international branded houses of Dior Chanel Gucci etc And you can also walk to the Arc de Triumph n the Eiffel Tower The family room for 4 is very spacious 
250515,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, Location was spectacular Everything was within 20 30 minute walking distance in every direction The staff was extremely friendly even helped us order pizza to be delivered Parking on site was the best 
250516,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, We called last minute to see if parking was available and they were very accommodating and we parked onsite which was very convenient I liked that the bed was big and comfortable with plenty of space Our room was quiet even though we were on the roadside of the building the windows kept most of the sound out Overall our visit was pleasant and the staff were very friendly and quick to assist us 
250517,Residence Du Roy, Pretty much everything was fine by me , The hotel is pretty much at the heard of Paris with many things to do in the close surrounding and tube stations for the rest The room was very comfortable and clean Much bigger than other places in Paris and suitable for families The staff was also very nice and polite The breakfast was suitable with a decent choice Wifi worked fine 
250518,Residence Du Roy, The speed of free wi fi could have been faster , The location is perfect to visit Paris You can walk to most of the sites and enjoy a great night view of the illuminated Eiffel Tower from the bridge near the hotel The neighbourhood is quiet and just 5 minutes from the glamorous Avenue des Champs lys es The room was spacious for a family of four and the beds even the sofa very comfortable It even had a balcony Great value for money We enjoyed our stay very much and we are definitely going to come back again 
250519,Residence Du Roy, The rate too expensive if we compare it whith their services , The staf not smiley The staf very very poor And they gave us feeling like we are animes
250520,Residence Du Roy, There are two elevators only and one of them was not working during our stay The one who took our luggage to the room was annoying he stayed at the room until we give him a tip , Great location 5 mins walk to reach Avenue de champs elysees Clean comfortable rooms
250521,Residence Du Roy, The hairdryer like drying your hair with a vaccum cleaner hose Wifi really slow and in quite a exclusive district so didn t have the local buzz we were after The staff were helpful and competent but not the warm welcome we had experienced in London , Very central location for walking to all the major tourist attractions Room was clean and comfortable
250522,Residence Du Roy, The bathroom and shower were separated Too many alcoholic drinks in the fridge even though they know that a family is coming The breakfast should have been included with the price , Location was excellent The staff was very courteous The hotel was very clean and hospitable Will definitely stay there again 
250523,Residence Du Roy, No decor room Very minimalistic Fridge did not work Bed was not very comfortable Needs more touch and better cleaning service , Location is great Front desk is very nice Size of the room is good and has small balcony 
250524,Residence Du Roy, What I didn t like is that the toilet and bathroom is separate which made things pretty difficult for us, I like the beds as they are really comfy I love the room as the bathroom as well becuz they are really big Also the hotel is located in the right area as I can get everything within few minutes of walk 
250525,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The location was excellent and the room perfect for us 2 adults and an 8 and 10 year old It was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful We will definitely come back 
250526,Residence Du Roy, The hotel is 4 stars but rated I believe in 1990 or 1980 as now in 2016 it would be rated 2 star All rooms facilities are out dated You can see it in the lobby as they still hang the USD French frank conversation rate Our room had the safety deposit box not working and when we complained they said the hotel Manager will come at 5 00 pm They said we can put our stuff in the lobby and have to sign a paper that is in FRENCH saying it s under our responsibility How can it be under our responsibility when the safety deposit box in the room dosent work If you don t mind the above and look for the location only then I would recommend other then that you can find better hotels with better facilities Not booking again , The location only It is in a very good location and nearby main attractions 
250527,Residence Du Roy, Breakfast was a bit pricy but it was very good , The two room sweet was very big and roomy Perfect for three adults and two young children It was very clean and the staff was very helpful and nice we loved that the Eiffel Tower was only a few blocks away from the hotel 
250528,Residence Du Roy, Lack of info on the attractions and the staffs seems to be in a rush all the time and less patient at times, Location is excellemt and room comfortable We got the 2 bedroom apt Lobby seems small for a 4 star hotel though
250529,Residence Du Roy, Furnishings were a bit dated but clean and comfortable enough , Great sized room quiet location but very close to various attractions walking distance to the Eiffel Tower various museums within 1 5 miles or so and restaurants in the area as well are quite good 
250530,Residence Du Roy, Access from underground garage to lobby was blocked and I had to wait for the staff to open the door from inside , Location is fabulous property is nice and clean staff are courteous and helpful Parking is OK 
250531,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, Convenient and well placed within walking distance of most major sights The two room suite was ideal for traveling with children On site parking for a fee definitely made it easier than searching for an overnight lot on street parking 
250532,Residence Du Roy, Mattresss and sofa need updated , Got lucky with a free upgraded room Primo location Huge balcony Huge suite Bath and toilet in separate place is a plus 
250533,Residence Du Roy, WiFi didn t work much of the time and even when connecting to another room it lost signal after a short time , Apart from the WiFi being poor everything about the hotel was brilliant 
250534,Residence Du Roy, the extra bed could seriously be better , We ordered a room with 4 beds The two beds was an extra bed and a sofa It was quite disappointing but other than than I would give a two thumbs up It s clean quiet and pretty close to Arc du Tromphe 
250535,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The whole experience was great Receptionist were friendly bell service very attentive rooms were great and clean The location is just 8 minutes walk to the Champs Elysee and transportation is all across 
250536,Residence Du Roy, There are only a few affordable restaurants beside the hotel , Very peaceful yet near to different tourist spots and shopping areas Accommodating and lovely staff Comfortable bed and big room 
250537,Residence Du Roy, Reception staff was not very friendly I would say there is scope for improvement their , We booked an apartment for four it was great value for for money with all the facilities
250538,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The hotel was in a fab location close to the champs elys es and in walking distance of the Eiffel Tower The room was very clean with a good facilities 
250539,Residence Du Roy, WIFI not fast and get interrupted from time to time Air conditioning was not cold enough P S You have to walk about 10 minutes to find supermarkets and boulangeries Walking about 7 8 min to Metro station , Nice stuff exceptional location 
250540,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, It s a very nice hotel the location is near by the Triomphe des arcs ard 10mins by walk I will chose this hotel when I m in Paris next time 
250541,Residence Du Roy, The hair dryer is dusty and the head is broken The bed in the living room is flimsy and not very comfortable , Location We could walk to most of the attractions 
250542,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The location is perfect and close to everything The studio was good to accomdate my family 2 adults plus two kids and baby the bed and sofa bed were comfortable no noise it was very quiet the hotel staff were very nice and very cooperative 
250543,Residence Du Roy, Stayed a few nights and would have liked replacement toiletries shampoo shower gel as only got some on the first day which ran out quickly , Location was amazing and the room size was better than expected I ve previously stated in Paris and always found the rooms really small so was very pleasantly surprised 
250544,Residence Du Roy, My room smelled strongly to cigarretes even though it was supposed to be non smoking Aditionally it was facing the street which doesn t have a heavy traffic but the lack of isolation makes you hear each and every car passing by I realize that hotels in Paris are expensive but in my view you can find better value for money I was told the first day that the hotel was fulI so I did not try to change rooms I just lived with it , The location is very good to visit Paris The rooms are not big but with enough space and cozy and the staff is friendly I didn t have breakfast at the hotel can t value that part 
250545,Residence Du Roy, Expensive breakfast is not included in price but this is often the case in Paris , Excellent beds as well in the classic room as in the large suite Friendly and professional service Situated close to the Seine and Grand Palais
250546,Residence Du Roy, Although it did not cause much of a problem it was hard to block out the light in the room so sleeping in was not really an option , We were 4 people in a one bedroom suite comfortable and clean Hotel was well located just outside of the hustle and bustle which was a short walk away 
250547,Residence Du Roy, The breakfast buffet was a bit light for the price we paid , We had trouble finding entrance to the one way street to put us in the right area of the hotel The man who worked until 2am came with my daughter and I by foot to find our car and show us the way He was very kind and went above and beyond what I expected from the hotel staff Super customer service 
250548,Residence Du Roy, Fooled into breakfast From the checkin time it appeared breakfast was included but it was not and it cost 18 euros per person Breakfast was not worth 18 euros Electricity was out for about 30 minutes which caused issues , Location and staff very attentive 
250549,Residence Du Roy, Restaurants around the Champs Elysees were on the expensive side but we found that if we crossed the Seine to the other side of the river there was a good choice of cafes and restaurants on Rue Sainte Dominique a pleasant10 15 minute walk away from the hotel , Hotel room was a great size for 3 people I travelled with my Mum and my daughter We had a one bedroom suite with 2 single beds and a comfortable sofa bed Lovely bathroom and separate toilet Very central location for many of the main attractions in Paris Staff were helpful and friendly 
250550,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, We had a baby and one with special needs autism in our company Staff was friendly and relaxing which is rare in big cities We were late to book it was not cheap But we do not regret ladies in reception and Jacque were so sincere 
250551,Residence Du Roy, Coffee wasn t re stocked for the second morning Second bed was a little small yet still comfortable , Great location nice and quiet yet close to everything Very clean The staff were very friendly and helpful Nice personal touch with the hand written welcome card 
250552,Residence Du Roy, Soft furnishings had been upgraded but decor and hard furnishings were worn Bathroom fittings needed replacing Breakfast limited and not worth the price, Upgraded to a suite as hotel was quiet lovely to have extra rooms and facilities as it was a special birthday trip Biggest room we have ever had in Paris 
250553,Residence Du Roy, The wifi was a bit awkward to use No milk in the room for tea making but the hotel supplied it when we asked and they didn t replenish stocks each day Minor quibbles , Good location central but quiet Bed was very comfortable We were upgraded to a suite without any additional charge to celebrate my wife s birthday and were presented with a chilled bottle of champagne Nice 
250554,Residence Du Roy, 1 I booked junior suite with a kitchen as found in the Declaration of booking com when I arrived and I entered the the suite There was no kitchen and Microwave just water heater which has an exciting story kettle 2 when I started to use the kettle after a minute all suite shutdown no electricity when i asked reception help they sent guy he said it s your fault you put a lot of water in kettle i was surprised hahahaha any way he fixed the problem 3 the worst wifi as usual for good wifi 8 hour 4 the bathroom frozen you can not take a shower hahahaha under zero degree sure 5 Parking don t think about it if you have SUV 6 refrigerator it has fungus inside lol i paid more than 250 night Worst hotel inhabited since my visit to Europe and France in particular during the year, nothing
250555,Residence Du Roy, Staff polite but not friendly just doing their job Room is outdated Was charged 50 EUR extra at check out without any reasons Had to argue with reception staff to have it corrected, The hotel is situated in a prime location in Paris within walking distance to most attractions 5 minutes walk to the champs elysee The family suite is spacious
250556,Residence Du Roy, Bed was not made the second day shortage of coffee and no milk The staff could of been a bit more helpful , Location and the room layout was good and the beds were comfortable 
250557,Residence Du Roy, rooms and building need renovation limited hotel service , unimposing location within 10 min walking distance to L Arc de Triomphe good price for a large room junior full suite 
250558,Residence Du Roy,No Negative, The location was very convenient to all the major sights The room and especially the bathroom was adequately heated The staff at the front desk were very helpful 
250559,Residence Du Roy, At the front desk there was one person that was really not helpful she even told me I should not have booked through your site and that was why the room was not ready for the early check in I had asked for She had us waiting for 15 mintutes at the reception to know if the room was ready There was another person with her and she knew I had a business meeting to go to but I needed to change clothes before I had just travelled There was a third person there the groom He got impatient for us and just opened a door and told the person at the reception the room was not ready yes our bedroom was just next to the front desk but the woman there did want us to sit there and wait made me really upset I had to get changed in the restaurant next to the fron desk where other people where waiting too My problem is that she should have just done her job and go check for me as our bedroom was just next to the front desk I lost 15 minutes and was late to my business meeting On the other hand another person at the front desk manager was very kind and gave us a discount for the discomfort in the end of the stay I have mixed feelings about this hotel , The location is very good just next to my business meetings and very central 
250560,Residence Du Roy, nothing really to complain about , nicely appointed room great bathroom very good hot water comfortable beds Quiet neighbourhood Situated in the middle between the Lovre and the Eiffel Tower 
250561,Residence Du Roy, We were travelling with our children 12 and 16 and friends I paid for an apartment for our family and a double room for our friends a couple First night when we arrived the staff of the hotel tried to cheat on us saying that since the apartment is very big they put us all together in it and if we don t like it they give us an additional room on the next day When we said that we paid for a room apartment they answered that the hotel is fully booked and they can t find a room already paid by us It was 9 pm and the staff didn t want to help us at all They kept saying us for an hour that this is the situation and we had to deal with it , Location and comford
