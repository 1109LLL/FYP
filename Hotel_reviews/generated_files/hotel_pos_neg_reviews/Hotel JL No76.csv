348693,Hotel JL No76, We have booked a quadruple apartment It was ok for us but there was no window in fact because the room was in the basement For same people this could be a little claustrophobic , The location is perfect The staff is very friendly Our family was able to stay together in the same apartment what was very convenient

348697,Hotel JL No76, Nothing to say , Great location and comfortable hotel It s proximity to the museums and public transport is exceptional The restaurant on the property was a bonus particularly when we arrived not knowing the area TWO chairs and windows that could be opened added to our comfort The honour system for coffee and drinks was utilized and appreciated 
348698,Hotel JL No76, Arrived with baggage really no assistance offered with bags by reception staff and elevator is small so somewhat difficult , Good location on quite street close to museums park public transit Lounge dining and back patio very nice Nicely appointed room

348700,Hotel JL No76, Our room smelled of sewer whenever we tried to turn on the fan or A C Since it was very hot compared to where we had come from this was pretty terrible We finally figured out how to open and lock the windows we were in a basement room with ground level access so did not want to leave them accessible When we called about the smell they said they would check into it but nothing seemed to change so we just turned off the system ,No Positive
348701,Hotel JL No76, Bit of a walk to the centre square but public transport is close and easy to use , Only stayed the one night unfortunately but would definitely return Can t complain rooms were very clean and staff were very friendly Particularly enjoyed the jacuzzi bath 
348702,Hotel JL No76, Room was not clean when we arrived Stayed 2 nights and room was not cleaned Had to ask for towels No tissues at all Played cards downstairs and tables were dirty Our friends had a similar experience in their room They had four empty tissue boxes but no tissues , Thomas at the desk was amazing Thought of extras to help our stay be nice

348704,Hotel JL No76, Nothing , The Hotel was fantastic Incredible location just a block from the Van Gogh and Rijks Museums When we asked the staff for dinner recommendations both the places that they recommended where close to the hotel and the food was fantastic The staff was always ready to help in giving us information about the best ways to get around town which bus or tram to take etc They also check on our taxi for our trip to the airport the night before we left 
348705,Hotel JL No76, Usual check in from 3pm we left bags with reception but after coming in to Amsterdam after 4 hr train journey and arriving at Hotel around 2 30 would have been nice to have settled in to the room staff, Staff friendly very clean slightly up market at the end of a long trip it was worth the extra that we paid 
348706,Hotel JL No76, The A C was a bit noisy and some instructions how to set it would have been good , Nice and quiet good location near the museum area Bed was fine and breakfast good with all needed Only missing gluten and lactose free options that reception promised would be available day one but staff managed to get it for day 2 and there was plenty of other food so it was ok The interior style felt personal and out of the ordinary 
348707,Hotel JL No76, No complaints what so ever , The staff was fantastic We arrived early in the morning with a 3pm check in The staff held our bags so we could explore in a locked room very safe Also for dinner they recommended and searched out a restaurant after discussing with us what we were looking for and then booked the reservation good and service at restaurant was wonderful 
348708,Hotel JL No76, Bed mattress and pillows are too soft Light in the bathroom can be a bit brighter , Location convenient safe and quiet Staff making the hotel like home The free drinks in the lobby a smart way to invite guests to social in the lobby instead of sticking to the respective rooms It s cozy and warm Not feel like being in a hotel at all 
348709,Hotel JL No76, The sink area was next to the door to the room The toilet and shower were in a separate room and the door opened into the storage area doors Also the bathroom was covered in slate and made the bathroom very dark Floor in toilet area got wet when you showered , Very helpful staff Fabulous location just a couple of blocks from Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums Very good breakfast 
348710,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Good location to art museums and the tram system Could walk to most tourist sections of the city The hotel staff was attentive and gave good suggestions for places to eat around the hotel 
348711,Hotel JL No76, Being in the basement was fairly noisy and would have preferred to have been on a higher floor was woken up early from workers etc , Room was lovely spacious very clean and comfortable Staff we re helpful and pleasant bar one lady but as the others were so helpful will oversee that Location fab close to shops and I Amsterdam sign 
348712,Hotel JL No76, We only stayed 3 nights so the lack of reachable storage did not inconvenience us too much If we were staying longer we would have wanted to unpack but almost all of the storage space was reachable only by standing on a chair , The room was modern and tastefully decorated and the bed linens are comfortable Our bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub which we did not use and a modern stall shower of glass The fixtures are great a rain shower head and a neat hand held sprayer There is adequate room for cosmetic items in the sink area which is outside of the bathroom The staff is extremely helpful There is a nice outdoor space in the back of the hotel The neighborhood is lovely and safe and is within walking distance to the Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum as well as tram bus service and upscale shops The Seafood Bar restaurant just around the corner serves excellent food at reasonable prices and around another corner is Blushing also affordable we enjoyed our breakfast there 
348713,Hotel JL No76, At the price they might provide a box of tissues in the rooms just a minor quibble , Excellent helpful friendly staff Quiet yet ideal location Stylish d cor 
348714,Hotel JL No76, With deep regret I must report we had a pair of jeans stolen or accidentally went missing from our room The hotel policy states it does not take responsibility of items that go missing from the room The only explanation offered was we must have left the door open We know this not to be true or to be so careless insult to injury really A four star hotel should guarantee safety and security to go along with the glossy attractive brochure and friendly accommodating staff We have been overpowered uncompensated and now out of pocket disgusted and disheartened not an ideal situation to end a great week in Amsterdam We do not recommend this hotel , It was close to the city 
348715,Hotel JL No76, a lot of brand stores around but not many places to have dinner in the evening The bed was a bit too soft , The personnel was very warm and helpful attitude towards guests is fantastic The room itself is not too big but bathroom is big has both shower and bathtab with built in the wall TV Just a few min walk to the boat station so you have a change to take a boat tour even if you arrive quite late 
348716,Hotel JL No76, Breakfast could have been much better for the Price of 20 Euros Perhaps 2 Cooks are better if the current one can only Keep up with 2 orders several People left since the buffet was half empty at 10am The HD Ready 22in tv in our Junior Suite upgrade was hmmm tiny Full or UHD with at least a 42in was expected especially at the distance from the bed Take care of this and it s a fantastic hotel, We stayed at another hotel Romoer after given an upgrade The was hotel was located Close to Trams The room was very clean and spacey with a huge comfy bed Awesome Whirlpool 
348717,Hotel JL No76, Rooms are tiny but I guess it s all the same in Amsterdam , This hotel is just the best place to be close to the Van Gogh Museum or to the Rijksmuseum and it is only 20 mn away from the Central Station by tram Staff is nice and helpful and there are great restaurant around Moreover it is in the center but not where all the tourists are so quietful and ccharming 
348718,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Boutique style hotel great location close to the important Amsterdam museums easy access to tram Rich breakfast buffet friendly staff and honesty bar Comfortable beds 
348719,Hotel JL No76, Basement room next to the cleaners cupboard so we were woken at 8 30 but banging and crashing coming from there , Smart clean hotel friendly staff and good location
348720,Hotel JL No76, There was a problem with the bill and all the accountability was placed on our shoulders Not very helpful Very stubborn Hard to come to a compromise Beware of being double billed , Great location 
348721,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Room with jacuzzi and tv in front of it location of hotel is amazing But the most impressive thing that makes me wanna go back is customer service of hotel personel Especially manager young Man that was there was the most helping and friendly guy I have ever met in hotels 
348722,Hotel JL No76, We didn t get it so I can t say if it was worth the money or not it very well may have been but breakfast seemed too expensive I live in europe so I m not being a super cheap American tourist here with extremely good and less expensive options nearby , Excellent and friendly staff were the first experience but my personal favorite value for the hotel is the location it s both extremely close to two world class museums I didn t visit the modern art museum this trip so possibly 3 and in a very quiet and safe area Amsterdam is amazing but the tourists can be a bit much after awhile so it was absolutely wonderful to walk back to the hotel on a quiet and peaceful street with gorgeous architecture on both sides Absolutely lovely 
348723,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, We loved this hotel Quiet location but near the Tram and many shops restaurants Very comfortable and clean spacious room Have one 110 outlet was convenient 
348724,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Everything is great about this hotel Staff are friendly and the Nespresso machine in the bedroom is now a must have in anywhere I m looking to stay 
348725,Hotel JL No76, There really wasn t anything we didn t like , This was a surprise trip for my boyfriend s 40th birthday and also celebrating 11 years together I had requested for a bottle of cava and cake to be in the room upon arrival and as we checked in they upgraded us to a nice room and when we got to the room they had decorated it with balloons as well as made sure the cava was Cold and the brownie cake with ice cream was ready to eat They gave us great recommendations on restaurants and must see places during out 2 day visit the staff was great so friendly and service minded The room was decent size with plenty of space and the bathroom had a bubble bath Jacuzzi style bathtub The bed was really comfy I mean REALLY comfy wished we could have taken the bed with us home lol There was robe slippers and toiletries and a Nespresso machine The breakfast was good too small buffet but you find pretty much Everything you want on it and the also have a small a la carte menu which is included in the buffet as well The location is really good super close to museums the Iamsterdam sign and there s trams and buses just one block away from the hotel very convenient if you don t want to walk pretty much everything about the hotel and our stay was great 
348726,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Beds are the best I ve stayed here 3 times never fails to impress They have a jacuzzi bath with a tv in some English channels too I watched Family Guy in the bath with bubbles They have an honesty bar and the staff are really helpful and friendly can t wait to go again 
348727,Hotel JL No76, The only thing we found bad was that there were hairs in the bath having said this We did put the hotel under pressure by arriving early it was unusual to have the sink in the bedroom hallway area beside the entrance door as this meant there was no bathroom mirror or sink Anyone who would like a bit of privacy from their travel companion while having the use of a sink would be inconvenienced The bath was perfect but when using the shower the water went through the screen and flooded the bathroom these are minor details but I imagine some would be disappointed paying a higher price during the high season and receiving facilities that you know are a smudge under what the hotel is truly capable , The staff couldn t have been any more helpful Ask a question and you got a really helpful answer Ask for a suggestion where to eat and you left with suggestions from the manager and a map detailing restaurant locations The staff are what really make this hotel what it is without them the experience would have not been anywhere near as good The location is perfect for a couple who want to experience everything Amsterdam has to offer and at the end of the day retreat to a nice relaxed area of the city where a good nights sleep is assured By no means is it far from the centre The number 16 tram stops just by the hotel and goes all the way to central station passing a number of areas of interest 
348728,Hotel JL No76, Wifi dropped out occasionally Beds a bit saggy Bathroom VERY small and bathroom basin outside bathroom , You can make tea and coffee in your room but need your own milk Position is very good if you want to be in the museum district Trams nearby You can buy tea coffee alcohol etc downstairs on an honesty system Staff are friendly and helpful 
348729,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Bathroom was fantastic great sized bed helpful staff and very clean Location only a 5 10 minute walk from the main part of the city Would use again upon return great value for money 
348730,Hotel JL No76, The room was a bit small and it had 2 single beds put together I prefer either a queen bed or a king bed But other than that it was very comfortable , The location was perfect very close to all the museums popular hang outs shops etc I will definitely recommend this hotel It is very central The honesty bar was also nice we could sit in the lounge and enjoy some drinks or coffee Thomas and Andre were fantastic Very helpful and so funny They gave us directions advised in which restaurants to eat at and also booked some tours for us They were great 
348731,Hotel JL No76, We were overcharged The amount invoiced to us versus the amount taken from our account was very different The hotel was also not willing to admit this or refund us , If you are staying here ensure to book an executive deluxe room for size and comfort 
348732,Hotel JL No76, Pillows were way too flat and became uncomfortable when stacking two together Wish they re could ve been more vegan options at breakfast time , Staff were very friendly all around Andre and Thomas were very welcoming helpful and funny to talk to Room was clean spacious and facilities were good Good walking location to everything Very quiet 
348733,Hotel JL No76, I could get the jaccuzi to work but maybe it is me and not a technical failure , Got an upgrade it was very nice the room was cozy and comfortable The location is good to explore the city 
348734,Hotel JL No76, nothing really all was perfect, The friendliness and patience of the staff The personal touches ambiance The location of the place right behind the PC Hooftstraat and a 5 minute walk from the Musea 
348735,Hotel JL No76, The thrumming deep noise in the rooms all night was dusturbing The matresses felt worn and not just soft , The concept of the honesty bar is quite nice The welcome chocolates were appreciated The staff was friendly and tried to help 
348736,Hotel JL No76, When checking in they tried up sell the twin room we had already booked for 20 euros per night extra We were told our twin room booking through the website was a request so we should be thankful they accommodated us The room was on the ground floor next to the lift and entrance to the hotel so we were woken repeatedly between midnight and 7am due to the noise We we requested to move but were told that was only possible if we paid 20 euros more and they only had double rooms It was disappointing that no efforts were made to resolve the issue and instead the only suggestion given was to pay 20 euros more to move to another room Whilst they were happy to accept 20 euros more per night when we asked to be compensated for the noise we were told the rate is fixed as the booking was made through booking com , Location was good next to the museums

348742,Hotel JL No76, Honestly it was perfect , I loved everything It was gorgeous the whole room was spotless and just beautiful It was much more roomie than some of the other places we had stay in Europe The gentleman at the desk was SO friendly warm and helpful So was all the staff we ran into A truely great experience I would suggest this place to anyone and everyone It was also in convenient walking distance to everything we wanted to see They even had their own bike rentals

348744,Hotel JL No76, Nothing to mention here, The room was spacious comfortable and nicely decorated The best thing however is the bed it is a very comfortable boxspring 
348745,Hotel JL No76, The reception when we first arrived We had to wait outside and ended up knocking on a window to get inside then felt like we were disturbing them from whatever they were doing in the side room by the reception Almost made us want to leave , Location and the staff and cleaners Nice quiet room Really the difference was the staff on duty After the first evening we were doubtful but the other staff were truly exceptional and made our stay that much better Every day we bumped into cleaners and they were so kind and friendly 
348746,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, This hotel is well run Flexible with the bookings allowed an early check in to a upgraded room at a very reasonable price or the alternative is to store your baggage The hotel has a restaurant and room service if required Location is very handy to the major museums of Amsterdam one block from Van Gogh Stedelijk Museums and 2 blocks from the Reijks Museum One block to the high fashion shopping street Trams and buses available to take you into the old Amsterdam Rooms are comfortable and clean The staff are extremely helpful friendly and knowledgeable with great recommendations of local cafe s and restaurants A very enjoyable experience

348758,Hotel JL No76, The street was under construction so it was difficult to get in and out of the hotel We paid for an executive room and paid extra for breakfast up front prior to traveling We confirmed that the room was paid when we checked in however in checking out there was an additional charge for the room The explanation was that the weekend rate was higher and we owed an extra 50 Euro because we were there one day on the weekend They refused to honor our confirmed paid rate , Location was a plus and the staff was very friendly and helpful

348772,Hotel JL No76, The oddest thing about this wonderful hotel is that all three nights we were there I needed to call down and ask for clean coffee cups and supplies Not sure why providing clean coffee cups when they provide both a mini expresso maker and hot water kettle isn t part of the usual housecleaning protocol But this little annoyance wouldn t stop me from staying there again , The room was very comfortable and the staff very attentive Quiet location and wonderful amenities Just minutes away from the Rijks and Van Gogh Museum s and a tram stop Worth the splurge

348793,Hotel JL No76, Unfortunately when I put the jacuzzi bath on black dirt spurted out of the holes which was a bit off putting Also the double bed was two singles pushed together which was a bit disappointing as I had booked a double room expecting a proper double bed and fell down the crack a bit during the night however it was very comfortable non the less , Lovely bedroom with great decor and facilities Gorgeous area very quiet and cultural 
348794,Hotel JL No76, Nothing at all , The reception staff were very welcoming and informative I booked a twin room for myself and grown up daughter it was very spacious with a fabulous bathroom the jacuzzi bath being the star The hand basin was actually in the main room unusual but it was OK Everywhere was very clean and decorated in a contemporary style Excellent choice for breakfast hot and cold buffet on offer with delicious local bread too The hotel is in a very quiet street right by the main museums yet very easy to access all of the city either by walking or by tram I would stay here again without hesitation 
348795,Hotel JL No76, Two single beds pushed together is not a king size double , Staff could not be more helpful and friendly breakfast was great room good size and spotlessly clean 
348796,Hotel JL No76, We got the room in the lower growing floor which is only get tiny little window would prefer more bigger window on the different floor, The location is spot on to the museum we like
348797,Hotel JL No76, Cleanliness is not their best feature There were days when we found the trash still in the room in the evening or the towels though clean had some stains and a grayish colour Staff is very unequal some are extremely kind others however wouldn t even bother to open the door for you they would look the other way on purpose the entrance door is locked and you have to use your key unless someone at reception presses a button Bathrobes have seen better days Also better have your own soap and shampoo they are not very generous with that Beware of the bathtub if you are not very fit it s hard to get out it is deep and slippery , The hotel is very well located within the museum area much more pleasant and quiet than the very central one One can get there however by foot or tram very fast Rooms are pleasant but nothing special They have Nespresso and tea machines in every room Breakfast is good so are the dishes you can order during the day evening in the lobby They have coffee and lemonade all day long 
348798,Hotel JL No76, The pillows are quite big even the small ones One might consider introducing thinner pillows The breakfast could be a bit more varied and with more choices given the price , This was my second visit to this hotel and I again loved it The location and rooms are excellent and in the night it is quiet The staff is very friendly 
348799,Hotel JL No76, The only thing I would say is the Hotel restaurant menu didn t really interest us much not much on there to shout home about but to be honest with you the Hotel is in such a great location for some really good breakfast spots that its not worth eating at the Hotel anyway so I wouldn t bother getting breakfast But I must stress this is personal preference not a negative at all , This Hotel is a real gem in a great location for getting to everything you need in Amsterdam A short walk 2mins to the main Museums and a 10 15min walk to the main city centre you could also jump on a tram which is very close to the hotel too but why when you can soak up the beautiful city of Amsterdam The hotel is a 30min bus ride from the hotel the bus drops you literally outside the Hotel very easy to find and removes the stress of getting to the airport I imagine a Taxi would be pretty cheap too but the bus was like 5 euros Its also a 10min walk to the lovely area of Pjip where you can find some really good brunch and eat out places We upgraded to the bigger room which was definitely worth doing the room was one of the best rooms that we ve stayed in with everything that we needed The bed was really comfortable and it was 1 double bed not 2 singles put together like many other hotels We did t watch the TV much but it was nice that there were channels in english The staff were brilliant too very attentive and quick to respond when we had a minor issue with our safe not working I would definitely stay in this hotel again because of the location and the sheer quality of the rooms 
348800,Hotel JL No76, The water pipes providing water in the bathtub must be dirty Some dirt came out when filling the tub , Breakfast was excellent room and service were excellent Location is outstanding 
348801,Hotel JL No76, Nothing comes to mind except a rather slow speed internet connection that is being sorted , Friendly staff well positioned for museums exclusive shops and interesting areas such as Pijp Lovely spa bath with built in TV and full range of facilities you d expect from a four star boutique hotel 
348802,Hotel JL No76, I think my only complaint is the hotel is located across the street from a preschool so the kids were quite loud in the morning when they were outside Also noise is a bit loud through the walls you can hear people open and close their hotel doors down the hall but it wasn t a huge deal , My husband and I booked a 10 day European honeymoon and our three night stay at JL 76 was our last stop where we planned to do less and just relax And what a perfect place to do just that Right upon arrival Kate helped us check in and even upgraded our room for us She was so helpful in giving us tips on getting around Amsterdam The room was spacious incredibly clean and had an amazing soaking jacuzzi tub Anything we needed they took care of Room service was amazing as was breakfast Location was perfect and right on the tram line so we were able to see the whole city at ease When we return to Amsterdam we will absolutely be back to this hotel 
348803,Hotel JL No76, Watch out for the authorisation charges when booking this hotel as the reservation makes no mention of such charges Nor do the staff inform you that they will be taking three separate charges from your account before you even pay the total cost of your stay Terrible service for a hotel which boasts 4 stars ,No Positive
348804,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, The staff were beyond helpful A map was accompanied by a talk about nearby areas the best restaurants according to our tastes and what not to miss The night porter booked our dinner reservation the reception staff booked our taxi to the airport everything was immaculate and the Jacuzzi bath was the dream Highly recommend to everyone 
348805,Hotel JL No76, Some marks on the hotel wall caused by previous guests could have done with a wipe over or new paint Requested a double room but got twin beds which were easily moved together 2cm apart to create a big double bed but would have preferred double bed , Excellent location and so close to all the main points of interest Staff were helpful in recommending other places to visit room was good bathroom whirlpool bath was amazing hotel was very modern and reception always staffed and friendly Good AC system in the room Room was spacious and modern 
348806,Hotel JL No76, I only wish breakfast was included for the price you pay for the room , Everything was clean comfortable and in excellent condition Staff was friendly and helpful 
348807,Hotel JL No76, High sided bath people on the small side could have issues maybe a step to get in and out would be helpful , Really comfortable and clean Great nights sleep not disturbed by any noise Staff so friendly and helpful Breakfast good and plentiful Liked much of the artwork especially the painting of the bird at door to lift is it for sale Looking forward to our next visit 
348808,Hotel JL No76, Nothing I can t fault our stay I would highly recommend to anyone especially for a short stay as a brilliant location to everything , The staff were so helpful it was clean and looked after
348809,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, We had a little issue with the jacuzzi but the service was excellent and they gave us both a free breakfast for the inconvenience couldn t have been more delighted Would definitely recommend it to my closest friends 
348810,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, In the museum district Van Gogh Rijksmuseum on your doorstep Easy to walk to the city centre plenty of access to handy trams buses 
348811,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, A great welcome from beginning to end Extremely comfy bed loved the tv in the bathroom Delicious breakfast Right in the door step for the big museums and the team to Central station Helemaal echt gezellig 
348812,Hotel JL No76, Room slightly small Nowhere to hang a dress only skirts trousers and shirts , Staff very friendly and helpful Excellent location for the museums and easy to reach the centre of town on foot or by tram Would stay there again Did not try the breakfast 
348813,Hotel JL No76, My only complaint is that the people above me were loud late into the night I was already struggling with jet lag and a nine hour time difference I think it was really the building which allowed for any noise from above to sound loud The front desk gave me some great ear plugs problem solved , I was upgraded to a sister hotel nearby as soon as I arrived I was told due to the room that was available being a basement room I was sent to Hotel Roemer The room at this hotel was excellent roomy nicely decorated comfortable 
348814,Hotel JL No76, Cramped bathroom but it s a hotel adapted from an old house so to be expected Rooms would be more spacious in a hotel in one of the chains but I prefer these charming old places , Nice breakfast Near museums and upscale shopping although I didn t do either 
348815,Hotel JL No76, Bathroom was a bit smelly A bit noisy on the basement floor Even though you put do not disturb sign and also say no cleaning to the staff they still go into the room and do the cleaning , Very good location Staff is good Bathtub with bubbles and TV Quite spacious Bed big and clean 
348816,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, The staff all of them spoke good English and helpful All the Receptionists gave us a good impression always going the extra mile to ensure we were assisted to our satisfaction The breakfast was good although it was the same everyday which can be boring in a way Maybe they can change the menu once in a while There is a nice sitting area where coffee is available on the ground floor The Hotel depends on the honesty of the Guests to pay for the drinks which is a cool thing It is close to all the sights Rijksmuseum Van Gough food etc and if you take UberX from the central station But you can easily take the tram to get there for Euro 2 90 With Uber it only cost you EURO 17 or less Location is fantastic as the Airport Express Bus is within 5 minutes walk from the Hotel It is the Rijksmuseum stop for both the Tram and the Airport Express 
348817,Hotel JL No76, service, The room has problem with sound from the pipe line in the building i could not sleep called the stuff to fix was waiting for a long time to change the room even the first day i booked the hotel and mentioned i will check in earlier then instead there is no room for me and i had to pay to update enable to have a room earlier then second day i changed the room the air exhaust is very loud could not bare it over all there is a lot of problem in the building and stuff was late for everything
348818,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, My girlfriend and I stayed here for five days from Jan 1 to 6 We love Hotel JL76 A LOT Staffs here are all very friendly and helpful The location of the hotel is ideal for people who love museums Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are just few minutes away The hotel Room is very cozy we love its massage bath tub especially after a whole day activity outside Definitely will come back again and recommend to friends 
348819,Hotel JL No76, Only fault I have is the buffet breakfast and some of their hot dishes We found that some of the hot items were missing at times and not refilled and others like the scrambled eggs were left to cook to a solid brick consistency I am a picky person with food so others might find it not so A really minor thing for a great boutique hotel , Location of the hotel was ideal So easy to walk to everything We had room 101 and it was a great size and the bed was so comfortable Room had everything we needed and the free wi fi was great Really liked the foyer and the honor bar they had set up Staff were very polite and very helpful 
348820,Hotel JL No76, Nothing , Perfect location super friendly and very helpful staff very welcoming beautiful contemporary interior beds to die for and delicious breakfasts Absolutely nothing to fault Brilliant value for money very much looking forward to revisiting 
348821,Hotel JL No76, Reception staff were generally very helpful we left a case before and after our one night stay However when we arrived for check in at about 1630 there was a short delay and cleaning staff were clearly only just finishing their day s work Unfortunately we were given keys and the number written on the key card was for an already occupied room We couldn t gain access of course but it was embarrasssing and a further delay , The location in the museum quarter matched our Concertgebauw booking precisely and enabled us to take in the Rijksmuseum on the same day yes open on a Monday Breakfast was good quality and service efficient We had an Executive Room and the bed and the spa bath met our expectations Via Trip Advisor we found the Seafood Bar which is close by and the meal before the concert was superb 
348822,Hotel JL No76, Not a criticism but worth noting As our room was in the basement we were not able to get a connection to the free wi fi If you really need wi fi ask for a room above ground , Situated within minutes of the museum quarter and Leidseplein Square which has excellent transport links this hotel is the ideal base to explore the city There are stops for both the hop on hop off boat and bus tours in easy walking distance too and Centraal Station is approximately 40 minutes away on foot We were able to check in our bags before 3pm and to also store them after checkout on our last day which really helped us make the most of our four day break The room was beautifully clean and spacious with a large power shower mini bar widescreen TV controllable heating a huge bed a safe and plenty of storage space The complimentary toiletries and tea and coffee making facilities were first rate It was my birthday during our stay and the staff really went the extra mile to help me celebrate presenting me with a personalised decorated Dutch pancake at breakfast and a lovely gift of caramelised waffles Breakfast is 18 Euros if you book the night before but it s so plentiful and delicious it represents excellent value We didn t eat again afterwards for nearly 9 hours I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to book again The staff in particular are truly kind and welcoming 
348823,Hotel JL No76, We were given a room in the cellar or 1 as it was called This meant basically no day light The narrow window facing a back yard was not properly sealed so quite a draught Also we were first given a double douvet and unfortunately also a double bed However we managed to get an extra douvet and the bed was large enough for two friends Because we only stayed 2 nights we let this pass Charging your credit card for 1 night plus 50 EUR is rather heavy too but the reserveration was gone when I returned home , Excellent location very close to museums and shopping Staff was very helpful breakfast good 
348824,Hotel JL No76, The room was big and confortable but the bathroom was small The toilette and shower were separated from the sink which is awkward by itself but add on that the toilette shower space was really small and uncomfortable to move around , The location is great just a block away from Museumplein Staff was really nice and since we booked way in advance we got a great price 
348825,Hotel JL No76, We were offered an upgrade for a bigger room with a balcony but when we got in the room I m not sure it could ve been much smaller the size was fine but i think we just paid for the balcony Probably not worth it outside of summer months There was damp coming through the wall next to the curtain , Staff were very friendly our room was always cleaned to a good standard The spa bath was nice and the beds were comfy great pillows 
348826,Hotel JL No76, Bigger range of free teas and coffees, The staff were friendly and helpful The suggestions of places to eat in the information book in the rooms was spot on Good location
348827,Hotel JL No76, We had problem with the air conditioning the second night and the personnel was willing to help The next day the problem was resolved , The personnel was really helpful We appreciated the coffee machine in the room The location is great Definitely a good choice 
348828,Hotel JL No76, Basement room seemed odd as was exec double carpet was stained room was a bit old window area was cold there wasnt a view , Location was ideal and quiet The staff were really personable and the jacuzzi bath was fun 
348829,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Hotel was in an excellent location for getting to all attractions Tram was a 2 minute walk from the hotel Staff at hotel were very welcoming and helpful Lovely experience for an alternative Christmas break 
348830,Hotel JL No76, We booked a room with double bed but we got a twin instead The staff was friendly enough to solve this problem Our room was next to the supply closet it made some noises when the door of the closet was being opened , The room was modern and beautiful Bubble bath with TV was something we looked forward to it every day Our room was on the first floor so it was quick and fast with the elevator We liked The staff the most of our stay they were really accommodating they found our lost items they are really helpful We had enough pillows to build a pillow fort
348831,Hotel JL No76, Bad insulation no thicj walls carpet on the floor was kind of sketchy , The hotel is located perfectly for tourists who want to be central for museums and shopping but still a little outside the noise of the city Very nice breakfast cozy room 
348832,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Lovely welcome on arrival great location for musuems and trams etc I upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi which was great after walking all day I liked the honesty bar and felt at home in this small boutique hotel Would use again Ps great seafood restaurant on next street

348834,Hotel JL No76, Compared to American hotels rooms and halls lack space Call it Amsterdam atmosphere , I stayed in a souterrain room At first I was afraid it would be noisy but the window faced the inner yard so noise was no problem at all Interior was well thought out to the smallest details I found personal very helpful Lift is a definite plus 
348835,Hotel JL No76, air conditioning heating seemed set too cool and despite assistance from staff still did not work properly but they gave us a heater , location and friendly efficient staff good d cor excellent breakfast
348836,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, From the moment we arrived in spite of it being busy we were warmly welcomed Andre and all the staff were kind accommodating fun helpful and made sure that every detail was perfect for us And always with a smile we felt welcome and happy for our entire stay Great breakfast as well Wonderful hospitality Would highly recommend and definitely stay there again 
348837,Hotel JL No76, shower didn t drain quikly enough so bathroom floor got very wet Would have liked more tea coffee supplied in room though not too far to visit the bar , Fantastic location could walk just about anywhere Most comfortable beds we ve ever slept in and DVD player handy for tired evenings 
348838,Hotel JL No76, It s a small hotel with a small staff so we had to wait for a while to check in and check out but it didn t really impact on our overall enjoyment , The fantastic location was perfect for our visit focussing on the museums Staff were friendly and helpful Room was clean and comfortable 
348839,Hotel JL No76, You can hear the maids to loud on the floor But it is ok it is a old house and they are good workers, The Location is sooooo good The helpfull crew The Jacuzzi Amsterdam

348843,Hotel JL No76, The light coloured carpet in the room had a number of stains and would benefit from cleaning Only dry imitation creamer was available for use with coffer and tea in the room , Excellently located to visit the main museums The Rijksmuseum is at the end of the street The front desk staff were friendly and helpful 
348844,Hotel JL No76, Room was not well cleaned even after complaining still not properly cleaned , Very friendly staff breakfast was OK perfect location for museums and public transport 
348845,Hotel JL No76, I did not like the check in time 3pm as i arrived on 1pm and was told to wait till 3 pm to check in I usually check in at 12pm i most hotels in Europe , The room was nice the location was in a quite side of the city but yet near the point of interest 
348846,Hotel JL No76, My door was very difficult to close but when I reported the problem The next day they fixed it , The location was very good Near the museums shops and not far to walk to many places Breakfast and Wi Fi was great The staff was very helpful and polite 
348847,Hotel JL No76, First off the wifi network is very weak which was frustrating when trying to do anything online from the hotel Secondly I rented a bike from the hotel It was not in great condition and thus riding it was not very much fun , Great location room was small but comfortable jacuzzi tub was awesome 
348848,Hotel JL No76, The sink is part of the room and outside of the bathroom which is a bit odd The breakfast is not cheap You may consider eating outside , The location is perfect It s a short walking distance to the major museums It s a short walking distance to the public transportation trams 3 and 5 and more which will take you anywhere you need There s even a bus which goes directly to Schiphol airport 
348849,Hotel JL No76, The lighting in the room was dreadful very hard to put on one s make up Also no need for huge bath why were the sinks out in main bedroom instead of in the bathroom , The location beds very comfortable
348850,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, Attention to detail very poor Rooms dark small and cramped Bathroom to small to even fit the sink in which was in the bedroom Had to remind the staff of everything to be replaced Soaps tea bags you name it Woken up every morning at 7am with the chambermaid outside the bedroom door which was so thin she sounded like she was in the room with us We did not like anything
348851,Hotel JL No76, Had to chase up house keeping problems a few times such as not refilling coffee tea each day and only having one cup and no teaspoons or shortage of towels for a 4 star hotel this should be done but we stayed before and had no problems so maybe just an off day , Staff were lovely and helpful lovely rooms with big comfortable beds and square pillows Bathroom had walk in shower and jacuzzi bath with tv Loved bar in reception for a quick coffee or drink at night and food was good with compact menu Location is in the museum district and designer shops are just one street behind hotel Also airport bus stops right at end of street perfect

348859,Hotel JL No76, The rooms are either one solid super king bed or two singles pushed together we ended up with 2 singles with individual single duvets but asked for a change to a super king the following day which was facilitated by the hotel We had stayed here before and knew that there was a better option than the room we got on check in , The hotel is very central without being in the noisy hub of the city we walked everywhere but if a tram was needed it is only minutes away from the tram connection The hotel is very pretty and has more space in the bedroom than boutique hotels usually would and the large king size bed was really comfortable The bath was a real treat too 
348860,Hotel JL No76,No Negative, The staff was friendly and allowed us to check in early This was especially helpful since we came in from an international flight at 10 00 am The hotel cleaning staff was especially attentive and helpful Excellent location Can take bus 197 directly from the airport

348863,Hotel JL No76, No continental breakfast option which made breakfast too expensive, Very friendly and helpful staff great concept of lounge area and meals were reasonably priced Great location 
348864,Hotel JL No76, Two things We were in a basement unit so we didn t have a window to see out or let light in Also the sink located in the bedroom was awkward to use with one person sleeping Sauna tub with TV was a nutty idea and waste of space Room was better suited for single travelers or young couples , The location was perfect Staff extremely helpful Bed was great WiFi was adequate but didn t operate at times

348871,Hotel JL No76, When we arrived we were told that we were being given an upgrade and shown to the basement near the lift We enquired about another room with at least a window to the street we were then told that was the room we booked I reminded the receptionist that I did not want their upgrade but would like the room I had booked Is it because we are from Australia and we have a relaxed attitude that we are actually given worse rooms Hotel operators must realise that 24 hours on a plane to get to their hotel requires some reverence and not some one to be taken advantage of This has happen a few times even when booking very expensive rooms To JL s credit we were moved immediately admittedly a smaller room on the 1st floor but at least our window opened to the street , The location and incredibly helpful and happy staff
