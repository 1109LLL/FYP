206177,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The windows are relatively small in the one bedroom suite , The bed is comfy and location is good as it is near the Paddington subway and train station The kitchen is a bonus as you can cook something to eat in the morning without rushing 
206178,The Westbourne Hyde Park, , Nice modern and warm room with kitchenette Very convinient for few nights and very well located walking distance from Paddinton and the Heathrow express and a subway station Close to the park but not on the park Quiet and clean neighborhood Worth paying the premium
206179,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The room was quite small but nothing out of the ordinary for London I got a good deal would have been less pleased if I d paid normal rates , The little kitchenette was good with the coffee machine for late night drinks The furnishings all looked modern and clean 
206180,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The bathroom was a little tight although very modern , We had a bedroom plus another room which had a small sink and fridge as well as a fold out bed We comfortably had 3 adults A family could also use it 2 in the bedroom and 2 smaller kids in the pull out bed During the day we folded the pull out bed back in to give us more room We also specifically booked close to Paddington to walk to the train 
206181,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Rooms vary depending on location staff offered little help when it came to facilities not working Be wary if your planning to leave luggage overnight even if you are planning to come to the same hotel as storage is not available for such instances Lack of overnight storage facility was a big let down , Location was good easy access to Lancaster gate station
206182,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing about the stay but I have required for an electronic receipt to be sent to email address twice and I ve never received such an email , The location is very convenient close to Paddington station though the room is not big probably due to the good location The facilities in the room are really nice and complete even with a hob 
206183,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing it was spot on, Staff were really friendly room was spacious and shower hot and powerful great location with lots of small cafes for breakfast and a five min walk to tube
206184,The Westbourne Hyde Park, A summer weight duvet should be on the bed in July , Greaat location just a stroll to Hyde park and easily walked to from Paddington Our room was great little kitchen facility lovely rainfall shower head modern interior decor and a fantastically comfy bed I wanted to take the pillows home with me The staff were efficient and friendly and our room was ready earlier than expected Fortunately we had air conditioning as it was hot in London during our stay Often air conditioners can be noisy but I had no problem sleeping through this one

206186,The Westbourne Hyde Park, We travelled with friends and had two rooms side by side Quite a difference in the room sizes especially the bathrooms Our bathroom although beautiful was tiny you could not open the shower door great shower though unless you wedged yourself into the corner by the toilet Fine for a couple of nights but would have been a problem for a longer stay as no space to put anything , Very friendly helpful staff Great modern spotlessly clean rooms well equipped kitchens We arrived at Paddington and a very easy 8min walk to the hotel We were going to a concert in Hyde Park and again a nice easy walk perfect location for us Liked the adjoining door between our two rooms ideal for families or groups of friends Will without a doubt stay here again
206187,The Westbourne Hyde Park, We were not told if breakfast was included Also no mirror in the bedroom so drying your hair was a chore, the room was very clean and the elemis products and nespresso machine excellent
206188,The Westbourne Hyde Park, No breakfast facilities but there are plenty of places to eat in the area so not really a problem , Modern quality clean hotel Had a good sized room with nespresso machine and nice ammenities Great location close to Paddington and Hyde Park Staff were friendly and accomodating I stay frequently in London and this property was better than many other hotels in the same price range I recommend it would stay here again

206191,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The whole hotel is extremely relaxed staff are welcoming friendly and professional The room was much larger than expected There was an excellent shower and an extremely comfortable firm bed with good quality bedding and pillows I was particularly pleased when they replaced the quilt for a sheet as it was extremely hot The kitchen area with fitted fridge and tea coffee facilities was an added bonus 
206192,The Westbourne Hyde Park, I have no complaints , The rooms are small but efficiently set up the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the close proximity to a major train station made this hotel a good choice 
206193,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Renovations on Westbourne terrace obstructing the road to the hotel no food options on site smallish rooms, Close proximity to Paddington recent renovation

206202,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location that was super easy to get to We picked this spot because of its closeness to Paddington station where the express Heathrow shuttle arrives but the location is a great launching point to reach Hyde Park Kensington Palace Royal Albert Hall etc and a short distance by cab to Parliament Westminster Abbey or Buckingham Palace Paddington is also a subway line right to Piccadilly Circus So it was a nice clean boutique hotel but we weren t interested in the amenities we were interested in it being a good launch pad at a reasonable price It fit the bill 
206203,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which is not a problem When we left the hotel via the fire exit we ended up in the garden of neighbouring apartments and had to climb over a fence to reaccess the hotel via the main door Hotel did not check off guests against a list which is dangerous as someone could have been still inside , Room was newly decorated bed and bed linen excellent Also hotel had a luggage room and held my luggage on check out while I was at work

206210,The Westbourne Hyde Park, No restaurant for breakfast Told need to sit in the reception area to eat a croissant Not good enough , Location good Near Italian cafe in Hyde park
206211,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Room was too small made it cramped for two people and four suitcases Not unusual for Europe though , Great location within a few minutes walking distance of Paddington after catching the Heathrow express

206213,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Rooms were small for families as well as the beds In addition water pressure in the bathrooms needs to be increased though the water is pouring slowly in the bathtub , The friendliness of the staff
206214,The Westbourne Hyde Park, No breakfast option We hope they would include a restaurant in the future, We like the location It eas near Hyde Park and a little charming neighborhood away from the busy touristy locations We also like the amenities in the hotel room like the nespresso coffee machine cutleries plates glasses and microwave oven We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite There were three of us and it was very comfortable

206218,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Check in was incredibly slow and frustrating even though I had pre booked , Great location and could not fault the room although the windows need replacing 
206219,The Westbourne Hyde Park, My room had a noisy fan on the bathroom that would stay on for 20 minutes every time I turned on the light This needs to be fixed , Good location near Paddington station and nice spacious room with all the facilities you need 
206220,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Stuff to manage dirty dishes after using the kitchen, Just renovated Quiet and equipped properly Comfy bathrobes appreciated Well located near Paddington and Hyde Park 
206221,The Westbourne Hyde Park, With no restraint a bit pricey and not a central location I know it s London and the extraction fan in in en suite worked only when the light was out Reported fault on arrival but still no fixed after 4 days, Clean and new and with a studio with two rooms were good as we stayed for 4 nights My wife has difficulty in walk but she could manage a 3 4min walk to the bus and the 148 bus was convenient for the centre
206222,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The only thing I couldn t work out was how to turn off the light in the kitchen area some instructions and or an info leaflet on the facilities would have been helpful , The room was spotless and larger than I expected The kitchen facilities were excellent The power shower was great I loved the view across the roofs and the church 
206223,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing, Excellent location Very comfortable and well kitted out room with mini kitchen facilities Excellent shower comfy bed Really clean Would definitely use again 
206224,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The receptionist who helped us checked in was the most unfriendly receptionist we ve ever seen and did not make us feel welcomed She was not smile at all and did not tell me whether she s finish using my passport or not and just left it at the side The most weird thing was when I had eye contact with her she was starring at me right into my eyes expressionless I smiled at her and she was just keep starring at me like I m a alien or something However the receptionist who helped us checked out was very nice and friendly , The room is great It got so many lights that we can easily found switches The decoration are very comfortable There is a small cooking area near the door where we could make tea and I love that idea 
206225,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The fire alarm went off three times due to system issues during our stay All in the middle of the nights The hotel did not handle it well After the alarms went off there were no effort to let people know that they were false alarms I called the front desk but the no one answered the phone I had to get downstairs to ask the staff for information The hotel does not seem to understand the customers are scared when they hear the fire alarms The no action of the hotel staff is extremely disappointing For this reason alone I will never stay here again, The design of the room is interesting Although the space is limited it is very functional 
206226,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Few more hangers in the wardrobe would be useful , Stylish decor spacious suite with excellent amenities and thoughtful extras Well equipped bathroom with good stoarage space and handy magnifying mirror Cosy lounge area and ample mini kitchen with plenty of wardrobe space for a few days stay

206228,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Unfortunately if there was anything it would be that there was no tea towel or a small sachet of washing up liquid for washing up considering it was self catering But other than that small thing it was faultless , Immaculately clean and very friendly staff
206229,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, There is small kitchen facilities and also coffee machine Also the bathroom is very spacious The accessibility features of hotel room are also very much appreciated 
206230,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The apartment space was very compact so a little more space would have been preferable A bigger bin would have been preserable considering that cooking facilities are provided , Friendly staff Great location with easy tube and bus connection and three minutes from Hyde Park Comfortable beds and fluffy big towels changed daily 
206231,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Shower in the bathroom leaked water all over the floor, The bed was really comfy and the staff were extremely helpful really appreciated being able to leave our bags at the hotel whilst we went out into London for the day and the fact that we were able to check in earlier than expected without any problems

206234,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Unnecessary deposit required 50 Pounds There s no hotel restaurant or room service and only a rudimentary bar , Extremely cozy welcoming hotel Excellent location close to Hyde Park Lancaster Gate buses Lancaster Gate Tube closed until Jun 17 and tube as well as Paddington Station 
206235,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Check in was extremely slow and check out wasn t much quicker , Room was comfortable and well equipped Shower was awesome I could have quite happily stayed in there all day 
206236,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Just had a disappointing arrival experience We turned up a bit early and room was not ready no big issue but the person that dealt with us on reception was not the most customer friendly Having said that generally the staff were very good, For London the price was very reasonable the hotel is clean and facilities very good
206237,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Check in process was quite lengthy unnecessary deposit required, Well appointed and equipped room comfortable bed great location close to Hyde Park friendly staff
206238,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The triple room was a little small for 3 adults When the sofa bed was opened out found it difficult to reach the kitchenette Wished there was a good supermarket nearer to this property but we still had a great time thank you , Loved my stay at the hotel very relaxing clean and comfortable The location was excellent just round the corner from Paddington Station and buses to Oxford Street The staff were very friendly and always greeted us with a smile and a hello Would definitely stay again 
206239,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Rubber mat in shower was covered in mould not sure if it is even needed , Friendly helpful staff Clean and comfortable Excellent location close to Hyde Park Lancaster Gate buses and tube as well as Paddington Station Nicely designed rooms and bathroom Nespresso coffee machine and even cooking facilities 
206240,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The only thing was perhaps supplying a tea towel and detergent in the kitchen , The staff were amazing especially Christiano and Osmand who helped us to find a larger room for our three teenage children Nothing was too much trouble The rooms were great showers were fabulous Great location 
206241,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Considerable confusion at check in interrupted by an incoming phone call and I was made to wait the check in computer was not working correctly Nothing terrible but nowhere near good enough , It s an okay hotel if you need a place near Paddington Station 
206242,The Westbourne Hyde Park, the only thing I would change is there was no door on the bedroom we put our 4 year old to bed in the main bedroom at 7 pm but as the bedroom had no actual door we still had to be quiet in the living room kitchen area as the suite was very open plan But this wouldn t stop us staying again and isn t something that affected our enjoyment staying, Amazing location and great facilities Brilliant family hotel with friendly helpful staff Everything like new bed and sofa bed super comfy very powerful shower well equipped kitchen and made super base for our weekend in London We stayed with our 4 year old who staff made feel very welcome Was a very quiet hotel we couldn t hear anyone coming and going 
206243,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Very noisy room which kept us awake and woke up our three year old several times with the noise of traffic w hen I told receptionist on departure was told well next time you book we will give you a quiet room Would have liked this in the first place , Lovely comfy bed loved the bath robe and slippers also complimentary toiletries very nice
206244,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The bed was amazingoing and when combined with the blackout curtains it was definitely the most amazing sleep ever The shower was unreal I didn t want to get out of it and all the staff were extremely helpful 
206245,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Breakfast choices, Extremely cozy welcoming hotel The staff is very friendly and helpful It was a real pleasure to stay here and all was very comfortable 
206246,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The bathroom was tiny No fun for tall people , The location is good for central London and it offers decent value for money There s no hotel restaurant or room service and only a rudimentary bar but the in room self catering facilities are very good if you need them 
206247,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing except the rooms and spaces this thing common in London and Europe , The hotel was wonderful and beautiful in every sense of the word including the workers and the most important non smoking hotel beautiful scents scattered all over the hotel cleanliness calm everything was wonderful thank everyone for their hospitality and cooperation
206248,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing, Very warm and friendly welcome by all the staff our room was well stocked and very clean thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to friends well situated to Hyde park and plenty of shops and restaurants around
206249,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Rooms were very tiny We took a deluxe double studio and a deluxe one bedroom suite They were both very small for the price No room service in the hotel Breakfast as we were told only consists of tea coffee and croissants for 9 pounds a day Hotel is not bad in general but it s we felt that it was a bit overpriced for the size of the rooms and services available in the hotel Overall it was an ok stay , Location of the hotel is very good Many restaurants supermarkets pharmacies souvenirs shops metros around the hotel All accessible by a short walk Hyde park is also walking distance from the hotel Staff was helpful with all our requests and helped us make some last minute reservations for New Years Quiet neighborhood perfect for families 
206250,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The beds and pillows could be a bit more comfortable, Very warm and cozy reception and lobby area Staff excellent but one small issue as check out was not allowed to be delayed as I fully understand the hotel was pretty full 
206251,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, Our stay here was simply perfect The location is very comfortable to travel around using the tubes Being close to Hyde park We loved going for short walks and Lots of good restaurants were also easily accessible The staff were very friendly and the hospitality was very good Facilities were just enough and the rooms very clean and neatly maintained Overall We would love to come back and stay there We only had a trouble with the wifi being very slow Rest all was perfect 
206252,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Picking holes a bit but the shower wasn t great , Great all round Staff excellent rooms very comfortable Rate paid reflected December but pretty good value 
206253,The Westbourne Hyde Park, First morning workers were making noise at 8 30am in the room next to our and they woke us up We complained about the incident to reception and although they could not stop them to work that day next days we stayed they did not work early in the morning Unfortunately in the next two days the housecleaner knocked on the door around 9am so we were also woken up Besides these issues the rest of the stay was very pleasant , The room had space enough and the kitchenette was quite useful for us Bathroom was nice 
206254,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The temperature control in the room was not good it was either too hot with the heating on or too cold in the bathroom if you turned it off Made the stay very uncomfortable Also room was tiny and did not make good use of space No provision in the shower to place your toiletries had to put them on the floor Also the towel rack was so high I needed to climb on the toilet seat to grab a towel Just needs a bit more care and attention , Staff very friendly and helpful they understood that I had just arrived on a transatlantic flight and made sure I got an early check in I REALLY appreciated that very much Room was clean with kettle coffee machine and a smart TV 
206255,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were very helpful friendly and always said hello when you passed with a smile You don t see that so much nowadays Hotel is 15mins walk from Hyde Park in a nice area and only 2 stops on the tube from Bond Street so easy access to shops The room was very clean on arrival and had everything you needed Also cleaned daily to a high standard 
206256,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The noise was very bad at night from the traffic and the bathroom fan constantly ran which was very loud when when bath room door was shut and lights where off, Amazing location extreamly good staff the room was lovely
206257,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Literally the only thing was that the bottled water in the fridge was sparkling and we prefer still and that s being extremely picky as it didn t affect us at all, Beautiful Hotel with lovely sized comfortable rooms hot relaxing showers and extremely clean bathrooms Perfect place to stay for Hyde Park Or anywhere else in London as the tube station is only a couple of minutes walk away 
206258,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing , Great location just few minute walk to Lancaster Gate Tube station Paddington station and Hyde Park The facilities are great staffs are nice 
206259,The Westbourne Hyde Park, It is not a hotel but more like a B B no bar no room service no food served no mini bar Even if there is a kitchenette it would have been nice to have a mini bar part of it and some food available just in case No proper breakfeast served either So in terms of value for money it is fair Water was not hot enough in the shower temperature limited and heating was a bit fussy Additionally having a bathroom equipped with the disabled equipment makes it a little less charming and plastic tiles on the floor and walls too Ok that is looking into details as in general the rooms are really comfortable and hotel very close to Paddington station which is so easy to get to and from Heathrow , Spotless and comfortable 
206260,The Westbourne Hyde Park, On check in the receptionist tried my credit card in the machine and said it declined asked him to try again it declined and again declined he then said i must have in sufficient funds in my bank i then told him i had thousands in my bank at this point i am feeling very embarrassed because of people behind me i asked him to try again and it went through fine i rang my bank to see if there was a problem and they assured me there wasnt It was the receptionists mistake Nobody to serve in bar area until 2 30 pm on a saturday ,No Positive
206261,The Westbourne Hyde Park, There was no door separating the bedroom to the living area With a baby that s a complete bummer Tge cleaning times were wacky and not very client friendly abd even when raised this point they still didn t do it sooner We had also to pay for a baby coat and not cheap they can be more transparent about this hidden cost and follow other hotels that do not charge anything Small things toiletries were fully changed renewed only at our request room vacuuming could have been better , The location and relatively new facilities Some of the staff genuine friendly and good intentions not super with executing 
206262,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Very small bathroom Noisy road which meant we couldn t open a window overnight so the room got quite stuffy even with the aircon on, Good location very close to Hyde Park and the Lancaster Gate tube station Ability to self cater although kitchenette was small and had limited equpiment Very clean Comfortable bed
206263,The Westbourne Hyde Park, There is a small bar on site to get drinks but no breakfast Therefore would strongly recommend you take something with you for the next morning Rooms have coffee machines and a kitchenette so easy to store food and extras to save the walk possibly in the rain the next morning , A fantastic room for the price We had a suite with separate seating and kitchenette Everything looked new and beautifully done Hotel is in a great location although this is Paddington so not a terribly glamorous look out the window and easy walking distance to Hyde Park and Paddington Station A few minutes walk to facilities such as the Mitre Pub where we had dinner and coffee shops near Paddington Station Would definitely recommend and I would stay here again 
206264,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, Would definately return to this hotel again and recommend it to family and friends If only they could offer a breakfast basket then it would be perfect 
206265,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The location is in the heart of London and close to two underground stations The staff is so friendly and collaborative and the hotel is relatively new 
206266,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Just a suggestion a mirror above the desk dressing table for ladies blow drying their hair , The overall experience from beginning to end was amazing Super comfortable well laid out superior decor clean amazing staff 
206267,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Room was extremely small The road outside of the hotel was perpetually lined with honking traffic it was so hard for the uber driver to stop and pick passengers up The hotel also does not serve breakfast Lastly the hotel does not even have the facilities to store our luggage for 2 nights while we sightsee in paris even though we have booked for the subsequent 5 nights in the deluxe suite In the end the options they gave was 1 Ask my pregnant wife to lug the luggage to the train station to store it there 2 Find another hotel I cancelled the remaining nights and found a more reputable one that stored our luggage , The staff were polite enough Hotel looks new 
206268,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The hotel provided toiletries were not great would bring my own , Comfortable bed nice kitchen facilities very clean The staff were very friendly with a quick check in and check out process 
206269,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The room is too small and shower place is crowded and it s hard to find a space to place shampoo and conditioner The hotel doesn t have breakfast place or conference rooms , Nice room with everything you possibly needed All furnitures are quite new and room is clean staff there are quite nice The location is close to tube stations and the place is quiet at night 
206270,The Westbourne Hyde Park, One bedroom apartment but no door on the bedroom Rather strange when family were sleeping on the sofa bed in lounge , Very clean stylish 1st class fittings 
206271,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, Gorgeous smell in the lobby like a spa Room was very nice Loved the bed the toiletries the coffee machine and a good hair dryer which so many hotels get wrong 
206272,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Getting in and out of the bathroom was a struggle small doors were hitting I asked to extend my stay by a day or two if available 2 days before checkout The gentleman at night suggested I contact the staff tomorrow I thought it strange since he was at the desk already I asked the young lady at the desk the following day She said there were no availabilities that is all I am accustomed to hotel staff offering other options but she came off as inexperienced and quite rude I think unintentional on her part I expected they were filling up but was fine with booking a different type of room or paying extra had it been offered I think she meant there were no similar rooms available at my discounted rate rather than there were absolutely no rooms available Was not keen on that lack of courtesy I stayed somewhere else the following day after checkout , Great having a small kitchen to cook in Television access was also great for films and YouTube haha Cleaning staff was very kind and the porter was especially helpful and good natured Most of the concierge and staff at the desk were great and very helpful with directions and nearby attractions The front desk gentleman gauged that I was young and suggested a prime shopping location specific to my taste The room was very clean and the hotel is in a nice residential neighborhood 
206273,The Westbourne Hyde Park, size of suite was a bit of a joke photo must have been taken with a fish eye lens Definately not big enough for 3 adults sofa bed would not unfold because it hit the opposite wall Turned it round but then had to climb over it to get to bedroom , Very clean Fantastic view of the drugs bust Sunday night outside the squat opposite our room 
206274,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing, The staff are all exceptionally friendly and helpful Reception staff are particularly well trained and professional We enjoyed the extra comfort of the deluxe suite with a kitchenette and separate sitting area The wifi was reliable and everything was spotlessly clean 
206275,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The room itself have a connecting door to the lobby toilet when I slept on the sofa bed I could hear the door sound in the morning it really distributing Also the space for the toilet it s too small for me since it was used the space for the public lobby toilet Last there is no place for soap and shampoo in the shower , The room is quite large but there s one problem in the room Overall the staff service is excellent Mention few names that helped my stay better to Osman Since the greeting until check out he s really there for the guest 
206276,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Reception staff weren t particularly customer focussed baggage guy aside who was very helpful Limited scope for early check in, Room was very comfortable extremely clean Great location near to underground and Hyde Park
206277,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Did not like having to pay a 30 deposit on top of a pre paid room It was easy to get it refunded the next day though , Comfy beds Elemis toileteries friendly check in and check out and super location We had a nice quiet room as requested 
206278,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The room was just amazing and I believe for London it was good value for money It s located in the heart of London Hyde park at walking distance plus close to train and tube stations The building is newly refurbished so it s actually like staying at a new property The staff is friendly and the hotel manager was extremely helpful and accommodating Overall a great stay
206279,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, I must say it s been probably the best hotel I ve stayed in London without paying 200 per night New and clean Calm Paddington station less than 10 minutes away great if you come to Heathrow the Heathrow Express makes it in 15 mins Helpful and kind staff I ll be happy to stay again
206280,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Upon check in in addition to taking the room charge up front they also took a pre authorization for damages that might happen We were not informed on this matter anywhere while we were making our reservation it is the hotel s responsibility to document and charge these damages not guests responsibility to pay up front for something that might happen They need to clarify their policies , The rooms the amenities and the location were beyond our expectations and we truly enjoyed this hotel
206281,The Westbourne Hyde Park, My only complaint would be the positioning of a bright green light in the passageway ceiling possibly part of the alarm or smoke detector system which for us was quite intrusive Not a complaint but if we were staying for a longer period I would go for an upgraded room with more space Although there was a small bar in the foyer it wasn t attended so I guess they don t serve drinks there but not a problem in Central London , The room 003 was quite small but apparently new The double bed was very comfortable and the room in a basement but with a window was very quiet for London We wanted an hotel close to Paddington station for a 1 night stay at reasonable cost and this hotel I thought gave good value for money The room had a small kitchen area complete with hot plates m wave fridge toaster etc as well as a Nespresso coffee machine The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries the shower was great and lighting very good The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and the location just to the north of Hyde Park was ideal for us 
206282,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Because it was a very new hotel only opened 4 days the bar was not ready But that was not a big deal , The location of this hotel was amazing Central to everything We felt very comfortable in every way 
206283,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Check in was very disorganized the staff did not know what to do and would not allow anyone to book in until 3pm all at same time so took a long while,No Positive
206284,The Westbourne Hyde Park, I was shown an apartment with attached room But when i arrived there was just a studio apartment I was told that booking com made a mistake posting wrong details , The staff was good property new and ambience good 
206285,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Nothing, Everything was immaculate The staff was friendly and accommodating for every request and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of Location is outstanding literally across the street from Hyde Park 
206286,The Westbourne Hyde Park, They did not receive confirmation from Booking com so there was no room available after waiting 30 mins they said will a Holiday Inn 10 mins taxi away do NO after a further 10 mins the only room they could put us in was a double 2 Guys because we where meeting other people in the area we had no choice but take it No compensation offered by the hotel because it was Booking com fault ,No Positive
206287,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Being new some of the staff were a little blue However tried and after opening several hotels myself understand how much of a task it can be My only real criticism ofrom the experience is that there were no facility to use the hob no pans etc no cleaning cloth and I wish an extra touch would have been fresh milk in the fridge I was also asked for a preauthoried deposit not unusual however could be an issue for travellers who are a little more cost conscious as it has not yet reached my account again yet almost 3 weeks on , The hotel is well presented as it s new initially the room and public areas were well presented decorated tastefully and at a reasonable price The bed was a dream to sleep in the towels were nice and soft and the shower was a delight The room is great value for money 
206288,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Unable to check in before 3pm and check out at 11am these hours are too restrictive Also being wakened by hotel cleaning staff at 9 05am asking were we ready to check out was an unwelcome occurance A few teething problems with phone and toilet fan not working correctly in room , Location new hotel staff very friendly helpful comfortable rooms 
206289,The Westbourne Hyde Park, should but Ashe trey out side the hotel it not good to through the cigarettes ends out side the street No complimentary water for the guests , I like the Location it is a way from the center around there was small but very good shops and restaurants 
206290,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Parking , The staff were lovely and treated us to a surprise birthday gift Really made it special They were very helpful with arranging a taxi for us too Thanks guys 
206291,The Westbourne Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff was knowledgeable friendly and very helpful This was true from the front desk personnel to Mirella in housekeeping It was a lovely new hotel which obviously had the guest in mind very comfortable There was even a Nespresso coffee machine in the room stocked with various pods Very Clean It s located close to the tube and park I look forward to staying with them again 
206292,The Westbourne Hyde Park, I would have like a tiny shelf in the shower and near the bathroom sink for my lotions and potions , Extra comfy beds and pillows economy of space without being claustrophobic lovely design thick curtains so if you re in need of a lie in that can happen Real coffee from Nespresso friendly staff Ooooh yeah pretty fabulous location too 
206293,The Westbourne Hyde Park, The bar was not open this was never mentioned pre booking and asking for a card payment for extras when none were available i felt was a bit off, Everything is new and of the highest quality Great location
206294,The Westbourne Hyde Park, 1 Food debris under the slab on the check in day debris from the hood when turned on a lot of threads from towels 2 In common all 10 days were very good until the last day We had 2 extra hours for check out thanks to booking genius status Unfortunately everyone on reception forgot about it although I reminded about that on the day of arrival So from 10 00am till 12 30pm I received two different calls from the reception two different visits from housekeeping one of them saw me naked bad mood 3 Deposit 300 GBR is still blocked on my bank account , 1 Location 5 walking minutes to the two different lines tube stations 2 Stylish room design well made furniture 3 Great linens pillows and blanket 4 Teapot cups and other cutleries Hairdryer bath accessories Ironing board and iron 5 Great shower 6 Good free wifi in the morning slower in the evening but good in common 
206295,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Reception at this hotel checked me in to the hotel room n the afternoon At 10 30 pm they checked in further quests into the same room Total strangers walked in to my guest room when I was undressed Very poor attitude of management and terrible security and in my case total disregard to my privacy Total strangers being given access by reception to my room late at night is reckless and dangerous , Leaving the property was the highlight 
206296,The Westbourne Hyde Park, nothing really, Everything was perfect Room was clean and tidy daily service provided clean towels and replenished coffee and milk beds were comfy location just perfect 
206297,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Towels stored very high in bathroom hard to reach when you are short nowhere to put soap in the shower cubicle , Modern brand new facilities very convenient to tube Fast free wifi Comfy beds Clean very little outside noise we were on the ground floor with a street view 
206298,The Westbourne Hyde Park, Apart from one lady at reception the other staff seemed unsure and were not very helpful I believe this is a new hotel and staff are getting used to it I think the Management should have made sure the staff were properly trained before opening , Just across the road from Hyde Park Very clean modern decor well equiped appartments New hotel and I think the staff have a lot to learn but I m sure it will be well run after a few weeks practice
