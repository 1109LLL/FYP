228027,The Piccadilly London West End, The spa should be completely refurbished , The staff is eceptionally friendly and we would like to name Filip who was very helpful as were all the people at the reception desk These people and the location of the hotel really make up for what is lacking in really making this a 5 star hotel 
228028,The Piccadilly London West End, The air freshener in the corridors was a bit overpowering The changing room in the spa gym had a dirty floor with hairs etc People waiting for the spa were sitting by the gym s glass door it felt a bit uncomfortable having to exercise in front of everyone sitting there , Beds were very nice The staff was very friendly and helpful even when very busy The room was clean The location is just excellent

228033,The Piccadilly London West End, Not anything I would complain about As stated the rooms are small but still comfortable The furnishings are newer and everything well maintained And no smaller than you would find in similar hotels on the continent You just have to plan a bit when two are trying to get ready at the same time , The staff at this hotel were brilliant and looked after our every need The prosecco and chocolates in the lobby were a nice touch I call the hotel rooms small my partner says they are bijou Not sure but Americans need to understand these are European sized rooms Bathrooms were sufficient size and the rainwater shower was brilliant Every part of the hotel was clean modern and tidy The location in the west end is second to none On the hotel side of the street is Soho on the other side of the street is Chinatown Everything you need is in easy walking distance 
228034,The Piccadilly London West End, Nothing to report , This hotel is situated in a perfect location just a five minute walk from the iconic Piccadilly Circus and close to restaurants night clubs and theatres I was upgraded to a suite which a nice welcome the suite was spacious which is very rare in London very clean and nicely decorated Staff very friendly and knowledgeable I would recommend this hotel for both a business and a leisure trip Very good for solo travellers and couples 
228035,The Piccadilly London West End, I can t think of anything , This is by far the best hotel and location I ve found in London Everything is within walking distance if you enjoy walking I only had to take the tube a couple of times The British and National Gallery are super close It s possibly one of the most vibrant parts of the city to stay in Anything you could need is around the corner Pubs restaurants bars clubs movie theaters and theatres Will definitely be staying there next time Pricey but for London it was a great deal Staff was super attentive and kind 
228036,The Piccadilly London West End, Room quite small and bathroom smaller still Probably the smallest I have ever seen I tried to find a hotel that was less expensive since I was traveling alone and thought this was very expensive for the size of room Also the decor was not the most pleasant Prefer modern and lighter Maybe I am not used to London standards , The staff went above and beyond to accommodate every need Amenities in room included a nespresso machine water cookies and fresh fruit This was excellent Also cannot get better location Was close to so much of what I wanted to see and do 
228037,The Piccadilly London West End, Rated as 4 to 5 star hotel yet can t possibly be more than a 3 Very small room and bathroom particularly yet called a premier room Spa very substandard as is Gym with often wet floors and no towels Far too many other issues which we reported to management We would never stay here again , The staff were quite pleasant 
228038,The Piccadilly London West End, The brekafast area is a bit small I got a disabled room even though I booked a regular standard room The A C didn t work , A comfortable hotel in a perfect location Picadilly and Soho Well maintained and with a very friendly and helpful staff Good size of the room nice amenities and well equiped mini bar I would definitely recommend for a short stay 
228039,The Piccadilly London West End, Room wasn t ready on arrival despite being there just 5 minutes before when check in starts from , Staff Surprised my friend by making the room up with balloons and cake for her bday spelling happy bday with dried rose petals on her bed Very nice touch 
228040,The Piccadilly London West End,No Negative, Right from the start the welcome was perfect Glass of Prosecco and friendly and helpful staff Room was beautiful and had everything you could want Even a mobile phone if you were visiting from abroad Coffee was delicious Attached restaurant had an Indian street food experience for the evening Staff were helpful and friendly and good food 
228041,The Piccadilly London West End, The smallness of the room and bathroom even in a junior suite The payment policy of the hotel Horrible The lack of a good restaurant attached to the hotel Currently Hankies the adjacent restaurant is what the hotel uses This is not a restaurant that serves really good breakfasts or even good afternoon teas etc You have to go to the nearest Pret a Manger to get espresso yogurt fresh fruit etc And forget about really good lunches Part of the problem is the rating that Booking com gives the hotel The rooms are unbearably small , The Nespresso machine in the room The 120V outlet on the desk The fruit and daily cookies
228042,The Piccadilly London West End, Not enough tea in the room Breakfast a little expensive so ate out , Lovely staff at check in size of room and bed Clean room and great location Loved the complimentary touches Despite being so near hustle and bustle very little noise and we had a front room 
228043,The Piccadilly London West End,No Negative, Excellent staff who were extremely helpful and friendly In particular this showed through when I had the unpleasant experience of watching them having to deal with a pretentious couple who were trying every trick in the book to try and get a free room upgrade The staff showed patience and professionalism that management should be proud of The rooms were excellent very clean and good quality fittings Great location Highly recommend 
228044,The Piccadilly London West End,No Negative, The location was excellent Its location on Shaftesbury Avenue was so convenient and meant that it was only a short walk to all the theatres and restaurants Covent Garden and China Town were both very close Above all this was the friendliness and courtesy of the staff They were excellent 
228045,The Piccadilly London West End, The fridge was broken we was going to drink the champagne but it was warm we informed reception they said they fix it so we could drink on return wasn t fixed still warm The shower door didn t shut hoovering outside our room at 7 35 in the morning Lights were broken very disappointed as the location was perfect and would stay regularly, The area

228047,The Piccadilly London West End, I was quite pleased with every aspect of our stay at the Picadilly West , The location is fantastic Easy walking to Picadilly and Soho We used public transit a lot Picadilly makes that very easy to get anywhere pretty quickly We used busses the river bus underground and overground using the Oyster Card My wife uses a wheel chair when we travel London on the whole is very accomodating The underground sometimes presents challenges because not all station have lifts 
228048,The Piccadilly London West End, Lack of space in the bathroom for toileteries , The Hotel was conveniently placed for theatre trip and within easy walking distance from Waterloo Station Reception staff were excellent and a bonus was the welcoming glass of Prosseco Very well appointed bedroom with complimentary items Comfortable bed with great choice of pillows 
228049,The Piccadilly London West End, Sound proofing was poor I could hear conversations in the hallway and other rooms Made me nervous about speaking too loudly on the phone Only ate at the restaurant for breakfast and that only once due to the exorbitant price plus an insulting added gratuity for the continental breakfast at that However using my Manhattan rule what would you pay in New York the price wasn t that out of line The selections of pastries cereals and proteins was quite nice , Room was small and quirky but well laid out with all expected items and more mini bar fresh fruit bottled water toiletries Bed was comfortable Great charging station for all electronics Front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly Location was great downtown Piccadilly with theaters shops restaurants Chinatown Trafalgar Square and the underground all within blocks I also enjoyed staying in a hotel that did not look like every other hotel in every other major city in the world The complementary glass of Proseco upon arrival was a godsend as I was about to lose my mind after a long day of travel

228078,The Piccadilly London West End, Nothing , Absolutely everything location is perfect and yet the room was silent you would not know you were right in the middle of central London Room and facilities are excellent really nice gym and spa which totally made our stay after long days walking around Absolutely the best thing about this hotel though is the staff they went completely above an beyond special thanks to Andre who went out of his way a number of times to make our stay especially comfortable We spent two weeks in the UK and this was by far the best service we received from all the hotels we stayed at the staff really care about making it a special experience we will stay here every time from now on

228122,The Piccadilly London West End, The national grid was off and made do with a very quick cold shower on our last day staff was very apologetic, The bed was so comfortable and the staff very friendly specially enjoyed the small eatery very handy if you didn t want a big meal
228123,The Piccadilly London West End, That we hadn t booked for another night , Everything Was a little wary when booking as due to the excellent location thought may be rather a busy noisy hotel Quite the opposite Even though all rooms were booked it was so lovely and quiet I think actually the quietest night sleep I have had at a hotel Amazing Infact nothing we could fault Maybe just that the rooms are smallish but immaculately clean and stylish Huge telly comfy BIG bed sparkling shower room Glass of bubbly on arrival We also LOVE Les Mis and was literally doors away from the theatre Also lots of places to eat drink in this area Will be back soon that s for sure

228128,The Piccadilly London West End, The room was far too small to be classed as a Premier Double The bed was a very small double My husband actually slept on the floor to ensure I had a good night s sleep for my run the following day which wasn t great , The location was perfect for us as we wanted to be close to Trafalgar Square for the 10k Winter Run I was participating in the following day The hotel was modern and clean The staff were very friendly and attentive We thought the glass of prosecco at check in was a nice touch Although we complained about being asked to move hotel the night before due to a computer error I refused and the horrendously small room size the lady at check out was very considerate and offered us a 20 room discount and an offer to upgrade if we stay again 
228129,The Piccadilly London West End, being in the heart of the West End comes with a downside book the rooms to the back of the hotel if you want a peaceful sleep without street noise small rooms including even smaller bathrooms lots of modern technical equipment in the room different lighting schemes you get your own mobile phone etc but the essential technical equipment wasn t up to level We had a false fire alarm around 23 30 with the fire sensors howling for a solid five minutes so everybody was out of their rooms by then and back awake in my case friendly personnel but Concierge went for a smoke with three people waiting in the reception area Receptionist was new with no extra management to guide him Plan in some extra time for Check in and Check out , great location in the heart of the West End very close to theaters restaurants bars shops of Soho walking distance to Piccadilly Circus friendly personnel good bed I had a Queens bed good shower large flatscreen TV basically everything from the description was present in the hotel room 
228130,The Piccadilly London West End, Nothing, With liked everything the location the welcome when we got there the complimentary glass of presecco was such a nice touch and the free mobile that had maps already programmed in so that you could take it out with you
228131,The Piccadilly London West End, The breakfast was very disappointing they would be better to stick to the continental style rather than the cooked items , The staff were more than helpful always happy to offer their help and advise Room was lovely and spacious and the fruit water teas anencephaly biscuits were a lovely treat We also took advantage of the small spa available which was nice and relaxing 
228132,The Piccadilly London West End, Our bathroom in our twin bed room had a glass panel facing the bed so no privacy while showering Could be problem when you are sharing a room with friend or collegue , Extremely helpful staff nice rooms location brilliant
228133,The Piccadilly London West End, It would have been nice to have a mini fridge to keep drinks chilled or to store snacks but it wasn t really too big a deal Just nit picking , Excellent bathroom clean modern well lit Slippers Bathrobes Giant towels Complimentary daily bottled water fruit the prosecco at Check In Awesome staff And the large very comfortable bed 
228134,The Piccadilly London West End, The put my pregnant girlfriend and I in a single room with a single bed then when we said it was a double bed they told me I didn t know what a double bed was and that was the normal double room Checking the photos on here it wasn t and they agreed to move us to the room we had paid for It seemed like a chore to move us but they made sure we slept in the room that was facing the road and had a club on our level next door Worst stay I ve ever had in a hotel , Location is handy for the Harry Potter play but I d only stay here if it was the last hotel available in London 
228135,The Piccadilly London West End, Hotel food breakfast only which arrived cold No vehicle drop off pick up zone for unloading bags other than around corner or over the road Small rooms and tiny bathroom go for biggest you can afford , Great location to theatre restaurants shopping Staff friendly and attentive Rooms pleasantly decorated Hotel with character Would recommend for one or two nights 
228136,The Piccadilly London West End, No price list for mini bar so it was an unknown , Heated bathroom floor great location didn t have a meal so can t comment Left our cases at hotel after we had booked out staff were great 
228137,The Piccadilly London West End, Nothing remarkable Reception smelled a little to Curry Food it was ok with us but maybe not with everyone, The staff was awesome in particular Maria she helped with a minor issue with the heating system 
228138,The Piccadilly London West End, The bathroom was very small We couldn t get 24 room service , All the staff were wonderful and friendly The room was stylish turn down treats and nice coffee machine 
228139,The Piccadilly London West End, It would have been great to have known in advance that ear plugs would be beneficial at night if you re not a heavy sleeper Or maybe the hotel could provide them with their dressing gown and slippers availability Not really a complaint as this was Piccadilly Circus after all and the hustle and bustle was understandably 24 7 On night two my sister and I had obtained ear plugs and we slept like babies , Although I didn t specify that I was celebrating a birthday I was delighted to find a decorated bed as well as a box of chocolates there were fresh flowers in the room too Upon arrival the Prosecco was a very welcome treat Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and their customer service was excellent The location is exceptional and in very close proximity to the tube station Fortnum Masons as well as Harrods were very easily accessed from this hotel We ate in some fabulous restaurants including the Cork Bottle and Dalloway Terrace The theatres are metres away We opted to see Thriller the Lyric theatre which is the best show that I ve ever seen We took advantage of the gym too just to take away some of the guilt of the over indulgence of our 3 day stay

228143,The Piccadilly London West End, The noise of roadworks in the morning But hotel is on the main street so to be expected , The service upon arrival and they knew it was our birthdays and made extra special treats for us in the room which was unforgettable 
228144,The Piccadilly London West End, When the maid just opened the door without knocking and I had no clothes on was very embarrassing and I was very upset , Was up graded to a four poster bed and was very comfortable 
228145,The Piccadilly London West End, The hotel does not have a restaurant which given its location is no big deal However the bar next door is in our opinion extremely poor and is not a reflection of the high standard of the rest of the hotel It is not clear if the bar coffee shop is part of the hotel but it is expensive and poor An area for attention Another point is that the bar coffee shop not being part of the hotel closes at 23 00 and therefore there are no facilities for guests to relax on returning to the hotel, The outstanding point of this hotel are definitely the staff who are superb The hotel seems to have been recently refurbished to a very high standard the rooms are a little on the small side especially the 5th floor but perfectly adequate and very well appointed The Nespresso machine is a great bonus

228151,The Piccadilly London West End, Had a wet room not a shower cubicle or bath meaning that the whole bathroom was soaked after showering For the money I would expect a Bath or shower cubicle The hotel advertises on its website complimentary breakfast to all those staying there but we then found out this did not apply to those who book through booking com, Welcome glass of prosecco on arrival made for a nice start The room was good
