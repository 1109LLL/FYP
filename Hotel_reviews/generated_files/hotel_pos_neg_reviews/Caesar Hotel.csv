124084,Caesar Hotel, Nothing in particular, The hotel has a great location near Hyde Park and Queensway Bayswater and Paddington train stations and the surrounding area is safe and charming The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was good and comfortable in a quiet street I will definitely stay here again 
124085,Caesar Hotel, Room a little tatty although clean Quite pricey even taking into account London prices, Location was ideal booking was straight forward Helpful staff nice bar
124086,Caesar Hotel, It would have been great to have a seating area next to the window I always like to have a coffee or drink and look out , The bed was comfy The rooms very clean I appreciated the fact that we could open the windows 
124087,Caesar Hotel, The breakfast was a bit expensive but delicious English eggs with Spanish meats , This boutique hotel is in a very elegant area of Westminster quiet and residential but close to the Queensway Bayswater and Paddington train stations We arrived by train to St Pancras and got a taxi to the hotel with our luggage about 20 pounds each way but used the subway after that My Mother was impressed that we had a W in our address West Posh and I loved the Spanish influence in the hotel 
124088,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, the staff were very accommodating and let us check in early then leave bags with them as rooms weren t ready comfortable rooms nice quiet location
124089,Caesar Hotel, In my opinion the chef needs training on cooking eggs and bacon should be cooked al a minute and all cooked breakfast should be served hot , Reception staff very helpful and courteous Continental breakfast is more than adequate
124090,Caesar Hotel, Does not deserve a 4 star No fridge in the room Dirty remote control Bed sheet with hair and traces of blood DISGUSTING Insectes in the room all the staff have a problem with english language Thank god i was there only for 2 days Extremly bad hotel, Nothing to be honest
124091,Caesar Hotel, The walls were so thin I could hear everything from the next door room The room could do with redecoration The food from room service was not great , Hotel is in a brilliant location The staff are really helpful The room was well equipped and the bed was comfy It was generally clean 
124092,Caesar Hotel, The rooms feel more like dormitory rooms than proper hotel rooms You walk down these infernally long hallways And there was only one teensy tiny window facing a brick wall , It s a perfectly fine hotel if you re just staying for one night The rooms are basic but clean Small but okay for one person Nice clean bathrooms 
124093,Caesar Hotel, Our room was below ground level so quite dark and a bit claustrophobic Had to boil the kettle on the floor due to location of electric points We were in for breakfast at the last minute but food was removed from the buffet table before we had finished so having paid 28 we did not get the full package and felt rushed , Excellent shower good breakfast good location for Hyde Park which was what we needed Quiet at night and comfortable beds 
124094,Caesar Hotel, The size of the regular room Plumbing issues in toilet Smell of detergent in towels No Storage area in room nor mini fridge Wifi is not the best connection No utilization of terrace it s locked Rooms are not fresh because not the light nor the air circulate in the room Room service menu can be upgraded , The size of the executive room The Spanish smile on everyone s face Helpfulness
124095,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, The room is clean and cozy good for solo traveler Only 8 mins walk to underground central line and 11mins walk to paddington station Good location to stay 
124096,Caesar Hotel, Nothing , The hotel is in a quiet area and yet within easy walking distance of Bayswater Queensway and Paddington stations The hotel is decorated in a modern stylish manner inside The bedroom was very comfortable and spotlessly clean We didn t use the restaurant so cannot comment on that Reception staff were friendly helpful and welcoming 
124097,Caesar Hotel, The extractor fan in the bathroom was incredibly noisy The condensation from the shower covered every surface in the room including the inside of the wardrobe and the clothes in it A central London hotel that aspires to attract business travellers should really have a restaurant that serves breakfast earlier than 7 o clock in the morning Rooms really cheaply furnished , Location very good Restaurant in the evening was excellent 
124098,Caesar Hotel, I thought the family room would be bigger looked like a double room with a bunk bed squeezed in , Very helpful and flexible with the children and the room service excellent had our double upgraded too Would go back
124099,Caesar Hotel, The room service was a little slower than they said but wasn t enough to worry about , Everything was clean tidy and it was small little details that made our stay nice Beautiful rose and a small bit of fruit on the side for us was a nice touch 
124100,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and polite staff Perfect distance from Paddington station Time from leaving the hotel walking to Paddington and then finished through scurity control at Heathrow was eksactly 50 minutes on a friday morning Quiet area in the Queens gardens 
124101,Caesar Hotel, The room although we were given an upgrade to executive was still very small and no biscuits with the drinks facilities It was very clean and had all we needed though Unfortunately we didn t sample the breakfast due to the price we thought 16 each was a little high and there are plenty of eateries nearby which offer a better choice , The location is very close to tube stations a number of restaurants and to Hyde Park It s on a lovely Street which is very peaceful The staff are very pleasant 
124102,Caesar Hotel, The only thing that we didn t like was that during our 7 nights stay our shower gel shampoo were provided only 2times But generally it is nice place to stay, Location is great close to Queensway and Lancaster gate station which is on Central line Close to Oxford street for shopping and to Hyde Park for walking Room is modern Electric kettle is another plus Staff is friendly Room was on the 1st floor with view to street
124103,Caesar Hotel, Nothing, Friendly staff Clean rooms Location was within walking distance of 3 different underground stations and tourist attraction within Central London
124104,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, The hotel has a beautiful exterior and cool interior It is an easy walk to three underground stations and Hyde Park The staff are friendly and the whole hotel clean and comfortable 
124105,Caesar Hotel, Weren t told online about a 50 deposit but I wasn t a big issue the staff were lovely about it, Perfect location for a tourist extremely comfy beds excellent bathroom facilities 
124106,Caesar Hotel, Rooms are a bit cold for this season Dec In the last morning there was no hot water for 30 mins , Breakfast is great Location is perfect and prices are very reasonable compared to average London prices 
124107,Caesar Hotel, Trip was over too soon , What s not to like The rooms are exceptionally clean staff are friendly and professional there s a variety to choose from breakfast charges apply and the location is right bang in the centre of the city and within walking distance of 3 different underground stations London attractions and a high street
124108,Caesar Hotel, 50 holding fee not explained no towels as requested and add on fees not fully explained also Sofa bed also made up and should have been cheaper than a normal single bed , Location was good for all events we attended
124109,Caesar Hotel, The broadband connection was not great and so wifi could be hit and miss , The location is great the hotel is very modern and clean and the staff are extremely helpful 
124110,Caesar Hotel, The sloping ceiling in the shower it s fine unless ur tall we both hit our heads on the ceiling very minor issue though , Beautiful room very clean spacious by London standards beautiful decor Bed was very comfy 
124111,Caesar Hotel, Uncomfortable bed No service on phone no wifi could be located Parking rediculous Boyfriend had to sit in my car for an hour to stop getting a ticket as maximum parking was 4 hours permits should be offered My hotel room was able to be accessed by the window from the outside Food absolutely awful worst nights sleep Would never return here Feel robbed, Didn t like abything
124112,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, I was so pleased setting in Ceaser hotel the staff were way so kind the room they give just the one I want they take care of me during my stay I love this hotel as I am used to stay in this hotel since 9 years every time I visit london so happy thank you sooooooo much 
124113,Caesar Hotel, booking in a bit slow view from window was a grim looking vaulted pit if ye like dat sort of thing, decent sliding door at front car parking walk in shower decent wifi
124114,Caesar Hotel, In room Tea coffee making facilities minimal and kettle in room had an Italian voltage plug had to use our own multi adapter to use in power point No drinking water in room and no fridge , Very handy location Lovely and quiet hotel and surrounding area Clean and well kept accommodation Reception staff helpful 
124115,Caesar Hotel, Room service was appauling Phone in room wasn t working so had to order down stairs food took an hour to arrive and it was stone cold steak severely under done when asked for medium cooked Because of no phone had to have food in room until the morning which wasn t pleasant , In a fabulous location easy to reach from tube station Room was lovely and clean Staff very friendly
124116,Caesar Hotel, Booked superior room but was quite small but adequate and mirror near desk would have been helpful otherwise fab hotel will book again , Hotel staff very relaxed and helpful location very convienient for public transport and very peaceful as not on main road Rooms clean and service excellent and white company toiletries a lovely luxury 
124117,Caesar Hotel, The rooms are extra small funny smell in some of the rooms and so very disappointing considering is a 4 star hotel i woudnt pay that money for that quality the pictures on the web are very smartly done is just not fair on the customers to be sold something and receive something else me and my friends booked the same hotel but after one night they switched to another they were just as disapoonted ,No Positive
124118,Caesar Hotel, I have left behind a skirt part of a two piece ensemble in my room which I noticed immediately and called from the train to ask to locate it and keep it at the front desk so that when I returned to London in a couple of days I could pick it up I also followed up this request with a e mail asking to get back to me as soon as they can They did not do anything When I arrived two days later they told me they did not find anything but when I talked to the manager he assured me that he will call the cleaner and will get back to me shorty He never did The manager lied to me about his assistance knowing that I will leave next day and the whole problem will disappear with me You have a better chance to find anything you accidentally leave behind in a public place than in this hotel even if you try hard to get it back ,No Positive
124119,Caesar Hotel, Cleaning staff did not get around to cleaning my room and my wet towels were still in the room at 2pm no heated towel rail b c no one had stopped by even to change the towels There was also no desk chair when I arrived and there were no hooks anywhere Heating seemed intermittent , Proximity to Hyde Park and a good Greek restaurant The bathtub I request in advance was in fact on hand 
124120,Caesar Hotel, We did book a pyramid room 12 months in advanced to be told when we arrived they were all full bit disappointing as it was tbe reason why we booked so early,No Positive
124121,Caesar Hotel, The room was EXTREMELY small So much so that we could barely move around after moving in our luggage I suspect there is high time for renovation especially the bathroom although it was clean We could quite easily hear the conversation of people in the hall and next rooms Our room was situated directly opposite the elevator which we could hear very well , The hotel was nicely located in a quiet residential area near Paddington Station The front desk staff was friendly and helpful 
124122,Caesar Hotel, Were told before booked that we would be able to check in earlier than 2 00PM However upon arrival this was not the case and we had to pester to get one of our two rooms earlier but only by 15 minutes Poor customer service Apparently we were upgraded but the room was split level and felt very cramped Not the value for money it appeared when booking on line , Location
124123,Caesar Hotel, The Twin room is too tight for 2 people The terrace can t be utilized Plumbing issues Smell of towels Acid TV too small and very limited channels The cable of the coffee maker is too short to be connected to the wall , I stayed a double experience with the Caeser overall its all you need in London hospitality good room service and a connected location The executive room is great 
124124,Caesar Hotel, The rooms are very small but this is normal for London , To me this hotel is an ideal option of staying in the centre of London at reasonable price at London rates The hotel is walking distance from Paddington and Hyde park It s located on a very quiet street in a beautiful building The rooms bed linen and towels are clean Bed mattress is comfy 
124125,Caesar Hotel, size of rooms 1 room offered had a small double bed placed against the wall , Very small rooms some with very limited window in a remote corner no view etc 
124126,Caesar Hotel, Small room ok for a night or two , It is a great location but the room is small There s nowhere to put your luggage to unpack etc Super close to paddington station Kensington garden an easy walk to portabello markets plenty of nearby restaurants 
124127,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff Great extra touch of leaving a small cake in the room once they knew it was my birthday Will definitely stay again Easy to travel into central London
124128,Caesar Hotel, Noisy as they let an area for birthday parties No enough off road parking , Very comfortable bed Very professional and friendly staff members Good location in a quiet area and proximity to undergraound stations 
124129,Caesar Hotel, In the first room we were located the closet was broken they came immediately and tried to fix it finally when they couldn t they moved us to another The central heating opens in certain times in the afternoon it opens after 18 00 so we were feeling cold when it was off In addition cold air was coming through the wooden window , Hotel stuff was very polite In general terms the hotel was clean 
124130,Caesar Hotel, I thought the room was kind of small for three people but for the location I m sure that space is at a premium The room we had would be great for two people though , The location of the hotel is very convenient for public transportation and shopping the staff was gracious and helpful and the room was very clean The breakfast was also very good 
124131,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, As always super comfy beds and friendly staff The hotel room doesn t feel suffocating like the rest of the hotels in London and I love the European power sockets 
124132,Caesar Hotel, I felt the price was slightly too high for the rooms we got though it was neat clean There was no refrigerator and bathroom was a touch too small, Located on a Quiet street very close to the Hyde Park Caesar Hotel was easily accessible via London Tubes Staff were all very helpful and friendly
124133,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, Larger than average rooms for Central London I had booked a single room The bed was at least a 1 5 size bed if not a small double that was really good Nice and clean
124134,Caesar Hotel, The room was tiny and very uncomfortable For the price could have stayed somewhere nicer Staff on reception were at times rude , Great location with good facilities 
124135,Caesar Hotel, A little bit of a walk from the nearest tube, Worth every penny staying here The bed was divine and there looked to be a great bar and restaurant admittedly we didn t use them Staff were brilliant when carrying out my extra request of putting a pic of Jon Snow in the room The cleaner was fab and lined up all our shoes plus we got a little choccy Fantastic 
124136,Caesar Hotel, I was really annoyed when we checked iin When I made the booking and also in an e mail to the hotel last weekend I had requested that the two rooms mine and my friend s be situated close together next door or adjacent Also I had requested that both rooms be in a quiet area away from a lift What transpired was that were allocated rooms 230 and 110 on different floors Furthermore 110 was situated beside a lift The requests had been completely ignored I had booked over 2 months ago which meant that there was plenty time to allocate appropriate rooms Was the failure due to inefficiency on the part of the booking agent or the fault of the hotel On check in the hotel was fully booked so there was no chance of rectifying the problem , The bed was comfy 
124137,Caesar Hotel, food larger room, the hotel was ok the room was smaller than my en suite at home and the evening menu lacked many things I predominantly eat vegetarian so this was an issue with the menu on that evening and the staff though attentive had very little knowledge about menu choices 
124138,Caesar Hotel, The access card to my room didn t work at all I used it 3 times during my staying and each time I had to go down to reception to reactivate it Super annoying No robe , The room was super quiet and because I was on the 4th floor I enjoyed the natural light coming in 
124139,Caesar Hotel, The floor levels change a lot in the corridors with no markings and striped carpets disguising this so if you are a little unsure on your feet you may trip , The Caeser staff were complete stars They could not do enough to make your stay enjoyable The waiter in the bar overheard that it was my partners birthday so brought out a pudding with happy birthday iced onto the plate in chocolate Would definitely stay again in a heartbeat 
124140,Caesar Hotel, The noise from the floor s above wasn t ideal when in the room Due to high heels walking on Tiled floors This was fairly persistent throughout the night , Friendly staff at the reception a decent offering at Breakfast but both our room and the restaurant were in the basement all felt a little bit like living underground for the weekend 
124141,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel The staff was very friendly and helpful The location of the hotel was perfect and the area was very quite While it is located near the centre it also sufficiently isolated from all the usual noise that London is famous for 
124142,Caesar Hotel, Room looked run down and the bathroom was old dirty and had no toilet brush The fan on the bathroom didn t work either Breakfast was just coldfood and unless you ordered a full English breakfast eggs and stuff came at an additional charge Would not recommend the not English breakfast breakfast , 50mb s Internet great location and staff 
124143,Caesar Hotel, Staff more accommodating as we asked them to book us a taxi back to the station which they rang one firm which was fully booked and didn t try anywhere else We was already running late for our train Also they tried to charge 20 for two drinks We will be staying somewhere else next time,No Positive
124144,Caesar Hotel, Breakfast was not included which was a shame , The staff were fab and so helpful with everything we required and requested They couldn t do enough for you It was in a great location close to two metro stations and Hyde park A 45min walk to oxford rd and a 15 min walk to Bayswater It was a lovely hotel and definitely recommend it 
124145,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very hospitable and willing to help The hotel is conveniently located and it has very good facilities which made me enjoy a comfortable stay 
124146,Caesar Hotel, It was my 3rd time in Caeser however this was the worst room I got so far and as a frequent client I was not expecting it It was small had no water to drink and no other options to make tea or coffee Not quite next to elevator , Staff amazing as always
124147,Caesar Hotel, Thought breakfast at 16 each easy expensive considering we were able to get a cooked breakfast with tea for less than 5 each and this was within 200 mtrs from the hotel , The room was compact but comfortable and ideal as a base to explore London 
124148,Caesar Hotel, room was a bit small, Nice quiet location really well thought out design and just enough luxury to make the stay comfortable Would happily stay here again 
124149,Caesar Hotel, nothing much, Good array of amenities provided surrounded by 4 tube stations that are within a 7min walking radius there are food options and also convenience store located near bayswater station which is a 5min walk away
124150,Caesar Hotel, We felt a little claustraphobic in the basement room we had although to be fair there was a window and it opened for fresh air The bathroom door slid open independently which was amusing and a little embarassing , Overall the comfort standard of service cleanliness and general ambience of the Hotel is very good Breakfast was a highlight for all four of us 
124151,Caesar Hotel, The doors and walls should be more soundproof Our room was by the lift and we could hear it each time someone was using it , Location location location Excellent staff at the hotel Nice bar 
124152,Caesar Hotel, The hotel smelled like incense anyone with allergies might have a hard time The duvet was almost stiff as if it had tightened up in the wash But that is my only real complaint , The look of the place was lovely The room was small but perfect for a single The staff were incredibly helpful Easy access to subways and especially the train and park 
124153,Caesar Hotel, The hotel wanted to charge 16 for breakfast which was eye watering so we went elsewhere for breakfast , Good friendly professional staff lovely room and comfortable bed For central London reasonable price 
124154,Caesar Hotel, on the same street there was only few Greek and Turkish restaurants but on the streets near there were more suggestions , The location was good we walked about 38 min to reach oxford street Many underground stations were close by To go back to airport it was 20 25 min drive with UBER and that was a good thing The staff was extremely helpful and nice Thank you Rita for all the assistance you gave us and for being sharp at customer service and always suggesting helpful hints We truly loved this hotel 
124155,Caesar Hotel, When we booked neither photo or description informed us our room would be an attic room which was smaller than we thought we had booked the bathroom was especially small , Liam was friendly receptionist helpful Location was in a quiet area an easy ride to major sights 
124156,Caesar Hotel, The walls were thin I could hear the person in the room next to me moving about in the morning and it woke me up, The location was great Gym facilities were good and the room and bathroom reasonably spacious by London standards The street was quiet so there was no outside noise Reception staff were helpful
124157,Caesar Hotel, Staff walking through hallways was very noisy didn t get a good nights sleep and the double bed was two wins pushed together was gap inbetween beds, Rooms were clean and staff were friendly
124158,Caesar Hotel, I had to cut short my stay by one day and had informed the reception that I would be checking out on 17th morning itself and confirmed that they should not be charging for 17th Next morning I was surprised to see I was billed for 17th They said I need to get in touch with Booking com for refund I did send a mail to Booking com but no response received so far This is my first experience with Booking com and I am expecting revert on my refund asap , Overall location and ambience was good 
124159,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, The staff at this hotel are very competent and genuinely welcoming The room and all areas were spotlessly clean bed comfortable everything worked Most of all the outstanding attitude of staff put me at my ease and made me feel I was in good hands throughout my stay 
124160,Caesar Hotel, Nothing at all In fact we ve booked a deluxe double room for next year, Everything was sleek and professional Bed was comfy and the toiletries were top class 
124161,Caesar Hotel, Nothing i enjoyed my stay , Great atmosphere at hotel clean and bright great facilities comfortable clean and spacious hotel room I love the neighborhood convenient safe and right next to Hyde Park 
124162,Caesar Hotel, Tired room bathroom Cupboard doors awkward to open and falling off runners Kettle could only be plugged into bespoke socket on wall adjacent to bed No chips on room service Room too cold Had to turn on radiator valve to get heat Air con not able to adjust higher than 22 degrees , Santi Excellent customer service Comfortable bed
124163,Caesar Hotel, The r staring was a little slow and the food arrived slightly cold Other than this minor issue We had no problems , Excellent staff with a positive friendly attitude Burning incense in the lobby gave a nice relaxed feel Also the luggage storage facility was great as we arrived 2 hours early for check in 
124164,Caesar Hotel, The rooms were very cramped with little space for a suitcase There was nowhere to hang one s clothes or place toiletries in the bathroom , We spent 5 weeks travelling the UK and the Caesar had the comfiest beds pillows out of all the places we stayed 
124165,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, I was here for the second time and I really enjoyed my stay They gave me an upgrade for a double room and I was welcomed with a free bottle of water in my room and a discount voucher for breakfast I much apppreciate this wonderful hotel and I m happy that I found such a wonderful place to stay There is nothing to complain Friendly staff clean and modern rooms excellent service and the hotel is very close to the public transport I will come back definitively I highly recommend this hotel 
124166,Caesar Hotel, grout around tiles in shower is grubby, Super comfy bed Quiet location but close to underground stations park shops and central London Staff went out of their way to accomodate our requests eg late checkout breakfast in bed
124167,Caesar Hotel, Where was my comfy robe this time , The people at the reception were super friendly accommodating all my requests Good job guys Needless to mention the super comfy bed and how spacious the room was 
124168,Caesar Hotel, Staff weren t interested at all Bar staff were good but reception disappointing clearly couldn t be bothered not impressed Also debited my card without consent , Bed was comfortable
124169,Caesar Hotel, Food needs to be improved The roomservice staff is amazing and friendly though , Nice big room Comfy pillows Good soaking tub and nice toiletries including bath salts Good location near Hyde Park and and close to tube stations EXCELLENT wifi Very friendly staff
124170,Caesar Hotel, That I was asked to pay 50 deposit upfront on top of my booking I think this is just rude and conveys a message that clients in this case me not trustworthy , The location was great 
124171,Caesar Hotel, I was planning on having a late morning in bed both Saturday and Sunday but I was disturbed by all the people going to breakfast or the cleaning staff so I was up by 8 , The bed was huge and extra comfy Loved how spacious the room and the bathroom were the room that I was had natural light in coming in and I was also lucky enough to have sunny days while I was visiting The staff were all very helpful and nice good location it took me 30 minutes to walk to Oxford Street plus the surroundings are beautiful in the fall very comfortable room loved the details as well chocolate and water on the house all the kits available in the bathroom the hotel even had a gym I will definitely be going back 
124172,Caesar Hotel, You know how hotels have a scent throughout the public spaces I did not like theirs It was a heavy incense smell that triggered my asthma and stopped me from going to the restaurant , The people were very nice and helpful and the location is close to everything without being in the middle of it all 
124173,Caesar Hotel, The room was extremely small Narrow hall way couldn t lug my suitcase in There was no space to even open my suitcase Only option was to put it on the bed Really really tiny room for the price they charge , The location was great 
124174,Caesar Hotel, The rooms were not sound proof at all and we could could hear the people in the neighbouring rooms all night every night the sounds of snoring T shower kettle we could hear every word being spoken and then felt very self conscious about any noises we were making even though no one was doing anything particularly noisy at all It made it very uncomfortable and we did not have a good sleep Also the door in our bathroom which was a sliding door did not fully close and thus it was not great to not have privacy in the bathroom and to be able to have no choice but to hear each other using the toilet The breakfast which was complimentary in our last stay was not in this one and we found it to be ridiculously over priced even with a discount voucher which saw the beak fast at two pounds less Sadly we will not be staying here again even though we love the location nor would feel comfortable recommending this hotel to anyone we ultimately did not have a restful or relaxing stay There are many other cheaper hotels inclusive of breakfast in the area I would strongly encourage these issues to be improved upon Thanks , The location was great and the staff helpful and hotel clean 
124175,Caesar Hotel, This hotel is OLD The room needs to be renovated The furniture is cheap and falling apart Walls of the room were not sound proofed Listened to the lady next door talking on the phone The floors everywhere are cheap plastic wood uneven and spongy Burning incense in the lobby is disgusting The smell is nauseating , The staff is very good Friendly and helpful Hotel is close to Center of city Two good elevators 
124176,Caesar Hotel, The breakfast is obviously overpriced I preferred to have breakfast at Pret a Manger it s 7 min walk and is two times less expensive with way wider variety of breakfast options, Location is perfect as it s a short walking distance to four tube stations close to Hyde park for morning running My executive single room 131 was ok the Ed was comfy the bathroom was not that tiny as it s normally in London hotels The staff was friendly and helpful Fast check in and check out Wi fi worked well
124177,Caesar Hotel, Everything else Slow reception staff language barriers small rooms strange uneven floor throughout the hotel tired decoration and marks on the walls paintings barely any power outlets tv picture was terrible quality I ve no idea how this is a 4 hotel presumably nothing to do with what travellers actually want and more to do with face value seemingly decent facilities , The rose that came with room service And the free White Company bathroom items 
124178,Caesar Hotel, Everything I had the worst experience ever with my best friend Really sad that the management does not really care for all the problems that is going on , I didnt like anythig Room too small Asked for an upgrade it was denied I told the reception that I was staying for 6 days not 2 or 3 she said it doesn t matter we dont upgrade people if you want another room you have to pay more The bathroom had a horrible odor and we complained The AC sistem was ridiculous we have to call every night for them to put it on In our 4 day the sheets where dirty and I have to tell them to change sheets They did not vaccum the bathroom Everything we ever asked it was a NO answer The reception is awful for a 4 star boutique hotel The worst part we ask one night where to go for a Italian Restaurant they send us to this cheap place call I believe Bonissimo I had a pasta with Salmon The next day I woke up with an alergy all over my face went to pharmacy for medication The reception never said Hello or even Good Night they are not friendly at all I can go on and on just an awful experience with so many other hotels to choose I think Booking com should not place this hotel as a 4 star hotel 
124179,Caesar Hotel, The room was a little bit squeezy so were the corridors this made it a little difficult for us with big heavy luggage , The service by the staff at the front desk were very good 
124180,Caesar Hotel, The walls are very thin and you can hear everything in the next room I had to move rooms because a noisy group were very loud in the next room The hotel manager was lovely though and moved me to another quieter room without problem , Staff friendly and helpful moved me to another quieter room without any hesitation The restaurant food was very good try the steak location is only 10 mins from paddington station which was great 
124181,Caesar Hotel, Location is a bit of a walk from nearest station Breakfast is expensive it was good Door could not open to balcony , Good modern clean room Good WiFi Free newspapers Spacious single room with balcony Free chocolate every night 
124182,Caesar Hotel, i cannot think of any thing that needs to be changed keep it up , breakfast good meals from the bar several excellent quiet room friendly helpful reception
124183,Caesar Hotel, No problems at all Great base for London outings , A secret hideaway from the hustle and bustle of central London A short walk from Queensway Notting Hill and Paddington tubes Compact but comfortable room on split level decent double bed stylish deco and bar Friendly service and good value for money 
124184,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, Close to the stations Paddington Bayswater and Queensway supermarkets shops restaurants and Hyde park Located in very quiet area Clean room and great room amenity
124185,Caesar Hotel, size of room which nothing much can be done how the shower tray fills up with water when one showers, front entrance and look of lobby location of course professional staff cleanliness
124186,Caesar Hotel, Room and bathroom were smaller than anticipated Breakfast seemed a little overpriced and therefore we did not take up the special offer Lots of eating establishments close by , Good location comfortable beds and air conditioned rooms Friendly staff on reception 
124187,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel in good location close to Paddington Station great for Heathrow Express and Hyde Park Friendly staff and clean comfortable room made for a pleasant short stay in London 
124188,Caesar Hotel, Room Service menu should have few more options for I natinal travelers Room size is smaller for a standard double bed room , Location and Cleanliness
124189,Caesar Hotel, No TV remote control in room and the electrical socket is not in proper function The floor of corridor on Ground floor is not flat which cause accidents easily There are quite bad situation outside hotel such as there are too many men or women to ask you to buy sex services on the street It is annoying It is located in between two tube station which requiring to walk at least 15 mins to walk to one of them, Politeness and patience of front desk staff and 24 hours operations of Bar in the hotel 
124190,Caesar Hotel, Would have liked hot water in the shower to be slightly hotter and we seemed to have problems getting wifi but overall a great stay thank you, Very happy with hotel nice extra touches and helpful friendly staff 
124191,Caesar Hotel, As ever in London pricing is interesting Room very nice but small , Great location Central yet quiet Friendly and helpful staff keen to help keen to please Lovely fresh decor Tasteful and well appointed room nice bathroom Comfy bed Efficient if slightly noisy aircon Reliable wi fi

124193,Caesar Hotel, Room was a little on the small side but liveable for 2 days in London, Nice welcome beautiful modern interior VERY comfy bed good tea coffee facilities great air con large shower
124194,Caesar Hotel, We were near the lifts on the fourth floor and the walls seemed to be quite thin We could hear everyone going in and out of the lifts and neighbouring lifts But we still managed to sleep at night so wasn t a massive problem , Really friendly staff with a comfy bed Really close to Hyde Park and an easy walk into Hyde Park Good price for a 4 star hotel in London 
124195,Caesar Hotel, Probably the most uncomfortable bed I ve ever slept on Room felt a little like a cell with only a window looking into a meter squared courtyard Other rooms in the hotel may well be lovely but I wasn t impressed Bathroom was also tiny , Location was great staff friendly Compared to other hotels in this area I d say it was good value

124199,Caesar Hotel, Room was small not much space to put anything Bathroom fan stayed on for a very long time after light turned off We were on first floor and smoke from smokers outside hotel inevitably wafted in the room , Location comfy bed Very functional set up
124200,Caesar Hotel, The housekeeping were over zealous in removing rubbish from the room The housekeeping was often not finished until very late in the afternoon , Location and price Everything we needed on the visit was close by 
124201,Caesar Hotel, They didn t give us any towel the 3rd day of our staying room small and NO Mini Bar not even Water in The Room had to go and buy everyday , Comfy beds pillow Location good 10 mins from Underground Station was clean and with nice surrounding quiet 
124202,Caesar Hotel, Tiny room with a small desk and no chair to sit at it on so not ideal for me seeing as it was a business trip , Lovely quiet hotel with very friendly and accommodating staff Lots of gorgeous White Co toiletries supplied

124207,Caesar Hotel, Room cleaning a bit slow off the blocks I stayed a week and often came back at 3 00 4 00 pm to find the room un prepared, Very clean comfortable and nicely designed hotel
124208,Caesar Hotel, None , These guys are the new kids on the block Beautiful classic building recently upgraded to a very high quality Took a single room and it was a great deal as the bed was still big enough and there was more living space around it than a double one including a nice little desk Rita at reception was very helpful in sorting my checkout one day early in no time Lovely AD 5th century mosaics on display in the lobby area Fresh grapes chocolate covered nuts a red rose and mineral water in a glass bottle accompanied by a welcome note signed by the GM I will definitely return highly recommend the place Lancaster Gate station or Queensway are short walks away but a number of double decker buses also cover the area so that you start your day with a nice journey overlooking Hyde Park rather than counting the stops on the Tube 
124209,Caesar Hotel, Slight leak from screen from shower over bath meant the floor got a bit wet but that was minor and did not detract from experience , Quiet and pleasant location Comfortable bed Friendly and very accommodating staff I booked my accommodation at a last minute discount rate online and when I arrived my room wasn t cleaned properly the staff upgraded me immediately which was really lovely and much appreciated 
124210,Caesar Hotel,No Negative, The cupboard door fell off during our stay and although nobody was hurt the health and safety hazard was totally overlooked The hotel room service manager came across as rude and abrupt ending the conversation with our chef doesn t have the time Overall a little disappointed with our stay

124215,Caesar Hotel, We were upgraded to a luxury suite which was nice for the relatively cheap price for London Pity that small details like slightly wobbly not perfectly painted night tables no sockets next to bed doors with fingerprints and a kettle with a European plug that has to be positioned on the floor to fit the one European socket in the room make this experience less than perfect , Good value for money for London Very close to Paddington station and Hyde Park
