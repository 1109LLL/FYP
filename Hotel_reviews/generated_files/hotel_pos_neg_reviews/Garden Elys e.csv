40609,Garden Elys e, Hotel itself is nice and modern although a few things needs improvement such as the pillows and the layout bathroom door right next to the bed and no bathroom fan Rooms are a bit small and the elevator is slow For a 4 star at this price it s not the best value The biggest problem however was with one particular staff member Charles the luggage porter While waiting to check in we left our bags with him in storage Upon attempting to retrieve them we were told the luggage would be delivered to the room but it did not arrive We were told that Charles was very busy so we just asked to take the bags ourselves Staff refused to let us take our bags even though we clearly identified them The staff called Charles who complained that we had interrupted his lunch and then he also refused to let us take our bags claiming it was his job to provide this service and that we had no choice to take the bags ourselves The luggage hostage situation continued until we basically had to issue an ultimatum Charles responded by laughing and then walking off We have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never seen such a thing happen like this before It was more than poor training he clearly was treating us either differently or more poorly than he would other clients The other staff of the hotel including the manager were quite helpful and friendly , The hotel is in a very good location amidst many hotels and restaurants Rooms are renovated and modern Garden in the back of the hotel is nice 
40610,Garden Elys e, Breakfast is way too expensive Besides there are tons of cafes and boulangeries in the neighborhood The bar doesn t have a draft beer but the Frog XIV is right around the corner The internet signal strength was good but the log in procedure was a bit annoying and the bandwidth was pretty low Don t expect to stream Netflix but you can check your e mail , A nice clean modern hotel within walking distance of Place de Trocadero Eiffel Tower Just around the corner from one of my favorite brewpubs in Paris the Frog XIV Expensive but not compared to other hotels in the area One Exceptional thing about this hotel It s probably the quietest hotel I ve ever stayed in when in Paris 
40611,Garden Elys e, WiFi was a bit complex and slow With so many good providers around perhaps the hotel might review the quality of this service I appreciate your reasons for the survey but I trave globally and just cannot spend time on lengthy surveys on every hotel I stay in Maybe you could stick to essentials, We were very pleased with the stay and we have been here many times 
40612,Garden Elys e, Extra charge for breakfast with 22 seems quite high , Renovated room has a big space as for Paris Very convenient bathroom and smart located plug in for mobiles etc Tasty breakfast Helpful staff 
40613,Garden Elys e, Nothing, Comfortable bed with modern clean decor and lots of luxurious little touches Reception staff very pleasant and helpful Great location very central 
40614,Garden Elys e, The reception did not accept the booking even though the client had a print out of the booking Only after arguing with them did they finally accept it ,No Positive
40615,Garden Elys e, The usual expensive and tight central Paris cribs but with an added bonus of on site parking pay extra provided you pre book If you don t pre book you re on your own , Fine Nice room window no view clean wifi works Got room no 666 whoever was numbering the rooms thought it be funny did not find it hilarious personally Great location 
40616,Garden Elys e, A little more coffee cream sugar in the little drawer and every day not occasionally A clock showing time at night would be a great addition to the nice clean room and very comfortable bed ,No Positive
40617,Garden Elys e, Room size Could have been a little bigger , Location was very good In a quiet street but very close to where the hustle bustle was Walking distance from major attractions 
40618,Garden Elys e,No Negative, Few minutes walk from the metro Close to major sights Plenty of bars restaurants close to the hotel Secure parking outside hotel Very friendly staff 
40619,Garden Elys e, Noise at night room tightness Also limited food selection for the breakfast, Proximity to Champs Elysee Eiffel Tower metro station supermarket pharmacy Cordial bellman staff at the breakfast restaurant
40620,Garden Elys e, The guy at reception who greeted us was a little bit grumpy He could have smiled more even if we didn t speak French He was explaining things with a bossy attitude like we did everything wrong I appreciate though his effort to speak English The other lady who checked us out was all nice and smiling The internal doors in the room could have been a little bit more modern There is a huge contrast between the modern things around even TV and the internal doors But that s a very little detail maybe an advice for future , I enjoyed the pillows I even took a picture of the tag to buy some for myself All clean They accepted to take care of our luggagge free of charge for a few hours after out check out 
40621,Garden Elys e, The male receptionist approach was a little full on this was kind of off putting as we was too young girls Breakfast was 22 over priced for what you was offered We orderd a taxi twice from reception both times they come 10 minutes early and put an extra 8 to the our journey without informing us, Waitress s polite and friendly Bed was very comfortable Location very good
40622,Garden Elys e, Was surprised with series of extra charges which I was never informed would incur an extra charge For example asking the concierge to book a taxi incurred 2 50 per person Despite the act of booking a taxi not changing for the amount of travelers , Location is amazing 5 minutes from Eiffel tower 10 min from the arc de triumph and 15 from the middle of Champs Elys e 
40623,Garden Elys e, The extra cost for breakfast seemed very high and I therefore declined , Quiet location in the heart of Trocadero with a lovely garden for all guests to enjoy 
40624,Garden Elys e, Dinner service would be nice , Very nice boutique hotel It was clean and in process of remodeling Staff was excellent friendly and helpful The breakfast buffet was very good 
40625,Garden Elys e, The walls are a bit thin so you could hear loud and clear all the noise on the hallway and also the windows you could hear all the noise coming from the building next to the garden didn t matter much though cause we were pretty tired from the long hours of walking and visiting, Location breakfast staff
40626,Garden Elys e,No Negative, My brother and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Garden Elysee The location was better than we expected and the staff was wonderful I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
40627,Garden Elys e, A bit of drilling in the morning Garden was out of use , Staff at desk were very welcoming Location nice and quiet but near to Eiffel tower Bed very comfy shower excellent 
40628,Garden Elys e, The fact they only give you two paper cups for tea for a stay of two days and don t refill your teabags coffee sachets in your tea compartment I had too ring reception to bring us new tea bags coffee sachet more bottle water for the kettle and also another glass cup which we only had one and there was two of us staying I do think if it s a 4 that should just be mandatory , The room was comfortable and the bed the showers were great plenty of hot water when needed at anytime of the day
