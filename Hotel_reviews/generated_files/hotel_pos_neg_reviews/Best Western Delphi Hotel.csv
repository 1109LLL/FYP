270811,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The bathrooms are very small but shower is full size, Comfortable large bed later on free snacks fruit and coffee available in dining room Getting into central Amsterdam was easy tram just round the corner on opposite side of the road and getting back take number 5 or 24 heading away from Centraal station get off at Gerrit 
270812,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The water pressure of the shower was a pit weak , I had a nicely decorated cozy room for one on the 4th floor In the mornings the chimney next to my window woke me up with the smell of freshly made pancakes The breakfast It s delicious and nicely diverse even if the sausages and bacon isn t quite your thing I especially loved the mushrooms coffee and the small dutch pancakes I really appreciated that in addition to basic milk also a vegetarian option Alpro s almond milk was served Everything felt fresh and hand made It was also nice that you don t have to pay for the breakfast before actually checking what is served All in all the breakfast was good value for the money 15 Free coffee tea vegetables small muffins croissants etc available in the first floor outside the breakfast hours Also a possibility for take away cups Location The area is rather peaceful but with great public transportation e g trams no 24 and 5 which goes to the city central Also the Amsterdam Zuid train station train to the airport and RAI conference center are less than 20 min walk away Really friendly and helpful staff Possibility to leave your luggage to the hotel before the check in and after the check out The room was quiet and peaceful even though the elevator located almost next to it 
270813,Best Western Delphi Hotel, We arrived around 10 o clock after 14 hours of travelling so we were really tired Early check in was not possible However they took care of our luggage so in the meantime we went to know Amsterdam , Location is really good if you travel for turism Hotel is located in a nice and quite area of Amsterdam and well located in terms of transportation tram and bus stops are close Museums are 10 minutes from there And they rent bikes I loved that Rooms were nice and clean 
270814,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Please take away those stuffy pillows in the breakfast area The design of renovation could have been a bit more modern and light , An easy hotel for a few days in Amsterdam Breakfast is excellent The bathroom was nicely designed and renovated 
270815,Best Western Delphi Hotel,No Negative, Surprisingly spacious room on the 1st floor Very clean and comfortable About a 10min walk to centre but the trams were on the doorstep another option into the centre Great location in a nice part of the city We did not have breakfast here as we wanted to explore local options great bakeries with decent coffee and lovely pastries for around five euros Lovely bars and restaurants and shops all minutes away we did not feel need to take the tram Few minutes walk to Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum set in a lovely park 
270816,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The room was very small unlike the photos One of the staff was extremely rude to the point where I was forced to complain as he shouted at me over the phone and did not apologise Other staff who were lovely had to apologise for him , The breakfast was lovely Very clean and comfortable 
270817,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The bathrooms were a trifle small but we would still make use of the hotel on future visits , The beds the knowledgeable friendly staff and the location 
270818,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Very small room Very small place for breakfast there is actually no restaurant just a lounge space next to check in , Good location clean and nice hotel Complementary coffee tea water some fruit nice 
270819,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Very abrupt staff Room was a small double but it was so small we couldn t walk around the bed My search asked for hotel in Leidesplein area of Amsterdam but it wasn t we had to get trams or taxis It was my Partners birthday and I had requested wine or beer in our room as a surprise I didn t get it even though hotel had said they would ,No Positive
270820,Best Western Delphi Hotel, A small double Room is really really small When the hotel is full you have to stand om Line to get breakfast , The Hotel is placed in a quiet Street but yet close to the city Nice breakfast 
270821,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The rooms are really small and building is dated dilapidated My shower was missing a curtain door and they didn t refill my coffee sachets overnight , Bed was comfortable and water pressure was decent in the shower
270822,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The staff was really nice except of the manager I think she was the manager She was not customer friendly at all When I just asked her a simple question the way she told me it was not possible was really cold unprofessional and defensive Not the right way treating your customers and influenced my mood before a very important business meeting , The area around the hotel is nice and quiet 
270823,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The beds are hard but more strange the matrasses do not stay in place they slide off to the side , We like the location the area and the free service for tea and coffee and the rooms 
270824,Best Western Delphi Hotel, There was not enough coffee sachets in the room 2 a day is not enough, Location was great really fancy part of Amsterdam some nice bars and restaurants around it and one simple team into the centre The room was bigger than expected and really nice beautiful bathroom very comfortable and overall a really pleasant stay 
270825,Best Western Delphi Hotel, For my taste the new bed with matrass was quite hard , A cosy comfortabele hotel with an easy atmosphere tea and coffee available all day even a plateau with cake The location is away from the busy tourist area yet not far from the museums and close to some high end shops 
270826,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Super tiny room and bed Old fashioned with stained carpet They just put toiletries the first day but I was staying for 3 nights , Location was good Not in the city center but walking distance to major museums and Vondelpark 
270827,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Welcome check in was the worst I ve experienced This week I ve been through France Belgium Holland and Germany and this was a bloke who really didn t want to be there or us to be there Grumpily told us it was 21euros a day to park on the street , Room had a balcony so I could smoke Problem is some stoners had had the same idea and there was old joints on the railings 
270828,Best Western Delphi Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely LOVED my stay here I m from the UK and took my husband away for a surprise weekend in Amsterdam the room was so big the beds were really comfortable my husband wanted to know what kind of pillows they had as he even wanted to buy his own Were a young couple aged 25 27 it was in a great location as the hotel was a short walk from a tram stop which took you into city center with the help of google maps we got around incredibly easily with a 24 hour tram pass bought from the hotel we were able to get around the city with ease 
270829,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The hotel is very small and oldfashioned not what I was expecting after seeing the photos For this price in Germany I can find a high level hotel like Ritz or Marriott There is no fridge mini bar in the room no shelf in the bathroom the safe is on the bottom And the biggest minus is that they took the money twice from my credit card That s disappointing , Hotel staff is very kind free tea and water is also a plus The atmosphere is wonderful and the hotel is very comfortable placed 
270830,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Cold air from air conditioner blew directly onto some tables in restaurant , Breakfast good ability to get morning tea good Comfortable bed very friendly helpful staff 
270831,Best Western Delphi Hotel, A bit pricey small rooms limited coffee cachets supply , Nice hotel situated on a lovely lush green road close to RAI exhibition centre Friendly staff clean rooms 
270832,Best Western Delphi Hotel, They gave a room without AC Please be very cautious about that It could be terrible in a summer day The room was terribly dark it was impossible to get some work done so I do not recommend it for business travelers at all, I liked that the guess room where they had free cakes tea coffee and fruit for 24h 
270833,Best Western Delphi Hotel, 1 Washroom light switch also connected to very loud ventilator OK during shower but unwelcome at other times particularly during the night should be 2 separate switches 2 Television is extra charge for local networks not complaining about rental movies that always cost extra 3 Breakfast in hotel very expensive and not good value e g no fresh eggs poor selection of fruits no hot cereal such as porridge , Comfortable quiet and good staff 
270834,Best Western Delphi Hotel, we were this time unpleasantly surprised by the bad manners and rudeness of some of the staff members the room was nice but not clean and the rusty bathtub was quite awful , we have stayed at the hotel several times because the beautiful and central location and the intimate seize and cozy atmosphere of the hotel The rooms with the balconies viewing the lovely gardens are very pleasant too
270835,Best Western Delphi Hotel, When i booked the hotel i was really excited as the photos looked fantastic and looked like i could be staying in a proper 5 star hotel untill i got there i did book a comfort room but got upgraded to a superior room so i was thinking fantastic this is going to be brilliant Well got in to the room and it was a baby blue coloured room with a nice big stain over the wall and lock was broken off in the bathroom so when i just the door went to leave and it was locked Both me and the misses ended up trying to open this lock for a good 30 mins and i wouldnt wish anybody to get locked in there by themself Cracked mirror and yellow stains round the window No idear so kept the blind shut No kettel in room even tho i requested and was not informed i could not fill up my baby bottles in the room so i had to use the coffee machine down stairs in reception Which wasnt to bad but still a inconvenience Really was expecting more from the hotel room specialy when i asked am i in the right room and the said its a upgrade and followed on with that they was refurbished 4 months ago , Very nice they was able to accommodate a baby crib for is which looked clean and comfortable beds and bathroom was quite nice and was clean 
270836,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Cleanliness hair on new towels though the bed was very comfortable I got bed bugs , Location staffs were lovely and helpful lovely room size very comfortable interior for eyes coffee and tea is there all the time 
270837,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The rooms are really small if not to say tiny There were refurbishing works on my floor and I got my room in the middle of the works I m sure it is temporary but still it was veyry unconvinient , The location is good and the staff is really friendly and helpful
270838,Best Western Delphi Hotel, They are under constant renovation so it can be noisy in the day , I was robbed in Amsterdam and the hotel staff took care of me very well and were very understanding
270839,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The internet connection is extremely slow and it constantly disconnects One of the mattresses was not horizontal and was not comfortable to sleep , I stayed in this hotel several times and had a great time In general the hotel is really good for the price it has
270840,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Unfortunately I got bed bugs during my stay The bites showed up the day I left and they proceeded to get worse as the week went on until I finally went to the doctor s and was diagnosed It s a shame too because the hotel seemed lovely I had noticed several other types of bugs ones the eye could see obviously and was able to eliminate them myself I thought about asking for another room but convinced myself there was nothing to worry about Thus unfortunately I would not recommend this place until they have resolved the problem , The staff was very helpful and polite The hotel is conveniently located near a tram stop that takes you to the center of town writhin 10 minutes You can also reach the airport relatively cheaply using this method Simply take tram 5 to the Zuin stop and hop on the metro you may pay 3 and then take either platform 3 or 4 to the airport you can follow the indicators on the signs 
270841,Best Western Delphi Hotel, The staff in the reception are not polite There is one guy in the reception who got angry and wasnt polite because i wanted to print a paper And the first night when we ordered an extra bed he almost yelled at us because we told him about it at night though we ordered it online before , The hotel is very cozy and clean Free coffee all day was the best thing The rooms are big comfy and very clean The hotel is in a quiet area which is a plus after partying in amsterdam The tram is very close as well about 3 minutes walking
270842,Best Western Delphi Hotel, 1 there were 2 huge armchairs in the relatively small room which blocked the passage around the bed totally unnecessary 2 i had booked a double room but we got two beds next to each other impossible to sleep together with my partner without falling in through the gap between the two beds , staff we helpful

270846,Best Western Delphi Hotel, There is no way to regulate tempetature so I ended up sleeping in a warm room No drinks after 23 hours Poor wifi , Breakfast and location It s in the middle of the city close to the treinstation and to the office of my company 
270847,Best Western Delphi Hotel, Old TV gave a grimey feel to the room with the clunky remote Housekeeping woke me up at 9 30 on sunday morning and tried to get in until I jumped out of bed and told them not to Then at 11 30 I was getting out of the shower and they tried the door again what is wrong with them it wasn t even check out time yet , The decor is very luxurious Breakfast was ok nice options Reception staff was very polite and helpful
