395211,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Nothing , Upon arrival on a hot muggy day we were greeted with a smiling face and a Heineken beer tap right there on the check in counter First decision made The room was fully equipped with great A C and the most comfy bed and pillows we d had on the trip With the next morning free after a lovely breakfast we were happy to be able to book bikes for 3 hours from the hotel No helmets available of course 
395212,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, A bit expensive for what it offers no extra facilites like a gym or a swimming pool , Close to the Central Station 20 min walking and the city centre but at a quiet place The rooms are nice and very clean the bed truly comfortable Expensive as all hotels of this kind in Amsterdam The staff were very kind One thing I really loved was that at the reception you may order some food and hot drinks even late at night we arrived to the hotel at 00 30 and were able to order a pizza and hot milk

395214,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Access for Taxi had to haul our luggage over cobble stones for quite some distance to ain hotel access Price is very high for type of accommodation , Very good choice at breakfast all the hot food was very good fresh and perfectly cooked Easy tram links to rail station cruise terminal and Rijksmuseum

395216,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, breakfast could be more various and during the mornings it was a little difficult to find a free table probably due to high season , comfy beds clean hotel nice staff peaceful area
395217,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Absolutely nothing bad to say about the hotel But Booking com was not really there for us regarding a reservation error misunderstanding When we called booking com to find a solution to our problem we were left with our problem more or less alone the only alternative offered by booking com to split up and to acommodate half of out 5 people family incl 3 kids in another hotel in the RedLight district Nice alternative Thanks to Hampton again they offered more than 1 hour of their time and went the extra mile to find the perfect solution for us , The front desk staff was amazing They helped us with every little detail and went the extra mile to help us even in several situations that had nothing to do with our hotel reservation Thank you so much especially for your first aid kit and your promise that you would never forget us We also loved the breakfast food and display was excellwnt and very clean Thank you 
395218,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No room service very basic food menu you have to go down to reception for No mini fridge or bottled water in the room No where to eat or buy snacks near the hotel Aircon a bit too strong and hard to control the temperature , Nice comfortable room nice staff Clean spacious rooms with modern furniture Close to tram line makes a trip to the city a 15 minute commute Basic but sufficient breakfast buffet The staff is very nice and accommodating 
395219,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, They did all travel days money guarantee on my card one week before arrival which is not rational and formal I booked free cancelation until two day before booking date but they did whatever they wanted , The staff and breakfast was very good

395221,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Staff very helpful and friendly Lovely breakfast Comfy bed and pillows Supermarket and restaurants within 10 mins walking distance Very quiet in hotel Lovely bathroom and shower Spacious room 
395222,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The frontage of property was very ordinary with cobblestones and steps making it very difficult to access with luggage Also no access to front door for cars The front didn t give a good impression but once inside it was totally different, Breakfast was plentiful and delicious and breakfast room was also very pleasantly decorated Rooms were also spacious and pleasant 
395223,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, There were no bottles of water in the room only tea and coffee , Absolutely fantastic Very friendly and helpful hotel service Delicious breakfast large selection of products tasty waffles Room exactly as on the picture clean and spacious Good location safe and quiet neighborhood but still close to the centre 3 stops 13 minutes to central station by tram I really recommend this hotel Perfect place for a few days in Amsterdam 
395224,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Breakfast is good warm buffet but it s the exact same every day Variety would be welcome , I recommend this hotel highly The service is excellent as are the rooms They are spotless The location is good it s not central but the tram down the street brings you to the center within a couple of minutes 
395225,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Perhaps if there was a cycling coach available I would have been less scared to cycle in Amsterdam I found it a daunting prospect , Surprised by the gym wish I brought some sneakers 
395226,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Great hotel It s not located in the center but easy to get there by tram The bed is comfortable the breakfast was delicious and fresh with many options But the best part was staff everyone was really friendly and helpfull 
395227,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Unfortunately I met a desk manager with very rude manners In addition although I paid the bill by cash after 15 days from my check out I still have my credit card blocked for the equivalent sum of money , The breakfast
395228,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Liked everything , Located in walking distance to Amsterdam centre main train station or There is a train tram stop about 300 yards from hotel reception Great breakfast friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel 
395229,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, On check out the hotel tried to charge me an extra 71 euros due to an error they said was made when the payment was taken When I booked the hotel it said payment would be taken at the hotel on arrival although the money was taken just a couple of days after booking was placed The lady on the front desk told me that it was their error but I needed to pay the 71 Euros I refused and was then accused of being difficult and then she said that she d not speak to me any further I guess she just expected me to say yes that s fine and pay her All I did was question it and find that it was an error that they had made and not one that I had made I also said that they should have informed me of the error on check in not on check out which I believe would have been the correct way to deal with this issue ,No Positive
395230,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Everything was fabulous but the cleaning staff although cleaned the rooms exceptionally well they forgot to put mugs in on one day and another day forgot to put towels in but wasn t a problem quick call to reception and they brought them up to us, Everything food staff rooms were all excellent and we will be staying here again if we come to Amsterdam again Cannot fault the hotel 
395231,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Would like a fridge in the room , Only had one night at this hotel but would have been happy to stay longer Beds comfortable My teenage nephew found the pull out sofa bed very comfortable also Good choice of food for breakfast Quiet Only 2 or 3 tram stops from Amsterdam Central Station 
395232,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No restaurant only snacks which were quite bad I ordered a pasta salad one evening and it came out frozen sorry sir let me get another one from storage ,No Positive
395233,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Staff at reception unfriendly and rude The room was delayed for 1 h and the receptionist replied well thats how it is it only lacked what will You do about it The location should be better for this price If You want to walk to the center it is 30 min 20 min by tram The 3 person room had quite an uncomfortable sofa , The staff during the breakfast was really helpful and friendy Specially Mrs Ewelina was really kind and supportive The rooms were clean and small parking made handling a car lot easier 
395234,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Staff sometime hard to understand explaination not adequate Toilet in room has sliding door Shower has no door, Luggage room Breakfast Close to tram station Big size lift
395235,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Not much that you can change I would however suggest that the location of the hotel be more clearly described i e the fact that it is not very close to the center of the city and accessible only by the tram line 10 or 26 The room was really small for the price So value for money the hotel gets a bad note The staff was mostly friendly and helpful though Still on our next trip to Amsterdam I doubt that we will stay here and certainly not use Booking com next time , The breakfast was good and the bed comfortable
395236,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Rooms are not cleaned satisfactory Cleaning is done very quickly In the night there is very few personnel one two persons in reception As a result of this the quality of service is low and it is not possible to respond to any unlucky events or even provide the basics Also hotel provide information about tours and excursions only the basics Hotel is little far from center , Staff in reception is polite and helpful The manager responded with excellent and professional way in my inquiries Excellent rich breakfast and professional staff
395237,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Nothing in particular, The staff was very polite and helpful specially Amar who guided us for everything we needed The courtesy extended by everyone made the whole stay very pleasant 
395238,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Forgot to clean the room and change the bed and towels, The location very convenient to reach downtown and the airport Breakfast very good with good choises 
395239,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The breakfast eggs mushrooms and coffee were disappointing Poor flavors and textures I did not try the bread and cheese or the waffles however and they did look fine I was surprised by the quality considering it had the Hilton brand , I made a request to staff before arriving to leave a romantic note in a room They went above and beyond and included a small bottle of wine Very nice of them and discreetly done as well No hassles at all 
395240,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Slight confusion over breakfast times and a somewhat strict closure of the breakfast servery , Although slightly outside the centre it is easily reached via a short tram journey The location seems a bit industrial at first but the location is worth a good exploration on foot Towards the waterfront there s the old Lloyd Hotel a few other restaurants and a supermarket and a short walk gets you onto one of the old islands Walk in the opposite directions and there are more exciting restaurants Tram lines are nearby and allow access to both sides of the city centre the Northern end at Centraal station and the southern end at the museums and the large grachten 
395241,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, A bit too far from Centre no restaurant no eating places in the area bar area was part of reception not ideal small seating area by exit was not a lounge area which was lacking bar sales must be very low due to this Room tax should be asked for on arrival not exit , Room spacious clean well appointed good breakfast bathroom good Staff helpful and polite 
395242,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No parking was available at arrival although I asked 2 weeks on beforehand to reserve 1 for me Only option was to park the car in the street at high price per hour also during night in an unsafe environment The breakfast was not very good and overcrowded Even on a public holiday breakfast was only served until 10 am No nice place to stay bar for diner or for a drink in the evening No restaurants or bars in the direct environment , Comfortable clean bed and bath room Easy bike rent service in the hotel 
395243,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Great location just a short tram ride from central station and a two minute walk Hotel was clean and comfy Breakfast was great especially the cappuccino machine 
395244,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The bar was an extension of the reception area I would have liked a separate bar lounge as it would have been nice to linger around the hotel a bit more, Hotel was spotlessly clean rooms were nice size and bed was really comfortable with good size bathroom and nice large shower All the staff were very friendly and helpful Decent breakfast with good selection 
395245,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The breakfast could be better more different food and more food it was totaly empty container with bacon when i came and did not filled it at the time when I had breakfast , Hotel is near by tram station and you have only three stops to the Central station Room and bathroom are very clean The stuff is friendly 
395246,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Staff unhelpful location difficult to find from tram station no signage visible till you re at the property entrance looks like garage for bikes with several bikes parked in the doorway so you don t know where entrance is breakfast stuff are terrible encouraging you to walk away from breakfast 1 hour before closing they don t top up food often , Some staff were helpful but most weren t 
395247,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Little bit nosiey due to being right near the tram stop and a busy road , Stayed at Hampton by Hilton for my first trip to Amsterdam with my partner Room was very tidy and spacious and the hotel itself was only 3 tram stops away from Amsterdam centre The bed has to be one of the comifest beds I ve ever slept in The only thing I wished we did was get up early enough to try out the breakfast 
395248,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, The breakfast spread was good There was a self service waffle maker which I enjoyed using The staff was very courteous and approachable It helps that there was a gym with quite a good selection of free weights 
395249,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Staff were rude and didn t seem to want to talk to customers One day I ordered a lasagne and it came out frozen and the two staff members just laughed about it The room had stains on the sofa and the curtain Also the shower was slightly odd and every time you had a shower there was no curtain or door but the water would just go on the bathroom floor Wasn t a wet room shower , I liked the city itself so much to do in city centre with the metro only taking 3 stops to get there 
395250,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Room cleaning service needs more attention to detail when cleaning and servicing the room s , Excellent front desk staff Breakfast was great Short walk to the tram and access to all of Amsterdam Solid value for cost 
395251,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The room stunk of raw sewage It was over powering to the point that the hotel manager when I asked him to come and smell the room was gagging as the stench was so bad We could not sleep and the smell got worse during the night to a point the following morning it became unbearable , Not a lot really Breakfast was good but everything was tarnished by the smell of raw sewage 
395252,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Room cleaning on one day was not up to the standard of other days and it looked like cleaning had been interrupted or rushed for some reason The room was spacious but had little space for clothes storage apart from hanging space We had to use the blanket shelf , I usually have a problem not sleeping on my own bed Not only was this bed so comfortable that I didn t notice the difference from home but this room was without doubt the quietest hotel room I ve ever stayed in While it wasn t in a central location the 26 tram stop was only 2 mins walk away and only 3 stops to Centraal Station The 10 tram stop was also there giving you a direct line to the Museums 
395253,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, First manager she was so rude not understandable when she talk to you in order very bad for the cash check out she asked me for my passport and my wife passport when I gave her 500 she said she said I don t have a change and no Bank near you have to go to the city the hotel far form center Barking 25 The room is a small The neighborhood boring, Non

395256,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The room was not cleaned properly everyday housekeeping has to be improved Nothing much around the hotel in terms of cafes grocery etc , The hotel is located in a suburb but there are two Metro lines which make it easy to get into the city center It is about 3km from the central station Room is a comfortable size Decent breakfast buffet every morning
395257,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Not having coffee in the room replenished daily, I really liked the room it was very clean and the bed was very comfortable The staff were lovely welcoming and helpful The hotel is a bit of distance from the train station about a 30 min walk but it is next to a tram station and close to local shops
395258,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Leaving, The location of the hotel along with the friendliness of the staff made this a thoroughly enjoyable stay We would recommend this hotel without hesitation
395259,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Check in was time consuming By system error my credit card was charged twice for the stay This was fixed after I contacted the manager , Had booked 3 nights and was initially given a room with a view to the cars driving down the basement parking lot Noisy and not comfortable at all Would not have been an issue for just one night Stay away from rooms 100 200 300 they are all terrible with distractions from cars just outside the window

395261,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Would have liked help with booking tours and recommendations on attractions as we roamed the town looking for the best tours a small travel desk at the hotel would have been good but only a nice to have , Very clean hotel lovely rooms very quiet and spacious We were a family with 2 children who shared the sofa bed and still enough room to move around Only 3 stops on tram to central tram stop only 2 min walk from hotel Easy walk to nice local restaurants Breakfast was sufficient highly recommend the waffles Make sure you grab the discount vouchers in reception for attractions they were handy We got a taxi from the airport to hotel but was quite expensive and we found the public transport so easy when we left we ended up catching the tram to central and train straight to airport and saved 50 euro We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again 
395262,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The washrooms need to be better designed The door to the coat rack and the toilet was the same There was leakage of water from the shower , Great location very close to tram station 
395263,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Staff behaviour and double charging on invoice, staff needs to improve was double charged for the room reception is a little cold and unfriendly in attitude good thing is that the tram stop is closeby and its a little away from the center so you can have your peace when you need it

395269,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, There was nothing that was worthy of complaining about , The hotel was situated far enough from the city centre to be undisturbed from revellers but near enough to enjoy walking in to centre Rooms were clean and spacious Staff were pleasant and the breakfast ample 
395270,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, I didn t like that our room smelled musty I don t think it had been cleaned The view from the room was a very over grown grassy area It wasn t very appealing at all 460 for 2 nights in the hotel was way too much I would not stay here again , I liked the shower I liked that this hotel is close the Centraal Station

395290,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Just the cleaning of the room 1 day missed even though the reception staff did give me some new towels and did offer to come clean The floors didn t look like they had been hovered everyday The shower was to powerful and the tray kept filling up might need bit of drain cleaner , The staff at the front desk were very friendly and they went above and beyond when they knew it was my birthday On my return from day out there was a note with best wishes and some gifts very nice touch The staff serving breakfast were also very friendly and would chat and ask if breakfast ok 
395291,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Not good cleaning have problems with charges hotel put on hold 150 euro from the card without warning and after checkout they couldn t cancel the hold Pay the tax from different card but at that time they again put on hold money for the tax on my card Now I should wait a week for automatic cancellation the hold So our checkout took a long time we were disappointed, Good breakfast good location
395292,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Hotel got our booking wrong the staff on day of arrival were not helpful at all and quite rude only a double bed in a triple room So rather than move us they put up a small put u up bed in the room which made it very cramped , The breakfast was great loads of choice and really great freshly cooked food Even make your own waffles

395298,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The shower leaked all over the floor every time but there are plenty of towels to mop up There wasn t the best selection of drinks provided so we didn t end up having a brew No biscuits either Criminal , The breakfast was incredible and really relaxed A decent breakfast is the best way to set up your day when you re out and about and this didn t disappoint for variety or quantity Even the coffee out of the machine was delicious Getting around from the hotel was really easy as you could catch trams to Centraal Station or the Leidseplein from 200m away from the front door or you could walk anywhere if you prefer though it ll take 45 minutes to get into town or Leidseplein on foot The room was really well laid out the bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of plug sockets The wifi all over the hotel was strong and it didn t seem to drop out There was no issue leaving our bags on the final day so we could go off and explore without the annoyance of lugging our bags with us This was another free service and nice touch 
395299,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Please be aware that parking can be full and costs 25 EUR night which is a bit overpriced for unsupervised parking Hotel staff did not inform us about this cost until after we parked there For cheaper supervised parking please investigate the P R opportunity which is reasonably close via tram 26 one from stop away from Rietlandpark in direction of Ijburg , staff was helpfull and overall friendly however they should inform about price if you park there 
395300,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The only thing we didn t like was the noise of somebody walking in high heeled shoes next to the room We had a room right next to reception and although it was extremely soundproof from the reception area we did get noise from the next room That said it didn t happen late and didn t disturb our sleep and would only happen in room 100 , Great hotel with amazing staff great breakfast and a great night s sleep Three stops on Tram 26 from outside the central station The room was a decent size too 
395301,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, I can t be happier If the front staff had placed us in a room in which everything is ready well maintained and fully managed , all the facilities located in the hotel were excellent There is no doubt o recommend this hotel to my potential friends willing to come to Amsterdam

395320,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The room we had was very noisy and cold even after putting the heating on which create a lot of noise as well Probably because we stayed on the first floor we could hear the water traveling to the pipes everytime somebody flushed the toilet It was very hard to fall asleep in this conditions , Clean and with good connections to all the touristic attractions max 10 min with the tram to the city center and 20 to the museums 35 40 minutes if you want to walk to the center or to any of the museums 
395321,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, it is a very good and efficient location for business travellers that move to one place to another in the week the breakfast was good and location is perfect if you need to move in Ams as the tram run frequently and till late evening and stops only few steps away from the hotel

395323,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The food selection at night time has good size portions but is limited in what you can order because is pre made They have two carparks and the main one was full so we had to go to the second one across the street and is fine but need the hotel staff with you every time you need to get things out of your car , The included breakfast had a good selection to choose from except the scrambled eggs they were quite bland I like they had a sofabed so you fit three or four in a room and it was comfortable and the room size was decent The shower has a temperature control feature which is a nice touch having a bath is old fashioned in a modern hotel The staff were excellent caring for every need and generally happy and friendly The hampton is near a tram stop so the main part of the city is only a few stops away and only costs 7 50 euros for unlimited travel on the trams for a day 
395324,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Absence of tea pots at the breakfast buffet Means lots of extra people in a small space trying to get their second cuppa , Brilliant bed pillows and great sound insulation Good buffet spread for breakfast

395328,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, One of the best places we have stayed The service was outstanding Every staff member we encountered were really friendly The rooms were very comfortable and really clean I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
395329,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, We was a little disappointed that our early check in and late check out was not accepted It would of been nice to have a window that opened in the room and the bedside cabinets were not cleaned properly Coffee tea drip marks down the side and front but not a lot , The staff was friendly and very helpful the location was great just a short travel to the centre with the trams every 5 minutes Great selection of hot and cold breakfast The room was gorgeous and the bed was very comfy I also noticed the staff speak a variety of languages We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back thank you 
395330,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Windows did not open at all and im not very good sleeping without a small airway Bar was very very uncosy We came back early for a cosy nightcap and ended up sitting bolt upright on sort of canteen like table and chairs with bright strip lights So we had one and went to bed , Very friendly check in staff we were also 2 hours early and we could check in Rooms spotlessly clean Very modern bathroom and a huge mirror Breakfast though very very busy was very good 
395331,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, There was no curtain in the bathroom and floor was always wet after taking a shower It was very hard to open compartments of the nightstand , Nice bed Good ventilation It was also quiet in our room which faced the inner court Breakfast was good 
395332,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No bottled water in the rooms bar behind the same desk as reception very small Not much to do Breakfast only till 10 oclock Bottle of water cost 5 euro , Comfy bed good breakfast tram nearly hotel to the Centre number 26 just 3 stops Shop jumbo 5 mins away prices ok Quiet location 
395333,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Modern Most comfortable bed you will ever sleep in seriously couldn t get out Nice shower head instead of a 5 min shower you end up having a 30 min one Very clean rooms and an amazing english breakfast And WAFFLES Good TV Channels Great Staff Very close to Amsterdam Central Tram 26 3 Stops only 10 minutes Thank You Hampton by Hilton for making our holiday stay enjoyable Definitely Recommend 100 
395334,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, no solo traveller price no toilet brush hard to close open toilet door some days annoying sound came from outside of hotel one corner of window does not seem to be mounted closed correctly spiders and webs outside window sometimes bad reception of English TV channels flies around breakfast no fridge in room you can buy snacks next to reception, close to tram 10 and 26 with tram 26 it is 3 stops to central station close to Jumbo supermarket friendly staff plenty of English TV channels wide single beds good shampoo and body wash not too oily slippery after wash There is also lotion and moisture safe in room good breakfast for few days not so good for longer stays if lack of variation is a problem
395335,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Staff were the most friendly helpful and efficient we d encountered at that point of our hotel stays in Europe Staff appeared to be enabled to evaluate and make decisions which ultimately benefited both me and my view of the establishment
395336,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Free coffee or tea outside of breakfast hours would have been nice , Breakfast had a lot of variety and included both hot and cold items Easy tram ride to Central station and cruise ship port Convenient that hotel sold tram pass 
395337,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, I stayed here one night while in Amsterdam for buisness I needed a hotel room in the area and picked this hotel based on ratings on trip advisor It fitted my needs perfectly I stayed in a standard room and was very happily surpriced to see I had been given a corner room with lots of light see pics Am guessing there are only three or four of these rooms so it was a great luck However if you are a light sleeper the noice from the street and nearby railroad might disturb ypu a bit The room was clean and seemed newly renovated It had everything I needed including an easy to use alarm clock and several sockers for charging my electronic devices The bed was super comfy that I decided to stay in bed a bit longer in the morning and skip breakfast When checking out the nice receptionist offered me to have a coffe and something to go as I did not have time to sit down for breakfast I will make sure to return to this hotel when in this area of Amsterdam next time 
395338,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, I had to wait a long time to get a room after check in and flying in from the US you are real tired when you get it Most places I stay in Europe are understanding and get those that have been awake all night the first rooms and don t make them wait until 3 pm yes I know the rules but when flying in from the US you get in at 8 am and have been awake all night , staff was nice and helpful
395339,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable The bathroom was clean The room was quiet Breakfast had a good selection of foods Close to tram stops 
395340,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Okay there was couple of things witch we didn t like The first thing was that you can t open the window We understand its for a safety reasons but still the room felt like there is no aer in it And the second thing was the cleanliness The day we arrived we got food from reception I must say the quality of the food was poor But what really annoyed us was that the plates wasn t taken off the room for the tree days we staid There was a cleaners coming in but all they ve done was tide up the bed and take away the towels And the plates was standing on the desk I think that wasn t proper cleaning service , The best thing about your hotel was the reception staff Every receptionist we met during our stay was amazing always with a smile always willing to assist with any question They made up our stay 
395341,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No fridge in the hotel room but it seems that many hotels in Amsterdam have the same problem Thin wall so it s possible that you can hear your neighbours or vice versa , Convenient location Can enjoy a nice walk to the main station within half an hour or just a few stations taking tram 26 Breakfast is the same every day for the 4 days we stayed there but it s tasty so it doesn t really matter 
395342,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The satellite television was going out for most of the time I was there but it was really beyond the control of the hotel staff , The staff was very friendly and Pooja was very attentive and helpful The room was beautiful and near everything we needed 
395343,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No complaints , Very friendly and attentive staff Two minutes walk to from tram stop then just 10 minutes to Centraal Good quality shower gel shampoo conditioner and body lotion provided 
395344,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, 1 Too small breakfast area overcrowded nonstop during the breakfast time 2 Poor breakfast eg cucumbers felt as if they were frozen prior to being served no fish no fresh juices 3 No slippers in rooms 4 Asked to clean my room twice they didn t but brought new towels 5 Quite far from the city centre , Brand new hotel
395345,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The only disappointment was the food I was excited with kids to have breakfast included The eggs were undercooked and the bacon was still raw Seriously raw We tried ordering a small snack for the kids after a long day out and the chips for the nachos were stale I know hotels aren t there for the food but these three things were exceptionally poor , Clean So thankful that I booked here last minute We were on a long vacation and I was confining reservations for another location after watching the reviews on that location I was scared I read the reviews here and felt better It is literally a 3 minute walk to a tram station that can take you right back to central station within 5 7 minutes so don t be concerned that you are out of the city center It was clean quiet larger rooms and a large breakfast 
395346,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, There was no lock on the bathroom door and it didn t shut properly There was an accidental alarm at 3 30am too zzzzzzz , The gym was ideal and the breakfast was excellent Overall a great hotel 
395347,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, Hotel was spotlessly clean Good breakfast selection provided every morning Good location with a tram stop a short walk away not in the centre so considerably quieter than Amsterdam Central some nice restaurants within a walk of the hotel 
395348,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The dinning quarter area was not large enough for the number of people been hosted at the time of our visit People have to be squeezed to reach breakfact goods , The location is great quiet and there is access to public transportation towards city center and arround 
395349,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Unfortunately the breakfast was really awful Scrembled egg was like rubber and was not edible on both mornings we were eating there Sausages were not fried but broiled Only enjoyable thing were the waffles which can be made by yourself Unfortunately no minibar in the room , Modern interior clean rooms Tram station in 2 walking minutes only 2 stops to Central station 
395350,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, The hotel is in a good location in the East of Amsterdam It s easy to reach from the centre of town take tram 26 from Centraal Station only 3 stops The river Ij is a nice 5 10 minute walk away with 2 supermarkets Albert Heijn and Jumbo easily located for all you day to day essentials There is also a nice tapas restaurant Pata Negra beside the river which has good food and a good atmosphere The hotel has a 24 hour menu handy as I arrived late in Amsterdam and most shops were closed The 24 hour menu is a little limited but handy for a late night snack or if you are a late arriver I ve stayed in other branches of Hampton by Hilton and this branch did not disappoint The bed was super comfy and the room was immaculately cleaned daily The reception staff were very approachable and friendly I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again 
395351,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Parking garage was across the street with a key that had to be returned each time and nowhere to park on the street Getting a double room instead of the requested twin room was annoying Arrived so late and so tired fell into the one double bed instead of realising that there should ve been two single beds Didn t have the heart to complain the next day , Staff were so nice and so helpful with anything we did ask them about 
395352,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, The view from our room was really horrible It almost felt like in a prison Turn it into a small balcony maybe Something needs to be done Also I was informed that I could leave my bag at the hotel but when I did my check out we were told that the room was full Well then dont guarantee me a place for my bag if you can not deliver , I liked the service Mike I believe his name was gave me the best service ever recieved in a hotel I liked the 100 Hampton But not everyone that did a check in got enlightened of the 100 Hampton Please upgrade Mike Best service ever Overall we really enjoyed our stay and The room itself was very Nice 
395353,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, As a hotel managed by Hilton Brand it has adecent services and nice facilities On the very first day of arrival the stuff at reception encouraged to give fedback if there was any complain The location of the hotel is convenient taking more or less 20 mins to get downtown In all I personally recommand this hotel if you want a sound sleep and cheersome breakfast 
395354,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East,No Negative, We liked everything about this Hotel because we ve been traveling around 7 different countries and different cities and stayed in so many different hotels so we have something to compare with We are nearly at the finish line of our jorney but so far it was the best hotel even though we booked at least 4 hotels during our trip nothing would compare to this one Very modern very clean and cosy I would definitely recommend Price and quality is perfect 
395355,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Only one minor complaint the distance from airport to hotel was a train to city and then tram to hotel its a 5 minute tram ride then from city to hotel but that s not a big inconvenience at all , The hotel and everything in it was top notch food staff facilities were all on point 
395356,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Didn t like the square pillows much lumpy , Nice selection for breakfast though can do with more tables and chairs The rooms are good size and clean
395357,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, For the price of almost 200 Euro the room was far too small no minibar no bathrobes etc Too much money for too little , Breakfast was nice and fresh 
395358,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Parking a response asking a question would have been great Tiny pokey room terrible room facility s, Nothing terrible property terrible staff no pool as advertised

395360,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Vegans should ask the staff for soy milk Gym has mainly cardio machines only , Waffle machine for making it yourself with loads of syrup Comfy beds and nice staff 
395361,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Its a new hotel so the front desk people are straggling still and their check in and check out was very slow We had to leave because we would be late for our flight and i never got a check out receipt I am sure it will be fixed soon not the peoples fault , Nice and clean Didnt have time for breakfast 
395362,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, We had ordered and prepaid a twin room when we arrived we were told there were no twin rooms available and we were offered a heavily sub par cot as a substitute Being too tired to make a fuss we accepted with the understanding that we could switch to a twin the next day Then we were woken up way too early considering our check in time and told that we d have to vacate the room before 12 00 and not be able to check into a new one before 14 00 We declined went back to sleep and then in the afternoon managed to wrangle the room shift anyways This is now the third time in a row that I book a twin room at an upscale hotel chain and have this exact problem Both Booking com and the hotels are to blame here When I book a twin room I WANT A TWIN ROOM especially when I have payed a week in advance on a non refundable room It should be self evident that in most cases just sticking people in doubles instead could be heavily infringing on peoples personal space I will be sending a separate email to Booking com customer service to get their act together regarding these kind of bookings , It s generally a comfortable and quiet hotel with good service and the breakfast is great The neighbourhood is quiet 
395363,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Too small breakfast no vegetables taste of different things not so good scrambled eggs or sausages Hotel is too expensive for that kind of food Also all windows is the rooms are closed , Clean modern hotel 2 stations by tram from Amsterdam city center 
395364,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, No area to relax except at restaurant tables Shower room door did not lock no lock actually insalled so didnt close either snack menu is very poor and is not freshly prepared , Well maintained Staff usually very helpful Decent range of breakfast items 
395365,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Hotel location far from centre also a very busy road and with that noise during night from traffic trains Scramble eggs were worst ever tried and daughter who is 22 agreed , Staff were great Hope they are treated as they deserve Always with a nice approachable attitude very helpful

395370,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, I did not realize at first that there would be no toiletries and no fridge I bought some food that needed refrigeration but couldn t store them The walls were a bit thin too and I could hear the next room talking laughing watching tv a lot of the time But on the most part had everything I needed, The bed and pillows were really comfortable Just wanted to sleep in every day Overall the property was very clean as well Great access to public transport and supermarkets 
395371,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Our room is facing the road and the traffic is quite loud all day , Clean and comfortable as the chained Hampton The location is close to several tram stop The staffs are really friendly and helpful 
395372,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, Hotel is a bit far from the centre of Amsterdam however the tram is only a 2 minute walk and it is only 3 stops to Amsterdam Central Station Couldn t open windows in room which meant it felt a bit claustrophobic in the room air conditioning was working great but sometimes it would be nice for some fresh air , This hotel is spotless Our rooms were cleaned every day The waffle maker at breakfast was an excellent idea Breakfast was very good Beds are very comfortable Air Conditioning in room Staff are very helpful and extremely friendly Rietlandpark Tram stop is only a 2 minute walk away Take tram no 26 from Amsterdam Central Station Great Spanish Tapas bar around the corner which serves amazing food with a great atmosphere 
395373,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Centre East, That we couldn t stay longer , We stayed here for our honeymoon and the hampton staff went above and beyond to make it extra special Lovely hotel lovely staff and only 3 stops away on tram away from centraal station Also bus stop close by if you need to catch the night bus when the trams are not running
