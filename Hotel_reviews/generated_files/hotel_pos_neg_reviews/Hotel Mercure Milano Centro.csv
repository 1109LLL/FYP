410024,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, More English Channel on TV especially movie channel like HBO Cinemax etc would be great since most of the channel was on Italian and couldn t be changed and has no subtitles , Super speed wifi and the hotel is right next to the metro station 
410025,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, In my current room the wifi is a little spotty , Delicious breakfast and location is easy to travel to all areas of Milan Very clean and the staff are very friendly 
410026,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Nothing everything was good, Location was great nice area and right above a metro station and close places for morning snacks The staff was very helpful and welcoming pleasant room and a cool coffee machine with fresh capsules every day plus fruit and water Thank you for a great getaway 
410027,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Breakfast was really not good with limited options Corazon was not good It is much convenient to go to the next coffee shop to have your breakfast , The location was great and you have the metro access just immediately opposite to the hotel 
410028,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, A boutique hotel only 4 floors my room was on the 4th and the elevator only goes up to the 3rd I think this hotel is quite pricey compared to other bigger hotels in the same neighborhood with more facilities When they made the preauthorization on my card I asked them to release this amount held and pay my room with it but it was not possible so I had to use another card until they released the amount after 3 days as it was easter time , Location right infront of Porta Venezia metro station and next to Jean Louis David the best hairdresser in town A safe and quiet area by night 
410029,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Wifi was limited to the day of staying , Very nice room with two very big beds Clean and comfort Walking distance from the train station and also only 15 minutes walking to Duomo 
410030,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Clean room but bathroom could be cleaner Tiles in bathroom could be cleaner but overall was ok , Great location We arrived in Milan by bus at central station from airport from central station we walked to hotel for about 20minutes top Subway is just in front of the hotel Two great restaurants are just near hotel we had there breakfast every morning we did not buy breakfast at the hotel hotel is in walking distance from Duomo 
410031,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Airconditioning was not working properly we had to open the window for some air The door could use some fixing as it was a bit difficult to open with the key Breakfast buffet options were limited better to walk to a nearby cafe , Location was very convenient Metro station is right outside the door of the hotel Convenience store is a few blocks away shops line the streets around the property The hotel staff was very accommodating and courteous 
410032,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro,No Negative, Great hotel with very good location It s close to Porta Venezzia metro station and only 15min walk to Duomo The staff was very kind and helpful The room was great clean and comfortable Near the hotel have restaurants supermarket and pasticceria with very tasty things If I come back to Milano with sure will stay again at this hotel 
410033,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro,No Negative, Perfect location about a 15 20 minute walk from the train station and about 15 minute walk to the cathedral and shops Great rooms facilities toiletries coffee machine kettle even some apples I d definitely recommend this hotel 
410034,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Rooms slightly dated but clean Limited breakfast adjoining bar was nice though didnt realise it was connected until leaving , Location was excellent Nice clean tidy hotel Being next to Metro and Tram links helped getting about Staff were helpful and friendly
410035,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, It would have been nice to have a nice welcoming jug of water in the foyer or some cold tea for guests it just felt slightly unwelcoming, Good location
410036,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Checkout was at 12 00pm and we left well before that But when we returned to our room after a morning stroll on a hot day We found our air conditioning had become centrally controlled and we could not adjust it The room had heated to 25 degrees and had become airless and stuffy I m sure this was to make you feel like leaving the hotel sooner rather than later , Rooms were large and airy good location Very helpful staff 
410037,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Would have preferred breakfast included in room rate but that is a minor issue Very pleasant stay for 2 nights, Good location about 10 15 mins walk from Piazza del Duomo and right next to metro station Room well furnished Great air con Plenty of restaurants and cafes beside hotel 
410038,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Rooms and corridors are small and tight , Next to the Porta Venezia metro station so you can get there by M1 metro from Cadorna where Malpensa Express stops and Duomo is on same line Next to Corso Buenos Aires the main shopping street View from room to the square is nice Rooms are clean and nicely decorated and there is an elevator Breakfast is good 
410039,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Room war very small without any view from the window as next building was 1 meter away from our room Also the stuff on reception wasn t friendly , Location is really good Plenty shops restaurants and clubs around 
410040,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Double glazing could not shut out noise of ambulance and fire engine sirens on the main roads outside , Good location For access to park trams and Metro
410041,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro,No Negative, Fantastic location 15 minutes by tram above ground right outside the front door of the hotel to the Central Train Station There is also a Metro Stop right outside the front door A Fantastic Italian restaurant close by 1 block same street and a great Coffee Bar just outside the front door to the left We used the hotel twice once when flying to Italy from Seattle and once before our flight to Barcelona Very good both times You will like it 
410042,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Unfortunately I was charged twice , I liked everything to do with this hotel from the location reception and the room facilities This is what is called excellency on all departments 
410043,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, There is no slipper supply in rooms You should bring your slippers with you from your home Rooms are too small , Location is perfect Personnel are kind and helpful Rooms seen as clean 
410044,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, We got stuck in the lift It was always slow and jerky and then on last day the doors wouldn t open Luckily staff were pretty quick to help us , This is a gorgeous hotel in a wonderful location The staff were very helpful suggesting places for breakfast and dinner and trams to the station We had a lovely room looking right over piazza and Christmas lights on bustling street
410045,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Weak WiFi signal slow Internet speed unacceptable for business traveller Breakfast was not fresh grapefruit juice and ham but costs 15 bucks very small shower booth subway sound in the night, Excellent location Proximity to excellent Neapolitan pizzeria just across Corso Buenos Aires 20 meters to subway Line 1 to the city center main advantage it s 5 min walk to our office in Milan
410046,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, The rooms could do with new paint , The hotel is about a 15 20min walk to the city centre Otherwise there is a metro station right outside with direct trains to the centre 
410047,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, The room need to be renewed Lavatory is too small and it s easy to get wet floor when taking shower , Location Just opposite to Gare du Nord Quite suit for a short stay for transfer 
410048,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, The only downside was cos it is only 32 rooms I could not book 2 weeks ahead for my final night back in Milano before flying out so had to stay somewhere else Other downside I will not pay 15E for breakfast anywhere it is simply not value for what most eat for breakfast , saying it is my new fave is a joke as I have not stayed in Milano for years However having picked the Mercure for 3 nights after a Metro arrival from Malpensa after arrival I booked a further 3 nights The accommodation is more than comfortable padded fabric wallcovering made a change I had a room facing the Porta Venezia and it was quite quiet so no worries there Staff were helpful and virtually all spoke English The best bit is the location for going elsewhere OK the Metro entry is right in front of the hotel but the best bit is the no 9 tram across the square not only does this go a short way to start at Milano Centrale but also runs down to Porta Genova and past the entry points to the Navigli canal area which is where I ate every night So for arriving conveniently off a tram easier than maybe stairs in the Metro with bags AND access to bars and dining it cannot be beat And the period prints decoration is all nice too Wifi no issues so all good 
410049,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro,No Negative, Good location an easy walk to the Duomo All the staff were great The tourist areas of all cities have their fair share of restaurants that are pretty average so we really appreciated the young concierge recommending a very good restaurant off the tourist strip It was a great Based on our experiences we would definitely stay here again 
410050,Hotel Mercure Milano Centro, Breakfast is not included and costs 30 And there is nothing to eat the food is not fresh nothing to choose coffee machine is terrible No traditional italian coffee no stuff in the dining room , Comfortable bad and fantastic location Behind the corner via Marcello Malpigni wonderful cafe is situated with traditional panini salads etc always fresh and tasty
