478015,Sina De La Ville, We were looking forward to using the pool but it was a big disappointment It s small and enclosed on the roof and it was really hot and muggy up there Breakfast was unremarkable , The location is fantastic 
478016,Sina De La Ville, The room was fine although looked rather old fashioned with textile wallpaper It is a matter of taste maybe the hotel should offer the choice contemporary or classic room It is a pity there were big stains in the wall covering but the room was clean Small bathroom The pool is tiny as is the rooftop terrace , Superb location right in the heart of Milan Friendly staff We arrived early and got an early check in wich is great Parking just around the corner is definitely a big plus in this area 
478017,Sina De La Ville, Shower in the bathtub but no non slip mat or safety hand rail but if you pull emergency cord your response to immediately , Staff excellent especially breakfast staff Great location Expensive but that s Milan CBD Would definitely stay again 
478018,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, room was surprisingly large and modern for heart of Milan This is right around the corner from la Scala and the Domo Staff was helpful called taxi for me directions were good etc and breakfast was very good big buffet with options Only nit was that the people in the room above evidently felt the need to rearrange the furniture frequently between the hours of 10 00 and midnight resulting in lots of noise in my room I finally called the front desk and surprisingly the noise stopped 
478019,Sina De La Ville, The roof top pool area was too small and hot to enjoy All lounges where taken when we went up for a look , The staff were extra helpful chasing our luggage that didn t arrive until the last night 
478020,Sina De La Ville, I didn t like leaving this hotel, The staff were just lovely and couldn t do enough to help us even taking furniture out of the room so I had more room in my wheelchair we had quite a lot of furniture in our room and we needed three beds Our first stay we got upgraded and had a wonderful room a great start to our holiday The manager had the right level of friendliness helpfulness but aurthority I wish I could have taken him to other hotels to show them this is how you run a hotel Breakfast was good they could have been a little friendlier but they were busy This hotel is in a wonderful position and I would have no reservation in recommending it we have stayed in Milan often but this will be the hotel we go back to 
478021,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, room was dirty it had instincts bugs inside it The junior suite did not have balcony as per our booking we have sent you 2 emails with no feedback
478022,Sina De La Ville, Don t book this for the swimming pool We did It s really small and the roof doesn t open anymore so it s like sauna in there Really disappointing ,No Positive
478023,Sina De La Ville, Pool is more like a paddling pool I especially chose a hotel with pool so bit disappointing also it is covered so not an outdoor area We used it and enjoyed it though spotless showers and towels Lovely bedside lamp didn t work and curtains wouldn t fully close because one was partially unhooked Minor points though only mentioning cos you asked, breakfast excellent plenty of choice hot chocolate drink very welcome as I don t drink tea coffee Big rooms well supplied with shampoo etc Clean and luxurious bathroom and comfortable bed dressing gowns slippers etc supplied Minibar expensive but expected in location Staff friendly and helpful Location perfect especially for La Scala 
478024,Sina De La Ville, Shame No Tea or Coffee Making facilities in Room Well stocked Mini bar though, Excellent Breakfast Selection Fresh Fruit Croissants Toast Cold Ham Tea Coffee Well satisfied Turndown of bed provided and small chocolate each night Excellent Location for shops Restaurants and Duomo
478025,Sina De La Ville, The pool water did not look very clear so we skipped the idea of a swim but the hotel overall we thought was lovely , Staff were extremely helpful polite and very welcoming The hotel was very clean and the location fabulous The hotel had clearly been refurbished recently The hotel restaurant food was lovely ate there one evening and I would definitely recommend it I really appreciated the fact that staff allowed me the indulgence to speak in Italian and responded to me in Italian even though I am a little rusty There are plenty of lively bars and cafe s near the hotel too for less formal eating 
478026,Sina De La Ville, Pastries at breakfast were not fresh Limited fresh fruit and juice Service is at best leisurely Staff in general need to focus more on customer service Customers should not be made to feel they are a hinderance The gentlemen in charge of reception certainly treated us this way ,No Positive
478027,Sina De La Ville, The shower is integrated to the bathtub , Surprise free upgrade to junior suite Very bright suite at the 8th floor Unique view of the Duomo and its Madonnina both from living room and bedroom From the living room we could even keep an eye on our car parked in the next building Powerful dual zone air conditioning Helpful staff The swimming pool open area has been incredibly relaxing warmed up by a 30 sunny day and jazz music in the background The Madonnina is visible from the pool too for special photos The hotel could not be more central in the heart of Milano standing next to the Rinascente mall and 1 minute walking from the Duomo 
478028,Sina De La Ville, N a, Absolutely loved this hotel and our trip to Milan We took advantage of all the hotel had to offer Not sure why there were weak reviews of breakfast on some of the other forums but I LOVED the breakfast that was offered So much better than anything in the UK The pool area was perfect for some weekend sunshine my husband and I burned It s a small pool area but quiet enough The room was a good size for Europe with a comfortable bed Location is PERFECT No need for a cab other than from the train station though I m sure you could take the Metro we were fairly short on time No complaints would definitely stay here again 
478029,Sina De La Ville, The A C in the room was the weakest point that made my stay most uncomfortable The A C needs an urgent upgrade for the hot summer months ahead ,No Positive

478031,Sina De La Ville, The breakfast was sub basic No orange juice Monday Tuesday No plates or bowls Wednesday Very poor fruit Choice of food very limited , No to croissants Yes to bed
478032,Sina De La Ville, The cleaning staff I am sure well meaning should knock on the door and leave 4 5 seconds before entering A bit of a pet peeve of mine so just in case put the don t disturb sign on , The location is great for people that need to stay at the very center of Milan and steps away from the metro system The check in staff went the extra mile to please and it was truly appreciated 
478033,Sina De La Ville, Other diners smoking next to us Nobody seemed to care that it spoilt the enjoyment of all non smokers The owners and staff seemed nonchalant and it spoilt the otherwise lovely atmosphere , The best places are always down the back streets and off the main tourist routes 
478034,Sina De La Ville, unfortunately we visited the hotel during design fiera week and the prize was outrageous the service at the breakfast was un attentive and the breakfast place not very welcoming, The situation between il Duomo ans the Scala is exceptional the staff and in particular were very helpful like in real hotel the room was nice but small for two
478035,Sina De La Ville, Pool was closed Booking com did not inform us before we travelled Caused a lot of upset hassle on our wedding anniversary trip Booking com refused to speak with us but thankfully the hotel stepped up to the mark , Hotel were very accommodating Great location close to centre
478036,Sina De La Ville, They charge 5 euro per each taxi call Thay also charge 7 5 euro per each water in room s room service They do not give any free water in room and no any tea coffee free in rooms , Breakfast was ok
478037,Sina De La Ville, The mirror wasn t straight in room 324 but you could still see yourself Nothing else to fault , If you come out the hotel turn left and you can see the duomo perfect location rooms where good quality for the price and staff showed us around pool upstairs was cold but who would use it in march anyway Staff ordered us a taxi when ever we needed it and always asked if we was ok and the maid brought us chocolate to the room with a smile 
478038,Sina De La Ville, Reception staff is rude and unhelpful , Great location Breakfast staff and bar staff are very friendly The reception staff needs to be replaced completely Very poor service and bad response to non Italians like me 
478039,Sina De La Ville, Items at breakfast were only lukewarm clearing of tables could have been more efficient Bed not comfortable with lump in middle, Breakfast variety Location of hotel
478040,Sina De La Ville, no ironing service before 16h on saturday and no iron available to do it yourself 1 bathrobe for 2 guests a lot of disturbance by the personnel although very polite maid to ask when she could clean to check the minibar etc If you want to have rest you should not forget to put not disturb on your room door, excellent location comfort the room is clean everything is correct
478041,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, Great service friendly knowledgeable staff Lovely hotel and great location I have stayed here on more than 1 occasion will hesitate to stay again 
478042,Sina De La Ville, For four star hotel they should have coffee maker in the rooms Breakfast could be better and pool is more like small jacuzzi , Professional staff who were ready to change the room same category but better view Excellent location very convenient to move around Very clean rooms 
478043,Sina De La Ville, The swimming pool was much smaller than expected and my husband couldn t actually swim in it because it wasn t deep enough The glass roof covering wasn t clean so you couldn t see the sky through it , The staff were all very friendly the bar was very pleasant to relax in and the food in the property s L Opera restaurant was fantastic The style and decor of the property is very nice too The location is perfect very close to all the major sights but quiet 
478044,Sina De La Ville, the breakfast choices was a shock for me very poor buffet and the same food for 6 days , the location was absolutely perfect you had all the good restaurants around you and shops 
478045,Sina De La Ville, the smell of the bath amenities too strong, I was with my mum we checked in late around 21h we got a room up to the kitchen It was too noisy we ask to change and they proposed us like 2 others rooms immediately really nice staff and helpfull
478046,Sina De La Ville, They say the pool area is heated but they forget to mention the water is ICE COLD Come on people either you have a pool or you don t but this is childish , Very comfortable bed in a perfect location downtown 
478047,Sina De La Ville, Breakfast room too crowded, Location in the heart of the city center 2mn wal from the Duomo Swimming pool but very cold water Beautiful terrace in the room
478048,Sina De La Ville, Other than the location everything else was horrible Staff were rude and difficult to deal with Room service did not clean the room well , Just the location 
478049,Sina De La Ville, The beds were not the most comfortable but all in all the hotel itself was great and the rooms were so traditional gave them so much character , Central location of the hotel was very close to walk to shops and restaurants Staff was friendly 
478050,Sina De La Ville, The heating system can t be regulated in Winter You can open the windows but then you get city centre dirt and noise My room was 30 degrees and they had to switch me twice to find a room that wasn t a sauna The safe is tiny It will hold your car keys and not much more Certainly it will not hold a laptop or a tablet , The location is excellent and the staff are helpful
478051,Sina De La Ville, the bed was a little uncomfortable the mattress was old and slightly uncomfortable we didn t ask to change it though as it wasn t that big of a deal AC was sometimes not working but we opened the window and it was fine not a lot of noise outside amenities could have been richer for such a nice hotel , Perfect Location Staff very helpful Very good breakfast Very clean walking distance from everything 
478052,Sina De La Ville, On our second night the laundry carts were moved out to the street this was from about 1am until 5am it was extremely loud as we were directly on top I went to the reception at 5am and said I need a different room the friendly receptionist apologized and gave us a better quieter room The breakfast is good but the breakfast room without windows is very draughty airconditioning and a bit small otherwise maybe a bit too expensive for the quality provided , The location is excellent right in the middle of the city close to the dome and the scala 
478053,Sina De La Ville, Only bemol was the maid walking in the room at 8am on sunday Did not think it was necessary , Amazing location great service they upgraded us to an amazing room with a patio breakfast is delicious and the coffee Oh mon Dieu the coffee Out of this world Anna from reception was great thank you again 
478054,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, Easy taxi ride from the train station Staff welcoming Room was clean and beds were comfortable There was a king bed and we ordered an extra bed for our daughter Still plenty of room to move around Location was right among the shops 
478055,Sina De La Ville, slightly small room with bathroom just beginning to look a bit tired Swimming pool so shallow impossible to swim in it Breakfast ingredients poor and cheap and not very good service , very good lounge with good pc printer connection Inside room quiet 
478056,Sina De La Ville, Quite bland and boring business hotel generic and old in design and style Small Tv ok bed but nothing to remember , The pool is not beautiful but better then nothing The location is fantastic 
478057,Sina De La Ville, Staff at the reception very unfriendly When checking out they kept talking to each other and did not even bother to say goodbye I will never go to this place again but they won t mind because they are tully booked anyway because of the location , The bellboya were very friendly
478058,Sina De La Ville, Some staff is impolite and inconsiderate The gut at the front desk messed up while the payment process and tried to convince me it was my fault actually argued with me UNBELIEVABLE Comfort is questionable no extra pillow in the room for 2 no power outlet near the night stand really Will not come back , Perfect location and good breakfast
478059,Sina De La Ville, Decor just a bit dated and tired air conditioning was very hard to control room was hot , Location so close to Duomo and La Rinascente comfortable bed room
478060,Sina De La Ville, The breakfast was average and the waiters were not up to the standard They act as if they are busy but they are not They clean the tables and collect the used dishes in very noisy way The room have some times sewage smell , Location is perfect less than 3 min walk from the duomo wifi is very good in the lobby and rooms The AC at my room was not very good the reception offered another two room to select the one I like more which was very nice
478061,Sina De La Ville, washing is priced at the high end , when i pulled up out the front of the hotel i thou wow check in was great the staff straight away so friendly full of info i went up to my room AMAZING so clean lovely the bathroom great balcony so cute and on the same floor as the pool great the little shampoo body wash so nice heated towel rack lovely linen the pool area has great sun all day the breakfast is amazing the staff work so hard the staff they are always cleaning i did stay 6 nights so i did have time to see how this hotel runs the bar area is so nice i do give hotel DE LE VILLE 10 out of 10 thank you the location is the best
478062,Sina De La Ville, Getting stuck in the lift the alarm bell in the lift did not work I had to ring reception No follow up from staff e g was I ok could they offer me a drink a little concern on their part would have been appreciated they sent the Porter to prise the doors open that was it Thank heavens I am not a person that panics Also restoration of the marble staircase was being done between 3rd floor ground so during the day lots of noise and fine dust This was not advertised on their web site None of the above impacted greatly on my stay , My room 321 Superior Dbl rm so pretty very comfy good bed great bathroom with lovely toiletries hairdryer bar fridge also quiet at night Very good buffet breakfast Guest lounge area bar elegant cosy very inviting newly upgraded Photos of this area on this web site are old Magic location to explore Milan on foot 2min walk to the Duomo Vitt Emanuele building 5min walk to La Scala I would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend this Hotel
478063,Sina De La Ville, WiFi in the room was bad In downstairs area it was fine You cannot actually do internet work in the room, Great location Staff very helpful Very good breakfast 
478064,Sina De La Ville, Waiters at breakfast acted busy and pressured although guests were on vacation and nobody was in a hurry The staff made it look like fast food venue The A C in room was both very weak and blowing sewage smelling air, The location is perfect 
478065,Sina De La Ville, There was another triple room beside ours with very active young boys and their parents staying Their squeals made me realise the walls aren t soundproof , Amazing location close to the Duomo but far enough away to feel quiet The triple room was cosy for three of us travelled with our daughter but very beautifully decorated and it would have been a fine size for two The bathroom was also nicely decorated and exceptionally clean The breakfast buffet was one of the best I ve ever seen 
478066,Sina De La Ville, Beds too soft room smelt stale and fusty breakfast tasted old like it had been sat there a long time found a few cockroaches in a room loose nail on floor in doorway to bathroom Changed rooms 3 times until we were satisfied pool looked dirty , Very good location to main attractions Staff tried to accommodate us with room changes when we were not happy not a good last day to our honeymoon 
478067,Sina De La Ville, Complimentary water would be good as businesses travel gives you limited time to purchase small items, The rooms were we ll appointed and the breakfast was excellent wide choice
478068,Sina De La Ville, The free Wifi had some strange moments and water from the mini bar was expensive , Compact but very comfortable room nice breakfast and good bar The tiny pool and roof terrace is a bonus The position could hardly be better 
478069,Sina De La Ville, The photo gave the impression that the pool on the terrace was much bigger than it was Only space for around six people and it was a horrible green colour when we went to use it Very disappointing Also TV in room didn t work Breakfast coffee really not up to Italian coffee standards, Really comfortable bed and fantastic location
478070,Sina De La Ville, We were stuck in the elevator around 11pm for more than one hour almost 1hour 30 minutes because of an electricity problem in the hotel after a short storm plus the alarm in the elevator was not working security issue and the staff did not know for a while that we were stuck until we called them good we had a phone signal although they had seen us take the lift We called 911 who said that electricity was cut for a little while and came back but apparently not to the Hotel and then after we went out of the elevator there was no electricity in all the hotel for at least 3 hours that night And above all that bad experience the Hotel charged the night no apologies at all for anything and the staff was rude and inefficient in managing the situation Unfriendly team would not stay again ,No Positive
478071,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, On the rooftop they have a shallow pool It aligns perfectly with the rooftop of the Il Duomo church What a great experience It s like swimming in heaven My daughter loved it She felt so posh The other great experience was breakfast Baldo and Francesca staff looked after us When my daughter wanted more strawberries they brought her a cute little bowl filled with strawberries Baldo had a great sense of humor too He told me that he didn t like the idea of a long flight He said he wouldn t know what to do for 8 hours I told him that it goes by quickly because they have everything on a plane now And he replied in Italian Do they have Table Tennis Hilarious 
478072,Sina De La Ville, Our trip did not start well with three moves of room as a smell of raw sewarage was evident in 3 rooms Spoke to the manager who told me its a known problem Just be aware Breakfast is only just adequate Reasonable selection but not really 4 star Rooms quite old and beds sagging Asked for walk in shower but only over bath available which was quite difficult to use , The location was excellent next to the Doumo Helpful staff when asked questions 
478073,Sina De La Ville, We booked a triple room and paid a premium price expecting it to be large but all we got was a regular double with a small portable bed No space at all ,No Positive
478074,Sina De La Ville, Front desk was rude pool terrace photos much nicer than the real thing wifi spotty bathtub shower did not drain properly stagnant water stayed in tub for hours after shower breakfast was not good and had terrible coffee and furnishings looked worn , Location 
478075,Sina De La Ville, Most of Service personnel seem to be around since the opening of hotel and have forgotten why they do what they do Despite many times reminding that we want a double bed when making and confirming the booking got allocated a twin One of the poorest breakfast spreads seen in a very long time No iron provided for safety reasons Service of ironing one short no sleave dress 10Eur Pool is more of a small plunge pool max 80cm deep with a terrace space enough only for 7 loungers Only half of the pool space can have sun as the rest is covered by roof That makes 4 loungers in sun Then there are Germans who leave towels and go to their room For a large hotel calculate yourself what are your chances of enjoying yourself at the pool on a sunny day Housekeeping enters guest rooms after the first short knock before you had time to open your mouth Poor bathroom amenities soap bar and no hair conditioner Absolutely not recommended Not worth your money nor time , The location is as good as it gets right next to Duomo and all the main shopping sightseeing Rooms although not freshly renovated are really fine Wonderful fresh juice bar just across the road from the hotel 
478076,Sina De La Ville, only one bathrobe in room stained small towel safe not working and no one to fix it sauna not working in the morning and not enough toilet paper in spa bathroom Not all receptionists that helpful especially regarding safe, pool and spa great bed and breakfast
478077,Sina De La Ville, The front desk could have been friendlier We were promissed early check in but were met with rolling eyes We waited an hour extra for our room We were also told no deposit payment at check out but they withdrew the total amount when we checked in , The room was clean and nice 
478078,Sina De La Ville, Hard to improve on this , Wonderful welcome after 30 hours travel rewarded with top floor room with balcony Very stylish hotel fantastic front of house staff
478079,Sina De La Ville, The fitness center needs some work machines are dated and not working the best, Staff was very helpful and attentive The location is great Breakfast was pretty good 
478080,Sina De La Ville, Staff was a bit grumpy We travelled with 2 children and apparently they only allow a total of 3 people in each room This was not clear when we made our booking so we had to reserve one additional room , Great location Close to all major shopping 
478081,Sina De La Ville, The Deluxe triple room was a normal double room with additional smal bed It was cleaned only after reminder Personal is laisy and not ready to help, Only location
478082,Sina De La Ville, Choice of pillows pease The alternative for lactose was soy milk Any other alternative such as coconut or rice would be a better allergen alternative, good service and lovely ambience Great breakfast
478083,Sina De La Ville, Room condition was not up to 4 star standard as to my experience Furniture looks old and worn out Beds were uncomfortable Bathroom was small Small bath was installed instead of shower cabin Wifi is very poor Swimming pool which is on the hotel nice photos was cold and impossible to use for my kid , Perfect location Friendly staff Breakfast was ok Parking lot doesn t belong to hotel but located really close 
478084,Sina De La Ville, There was a leaking through the ceiling and it destroyed some of our personal items We only had 15 discount after that Avoid Nadia at the reception , Great location
478085,Sina De La Ville, We stayed at a room for three it was very small for 3 people There were only 2 plugs one in the bathroom it was hard to charge our telephones and cameras But it was ok as everything else was good , Very central close to everywhere 2 min Walk to Duomo The breakfast was ok there were gluten free goods 
478086,Sina De La Ville, nothing esle was good Booking com showd DIFFERENT PICTURE OF THE ROOM WHILE BOOKING WHILE ORIGINALLY THE ROOM WAS DIFFERENT BREAKFAST WAS UPTO THE MARK BASCIALLY AN AVERAGE HOTEL , only the location of the property was liked by me
478087,Sina De La Ville, Totally overpriced staff at breakfast rude and not willing to help Rooms are ok renovated superior rooms are better Staff wanted to give us old rooms even we paid for the new ones Be careful Very dated interior Rooftop pool is ok needs to be cleaned Comfort and Cleanness of rooms is not satisfying for that exceptional high price , Top Location big rooms valet parking 
478088,Sina De La Ville, The swimming pool is not deep enough to swim in its more for dangling your legs in wifi was a bit weak in the room but fine downstairs in the lobby, Good breakfast selection very clean rooms and enormous bed
478089,Sina De La Ville, No climate control expect better at this price point Room too hot no a c available Had to open windows which had no screens Loud down town noises and bugs forced us to close the windows , Friendly staff good location nice rooms 
478090,Sina De La Ville,No Negative, The location is very convenient to the cultural retail district The staff were very friendly accommodating gave me local knowledge tips prepared a public transport itinerary for a trip to the Alfa Romeo museum in Arese which is off the beaten track

478100,Sina De La Ville, We were a little disappointed with the hotel pool We weren t expecting something recreational but the pool itself and the area were a bit small and the pool itself was quite cold We were hoping for something a little more spa sauna like It is definitely not an area meant for kids but I suppose the shallow depth would be good for younger children , The room was very cozy and comfortable It was also quiet which was nice as a little get away from the bustle going on right outside our window The staff was very friendly and very helpful The hotel restaurant was also very delicious and the staff there were polite and attentive
