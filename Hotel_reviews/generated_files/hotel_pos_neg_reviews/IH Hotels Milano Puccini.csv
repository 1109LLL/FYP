302838,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, We were originally given a room on the top level so there wasn t a window only a small skylight which made me quite claustrophobic Unfortunately it was a couple of days before they had another room available and I was very happy when they did The room given to my adult daughters was huge but with the angle ceiling again in the roofline it meant the window was from the floor up to about a metre , The staff were very helpful and the location is superb
302839,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, A C not working for the first night no room view only roof window we had a room next to the elevator which was a bit noisy, Good location helpful reception service good breakfast
302840,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The hotel ranking should be 3 stars in my opinion Shower was very difficult would not recommend it to the elderly Also the renovation was a bit poorly made for example there were holes on the toilet walls , Breakfast was good The hotel is located to the shopping area and would be a good choice for shoppers It took about 25 minutes walk to the Duomo chatedral Hotel was clean and the staff was helpful 
302841,IH Hotels Milano Puccini,No Negative, Location excellent cause it s near to metro right in the centre lots Of shops and facility around Safe area It s not a 4 stars But room was nice Obviously it has not a restaurant inside or any room service 
302842,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Bed was very basic and no frills although comfortable but not excellent Lighting in the room could have been a bit more modern , Very clean hotel with great customer service Very good location close to Centrale station and very close to public transport Very good shower and nice amenities The beds could have been a little more comfortable and the lighting in the room was not very modern but overall excellent value for money 
302843,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, No possibility to change air conditioning setting from the room breakfast a bit basic, Location is very good close to metro station and Milan city center nice shopping area 
302844,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Some employees are very rude and doesn t care about customers however the others try their best to compensate the unhappiness One night we were so unhappy with the managers behavior and the day after the other manager send us flowers chocolate and fruits to show how sorry they are ,No Positive
302845,IH Hotels Milano Puccini,No Negative, I needed a cork screw for my wine and they were there in minutes friendly staff I even took a picture with them on my last day I m from London and was lovely smell as you walk in the entrance always someone there to say hello in Italian and English they even printed off the train timetable for me to explore
302846,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, We had to ask at reception for the air conditioning to be activated and again to switch off didn t seem to be any way to control from within our room We had a room at the front of the hotel so there was a little bit of traffic noise from the main road until later in the evening , Location of hotel was very good a short walk from the main train station and the main shopping areas Breakfast was very good lots to choose from and plenty of staff on duty to clear tables and make sure everyone was happy 
302847,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The room was very small Shower was broken it worked but water was coming even from a hose No notice about prices of drinks in a bar Small room for breakfast had to wait to sit A C was controlled from the lobby Really uncomfortable , Location is great couple minutes to metro Good breakfast 
302848,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The Hotel could need some face lifting There is absolutely no restaurant or bar possibilty in the Hotel te mini bar is very poor The breakfast hall is rather depressing The ceiling light in the room is terrible , The location is quite good Walking distance from the Stazione Centrale di Milano There is a Metro station close by Different shops in the immediate neighbourhood as well as some good and also simlple restaurants 
302849,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The shower did not have any kind of curtain so water always splashed on the floor , Great location in an important avenue with lots of shopping It s right next to the metro in a line with direct connection to the city centre e g the Duomo The rooms were quiet very cozy and well equipped and the breakfast was good 
302850,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, I m not sure if it because of blossoming but it seemed that in my room which was on the 5 th floor had lot dust everywhere in the room even dusty balls, Staff were extremely welcoming and warm So many nice people from different corners of world under the same roof playing games and having chi chat on the sunny days you can sit on the rooftop and listen your own music and spend rest of your day in hammock When you feel like you can go on the first floor and sit under greeny shelter and enjoy your drink and even play pingpong Bar is well know and often people comes from different areas to enjoy evening and meet people and have some drinks together They are very generous with fruits and food which you can make on the 6 th floor and make great dinner for yourself on the house whatever is available in the kitchen you can use I really liked this place and recommend strongly to people to visit this place You ll not regret for Sure Thank you 
302851,IH Hotels Milano Puccini,No Negative, The location and private hotel area in front of the sea are perfect Furniture in the room a bit old but still very good and it fits to the atmosphere Terrasse of the restaurant has an amazing view Breakfast is good I spent a wonderful weekend in Portofino and especially in Continental hotel 
302852,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, room with absolutely no view need to lock the room always from inside to prevent accident open from outside , neighborhood staff cleanliness quietness 
302853,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Nothing, Hotel is very nice staff especially Alexander are extremely helpful They put themselves out for you to find out information you want and facilities needed Staff are some of the most helpful in all the hotels I have stayed in Milan Lots more expensive and but not as helpful it makes a big difference
302854,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, From the hotel the Lift was old and slow you can hear the metros vibration from the area the Arabs Restaurants and their food , The hotel is a bit old and definitly not a 4 star i would rate it an average 3 star Breakfast is good location is 10 mins walk from Milano Central Station just outside the door you will find the Metro Lima the area is good for shopping clothes cosmetics shops are open from 08 00 till 20 00 Monday to Saturday but not for restaurants you can find plenty of bad food turkish and arabs little restaurants in the area that beleive me their food is disgusting In Milan go for an italian restaurants prices are nt expensive 6 12 for a pizza or 5 12 for Pasta and food is lovely since metro is outside the door that wont be a problem to eat at the Navigli Porta Genova area that is full of great restaurants My verdict is that this is a fair hotel which i found not expensive with a good service 
302855,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Old mattresses on the beds ensure back aches in the morning Acoustic insulation in the room not adequate No view from the windows Not renovated recently , Staff very friendly 
302856,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Room very small Only one power outlet you had to unplug a lamp to use it Cool white illumination in the room made you feel like you are in an office from the 60s not a comfortable place where you can sleep Bathroom was good though , Very friendly staff excellent location great breakfast
302857,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Bathroom looked old and it seemed that equipment there was not well maintained shower Cherry tomatoes on the breakfast were not cleaned properly with signs of some dirt two days in a row Likely we weren t eating them the rest dishes were 100 OK , Room itself was quite cozy Bed was comfortable enough It was a bit noisy while living in the room which has windows on the street side but just a little we were able to sleep well Breakfast was pretty good with wide selection of dishes 
302858,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Be ware The hotel is right next to a theater and a strip club So from 7 9pm in my room i hear noises and applauses from the theater and from 10pm onward full blown music from the strip club would only recommend this place if you are a heavy sleeper , Great location Right in front a subway lima 15 min walk to central station
302859,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The bathroom has a half tub Perhaps an old style unit in which you can only bathe sitting Does not even have a shower curtain that allows you to shower standing without the water splashing over Haven t seen anything like that before The lounge at the the front desk has no comfortable seats If you are required to wait for some time , The location Centrally located on a shopping street full of good eateries The Lima station is just a hop away
302860,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Need bigger elevator current only fits like 4 people , The location is amazing located nearby a lot of shopping malls The most important thing is it is located nearby the metro station 
302861,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The bed was not well established it slid away from the wall During the night sleeping was felt that from somewhere blows Maybe the air conditioning but it was not comfortable After spending 3 nights I became a cold In the bath room was bathtub but it is so small that only suitable for children There was no shower curtain so the water sprays on the floor and the shower floor became wet Bathroom door did not correspond to a 4 star hotel The bottom of the door broken crushed It is shown in the attached photograph , Very good breakfast Polite staff Room service every day towels were changed toiletries replenished daily Was extra pillows 
302862,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Everyone read my review please be careful of this hotel I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights When I checked out I paid everything in cash However they still charge my credit card with same amount Although they deposit back but I need to pay the difference of exchange rate Don t even think to come here I warn everyone who read my review Very disappointed , Nothing
302863,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The room didn t look like pictures and as soon as you opened the door smell of damp hit you it smelt old and dated , The breakfast was great the lobby look modern and new and the man behind the reception desk was amazing and very helpful 
302864,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, There was a noise coming from the air conditioning The solved it by turning it off which resulted on me waking up cold , Great breakfast superb location clean comfortable bed nice bathroom 
302865,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, City tax , Bathroom was big and as usual in good Italian hotels well equipped Spacious room Big TV with fairly good choice of channels Landline phone Heating was good Breakfast was better than is usually expected coffee was real coffee I think even grapefruit juice was real 
302866,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The value for money is not very good the bed not very comfortable and the shower also not very good, The breakfast was really good and the staffs really helpful 
302867,IH Hotels Milano Puccini,No Negative, Excelent location on a central street and close to two central metro stations comfortable room and facilities very good breakfast However what I should stress the most was the staff They were very very helpful in helping me find my cellphone I had lost in an unknown taxi making all the contacts and warning me that they had found it even after I had already checked out of the property Would definitely come back 
302868,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, There is noise and jolts at night because it was very close to the metro station But this may not be a problem when you are tired of exploring the city you can easily get to sleep Rooms could have kettle and can be more sockets for charging to electronic devices , The hotel was centrally located Walking distance to Doumo square famous shopping streets and buildings We didnt need metro bus or taxi Central train station was within walking distance and it made easier get to the airport The staff were very helpful friendly and kind We have not experienced any negativity or problem The breakfast was fresh and attentive Wifi was really nice I recommend this hotel location was perfect and safe 
302869,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The matress was bad and our room needed some maitenance works , The staff is very friendly breakfast is quite enough not much diversity but good quality in the products and the location is awsome 
302870,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The hotel rooms are somewhat outdated this is an old hotel , Location is convenient pretty close to Milano Centrale and not far from the city center The hotel staff is nice and helpful 
302871,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Hot water availability very inconsistent the first day we didn t have any hot water The wifi is very slow and the general room facilities are generally very worn The phone in the room did not function a few lightbulbs blown above the sink in bathroom one next to the bed Beds are on wheels so they dislocate from the walls very easily too We were in a generally very green room too which felt very old fashioned , Friendly check in staff Good value for money and good location 
302872,IH Hotels Milano Puccini,No Negative, The staff was incredibly helpful and they were the nicest people i ve met on my trip to Italy the location was perfect very close to Lima metro station 
302873,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The shower was loose and the water was not hot just about warm The aircon was also too cold and wasn t able to turn it down , Very friendly staff good location right near the metro and cafes Basic needs in hotel if you are in and out exploring 
302874,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Double bed was 2 singles pushed together a bit uncomfortable, Reception was great room was great breakfast was great excellent value for money have stayed before and will stay again 
302875,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, In other countries this hotel will have no more than 2 stars It s dirty old and not refurbished Location is not excellent for anything Even if it s close to Lima Metro station you cannot do too much on Buenos Aires The same shops are near Dom Church and the area is more attractive , Even if ti s on the Buenos Aires Street there are quiet rooms and you can sleep well Breakfast is decent 
302876,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, bathroom was smelly couldn t control air condition from room This used to be a great comfortable hotel centrally located and great value for money Don t know why it s standards have deteriorated Won t stay here again unless some upgrades and are made to this once great hotel , breakfast was great very centrally located on one of the main busy roads in Milan s shopping haven 
302877,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, It was a little bit hard to find and no place to park my car but i think it s ok for the city center, Nice breakfast but no hot food Very nice and clean room comfortable bathroom I liked that they had slippers for each guest Near the center 20 minutes from Duomo and near the Metro also 15 minutes from Central station
302878,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The aircondition was not at all working The room was all dull and grey I would not recommend this hotel with young children I needed to get the milk warm for my young daughter but the staff told me that I need to go to Cafeteria to get it warm since they did not have Kitchen key , The Location was great Metro and Shops were just Right the corner 
302879,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Bath tub size Bathing was a problem Size of the bath tub is too small No provision for morning evening tea coffee , Location Breakfast Tariff
302880,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The hotel used to be charming Puccini music in public rooms Now a radio blaring Minimalist No longer suitable for business travellers It was disappointing to see how it has deteriorated , Pleasant staff at reception 
302881,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The man on reception on our first night was not overly helpful barely told us anything about the hotel breakfast or anything and then wouldn t turn the air conditioning down so we were very hot and stressed out by this , Excellent location close to shops and the sights 
302882,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, May be some shelves in the bathroom should be added there are any because we did not have any place where to put our bath s staff , Location and breakfast are definitely at the best room also very nice 
302883,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The only inconvenience I can mention is that the hotel is 20 min walk from the central place and the Duomo However the promenade is nice because it gives a good possibility to see the city from a different corner I really liked it , The hotel is really nice the stuff is friendly and always ready to help The breakfast was good there were always finely backed croissants fresh fruit and a very good Italian coffee The room was quite big with a spacious bathroom and always clean towels 
302884,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Very bad service front disk person at night even not talk to you in good way Smile on coredor of floor three Not good at all with this price you can find better, Location
302885,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Small rooms The rooms facing the boulevard are VERY NOISY you can t sleep with windows open Air conditioning didnt work No toilet in lobby Old slow elevators , Very friendly staff Great room service Very clean rooms Great location for its price right near Lima Metro Station getting downtown in 10 min situated exactly on one of the main shopping blvds Bueonos Aires I prefer staying cheaper NOT downtown but having a great access to downtown rather than downtown with HUGE prices Good basic breakfast with very friendly staff Excellent coverage of WiFi 
302886,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Room was tiny and nothing like the room we ve selected on booking com At check out they ve tried charging us 110 more without giving a real reason I am not referring to the 5 per day per person tax that the city of Milan charges tourists Very unhappy with the experience Would not recommend ,No Positive
302887,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, We were in room 415 in what should have been a double room But surely it is not a double room In fact to fit in a double bed from the window side there were not more than 20cm between the side of the bed and the wall Moreover even as regards switches and socket outlets it was obvious that this is a single room as with a double bed the switches end up right under the pillow there was even just one pair of complimentary bed slippers For sure it was not what you expect in a 4 star hotel , Staff were friendly Breakfast was quite good and plentiful 
302888,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, the bed was against the wall e felt sufocated the shower didnt work properly very bad smell on the toilet wifi didnt work even in the public areas, staff was friendly
302889,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, One of the staff memebers stole money from our room when we went out one evening When we asked reception to look into this they was not helpful and wouldn t even check cctv and she had a smirk on her face the whole time Worst service from a hotel ever I would not recommend it and was such a shame as we was celebrating my friends birthday ,No Positive
302890,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Some muffled boom boom noise from club next door I was tired enough to sleep though , Location and reasonably good cleanliness Breakfast offered plenty of choice 
302891,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Please consider insulating the front door of the rooms a little bit because when people walk and talk down the corridor late in the night or early one can hear everything Also in the times when everyone talks about saving the environment please allow your customers to choose whether they like their towels to be changed every day by putting them on the floor for instance best regards and thank you for the wonderful stay at your hotel we shall definitely recommend it to other friends , Location is perfect 10 minutes walking distance from Milano Centrale ane 20 minutes from Duomo Ideal both for longer stay and transfer stay i e if you only sleep in Milano and travel or work in nearby cities Lima stop on the red metro line is only 5 min walk There are lot of stores and shops around if you came for shopping and with big wallet Breakfast is excellent Staff was also very friendly and spoke very good English You can pay by credit card as well 
302892,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The accomodation don t correspond to 4 hotel at all Hot water is not coming at once have to wait around 10 min and after can take a shore , Good location cose to central station and sopping area
302893,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, I didn t like that when we wanted to take a shower we needed to wait 10 to 15 minutes until warm water came The shower itself was not that good Am breakfast didn t have to much fruits and for omelettes if you wanted one you had to pay for it I waited that the hotel new what I asked when I did the reservation I asked gluten free and lactose free breakfast but they didn t say something I hat to ask and the possibilities were that much , The hotel was clean The localization ist very good but don t take a room to the street side it s to laut and very warm The have some gluten free things on the breakfast but you have to order 
302894,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Black hairs on the towel spoiled good impression from the hotel The managers staff must control laundering better , Room breakfast no noise in the room Friendly staff Very convenient location on the shopping street near numerous cafes restaurants fast food restaurants 15 min by foot from the Centrale train station Direct metro line to Rho Fair center city center 
302895,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The biggest con of our stay was a really bad smell at our bathroom I m not saying it wasn t clean Maybe it s the lack of ventilation system But certainly it was something that could not pass unnoticed Our towels also didn t have the sense of freshness that somebody would expect from a 4 star hotel , The location was really good Hundred of shops are literally right at your feet the central train station is about 15 walk and the Duomo 5 with the metro Metro stations can be found all around corso buenos aires The staff was really polite and helpful Breakfast was awesome The variety of sweet and salty food was wide and everything was fresh and tasty There is internet connection everywhere although somewhat slow Surprisingly there was no noise from the street The room was small but cozy 
302896,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Dirty tiles in the bathroom old mattress no refill on the shower gel after the first day an omelette costs 4 they serve mostly sweet things at breakfast , Great location 1 min from Lima subway station 
302897,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, The mattress needed to be replaced And the sheets were super thin Also the shower water was tepid not hot , Spacious rooms and good location Fairly priced mini bar
302898,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Dirty bathroom with HAIR in the tub old doors furniture the room was cold no possibility to change temperature lots of noise from next rooms hotel lobby small and cold , Good location 1 min to the metro 10 min to the central station 
302899,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Honestly the bath could ve done with an extra scub little bit grimy , The buffet was okay maybe some scrambled eggs if I m being picky Receptionist was very helpful and freindly

302902,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, In the room the real temperature was 16degrees Celsius even if the heater was set to 24degrees from the reception so it s been really cold The interior design and facilities are more proper for a 2 stars hotel not for one with 4 stars , Hotel location is very good Breakfast included is decent Hotel s personal is kind and trying to help

302905,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, We heard the metro sounds in our room Room was very small and go to bed you need to go from one side , Very good location About 15 20 min on foot from central station Close to the hotel in the street there is metro where you can go directly to city center there are a lot of shops also We like interior of the hotel 
302906,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, Very noisy from HVAC system thanks god I had an earplugs Secondly we did not have hot water only warm one , Location 3 metro stops to the city centre 
302907,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, breakfast is quite weak just a simple hotel to stay , The location of the hotel is very good it s a few step away from the metro station Very close to the shops 
302908,IH Hotels Milano Puccini, They tried to issue the half of total amount before our stay and my bank cancelled my card because of this anonymous process When we arrived to hotel they mentioned about that they have to get this amount as cash A little bit annoying procedure , Really great location It takes nearly 15 minutes to Milano Centrale Train Station by walk just a few steps away from Lima metro station and only four stations away from Duomo
