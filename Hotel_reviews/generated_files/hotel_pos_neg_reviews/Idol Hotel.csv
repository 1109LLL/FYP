62770,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Good and special hotel with different chambers Romantic and high quality decoration and fournitures in the room 7 8 min to the metro and the gare Saint Lazare I like this hotel but a little bit expensive 
62771,Idol Hotel, Loved everything , The staff at the hotel were really delightful and friendly speaking both French and English The location was fantastic with several metro lines to the centre around the area The hotel itself is one of the nicest I ve ever stayed in with a unique design 
62772,Idol Hotel, Not much x, Beautiful hotel 15 minutes walk from the Moulin Rouge The staff couldn t be more helpful and spoke very good English The room was spacious and spotlessly clean The only thing missing was a kettle for a cup of tea although there was an espresso machine in the room and a more comprehensive machine in reception for coffee and hot chocolate The restaurant out of the hotel to the right and 1 minute walk on the opposite side of the road is well worth a visit Enjoy 
62773,Idol Hotel, Toalette was a bit small No place to store personal stuff in bath room like tuth brush makeup perfums etc , A very nice location Friendly lovely stuff
62774,Idol Hotel, No complaints , This place has tons of personality as does the extremely helpful and friendly staff The room was large and the beds were comfy They all have a different vibe and come with a built in sound system you can connect to There is a very nice hot drink bar in the lobby that is free to use It s close to several train and metro stations and is within walking distance 
62775,Idol Hotel, the only downside was the breakfast the sausages were like little hot dogs and were really hard At 17 per person it was rather pricey, Everything was perfect Close to the Europe metro station which made travelling around the city very easy the room was gorgeous A large comfy bed and the shower in the room was lovely especially with the large shower head it was very relaxing after a long day Free tea and coffee in the lounge and the speakers on the walls were brilliant We will definitely be returning to this amazing hotel 
62776,Idol Hotel,No Negative, We really liked that we could get adjoining rooms for our family The style of the hotel was cool The staff was very accommodating for our arrival and departure times 
62777,Idol Hotel, Shower stall located in the middle of the bedroom HVAC system not responsive to changes might have been a temporary malfunction , Very friendly staff Relatively close to Metro station Expensive but nice breakfast 
62778,Idol Hotel, the only thing for us was our neighbour walked around in heels on the wooden floors from 7am , Really lovely room with large plasma tv large comfortable bed big bath shower bonus of a balcony for a morning coffee also lovely free coffee in reception 
62779,Idol Hotel, Quite a small room but expect that in Paris, Breakfast was good staff were all very friendly and helpful Good location on a quiet street but very Central We walked everywhere
62780,Idol Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is very nice breakfast was absolutely great and L a at the front desk was always prepare to help us The hotel is in a very quiet part of town when we came back to the hotel in the evening after a hard day it was an oasis when we were not tired after a day only a few metro stops and we enjoyed buzz of the city definitely stay I recommend and bathtub in the room is really cool We do not know why others build separate bathrooms 
62781,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel I particularly appreciate the sound systems in the room A fabulous distinctive touch A real effort on design making stays for a couple particularly enjoyable 
62782,Idol Hotel, This place should close down people are rude the room are with no windows dirty and small like a prison and they smell like weat clothes whe you leave them drying in the washing machine the most terrible experience of my life I felt like womiting I tried to cancel but they did not allow me the owner should go to prison,No Positive
62783,Idol Hotel, the only thing I would say is the hallways are small so if you are larger it could be hard to get around but I believe this is common in Europe , We loved everything about this property the rooms are so cool the staff was very friendly and helpful and the young lady who helped us gave us many suggestions for both tourist spots and quitter options really made us feel comfortable 
62784,Idol Hotel, The noise The cleaning staff are very loud with their work The price of breakfast and the mini bar is extortionate There is a supermarket across the road so that helped , The location was excellent the Radio Bluetooth speakers in the room were a great surprise The staff were very very kind and helpful The shower was exceptional and the room was comfortable overall
62785,Idol Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent and the hotel very clean and comfortable The staff were most obliging and nothing was too much trouble The hotel is in a very safe district and many attractions within easy walking distance There are also some very good reasonably priced restaurants nearby We enjoyed our stay and would certainly revisit 
62786,Idol Hotel, Nothing at all The stay was perfect relaxing and fun , Everything This hotel is pure boutique luxury I highly recommend it Got a great price through Booking com and everything was perfect for the stay Would be a great hotel for a couple looking for a romantic experience in Paris The beds are super comfy too best sleep I have had in a while We were going to a concert in Salle Pleyel concert hall and this was just a short walk there and back It was a perfect location for our trip 
62787,Idol Hotel, Although the hotel to be fine I guess the price is too much even for 1 person and with no breakfast included The water to take a bath was so so hot that I was with difficult in take a bath , Staff very kind good location 
62788,Idol Hotel, The lift was tiny It would not be big enough for a large couple so I don t think the hotel would be suitable for Americans Also its much further from La Croissette than I imagined even via taxi , The bathroom was small but had Hansgrohe Urquiola taps and shower There was a separate toilet with Duravit wall hung WC and a Geberit flush The mattress was firm but extremely comfortable 
62789,Idol Hotel, We decided not to opt for the breakfast as 17 per person per breakfast seemed steep though everywhere in Paris seems expensive to eat so perhaps it s justified , Multi function shower Bluetooth speakers in the room led lighting Small supermarket across the road and a metro station less than 2 minutes away made it very easy to get around 
62790,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Lovely boutique hotel Very kind staff The single room was on the small side but the space was used very smartly and the design super stylish My highlight was definitely the rainforest shower system I never wanted that shower to end I would definitely recommend this hotel 
62791,Idol Hotel, The shampoo soaps had way too much perfume for me , All of the staff and especially Jessica were all wonderful Excellent at customer service professional friendly and truly wanted to please the guests 
62792,Idol Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was absolutely amazing in decor The staff were extremely accommodating making it an overall lovely experience This is by far the most aesthetically fantastic hotel I ve ever been to Loved it 
62793,Idol Hotel, I was alone so it was not a problem but please note that there is no separate bathroom If you come with a friend you will see him her showering haha, I loved the decoration the staff the equipment Everything is great
62794,Idol Hotel, Breakfast is expensive I didn t try it because of the cost 17 and if you have a room at the front of the property it s a little loud early in the morning , Super clean beautiful hotel great location and fabulous decor 
62795,Idol Hotel, Nothing It was perfect , The staff were friendly and efficient We arrived early and our room was not yet available But they offered to bring our luggage to the room while we started our sightseeing almost immediately The location was perfect since the train and some convenience stores are nearby The room is quite small which anyway is typical in Paris But they more than made up for the space We had a very comfy bed in a lovely decorated room All in all 5 stars for me 
62796,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Funky large suite room with bath in main living space Large walk in closet and stylish shower room Quality coffee tea available 24 hours in reception plus drink making facilities in room Walk in wardrobe 
62797,Idol Hotel, There is no Ebglish Channel on TV Checking in time too late 16 00 They should be flexible a bit if the room is ready they should check the guests in rather let them wait It s over priced for what what it is , The location is good 
62798,Idol Hotel, Breakfast left a little to be desired if you got to breakfast after 9am some of the breakfast items were gone and were not replaced Sausages Bacon for example There were no plates provided apart from what was set out on the table if you used one plate and wanted to get something else all you could do was take it from another place setting the lady on duty for breakfast gave us a very stern look like we did something we weren t meant to , Good location and we were given a free room upgrade funky hotel with great design and room decor Staff always helpful and friendly mostly 
62799,Idol Hotel, I can t think of anything that could be improved We will be back , Wonderful breakfast Housekeeping was amazing Room outstanding Very quiet and comfortable We could play our music and the speakers were great 
62800,Idol Hotel, A kettle would have been nice in the room there was an expresso machine but being Irish I missed being able to make a cup of tea Not a big issue though as everything else was amazing, The hotel was lovely it was quirky super clean and had all mod cons The shower was amazing Very chilled out and relaxing The staff were amazing they were very friendly and helpful I don t think I ve ever been in as relaxed a hotel The room was Gregory s and very quiet Because it s a small boutique hotel it felt very personal and a friendly place to stay I ll definitely go back next time I m in Paris 
62801,Idol Hotel, Some details about the sink that is in the room itself due to lack of space I suppose its not convenient but it s not a big deal , very friendly and fast check in someone assist me to bring the luggage and show me the room very nice decoration Nice free capsule coffee in the room Nice bed Better breakfast as expected I must admit that I get mostly bad breakfasts in France but this one was good 
62802,Idol Hotel,No Negative, We would like to extend a special thanks to Ms Karime the person who greeted us when we arrived She was always smiling and very kind Also a special thank you to Ms Jessica for all her assistance throughout our stay Ms Itala was very clean cheerful and had a positive attitude We enjoyed seeing her at the breakfast area Ms Love and her team did everything they can to ensure that we enjoyed our time at the hotel Thank you and we love IDOL 
62803,Idol Hotel, The room is not really big even for the non basic ones but it s unfortunately something common in Paris No slippers in the room , The nice design of the room and the bluetooth for the music in the room Close from the subway Very friendly reception and very accomodating
62804,Idol Hotel, Would have liked if I was told at check in that the coffee tea was free of charge Not a lot of good restaurants around or places to get food Saw a sign of a mini supermarket opening in 2016 in that street , Staff was super friendly and helpful Was upgraded to a bigger room after 2 days of a 4 day stay thank you that was greatly appreciated Super cute rooms both times unique and great flair and design Really close to the Metro station Europe and Saint Lazar Great value for the price and location

62807,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Staff was amazing very friendly The decorations in hotel are very interesting There is an espresso machine and very nice sound system in every room Excellent attention to detail nuxe lotions shampoos gels soaps and conditioners are provided in each room Rooms are excellently cleaned Coffee hot drinks machine in the reception Staff at the reception are always helpful and friendly always eager to give directions recommendations and help with anything you need The location is perfect just nearby there is a very nice boulangerie and a park 10 15 min drive to louvre There are very nice cafes and restaurants in the area Very nice area close to the main attractions in Paris As me and my husband were there on a honeymoon the stuff were very nice and offered us a suite room with a very big discount Would definitely recommend the hotel and looking forward to coming back

62809,Idol Hotel, Not much , Loved loved loved this hotel Staff was friendly upon arrival Room spectacular and visually so pleasing I ll stay here again for sure 
62810,Idol Hotel, Can t see why they can t give you an invoice when you leave every other hotel can some people have played the in room speakers too loud and blown out the bass too bad , Staff is great they seem to care about the guests In room Bluetooth music is wonderful Hotel is cozy and unique in style 
62811,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Incredible hotel and location staff were fantastic very friendly and patient with our stilted French Our room was really interestingly designed with lots of lovely touches 
62812,Idol Hotel,No Negative, Reception personnel very attentive polite and helpful We were upgraded to suit room and some discount was offered too Breakfasts nice choise in relation to prices and in comparison with widely available cafes around Acoustic system in suite room 603 comfortable and soft bed the only better rooms in this hotel might be with balconies Generally very quiet place for busy and noisy city near to metro you can reach any distant place in the city and close surroundings
