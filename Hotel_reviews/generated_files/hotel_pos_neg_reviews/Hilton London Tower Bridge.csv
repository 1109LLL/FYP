199064,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I was with 4 friends in two rooms The room with 3 people in only had one double bed and a put you up style chair bed We did complain and we re moved to a room with two bigger beds but the third bed was still the chair bed Thought the Hilton could do better especially as some families want to be together , Comfy bed good shower great breakfast 
199065,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The shower was a little difficult in that the water sprayed directly on the vanity if you applied any reasonable pressure This was purely because of the way the bathroom is designed Other than the shower the room was perfect , The hotel was in a good location super close to the tube station Check in was super easy and the staff were very helpful We were given complimentary breakfast at Jamie s Italian the restaurant attached to the hotel Breakfast was AMAZING and the coffee was brilliant super important if you ask me The hotel was very accommodating of our late flight and gave us late check out until 2 pm complimentary 
199066,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The breakfast was exceptionally poor Looked like a shortage of staff lead to a lack of everything Had to wait so long for the rest of breakfast to arrive that what we had already selected was cold None of the staff were friendly seemed impatient with being asked where things were The eating area looked very tired had been down graded to a cafe with wooden stirrers instead of spoons Left feeling as though we should have eaten out The pillows on the bed smelt of cigarette smoke which we would have changed had it not been so late when we realised Last time we stayed we really enjoyed it that s why we booked again ,No Positive
199067,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The tv didn t work and my room wasn t ready when I turned up My shower was cold the on site engineer came to check it out and told me it just takes a while to heat up To be fair after 10 minutes it did get up to warm not ideal if you re in a rush or have a high maintenance girlfriend, Breakfast was excellent the room was a fair size 
199068,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing to complain about , The location and found the hotel has a relaxing atmosphere after a busy day in London The rooms where good size with good facilities comfortable clean 
199069,Hilton London Tower Bridge, As I wrote above delay in the rooms being ready , I stayed as part of a family group for one night prior to my son s wedding We asked if the rooms we had reserved could be close together on the same floor and you arranged it thank you Unfortunately none of the rooms were ready when we arrived despite having been told they would be available from 3pm when I rang in advance to ask and mine was the last to be ready and not until about 4 30 That apart the proximity of rooms was excellent Very comfortable beds 
199070,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We didn t like the fact we couldn t use the roof terrace for a drink as it was my birthday it would have been nice to have had a drink up there in the superb weather we had but that s my only negative, The homemade granola for breakfast in Jamie s was fabulous My room was lovely and I loved the quality of shampoo and body lotion etc
199071,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast is acceptable but choice limited Plugs are UK or Japanese Need to ask for adaptor In such hotel plugs should be international , Location and easy access
199072,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Good breakfast in the facilities of Jamie s Italian Nice executive lounge with outside area on balcony with great view of The Shard and more Helpful staff Good location with 5 minutes walk to the Jubilee line and train station 
199073,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Arrived at 1 45pm and did not get a room until nearly 4pm Then our rooms aircon was broken and we were told we needed to move rooms It was after 6pm by the time they moved us When we left they tried to bill us the full rate not the rate agreed on booking com Overall it s a good hotel but I feel the staff lack training , Clean and functional Location
199074,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The bed creaked The terrace bar advertised was only for executives and not for regular guests and for such a big name as Hilton there wasn t exceptional facilities The Tower Guoman across the river is better Value for money debatable , Location was superb and the facilities good although not exceptional Air conditioning was excellent 
199075,Hilton London Tower Bridge, the breakfast was not very good the cooked items had been standing a while Coffee machine was broken and I had to find a member of staff and ask for coffee when poured out it was stale Our stay was the night of the London Bridge incident , The Reception staff were helpful both before and after the incident 
199076,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Room was late but we got an upgrade so no problem One of the lights was nor working Main light switch a bit fidley, Excellent Bed and well equipped room
199077,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No help with luggage One bathrobe missing Insufficient bathroom shampoo for two Air con awful slept in a room far to hot and air con did not work and yes I did follow the instructions We didn t call for help as we were far to tired and didn t Want to have to wait for assistance and after the service at the concierge we didn t think the hotel could be bothered the room was supposed to be a deluxe which was supposed to include a seating area unless this meant the desk chair there was none I was suspicious this was not a deluxe room I have stayed in American chain hotels before never again in a Hilton , Restaurant and lounge staff were friendly
199078,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Hotel was unable to get our cases to our room roomhad unpleasant smell and was not overly clean BUT they did arrange a good discount without us requesting it impressive , Convenience to shard breakfast
199079,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Staff were excellent and very helpful but for us it was the location which was right in the area we wanted to explore Very clean to and the barman did a mean Cosmo cocktail 
199080,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room was very small and basic Also when asked about promotions the staff had little or no clue what I was talking about When we asked for a knife to chop up fruit in our room the kitchen staff point blank refused In hindsight I wish I had gone and booked a premier inn , Breakfast was good and the room was very clean 
199081,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Having small change go missing the fridge locked from use although an ice machine was available at the endof the corridor Poor view and extra charge to use the balcony And although the Hilton stressed that our views are important no reply has been received from them addressing our concerns Accurate at the time of writing , Location was excellent front of house staff professional friendly and efficient 
199082,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I was disappointed about A paying extra for the roof balcony for a special occasion and we wasn t able to use because it shuts at 10pm I wasn t been informed and it wasn t been run briefly what s written on the paper that was given to me I guess it will be a good idea if you run briefly what s on the paper because not all guest have the time to read especially if rushing into something e g like getting ready and going out for dinner B Being disappointed with the receptionist night duty when we are trying to enter to the left side entrance and he showed me a rude gesture instead of saying please use the other entrance door C Same as the door staff whose a bit rude about asking for room key Assuming we wasn t guests Even if it s protocol to ask maybe in a nice way not being so rude I just find it humiliating showing of rudeness Paying that amount of money is not worth to be not treated nice , I like their surprise cake and card They really make it extra special my boyfriend s birthday Thank you for the staff effort 
199083,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The mini bar is always a source of irritation not enough room to store own milk small food items etc and the sensors are readily activated when items are moved As always the hotel breakfast was far too expensive , Great location just a few minutes walk from the tube the Thames and many tourist attractions with a good choice of venues supermarkets for food and drink Our double deluxe room was spacious quiet and comfortable for three adults with efficient and quiet air conditioning great shower bath tea and coffee facilities It was very hot during our stay so the adjacent water features and breeze from the river were very welcome 
199084,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Had trouble checking in Did not get into my room until 1745 As it was not ready consequently this had a knock on effect and we missed the start of the show in the West End , Room very clean Staff helpful especially bar staff 
199085,Hilton London Tower Bridge, It took me speaking to 4 people before I got an answer over which breakfast food was not gluten free Staff need extra training to understand coeliac disease ,No Positive
199086,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Staff in the reception didn t even acknowledge you when you went in or out, Popped into the bar for a drink the staff were so friendly and welcoming
199087,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Paid for room upgrade but thought room size would reflect this but didn t , Staff were very courteous and the location was excellent The furnishings in the room were good the bed was very comfortable and bathroom facilities were good
199088,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I asked for the room to be decorated with balloons flowers cake and petals on the bed On my arrival it was not done and it missed initial surprise and I still had to pay for it , Staff did what they could to make me feel beter
199089,Hilton London Tower Bridge, This appears to be a hotel which caters mainly to business people Decor is modern and bland Shades of grey Some rooms have separate bath and shower which we would have preferred Bathtub deep and narrow some difficulty in getting in and out when wet Shower doors tend to allow water to flood the floor Found the air conditioning to be too cold and somewhat noisy Window opens but too noisy outside at night to keep open , Great location for River Thames and river based transportation events restaurants and entertainment All a few minutes away Very close to London Bridge Station Railway and Underground All staff front desk catering and housekeeping efficient and friendly Rooms and adjoining bathrooms clean and comfortable Beds very comfortable Adjoining restaurant serves good food at reasonable prices We would stay here again 
199090,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The room was both clean and comfortable with plenty of space for 2 people Great facilities however I didn t know about the fitness suite and therefore didn t have my gym gear with me Breakfast was delicious with a great selection to suit everyone Would definitely return 
199091,Hilton London Tower Bridge, all good, great location and staff very helpful rooms great and spacious and bed comfy too pillows a bit too soft but thats a personal preference Beautiful hotel and very clean with a great atmosphere
199092,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Just would ve loved to have more time in the executive lounge and just that they would ve remembered my request about it being out anniversary , Was perfect in every aspect met all my requirements Staff were on point always and happy to help with any queries 
199093,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Some of the staff was not very helpful and not understanding Making it our fault they did not have a room according to our order and trying to be nice as if they were doing us a favor when finding another room that was according to our booking We had seen some feedback from geust getting cakes and welcome gifts when there was a birthday or anniversary I don t know who payed them for writing that comment or feedback because that is not how it is We got neither eventhough we sent them messages through bookings as we were celebrating both As if they had never got the messages and did not expect us at all if I refer to the arrival The staff was just not helpful at all trying to make us stay a bit more comfortable eventhough we asked for it , Breakfast was great Some of the staff was helpful 
199094,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Third year in a row this hotel has messed up our booking details I would never choose to stay here if it wasn t for work On check in we were also convinced to stay in accessible rooms on a newly refurbished floor The rooms were NOT newly refurbished they were simply refurbished to make them accessible by removing the bath and having accessible friendly features This type of room wasn t necessary for myself and my colleagues and were totally mis described at check in My advice would be to stick with your original room if offered this It was a busy period in the London Bridge area but even so this hotel is very over priced I d recommend the London Bridge Hotel in preference if available , The bar area and Jamie s Italian are nice If you re here for a conference the business and conference facilities are nice 
199095,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Seating in the Jamie s restaurant we were initially seated next to a young family on a bench seat We asked to be moved to a table with our own seats Who wants to share dinner with a family you don t know , Gorgeous hotel in a gorgeous location just a few minutes from the Thames Tower Bridge and the Shard The Jamie s Italian restaurant for breakfast was a treat 
199096,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I had to ask for a bathrobe Maid knocked on the door at 10 to 9 am Mini bar was checked and restocked at 9 am I was trying to get dressed, Space big bathroom breakfast
199097,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We weren t disappointed by anything at the hotel only the amount of roadworks and construction going on outside but obviously not the hotels fault , We enjoyed the luxury feel of the hotel without feeling uncomfortable as in other places you can feel intimidated The staff were excellent and unobtrusive while always being on hand and available to help 
199098,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Not much of a view from rooms, We stayed here London marathon weekend perfect location to atractions Superb breakfast and other meals provided by Jamies Italian onsite
199099,Hilton London Tower Bridge, nothing stands out for need of improvement, Room was lovely breakfast good Also appreciate the complimentary bottle of water We also ordered late room service the food was fab 
199100,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing, We upgraded and the executive room was fabulous the design of the hotel is very funky and cool the bar was buzzing Breakfast excellent Staff superb couldn t fault a thing highly recommend 
199101,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The room was roomy and the facilities were great The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and tidy The staff were very pleasant and helpful and Jamie s Italian within the hotel was great 
199102,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The pillows on the bed need replacing The attached restaurant needs refreshing but food was good and the staff were great, Really pleased with the hotel Ideal location for our plans on this visit Pleasant staff Very clean 
199103,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Minor problem the level access shower flooded the bathroom, All the staff were excellent The location was good but nice and quiet in the room Breakfast was of good quality with a reasonable choice
199104,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Couldn t work the aircon the tv didn t work properly to start off with and you couldn t turn on bathroom light without turning on the main lights ,No Positive
199105,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No Car Park we knew that and made alternative arrangements however it needs to be recorded as a downside Please note there is a small area by the entrance foyer where you can leave the car for the time it takes to check in so there is no worry carrying car luggage , Great Breakfast in the Jamies Restaurant attached to the hotel Upgrade to Executive and then enjoy complimentary drinks in the Exec lounge 
199106,Hilton London Tower Bridge, hotel restroom facilities have been used by tourists walking by When we tried to use them an Italian school class was occupying it Quiet unusual maybe this is due to the fact that the hotel staff by the way very helpful is Italian too , Breakfast area was very nice and the buffet time was extended for late morning arrivals
199107,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The beds were too hard and the pillows flattened too much which meant we kept waking up and having to shift positions because we were getting too stiff and achey , The hospitality and bathroom facilities were excellent and any requests we had were met promptly Also the beds in the twin room were a great size 
199108,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The reception staff very unhelpful when I told them I booked a room with a sofa bed Only double room left in hotel After much deliberation we took the room anyway to find it did actually have an extra bed in the room,No Positive
199109,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Price of a gin and tonic in the bar , The breakfast was great I myself am vegetarian and gluten and dairy intolerant which was catered to on my request 
199110,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Better wifi availability within rooms Appeared to be a bit patchy at times suffering from regular dropouts , Two rooms booked family members so finding we were allocated interconnecting rooms on arrival was a very pleasant surprise Very quick to react to and fix a slight issue in the bathroom Also the availability to store luggage both before allocation of rooms and after checkout was invaluable 
199111,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Mini fridge made an annoying and constant mechanical whining sound Thank goodness I had a white noise sound machine , Great location near a major station and outdoor market
199112,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, It was a good location for The Shard and for Southbank which was our main purpose for our trip So location from that perspective was perfect for us but we would look elsewhere for our next trip to London purely down to the location only being good for those attractions in my opinion We didn t use any of the amenities in the hotel check in and out was pleasant enough the room was an average size but the bathroom was lovely and big its nice to have a bath with option of a shower Could probably fit a stand alone shower in that bathroom which would be good as opposed to shower over the bath 
199113,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I would of liked a better view especially of the Shard as I took my husband there for lunch for his 60th birthday, The bar area was really nice friendly staff and cool music
199114,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The staff in Jamies for breakfast weren t very friendly and abrupt , Bar staff were really lovely and so were the front desk Room was immaculate and very comfortable Hotel was clean and spacious and inviting We would definitely stay again 
199115,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, We always look for a new accommodation surrounding stPauls Southwark with proximity of the Thames Good beds no noise though we faced the works of London Bridge rail and view to the Shard Definitely we ll be back 
199116,Hilton London Tower Bridge, As above ref room but not a major issue , Staff were excellent especially Bally and the lady that cleaned the room sorry can t remember her name Slight mix up with the room as someone was in it Mistake cleared up quickly and new room allocated with no fuss 
199117,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Customer service was the best which me and friends really liked about It was just 5 10 mins walk to Shard where we had a dinner and the view was amazing from our room 
199118,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Finding ourselves locked out of the hotel when we returned from an evening out It took around 10 mins to get in as there was nobody in the lobby Whilst security is obviously important there is no circumstances where it is acceptable to leave guests waiting in the street late at night , Excellent breakfast comfortable rooms
199119,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Informing the hotel that it was my birthday they welcomed us with an upgrade of room there were balloons card and sprinkles on our bed and also cakes were sent to our room A lovely thoughtful surprise 
199120,Hilton London Tower Bridge, It s sort of half a Hilton with the restaurant and bar area seemingly outsourced They re still good but as a result their main target seems to be drawing in non guests There is often overly loud club style music audible in the entire public area leaving little relaxation space , Breakfast at Jamie s Italian was very good Wi Fi was reliable rooms comfortable Well presented hotel 
199121,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I was charged 50 safety deposit without my knowledge the staff did not mention this at check in or check out which I think is really unprofessional I had to call them to find out what it was for The breakfast was good with a varied choice but because it was a buffet some of it was cold would be fine of course but for what you are paying you would expect a higher standard Basically you stay at this hotel for the amazing location and nothing else Be warned though they are currently constructing a new part of London Bridge station which is opposite the hotel they work at weekends and through the night and it s noisy no Sunday lie in that is for sure Try and request a room away from the street if you can ,No Positive
199122,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I asked him to give my a good view but they don t and the wi if is very bad and I told the front desk about this issue, Location comfort clean staff
199123,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Not much I can think about , The bed was exceptionally comfy as per usual at Hilton The service from staff at the bar was fantastic with a great Italian accent to go with it 
199124,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No power points on the bedhead wall which I need for medical reasons I needed to borrow an extension lead which then ran across the access to the bathroom A trip hazard at night particularly, Great Location comfortable and helpful friendly staff 
199125,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Car park was hard to find long way from hotel, The new rooms were excellent Very friendly pleasant helpful staff Great Guy on the bar from Malaga Spain makes great cocktails 
199126,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Would have liked to stay longer but couldn t afford it , Executive lounge Views from the roof terrace Helpfulness of the staff Comfy bed large room and bathroom 
199127,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Bed wasn t as good as other Hilton hotels only 2 pillows , Nice clean hotel Staff all extremely pleasant helpful Good location directly opposite The Shard 
199128,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I was charged 15 pounds extra over the rate from booking just before I arrived and no one from the staff knows why, I upgraded to executive room with access to executive lounge Was good with snacks and coffee and quiet place The hotel is clean and safe and the area is very nice 
199129,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, when we arrived our room stank of sewage reception sent a cleaner up with an airfreshener obviously as I was paying 350 for 2 nights that is not on and a new room was found
199130,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Paid extra for vip room access Was underwhelming to be honest Lots of people crammed in a small room with heating too high Would have preferred using the spacious bar downstairs which looked far more luxurious , Room was very nice and looked recently built Bathroom was a decent size And all fixtures and fittings were nice quality 
199131,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The breakfast was not the best to be honest Also only one bath roab in the room , Location was great also Jamie s Italian which is located inside the hotel was superb 
199132,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The in house catering is provided by Jamie Oliver s enterprise Suggest you book for a weekend evening meal as many non residents eat there This was not mentioned to u s so we had to wait about an hour for a table for 2 on Saturday For what you get the food is a bit expensive but you are paying for the name and London location , Location was ideal 5 minute walk from London Bridge Railway Underground stations Close to the Shard London Bridge HMS Belfast St Pauls and much much more All staff very friendly and helpful 
199133,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Ice machine in hallway did not work Breakfast was nice but served on cold plates , Freshly re furbished room Comfy bed and plenty of space Friendly staff and very clean
199134,Hilton London Tower Bridge, There was a lot of noise in the night outside groups of people singing etc at 1 30am 2 30am which woke me a few times Not really your fault windows were double glazed but spoilt the experience , The staff were very friendly and helpful 
199135,Hilton London Tower Bridge, there was drilling intermittently during the day Friday and drilling again at 9 30am saturday No fridge for my husbands medication had to request use of locked cooler fridge which Manager did oblige He did offer to bring a fridge to the room but why not have a fridge in the room , Room very clean and comfortable staff helpful good location
199136,Hilton London Tower Bridge, A lot of noise from building new station even at 2am As a result of this rebuilding taxi could get no nearer than a 5 minute walk to hotel and after paying 25 from Paddington was annoying, Good breakfast in Jamies Room as good as expected as it was the Hilton 
199137,Hilton London Tower Bridge, As soon as we got in the room there was a awful high pitched noise coming from the bathroom I called down to reception straight away They sent someone up who told me it was probably just air in the pipe and if it happens again just run the taps for a bit not really the response I expected from a premium chain of hotels It did happen Again and again It was ear piercing and it went on through the night I didn t want to ring down to reception again as I didn t feel I was being taken seriously All in all a very disappointing stay , Lovely hotel in a great location Easily accessible by tube Nice bar and one of the best breakfasts i have ever had 
199138,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Rude staff There was a mouse running around freely in the lounge restaurant area Air con heating far too loud I asked for a taxi to get to my meeting After 15 minutes realised she hadn t even called it ,No Positive
199139,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The location was ideal only a few minutes from London Bridge Station Few minutes walk took us to the river taxi which we used to take us to the 02 ideal for us Husband unable to walk far 
199140,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The air con broke all weekend and jamie s restaurant was really unbearable to the point I was too hot to eat Think there could have been notice to customers when they booked or complimentary drink, Bed was extremely comfy free water is fab for me as having had radiotherapy I have no saliva glands so I need water with me at all times 
199141,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing although would have like robes so easier for shower , We had a lovely stay the staff were fantastic and made us feel so welcome a clean and lovely hotel
199142,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast could have a larger variety, Very clean amazingly helpful staff and great location only 5mins walking distance from the London Bridge tube station 
199143,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Two Ruba bar service was terrible Jamies Italian restaurant breakfast was all cold on Sunday it was only 9 30 am no croissants left The service was terrible For me the let down was how management did not have a clue to run a hotel , The check in person upgraded our room because it was our 22 nd wedding Anniversary 
199144,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The lighting in the room wasn t always enough the incidental lighting was fine however the master switch was complicated At times I needed full lighting Also switching the air con and adjusting the heating was nigh on impossible , I liked the way housekeeping tidied generally all the staff were smiley helpful and efficient 
199145,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Disappointed with shower cubical in room it tended to leek a lot room 826 Thankfully had plenty of towels Dare say it will be sorted by maintance team, Break fast is in Jamie s attached to the hotel Could to with 2 coffee machines Other then that the breakfast was very good

199148,Hilton London Tower Bridge, maintenance in room next door noise all day when just come from a long haul flight , the breakfast was burnt and the staff were poor asking for ketchup and being told its over there 
199149,Hilton London Tower Bridge, UHT milk in rooms Hotels everywhere please can we have real milk , It was great to be based in a less busy location as it was the weekend and great to walk along the river 
199150,Hilton London Tower Bridge, First experience at a Hilton Hotel I booked it thinking it would be a a step up over premiere inn and also perhaps a nice romantic place to stay It wasn t No attention to detail TV features for movies were slow and occasionally crashed the TV itself was pretty old with a terrible picture We ordered room service at 21 45 It was promised 20 30 minutes later but turned up passed 23 00 and stone cold Shower leaked everywhere Breakfast was a rush and pretty manic The bar at the hotel was pricey but the cocktails were good We had a voucher for 10 off which was met with a feeling of hostility as the bar manager went of his way to approach us to query it which was surprising especially as it only saved us 5 quid Lastly the noise every morning at around 7 there was some high pitch repetitive squeal which came from within the hotel , Location Great cocktails 
199151,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We came to breakfast at 10 00 on a Sunday it took 26 minutes to get an order for an omelette gave up in the end The food was good though just couldn t get what I wanted , Great reception service bar service and most people interactions were good the location is excellent for London city activity 
199152,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing , Bed was extremely comfortable Staff very professional and polite We were upgraded upon check in and our room was beautiful One night we ordered room service at 10 30pm it was the best room service we have ever had food was excellent and still very hot 
199153,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The hotel website stated it was a 5 minute walk away from the nearest train station but it was closer to a 20 minute walk which we completed with two large suitcases across the London Bridge Once we got to the hotel we found out it was under construction We were upgraded to a different room only to be surprised by another hotel guest that had been given the same room as us , Staff was friendly and after several uncomfortable circumstances was accommodating to try and make our stay better 
199154,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Ordered food and asked for no salad in the burger and came with all salad had no hot water for the first night had work being done on the rooms waking us up from 7 and continued till 5 in the evening ordered breakfast and it was also wrong was told there was a charge to order to the room which I found bizarre also when we arrived we had to pay 50 a night to secure the room and if any damages where done this wasn t stated when I order over all the experience wasn t great it was my partners birthday and I felt like it was totally ruined,No Positive
199155,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Free WiFi only for 1hr, Quick check in and out Staff very helpful with map and what was nearrested by Told us what underground line we needed to use to get to where we were going Was only 3 minutes from the station Plenty of places near by to visit easily on foot 
199156,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The shower was very tilted to one side so was very difficult to have a relaxing shower and also the duvet was very thin for winter, Breakfast was great wonderful location and brilliant value for money
199157,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Woken up very early with cleaners outside and door banging maybe they should have buffers on the doors this went on for at least 20 minutes , Good location for our stay 
199158,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Taking 100 pound out of my account just in case we used the mini bar but it will take 5 working days to go back in never experience this in all my travels also when asked to book a cab for the next morning the concierge told us it would be 30 to London Liverpool Street when we told them that we will pay the taxi driver ourselves so any way the taxi dropped us off to the station he charged us 10 were in the name of God did the 30 come from, very comfortable relaxed atmosphere
199159,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Radiator in bathroom essential that s if you want dry towels in the morning for a shower Not enough shower gel for two people staying overnight also not enough milk or biscuits on hospitality tray One tiny biscuit each Had more at a small bed and breakfast, Location was great 
199160,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Check I appalling No record of booking via booking com even though I clearly had confirmation forms Took hours to get rooms, Rooms lovely Breakfast excellent Staff friendly and helpful
199161,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Complimentary water tasted terrible I d suspect tap filled and left to sit Husband had severe upset stomach which we can only assume was down to this , I loved the location convenient comfortable bar and amazing breakfast 
199162,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The only thing I did not like was the breakfast service which was managed by an adjoining restaurant and was self service and hectic Not at all like my previous experiences of breakfast at Hilton Hotels which is normally relaxed organised and enjoyable 
199163,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I ordered 2 breakfasts to my room we was looking forward to the breakfasts after a great night out I was told 20mins it finally came 40mins and everything was cold and didn t looked cooked and the toast wasn t toasted and it look like stale bread u wouldn t give it the birds The manger was nice and offered two more but I didn t trust the person cooking the breakfast the manger took the breakfast off the price I think but we left the hotel hungry very disappointed and Also when I arrived to room the battery in my TV remote had gone I phoned down to the desk but didn t come to the room so I had to go down myself to get some I didn t like that after they said someone will come to the room, The bed and room was very good
199164,Hilton London Tower Bridge, There is a strange smell in the room and bathroom we think it s the water but not 100 sure The smell was pretty strong though , Location and Breakfast
199165,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing about the hotel staff only about one of the staff in the hotel restaurant Jamie s kitchen who left us standing awkwardly at the entrance then gave a us a bit of attitude when we asked for a table , The room was comfortable and the hotel was beautiful 
199166,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Shower wet room water didn t drain away quick enough so left with a very wet bathroom Also problem with booking booked for 5 3 children and 2 adults was given 1 room assumed a family room On arrival was told they don t have any rooms for 5 people So was given another room next door for no extra cost This was slightly awkward unsure how the error occurred , Location
199167,Hilton London Tower Bridge, A little surprising especially given the price tag that WiFi cost extra and was a low quality Cellphone reception in the rooms was quite bad as well , Hilton was lovely The staff were exceptional and I was impressed with their service The rooms were beautiful and exceedingly well maintained 
199168,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Lounge stopped food and drinks at 9 not 10 as it says on all information One glass of wine One granmarnier and coke 33 50 in the bar far to expensive don t drink in the bar , Breakfast very nice 
199169,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Traffic diversions to the hotel is bad due to construction and uber or cab had difficult time to locate its entrance, Breakfast was good location was perfect
199170,Hilton London Tower Bridge, While we were there there was drilling noise during the daytime which was irritating The executive lounge was more like a Wacky Warehouse at times with infants running riot maybe an over 12s policy would make it feel more exclusive , Very good location Breakfast in the executive lounge was excellent as was the food served in the evening Staff were helpful Nice late check out time midday 
199171,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Heating system noisy Roadworks meant taxi more expensive due to diversions Drinks were ridiculously expensive and who thnks 20 each for a standard hotel breakfast is value Had to keep curtains shut since office workers opposite could see in v close , Comfy bed Staff v helpful when I needed freezer packs frozen for shop at Borough Market the next morning 
199172,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Twin beds could have been ready instead of the double Room heating was very high so had to request reception to turn it off as no room controls, Reception staff very friendly and efficient Hotel very clean and comfortable Great breakfast
199173,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The bed was hard and uncomfortable Very loud music was being played in the bar in the evening which made sitting in the lounge impossible Breakfast is served in Jamie s next door The queue for breakfast was slow moving and the service poor , Great location
199174,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The executive lounge for breakfast was disappointing Not much choice very limited items for full English i e Bacon beans scrambled eggs tomatoes A bit stingy Also an upset toddler didn t make it the most pleasant place to be we love children it s the parents who we blames , Location Staff Bed Bathroom
199175,Hilton London Tower Bridge, If we had stayed longer it would have been nice to have a swim or massage but it didn t have that available at this hotel But that s a very minor thing , Rooms were very comfortable clean well decorated 
199176,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room was decent but it wasn t worth 168 for one night I have stayed in hotels for less and their rooms offered more such as good speakers a more modern tv and a a sofa I expected more from The Hilton , The staff were very friendly and attentive and the breakfast was nice
199177,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I didn t like that there is no wifi in the rooms as you have to pay for it The hotel itself is expensive but when not busy you can get a bargain but it s not that often , The location is great The rooms are lovely The staff are friendly 
199178,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Wasn t very impressed with the cleanliness of the mini bar it was dirty so I complained before we went for a stroll when we got back there was a bottle of wine in the room with a note of apology the mini bar was still dirty so they sent 2 women up to clean it after I d complained a second time, What a beautiful bathroom it was the bed was nice and firm very cumfy Tower Bridge was just behind the hotel with pubs and restaurants close by
199179,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The whole area was closed off when we arrived and it took us 7 hours to get to the hotel even though we were 5 minutes away Diverted traffic signs did not take us to the hotel after we followed every single one,No Positive
199180,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Bar prices very high even for London Although the food at Jamie s was good we felt the restaurant was understaffed We had quite a wait for tea and coffee both mornings and tables were left uncleared More staff on duty would resolve this Shower is over the bath which means space is a bit restricted Minor point we thought hotel was a bit stingy with the toiletries left in the bathroom as there was only enough for one person although it was a double room , Location is excellent just a few minutes from London Bridge Station Borough Market Tower Bridge and Southbank Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby Friendly helpful staff especially Angelica and Mustafa on reception Hotel breakfast is in Jamie s which is part of the hotel Choice and quality of food was very good 
199181,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Had to pay 100 when I checked in for extras Thought it would be put straight back onto card when I checked out but wasn t , Executive lounge was amazing Room was comfortable good size Staff very friendly and helpful

199188,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room I was given 813 had a broken window could not close properly When we arrived in the late evening of the 15 11 2016 the Night Manager reassured us that it will be fixed the following day The following day we left to town and we specifically mentioned at the desk that we were leaving and that they can do their repair They did nothing on that day and neither on the following Net result we spent 3 loud and rather cold nights wind howling through the window crack AC working overtime to keep up You could call it romantic but it was not what we were after Very disappointing , All good except 
199189,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Our stay this time cost twice as much for the same amount of days as it did for our stay in August There was a funny smell in the bathroom which I think came from the sink outflow being unclean The carpet needed cleaning Our TV did not work and it took 2 phone calls to get it fixed , the room and bed were nice
199190,Hilton London Tower Bridge, This hotel is run by accountants Not enough managers and too many untrained teenage staff The room lights are such a low wattage you can t see Length of time taking to be served is very long Bar prices are very high for this standard of hotel and service Had to queue for breakfast coffee at a leaky machine weak tea is served from a flask Food at the breakfast buffet was cold even as it arrived from the kitchen Pillows were low quality There was a fire drill at just after 7 am I don t mind fire drills these are essential but not all customers left their rooms and we just walked to the lobby and straight back up If you don t do a fire drill properly you are just disturbing your customers for no reason , Very Clean Modern Superb Location Friendly staff Architecture and internal decor very high quality

199198,Hilton London Tower Bridge, It is annoying that they offer express check out and say that they will send the invoice by email but do not do It is now 5 days since I checked out and I have not yet received the invoice ,No Positive
199199,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I think wifi should come free when booking an executive room , Staff were very attentive professional and always there when needed I had the best garlic bread from Jamies and the cocktails at hilton are to die for unlike at Jamies which was pretty poor 
199200,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were going to London to celebrate my wife s 50th birthday I booked this 9 months beforehand asking for a nice view A month before I phoned the hotel to confirm that everything was still ok I asked the person on the phone for a nice view When we arrived though we had a nice room but not a good view at all when I asked the receptionist for a room with a better view I was told that there wasn t any left , The whole of the hotel was fantastic All the staff were extremely polite and professional Breakfast was amazing Probably the best I ve had in any hotel 
199201,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No USB socket so I couldn t charge my phone Bar has loud music so had to go elsewhere for a drink with friends Should have had breakfast in my room the surroundings were nicer than Jamie s Italian, Large quiet comfortable room with a very comfortable bed and a large bathroom

199203,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast was poor no one serving at cooking area visiting electrical tradesman had to go through the back to get someone when chef arrived he pointed for me to go to the other counter but I said there are no eggs or hash browns he then brought out a tray of cooked eggs from the back that unfortunately were completely cold Not a good experience , Reception staff very helpful the room was clean and of good dimensions 
199204,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I enjoyed my stay but I was not very happy due to poor lighting and could barely do my make up and having to use the bathroom mirror Also paying so much I would of expected a better view even though I was staying there for a night Not having a hair dyer in the room surely rooms should have been checked before hand to ensure everything was there for customer Also when asking a member of staff where the room was he had to clue , Overall it was a excellent hotel very clean and very comfortable bed 
199205,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The towels were rough and grey The lighting was poor to the point of not being able to read in bed , The location is excellent The room and bathroom were spacious 
199206,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast, There were no croissants Breakfast was dreadful The worse I ve had in a hotel I don t think Jamie Oliver would have brought his family there Like a bun fight trying to get everything together M S has fresher fruit 
199207,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The shower bath filler didn t operated correctly not allowing the bath to fill but was very happy with the shower performance , Very nice room compared to similar in the area 
199208,Hilton London Tower Bridge, A room further away from the gym as woken twice by the noise of weights crashing together , Very friendly staff easy to navigate around the hotel Nice room and en suite 
199209,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I didn t like being asked to provide a 100 security deposit which was taken straight off my card I was told that this is the hotel s policy and that the deposit would be refunded straight back onto the card I have a paper print out from the hotel but not one from the card machine for either the deposit or the refund when I asked I was told again that this is the hotel s policy why shouldn t a customer be given a card receipt , Really nice comfortable room very clean and nice pillows Great location literally 3 minutes walk from the tube station 
199210,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Wanted lowest room partner could not travel in lift had to climb 6 flights of stairs the room was decorated lovely did not want to trouble anyone , Jamies restaurant music in the bar location 
199211,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Light switch in the room was a little weird There was a master switch so took about 30 attempts to work out how to turn on off lights, Location Clean
199212,Hilton London Tower Bridge, At the moment with the closure of Tower Bridge and the building works at London Bridge station there are delays with traffic Fortunately there is a pleasant walk from the hotel along the river to London Bridge where traffic is moving a little better Also the music if you could call it music in the bar was so loud we had to shout to each other and the bar manager did not reduce the volume on request , Clean comfortable rooms Excellent breakfast in Jamie s Italian Helpful friendly staff 
199213,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Check out a bit slow only 1 on duty OK once another 2 appeared Dining room on Saturday night was almost unbearably noisy Outside of building rather uninspiring , Arrived early welcomed and checked in without a problem Interior design and decoration Comfort of beds 
199214,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Room not ready on arrival although we were there at 4and room said available from 3pm Daughter had arranged wine in the room on arrival a sit was her fathers 60th birthday nothing in the room We had requested a high floor quiet with a view room was next to train station no view So what is the point of a request if no one reads the request Food taken from the table before we had finished eating This seems endless but that is how it was although some of the staff helpful and friendly , Comfortable room 
199215,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Jamies restaurant we booked table for 8pm but when was seated they had runnout of all specials so had to go somewhere else , Everyone was friendly helpful especially young man on saturday eve at bar on ground floor he was excellent thank you
199216,Hilton London Tower Bridge, There was a lack of information when we checked in eg how to get to our room Slippers and robe were not in our room Not a major thing but little touches make all the difference , Jamie s restaurant being at the hotel was convenient for an evening meal and breakfast 
199217,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The reservation staff member who checked us in was very pleasant but did not inform me that he had tried to take a deposit from the bank card on the hotel s system That card declined Had he told me first that he was going to take payment I would have been able to transfer funds on my phone instead I was a little embarrassed and had to ask why he didn t inform me first before taking funds Apart from this the stay was great , The room was immaculate lovely bathroom breakfast and restaurant was great 
199218,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Bed was hard and creaky Air conditioning was noisy Breakfast was very disappointing No cereals and food was only warm and tea stewed , Modern and quite bright
199219,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I requested a late check out And we had no idea that we had this until after we checked out , The staff were friendly and our rooms were really nice Hotel in a great location easy to get about should you need to The hotel sent up a complimentary birthday desert cake tray and gave me and one of my guest breakfast free as a birthday treat Such a nice thing to do Myself and friends are planning to stay at the Hilton again Would also recommend paying for the VIP area as the roof top area is beautiful Plus you also get the VIP perks 
199220,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Absolutely nothing everything was perfect , Room was spacious and had everything we needed location was perfect for our visit to the Aqua Shard Restaurant 
199221,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were in a triple room but the third bed was very small More like a child s bed and there were no extra pillows for that, Loved the size of the room Very spacious for central London and a good price 
199222,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The view from our bedroom even though an executive room was poor just overlooking an adjoining building My wife had requested a river view , The hotel is situated in our favourite part of London near London Bridge and is close to the underground giving great access to all the main attractions of London The rooms are very spacious very modern and very clean The beds are very comfortable and you get a great nights sleep We stayed in an executive bedroom and therefore had free access to the executive lounge where my wife and I enjoyed a couple of drinks after dinner on the terrace overlooking the Shard A very nice way to finish off my birthday with my wife 
199223,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The only complaint I have is that the beds were rather uncomfortable, The location was great the hotel was modern and clean and the rooms were a nice size The welcome we received was very lovely too 
199224,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing it s all good here, It s very close to London Bridge station and burrow market which is why we like the area It is also close to the river we always walk along right down to Westminster Bridge At the top of the road you can get a bus to Liverpool Street where we meet friends It is a very good hotel
199225,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I asked for there to be a little something special in the room as it was a surprise for my partners 30th Was willing to pay too but there was nothing , Loved the veiw of the shard from our room
199226,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were not hPpy with the breakfast felt it was very noisy and not a very high standard however we had dinner night before in Jamie s and it was pleasant,No Positive
199227,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Got a pizza from room service was a big dissapointment Took ages to get anyone to answer the phones ie room service front desk, The breakfast was spot on The room and bed were perfect The staff were helpful
199228,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Upon arrival the reception staff were not very friendly and abrupt However further to this other reception were friendly and helpful On attending the late night bar room tabs only it was quite evident that some staff wanted to go home I work in the the catering industry and this is not something that you want displayed to the customers , The room was lovely and the location was fantastic for what we required We enjoyed the cocktails 
199229,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I did feel at breakfast was extremely expensive you only got offered likewarm coffee out of a flask type pourer and the cooked food was lukewarm also, The staff were helpful and courteous Our room was very nice

199231,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The room was exquisite it was quiet and stylish the staff went out of their way to help Lovely bar and facilities and perfect location for the business or tourist traveller Claudia and Anne on reception were particularly helpful Great experience 
199232,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Loud and horrible music in the bar for much of our stay Lovely bar if it had not ben for the terrible music What s the point Most of the guests are middle aged people who prefer quiet surroundings , The best hotel we have stayed at in London Very nice and comfortable rooms professional staff Great location with many restaurants and cafes nearby Easy to get around since a tube station is nearby 
199233,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Cigarette smell in the room Why is this possible You should prosecute the previous occupant of the room Noisy music in the lounge at 10 pm so peaceful until then , Comfortable bed and pillows Very helpful staff as we lost an item in the hotel Super terrace on 9th floor overlooking the Shard 
199234,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Staff were both efficient and personable Facilities in the room satisfied our needs and everywhere was clean and well maintained A spacious hotel including the lifts Great location near London Bridge Station for access to all areas though many places within easy walking distance Would definitely stay there again 
199235,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I didn t like that there was no wifi at all in room I also didn t like the idea that you had to pay if you wanted the WiFi in your room , It s location is very good
199236,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Would have preferred an in house restaurant for breakfast , Bright airy room comfy bed great to have the option of a bath or shower Good views of the Shard 
199237,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The staff were super disorganised We booked five months ago but the room was unprepared even at the 3pm check in time We had to ask for extra cups toiletries etc their triple room consisted of a double bed and a camp bed which is poor for the price paid , The room was quiet great buffet breakfast in Jamie s Italian at the hotel Great location close to the river and London Bridge tube
199238,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The price of the mini bar and having to go back home, The location was great for tower bridge and some local Restraunts and breakfast was great an amazing selection in jamies Italian restraunt and also good to walk around see some nice views and a good 5hr walk can take you round sights like Big Ben London eye and Buckingham palace and back to hotel Restraunts visited for dinner was azzurro Italian amazing food fast service and great value for money and about 5 10min walk from hotel and also went to the shad Indian again amazing food slightly more exspencive but a great meal and a 2min walk across from hotel and a tesco and local shop are also near
199239,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The bedroom wasn t very well finished for a Hilton plaster dust green paint on bathroom tiles shower leak some wires visible tiles badly cut Wifi was not that good already 60min free better than nothing but every 2 min it stopped Lack of details not expected for a Hilton, Staff breakfast and location were very good
199240,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Our room wasn t ready till 4 30 pm This was really unacceptable No one seemed to understand why I was annoyed by this I was told it was due to the previous guests having a late checkout , This property has a fantastic location and I must be honest and say that we got an amazing B B rate The room was good Breakfast in Jamie s Italian was good too We liked the bar and the fantastic host Sophia who was very kind to us 
199241,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The staff did their job but weren t too friendly apart from the house keeping staff who were always said good morning afternoon , Rooms were very spacious and had excellent facilities 
199242,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Our room ain t ready but we were offered a free drink at the bar whilst we waited , Good sized room modern nice roof terrace fab breakfast good value for money 
199243,Hilton London Tower Bridge, the bathroom smells very bad and I asked to swap a room and obviously they did not allow they only clean the bathroom again but didn t solve the problem , good location and new hotel
199244,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The water in the bathroom sink was tepid , lovely room 506 very pleasant staff Jamies Restaurant was good but the service was very slow Would have no hesitation in using this hotel again 
199245,Hilton London Tower Bridge, It was amazing , What did we like Everything We had an amazing time and the staff and food was lovely Thank you we shall be back to stay 
199246,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Chap on reception not incredibly helpful don t think it was worth the 325 and we had a 10am wake up call from house keeping on a Sunday , Good location Close to tower bridge and the tube 
199247,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Checked in at 01 30 and only my name was correct on the check in form I then asked for a phone charger as my phone was dead They don t supply them and no staff would lend me theirs Lastly the room service breakfast card on the door still had the previous guests choices filled in I will stay at the Shard next time , The room was a nice size with a well equipped spacious en suite
199248,Hilton London Tower Bridge, N A, Staff were all outstanding Very attentive and helpful nothing was too much trouble Let a bag at reception and by the time I realised they were already bringing it up to my room Excellent service all round Well Done Hilton 
199249,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Reception staff seemed unclear about taking a 50 deposit which has yet to be refunded This is taken against any mini bar orders that may be used and not paid for which is fine The next morning I tried to pay a bar tab that I had from the previous evening but I was told this would come off the already paid 50 and the rest refunded Am still waiting for this to happen , This is a lovely hotel in a great location for the South Bank Tower of London and Butler s Wharf The facilities were excellent and it was a very comfortable stay 
199250,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room was too small the in house service poor and the breakfast almost unpalatable , The location The help I got from j Juljia on reservations desk was unsurpassable and went far beyond the norm 
199251,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Poor internet access I managed to access with difficulty but my wife couldn t access at all Should be free to all too , Hilton breakfast are usually excellent and yours were no exception
199252,Hilton London Tower Bridge, For such a nice hotel and excellent location there were a couple of downsides The toilet roll was the cheapest I ve ever come across and the noise at 8am every morning was a little frustrating , Both rooms we had as a family were clean and comfortable and staff were very friendly The perfect location 
199253,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Use of Jamie Oliver restaurant for breakfast place wasn t fully to high a standard for me Food ok and selection ok Clearing up and noise levels around you whilst eating was a nightmare some of the stations for staff were not clean, Location fantastic Room bed very comfortable bathroom good to use and toiletries ok Bar area lovely to sit in great selection of cocktails and snacks
199254,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The executive lounge was very disappointing and not worth the extra cost The way you get in feels like you re going through a maintenance door to get on to the roof and the outdoor terrace area was just like a smoking area there are a few tall tables up there but hardly any chairs and it s very small, Breakfast in Jamie s Italian is a must 
199255,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room we had was right by the elevator so we were woken both mornings by loud guests waiting for the lift , The location was amazing and breakfast at Jamie s was extremely yummy Room was very comfortable and clean and staff were great and had some birthday balloons and cake ready for us in the room 
199256,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Waiting to collect our bags from the Concierge was a little slow , Masses of breakfast beautifully produced Very welcoming staff Generously sized room and a very convenient location 
199257,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Was put into a double room rather that a twin but staff could not have been more helpful in making a very swift change to the beds and giving us drinks while we waited , Bed was so comfy and the room was lovely and cool 
199258,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Called and asked someone how to change the to volume down in the bathroom and he didn t know Also saw a mouse scurrying around in the bar in the evening Shower pressure also poor , Liked the bed and the size of the room bar and reception all nice too
199259,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The amneties was for one person despite making a reservation for two people Being 6ft and big in size the shampoo soap and body gel wasnt enough for me to take even a single shower I called the frontdesk but no one picked up , Bed was excellent along with the location and the free breakfast offered 
199260,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Iron was leaking and hairdryer was on its last legs The room was comfortable but wasn t no better than a a standard room in another hotel for the price, location was perfect and staff very friendly
199261,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Night 1 Very noisy because of connecting door Night 2 Noisy because of air conditioning coming on and off all night need simpler air con controls, Staff tried their best to fix it but still kept coming on and off Being next to Jamies Location close to so much and to my course venue
199262,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were given the option of a larger room with walk in shower or a smaller room with a bath tub Not needing a bath tub we opted for the former but the staff didn t explain this was a room for people with mobility problems The room and bathroom would have been excellent for someone in a wheelchair but less so for people who aren t in a wheelchair Better communication from staff would have been appreciated , Large room and excellent location right next to the Thames Close to good places to grab food and public transport 
199263,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Our room didn t came with a small window so room was a biy dark , New and fresh modern rooms good sized too Great breakfast at Jamie s Italian 
199264,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Tub shower uncomfortable and dangerously slippery Pity since there s plenty of room to install s separate walkin shower Wifi authentication process not as simplified as could be Breakfast buffet hot items were too oily , Good Location and friendly and efficient staff at front desk 
199265,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Room spacious and clean plenty of wardrobe space bathroom well equipped Staff were without exception helpful and courteous Location close to London Bridge station and underground the Shard the Tower Thames Walk restaurants Hays Galleria with its shops mean this hotel is hard to beat 
199266,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, I have recently returned from a 2 night stay at The Hilton Hotel London Tower Bridge The hotel location is great a short walk from the Tower Bridge there was lot s going on around and we enjoyed a nice stroll down to the river side in the evening There is a great choice of restaurants close by The hotel was very clean with a nice modern feel the rooms are very comfy and we got a good nights sleep Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble We paid extra and had breakfast I m glad we did and it was well worth the money there was lot s of choice everything was freshly prepared and we were able to sit outside due to the nice weather I would definitely stay here again 
199267,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Cold shower in morning not pleasant Hairdryer didn t work but did get it changed Towels were tatty and fraying The screen on the bath was not fixed properly and was a safety issue Price of water 2 small bottle 158 for 1 night expensive and money taken from my card immediately when the booking said it would be done on arrival Also I was under the impression I had booked the Double Tree at Tower Hill which is where I had been before so I was very disappointed when I arrived there to find I was not booked in Even though I d paid The confusion was explained by the consierge and my partner and I had to walk all the way to the Tower Bridge hotel site which in my opinion having now stayed at both is the poor relation both in location and amenities Last time I was also given a VIP card on arrival for the executive lounge This time I was told it would be 40 extra each per day Obviously I was very disappointed with the lack of customer care , breakfast included was very good in Jamie s Staff were generally helpful
199268,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Bar service could have been a bit faster , Staff revived my Hilton honors membership and we got a room on honors floor Excellent Breakfast at jamies Italian was superb 
199269,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Earl Grey tea bags not in room and when we asked for these and some fresh milk we did not receive either as the housekeeper couldn t find any earl grey tea bags she didn t mention anything about the fresh milk , The room was comfortable nice to have a bath and a shower 
199270,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing , Right in the centre of loads of big tourist attractions Tower bridge HMS Belfast The Shard Tower of London etc etc Bars restaurants Rooms clean and modern Comfy beds Huge choice of breakfast 
199271,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The breakfast at Jamie s restaurant was very poor The food was ok but the service was shambolic on both days we stayed we had to track down our own cutlery cups and coffee tea Which was horrible anyway We complained about this to the hotel who told us it was subcontracted to Jamie s and there was nothing they could do,No Positive
199272,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Phone signal in the room was poor at times 4G 3G etc but very minor flaw on a great weekend , Loved how friendly the staff were they couldn t do enough for us The location was perfect beautiful and the surrounding area was very friendly and accessible via the tube Jamie s Italian underneath joined to the hotel was gorgeous 
199273,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Previous occupants baby food was still in the fridge so mini bar is not checked properly We also phoned before our stay to request a view of the Shard but this request was not notes and we got a view of the EY office instead, location staff decor

199289,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing , Fantastic location and so accessible from London Bridge Station Very short walk to the Borough Market Tower Bridge St Kathirines Dock and a lovely oat ride takes just a few minutes on the water to the Globe or a bit further to the Southbank We were with friends for a birthday surprise Philip at reception ensured that a beautiful plate of chocolate goodies awaited us in our room Little touches like this merely serve to emphasise what a great level of care we had from all the staff
199290,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Cost a bit more than I thought it was worth only really used it to sleep for a job interview the next day so didn t really get to see rest of hotel , Location was where we needed to be didn t really use the facilities but could see it had what we would want 
199291,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Terrible problems checking out took money from 2 Cm7 1atof my bank accounts cut me off two times when needed to speak to manager promised exec lounge would be open till 10 but it was closed at 2115 I don t ferl my concerns regarding the money issue was taken very seriously it also happened to one of my other friends we were both told we would have email confirmation but neither of us received one i feel overall disappointed with the reception staff and manager dealing with situation, concierge very helpful rooms very clean and decorated nicely and comfortable

199294,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We checked in at 4pm and the only available room was a disabled access room We could have waited for a regular room but had time constraints as we were meeting friends so had to accept the available option The room itself was fine but the shower absolutely soaked the entire bathroom no matter how accurately you placed the curtains making it unusable really for anything other than another shower , Service
199295,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I left my house keys in the room safe on the 24 04 16 and despite numerous e mails which have not been replied to several phone calls and three items returned forms I have not been returned my keys the staff have been rude in not relying to my e mails,No Positive

199298,Hilton London Tower Bridge, having a main restaurant that serves the breakfast lunch dinner as it was really strange to see a Hilton Hotel without a main restaurant to provide this the alternative Italian restaurant which is not related to the Hilton management had a poor service low quality breakfast with no refill of consumed items, the location
199299,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast was disappointing whilst the food was tasty and varied we were seated only for the table to be taken by another couple whilst we were getting our food Not sure how this came about but it led to an embarrassing situation which with better management could have been avoided The staff failed to help and the breakfast experience certainly didn t seem like value for money Definitely put me off returning In addition we wanted to eat our lunch outside because it was a beautiful day and the promotion pictures suggested that this would be a lovely thing to do but staff told us they were only serving lunch inside so we went elsewhere Couldn t help feeling that the great potential of this hotel isn t being fully realised , The location is excellent with nearby attractions and speedy links to all parts of London The reception staff who were personable and efficient added a nice sense of style to the hotel 
199300,Hilton London Tower Bridge, the shower was a disaster we flooded the bathroom everyday one of your managers should take a shower in this room and see how impossible it is to manage , Staff were very well trained and took the job of hospitality seriously very impressed 
199301,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Bar prices expensive and mini bar very expensive but it is a hotel in London so not surprised , Beds comfy staff lovely food amazing room spacious quiet spotless 
199302,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The breakfast at Jamie s was very average The staff in Jamie s weren t very professional or interested at all in the customers We had to ask for cutlery and milk for our drinks We weren t told where anything was and most of the food was just leftover scraps Only good part of the breakfast was unlimited orange juice Although the 24hour room service from Jamie s was brilliant So perhaps just the morning staff aren t too good , The hotel was beautiful the room was great very clean amazing view had air con etc there was a bath tub the bed was extremely comfy but very hard good for a bad back Great 24hour room service from Jamie s Will definitely go back just not for breakfast 
199303,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The View from our room, Location was great good value for money and friendly staff Concierge service also let us keep bags at hotel on the day we booked out allowing us to travel around London
199304,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The WiFi was horrible But I was assured by the receptionist that the hotel is going to be equipped with a faster and better Internet connection in the near future I also had no cell reception in the room Also I had to call 3 times and wait for at least an hour before I was sent some extra shower gel , The room was nice clean and comfortable 
199305,Hilton London Tower Bridge, There was no dressing gown in the room which is essential The bed was a little bit too firm but ok There was no complimentary water for night time , The location was excellent and the room was quiet which is always a bonus 
199306,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The mattress was very uncomfortable and gave both me and my husband sore backs For a deluxe room it was a standard double room size I was expecting it to be bigger Also I made a note on my booking for a bday cake for my husbands bday and I also called weeks in advance asking them to have it read at point of arrival 2 3pm and they didn t have this ready So we popped out and they did eventually get it for me because I care reception and complained , The view as right opp the shard The cleanliness of room The staff were very polite 
199307,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast could have been better hot food was bit cold Had to ask for hot coffee tea be nice if someone kept an eye and checked on guests Although plenty of choice , Great location very clean fresh and our room had just under gone a revamp so nice new fresh smell

199311,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No negatives , The hotel did what we were looking for slight problem being that we stayed at the shard the night before so difficult to keep that standard up Breakfast was very good and less than half the price of the shard for same food 
199312,Hilton London Tower Bridge, One of the reception staff aleksha not quite sure on the name spelling nevertheless she was on duty on April 28 2016 at 22 20 Upon arrival I approached her and Informed her that I want to book a room for the night Lifting her head she said we are fully booked and head down back on what she was doing scrutinising some papers Well that s fine no harm done only if she was not lying We are not stupid to pay for a taxi and head to the hotel if booking com did not show 4 rooms available as my phone s battery is so low we chose to book direct When she said we are fully booked I sat on the couch near the reception area and booked online so we got the room The staff who assisted me offered a free wine and bottled water Probably as a compliance on the hotels protocol if you are not satisfied with your stay let us know and we ll make it right thank you for doing that but such gesture can not cover a staff negative attitude as it comes within If you are busy on other things you should stay on a room where you are not visible to guests or at least put a note like proceed to next till maybe Rather than giving a negative vibe on the hotels reception area When I start talking about her attitude one of the male receptionist tried to cover her by saying head office sometimes forget to update the system really Another lie If your head office forget to update your system booking com should not be showing 4 rooms available besides when I said I have a room booked the receptionist was not even worried that it s an overbooking so meaning you have 4 or maybe even 10 rooms empty I booked a double and she was happily asking me if I prefer twin than a double honestly I stayed to many hotels some negative staff behaviour just passed me along but this kind of attitude is 100 embodied with lie as all proof of her lying was proven , The location 
199313,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The reception staff weren t very knowledgeable about London tubes where places were etc , I stayed with my brother who was doing the London Marathon The complimentary breakfast was well received thank you very much it was a lovely treat

199321,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I paid for an executive room and although it had been very newly refurbished and was a nice room the decor it was the standard size room that i feel you would get at any other hotel and did not feel like an executive room and cost 250 per night Saying this the staff were so helpful smiley and pleasant that it did make it worth the money , The staff were absolutely fantastic They couldn t do enough for you and made our stay really special The executive lounge was being refurbished too so they used a couple of meeting rooms which did get a bit overcrowded but the free flowing drinks were great We celebrated my partners birthday and this was great because the staff made him feel really special and made lots of effort 
199322,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I always think breakfast should be included in these type of hotels for the price , Location is perfect Staff friendly and helpful Rooms are perfect Bed was comfy
199323,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The hammering from the renovation works in the hotel at 0930 in the morning Spoiled what was otherwise a really great stay , Excellent location and the check in experience was great with helpful friendly staff

199335,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The only grumble is no on site parking can t be helped with the location but offering the NCP parking facilities is a lot cheaper and closer to the hotel , The staff were so friendly and the hotel itself was simply amazing We stayed in an executive room so had access to the lounge again just made us feel extra special Top hotel we will definitely be staying again
199336,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Horrible hard beds Staff didn t speak English got breakfast order wrong 3 times Air con was ineffective Way too expensive for what it is , Location
199337,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The room was not very large but fair for 2 adults Cleaning not that careful there were some crumbs on the carpeting when we arrived and some stains in the bathroom nothing to really complain about although I would expect a 10 10 from a Hilton hotel, Great location very close to Tower Bridge and to the London Brdige tube station Staff was very helpful friendly and professional The room had an excellent view Breakfast was also great I could choose the Breakfast included room rate 
199338,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The third bed was a sofa the double bed was not even King the horrible pillows finally at bedtime was all bad and there was no availability in the hotel suite so one person had to sleep in the sofa really terrible and the price is not justified We will not return again to this hotel , The staff

199349,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We stayed New Year s Eve and were not told there was a private party being held so we were not able to use any of the ground floor facilities we were told to go to bar on first floor which were not serving either cocktails or coffee the toilets in ground floor were a disgrace after people had been sick and toilets were filthy The room was basic with a poor view and I specifically asked for good view and phoned and sent emails to request this the balcony on 9th floor closed st 10pm which would have been great to view The Shard and New Year s Eve fireworks , The food at Jamie Ilivers Restaurant was good the breakfast was great
199350,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were a party of 6 in London for a special occasion we all had deluxe rooms I am unsure what extra s we got for the additional expence Hence because we paid a little more for better accommodation this has impacted on the overall review There is room for improvement As a regular traveller UK International I cannot understand why large hotel chains in the UK do not provide free Wi Fi for everyone The pillows were very soft there was only 1 spare The info states dressing gowns and slippers are available we only had one of each in a twin room The shower was disappointing as the water pressure was not very powerful and the water did not get very hot Our water glasses were not washed and the coffee making facilities were not returned to the cupboard when the room was cleaned The maids knocked quite early circa 8am to see if the room could be made up We acknowledge that we should probably have put the do not disturb notice on the door this really could be organised so that rooms are identified as vacant once people having booked out Our TV did not work on our first night We reported a fault and someone came to look at this He was unable to rectify the problem and said he would come back with another cable and didn t We reported this again the next morning and this was fixed whilst we were out for the day All equipment should be checked when the room is prepared for the next guests Breakfast is available in Jamie s and is quite expensive We asked if there was a Weatherspoon s in the area and the staff did not know An internet search revealed there were 2 a short walk away Staff having better local knowledge would be helpful A covered smoking area would be good A lot of people congregated on the terrace outside Jamie s in the rain and as there was no specific smoking area or any ashtrays the floor became littered with cigarette buts , The location is great as it is near many to mainline underground stations popular tourist sites and restaurants Because it is set back from a main road it is quiet It is modern and clean We had a room on floor 9 and had a great view of the Shard The hotel is modern and very clean We had a pleasant evening at Jamie s restaurant

199352,Hilton London Tower Bridge, My son and I saw a mouse come out from under a chair in reception Mentioned to duty managers but no offer of voucher or compensation given even a small gesture would have been appreciated it spoilt our stay to a certain extent One night our bedrooms were not serviced Expensive but good location for a birthday treat , Plush furnishings in reception Convenience of Jamie Oliver Italian Restaurant Location near River Thames Friendly and helpful staff 
199353,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Buffet in the Executive Lounge was poorly presented rocket leaves dried out under heat lamps yuk but the facility is good to have Lamp in our room was slightly damaged art work in room was vile looked like a scat protest and the bathroom could have been cleaner grubby cup rings next to the sink from previous guests Top floor 12th was noisy but that may have been due to the bad weather lots of clanking coming from the roof which woke us up a few times Cot for our daughter was slightly damaged too , Staff were great Only real benefit of the Executive room was a better view which was amazing Nice having a decent restaurant onsite Jamie s for breakfast especially Superb location Bed was comfortable

199364,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Wifi isn t normally free This is quite surprising Also breakfast on its own is quite expensive , The location is fantastic Room was great and spacious plus very clean The hotel gave us a few freebie christmas presents which was great as well and the majority of the staff who were lovely

199368,Hilton London Tower Bridge, London traffic means that you spend long hours in cabs The tube is a better option is you go into central London, The sole purpose for the trip was a concert at O2 hence being on the Jubilee line was perfect JAMIE S Italian was really good and the breakfast one on the best ever

199375,Hilton London Tower Bridge, It was to hot in the room At night the room temperature was above 20 C Air co worked fine but off course made to much noise to leave it on during the night , Very nice hotel The people were very friendly Breakfast is excellent 
199376,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The ventilation in the bathroom seemed inadequate The piped music in the lounge area was too loud and intrusive , Room was well furnished comfortable with excellent soundproofing Evening meals and breakfasts very good 
199377,Hilton London Tower Bridge, the Gym on the 3rd floor is too small going to another place for a workout is not practical so that is a downside The only downside about using Jamies is that they should have a better selection for breakfast for example there is only one cheese cheddar it is a nice cheese but there should be some choices e g cheese spreads feta cheese etc basically something else also there should be a bit more selection for people from the med such as olives black and green sliced cucumbers you can get these but you have to ask Again all of these are just constructive criticism because the hotel is very nice and I would definitely stay there again , Very clean and modern hotel good staff Location was useful both for business and also for shopping The lounge bar is nice and the arrangement with using Jamies as the restaurant is also a plus 
199378,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We were unable to use the bar as there was a private function which took over the whole area We were stopped from using the rear entrance by very rude security staff bouncers there was nowhere else to sit and have a drink so we had to go back to our room earlier than planned The room rate should include breakfast We chose not to have breakfast as 20 each is a lot for four people We found nice local caf s , Rooms were modern clean and bed comfortable 
199379,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Nothing really much to say here all very friendly except no free wifi, Hotel is really well kept its clean and fresh Executive lounge and hotel bar all very good 
199380,Hilton London Tower Bridge, When checking in I assured the staff that all was pre paid yet I was still charged for the stay for 3 nights which is yet to be sorted When speaking to staff regarding this issue it took speaking to the manager to finally understand this , The location was great staff friendly and the facilities were excellent 
199381,Hilton London Tower Bridge, We ordered an extra bed which was promised us later this day In the evening no additional bed in the room was ready Even after 2 times re asking and 3 hours waiting nothing The hotel manager then gave us some sheets and a pillow and our guest had to sleep on the floor On the day before the room service would deliver a pizza late at night about 02 00 which we never ordered he said oh sorry this is a mistake The hotel has not even lowerde the price Poor service through and through from a Hilton hotel I would clearly expect more , Nice and extensive breakfast buffet Very quiet and comfortable rooms 
199382,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Room is very comfortable Room has a lot of space for couple traveler The hotel is not far from London city airport The hotel is near M S supermaket 
199383,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Discrepancies in whether or not a breakfast was part of the booking Also i had been linked to a Hiltons Honours account which was not mine yet some of my details were mixed in A data quality Issue for me , Overall a great hotel
199384,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Hotel called us about 10 minutes before we were due to arrive by car to tell us they d had a problem with their system and we had to be moved to another hotel This wasn t any good as we booked the hotel specifically for a nearby business meeting so managed to get them to give us a room there upon complaining It was a smoking room so not great so overall pretty poor service for a Hilton , Breakfast in Jamie s was good but busy and location was good for getting about by foot 
199385,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I did not consume anything from mini bar but did open the door to place fresh milk and was charged everytime the door opened I was refunded the 15GBP,No Positive
199386,Hilton London Tower Bridge, it took three weeks to get the hotel to relase the credit card hold Completely unacceptable I will neither recommend nor stay at a Hilton hotel again, Nice modern hotel not too far from many attractions
199387,Hilton London Tower Bridge, At around 6 o clock in the morning I could hear someone banging on the door then I saw the light come through from the Lobby I woke my boyfriend up as I was scared he said you were probably dreaming go back to sleep Then at 8 o clock it happened again and we both woke up this time If we hadn t of had the latch on the door whoever it was would ve ended up coming into our hotel room Also throughout the night there was this awful buzzing and beeping noise we got up twice to find out what it was looked all around the room but couldn t see where it was coming from , I liked the location 
199388,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Poor service at breakfast on first morning pretty much ignored and had to source our own tea a coffee and cutlery despite trying to attract several staffs attention Second day was much improved with very friendly and attentive staff member , Fantastic location Helpful check in staff 
199389,Hilton London Tower Bridge, No Wi fi in bedroom just 1 hour per day would be fine The instructions for operating the shower could be clearer , Nothing stands out it s a useful hotel that ticks most of the boxes for a stay in Southwark 
199390,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The only negative I could find is not with the hotel but with Jamie s restaurant where we had breakfast One of the waiters was not friendly at all and behaved as if he didn t want us to be there and kept looking at us in a strange way It made us a bit uncomfortable , It was an excellent experience Exceptional service There is hardly anything to fault I wrote while booking that we were celebrating my girlfriend s birthday and they even put a cake and birthday card in the room for her This shows the level of personalisation in their service 
199391,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, The central location although it meant a little noisy at night The executive suite and its facilities were very good if a little crowded at times The staff were very friendly and most helpful Definitely visit again 
199392,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I emailed before my visit to say this was for my partners birthday and therefore could I have a room ideally facing the shard this wasn t acknowledged Also our room completely stunk of smoke all the skirtings had thick dust and the plastic edging at the bottom of the shower screen fell off everytime we opened it, The style of the hotel and the location
199393,Hilton London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Pleasant staff lovely room pleasing d cor throughout There were nice touches such as iron and ironing board complementary toiletries and tea coffee and mineral water should you need them 
199394,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Not bad experience but room oddly set out for disable persons why were we given Also found shower on to floor dangerously slippery Room not cleaned Asked to be at 2pm too late as back, LOCATION UP MARKET FEEL 
199395,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The wifi took ages to access and cut off quickly I d forgotten my son s room number but knew it was on the 7th floor No one was capable of telling me because they did not understand his name, Room a good size and late chech out time
199396,Hilton London Tower Bridge, The mini bar should have been complementary and an extension of the executive lounge so that we could have complementary bits in our room The tower hotel where we usually stay does this for executive rooms so it was disappointing, The luxuriousness of the room
199397,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Would have liked to be able to empty the minibar without having to pay 25 , The overall service was very nice and the room was spacey and comfortable The breakfast was very good with multiple things to choose from 
199398,Hilton London Tower Bridge, I would have liked free wifi in the bedrooms , The included in our rate breakfast at Jamie s Kitchen was one of the best hotel breakfast s I ve ever had outstanding The room was great as was the reception area and so handy for London Bridge station and the river we walked almost everywhere 
199399,Hilton London Tower Bridge, Breakfast was a shambles waited to be seated had to ask several times to get a pot of tea and then it had no lid Ran out of butter buffet not sufficiently replenished toaster didn t work , Room good and bed comfy
