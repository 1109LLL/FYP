221808,Hotel VIU Milan, There is still some construction taking place beside the hotel it wasn t noisy but it meant the view was a little lacklustre Pool area got pretty busy also despite only being open to hotel guests It might have been nice to have a few more loungers available , Very friendly staff great service from everyone Amazing rooms it was very clear the hotel has only been open a few months Everything was new clean and modern Very nice pool area 
221809,Hotel VIU Milan, The hotel blocked double 1 night payment on my credit card prior to my stay but this did not reflect in their system I was told that the extra amount blocked would be released shortly after we checked out well it still isn t Further more I would expect more from the reception of a 5 star hotel Looks shabby one person on duty during the night shift not the most competent one although quite friendly Did not like the location Chinatown is Chinatown wherever you go In general this should be 4 stars sold at half a price they are charging We selected it because of the roof top pool a rare case for Milan The pool is nice but a bit smaller in reality then it looks on the pictures Sorry guys this is the said truth comparing your venue with other 5 star hotels ,No Positive
221810,Hotel VIU Milan, Not the best neighborhood in Milan right next to the milanese chinatown and garibaldi area such a shame , Brand new and beautifully designed hotel bar and restaurant were amazing 
221811,Hotel VIU Milan, The hotel still new but the stuff is not well trained and they are very aggressive at a certain point they were rude E g heading to the breakfast and the lady stopped me and we had this conversation where are you going sir to have breakfast But you have to give me your details first Not just walking like that It s good for business but not for leisure at all the house keeping keeped knocking on the door 9 times while i was trying to take a nap and i put don t disturb sign This beside the construction work that was happening next to us check the photo , Good location near the metro station Nice desk at the room and fast internet speed 
221812,Hotel VIU Milan, Having to leave , Staff were very very good Pool on the roof was first class wifi was best I ve seen in a hotel an the food was delicious Will definitely be back
221813,Hotel VIU Milan, The hotel is not really in the city centre which is fine if you dont travel alone Everything else was amazing , We agreed this was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at as it fit our taste in everything design staff and facilities After we have returned to our room in the evening there was a welcome bottle of proseco and small biscuites for us Breakfast is really nice the room was spacious and the spa was small but nice as well 
221814,Hotel VIU Milan, Swimming pool is closed every hour for private parties Staff permanently ignored our requests My child did not have a chance to swim Very poor breakfast It is definitely not a five stars Probably between 2 and 3, Absolutely awful 
221815,Hotel VIU Milan, Nothing except the Location but everything was perfect , The entire staff was absolutely amazing The room was both beautiful and extremely comfortable 
221816,Hotel VIU Milan, I asked for a quiet room on check in I stayed in room 101 Its was next to a access staff door that bangs allot throughout the night I had a terrible nights sleep The corridors have a weird smell Maybe its the new carpet , This is the second time I ve stayed I really want this hotel to work for me as my office is around the corner The small terrace part of room 101 is really nice 
221817,Hotel VIU Milan, The only problem was an extra room service charge made after our departure of a meal that was offered to us by the manager as a compensation complimentary for a problem with a room service order made during our stay This will hopefully be sorted out directly with the hotel , The hotel is a lovely new hotel with a fabulous proffessional and attentive staff All went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and to make us feel welcome and content Our thanks and love to all of them especially to the lovely Sonia Enass and Marco 
221818,Hotel VIU Milan,No Negative, Very appealing 5 design hotel spacious rooms and spacious bathroom good located and first of all a very outstanding hotel staff super nice and helpful We travelled with our little dog and its very recommendable for dog owners too Highly recommended in general one of the nicest 5 hotels I have been 
221819,Hotel VIU Milan, the location is a little bit odd i think its in a new area where lots of new hotels are coming up but that was not an issue once we figured out our way , everything this is a brand new hotel very nice 
221820,Hotel VIU Milan,No Negative, Friendly staff Super hotel that is a new gem in Milan everytime will be there for Business Classy bar downstairs and amazing views from rooftop
221821,Hotel VIU Milan, Slightly overpriced Poor breakfast spread can at best be explained as functional The swimming pool was tiny and the purpose of choosing the hotel was defeated , The hotel was new with modern fittings Compact but comfortable 
221822,Hotel VIU Milan, The spa was not opened when I checked unsure if it has specific hours and the 30 breakfast could be better This did not take away from the amazing experience I had , The bed was super comfortable as were the pillows Bathroom was like none other very spacious and had a spa feeling The staff made my experience well worth it They were very professional and helpful I commend them My outstanding experience started from I entered the hotel very beautiful and inviting to when I checked out 5 7 minutes walk to China Town The tram stop is right in front of the hotel on the main road while the underground station that appears to be new is a 10 minute walk From Linate Airport I boarded the 73 bus right outside the airport to the last stop Duomo The Duomo is uniquely beautiful From the Duomo take tram 12 or 14 verify direction from hotel and arrive at the hotel in less than 20 minutes This might not be the best route but it was an easy route that required just one ticket costing 1 50 The hotel does provide pick up from hotel for 50 or 55 Breakfast was good but not outstanding as is what I was expecting for 30 The restaurant attached to the hotel is a MUST The food was good the owner very polite and since we sat at the kitchen bar and could see as they prepare every dish the cooks were pleasant and articulate in their detail to preparing each dish Restaurant has a live DJ too Totally enjoyed my stay 
221823,Hotel VIU Milan, Overdesigned bathroom You can t turn off the taps with wet hands There are no grips Breakfast needs a re think Bread basket too so long to arrive Cold breakfast needs a clean edit , Really friendly check in Super modern new hotel Comfortable rooms Near to the Ceresio 7 another roof top bar and pool Hotel pool great to sit around and have drinks Its not really managed though in the day 
221824,Hotel VIU Milan, Unfortunately the staff doesn t live up to the level of this hotel at all Intrusive suspicious people who 1 don t know what privacy means 2 reserved the whole amount for the stay and than charged the same amount on top of that Awful , Great Hotel design bed and amenities 
221825,Hotel VIU Milan, Very expensive daily rate for level of service received Expensive breakfast with only 1 basket of bread croissants even if multiple people pay for it A C was acting out only 1 single free water bottle for the all stay and tap water in the room had a strange smell taste finally shower was leaking , Very good looking hotel staff was ok
221826,Hotel VIU Milan, For the moment there is a construction site just nearby so the view from our 2 rooms wasn t great I asked if we could have rooms with another view but unfortunately it wasn t possible , A brand new hotel with a modern design You can easily go to the center by a tram or on foot if you don t mind waking The rooftop terrace lobby bar and SPA facilities are very nice We have really enjoyed our stay 
221827,Hotel VIU Milan, The spa could have had a treatment room it was basically just a few different types of shower and a steam room sauna , Staff were excellent rooms were immaculate 
221828,Hotel VIU Milan, They have a lot of kinks to work out hopefully just opening pains The concierge didn t seem prepared to offer restaurant recommendations and struggled to find us Milanese cuisine The cleaning staff doesn t appear to operate on a checklist so our room rain out of toilet paper and we couldn t get through to housekeeping for more the line was busy The breakfast is expensive and the staff seems inexperienced In fact they forgot half of what we paid for the first day and apparently dont check the details lIke has the salternative and peoperated been filled or has the condiments basket refilled As we were going on a tour we didn t have time to wait around for them to hopefully come by our table not around lot of folks working and you ended up sitting there a long while if you needed assistance 5 star hotels are all about the details This place forgot them If they don t step it up they will lose that 5th star , The beds were very comfortable because the hotel is new the bedding and rooms are very stylish and comfortable The rooms also had pretty decent sound proofing that kept the street and hallway noise out Heavy curtains let you sleep in if you wanted as they kept the light from outside out They had breakfast on premises as well as 2 restaurants if you didn t feel like venturing out 
221829,Hotel VIU Milan, The staff needs to be highly trained Spent 30 min checking out because they processed the wrong amount and could not understand what to do The hotel is new but 5 star so the staff should be very professional since day one of the opening The check in was also too long which was disappointing as the travel time was long and we were tired Car parking in hotel does not have enough space even when the hotel is not fully booked , New stylish great location close to Brera design Beds and bathrobes are fantastic Nice view from top floors Terrace with pool Will stay here again 
221830,Hotel VIU Milan, The quality of the breakfast is good but the service needs revision You have a small self service buffet with fruit en cereals The warm food must be ordered drinks eggs etc It takes a lot of time before you are served There is no system of taking orders No supervision This shouldn t be in a 5star hotel We took 3 times a breakfast and it was every morning the same , It s a brand new hotel Interior is beautiful No noise in the room High standard High quality The breakfast room is on top of the hotel 8th floor and has windows instead of walls You have a lot of light and a beautiful view Very nice The hotel is situated in the Chinese area Nice restaurants in the neighborhood 
221831,Hotel VIU Milan, Because the hotel is new there are certain things that still need to be worked on For example there was a wooden panel part of the wardrobe that fell on my feet because it was detached from the console Stuff is great but sometimes get lost a bit with the simplest requests I am sure all of these small drawbacks is just a matter of experience and will be smoothed out in the future because the place is just superb , The hotel is new so all the advantages come with the added bonus of the newness in everything Towels are soft and fluffy as are bathrobes Bed very comfortable excellent pillows and stunning linen Loved the control panel for the lights beside the bed Room very spacious and I loved the design and all the details Blackout curtains do their job well and I was able to get a good sleep in a completely dark room Complimentary mineral water provided Bathroom was well stocked with all necessary supplies and very very clean absolutely spotless Breakfasts are excellent never had baked goods so fresh in any other hotel Excellent food and coffee Stuff friendly and helpful Location ia quite central right by Chinatown and districts with cafes and restaurnats 10 min drive to the centre centre Would definitely recommend and return
