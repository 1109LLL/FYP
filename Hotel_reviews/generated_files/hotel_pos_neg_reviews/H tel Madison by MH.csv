51396,H tel Madison by MH, Simpler Express I think breakfast should have a baguette option As usual in hotels minibar too expensive to use try more competitive prices , Great location easy access to metro and buses comfy with helpful staff Simpler and cheaper breakfast option
51397,H tel Madison by MH, The commode toilet space a little narrow , Finally a 4 star hotel in Paris which deserves its stars Welcoming and polite and professional staff Kindly gave an early check in and late check out Very clean and cosy comfy well designed rooms Location is very central on the Boulevard St Germain des Pr s close to famous Caf de Flore and Les Deux Magots and shops 
51398,H tel Madison by MH, Staff were inconsistent reception lady at check out was not at all warm or friendly so different to the guy I had checking in And no free water each small bottle was 6 Euros , Super comfortable bed Stunning view of Boulevard Saint Germain and sunset could even see the sun setting over the Eiffel Tower if I poked my head out the window far enough 
51399,H tel Madison by MH, Cleaning of room Found socks of previous inhabitants in the corner Staff in the breakfast area changed and was very grumpy on Sunday Tables where cleared salt sugar and pepper removed at 10 15 AM although breakfast runs til 11 , Quiet room facing the courtyard which was perfect for us as we could sleep with the window open No noise from street Staff was very friendly and helpful no matter what we needed Extra bedding was supplied late in the evening as my daughter is an avid kicker at night thank you Christian Breakfast staff lady from India such a pleasant welcoming person Thank you for a nice breakfast experience
51400,H tel Madison by MH, The prices for the minibar are extortionate and we didn t see the menu and prices until we had tucked in to nibbles and beer , Fantastic Quirky hotel within walking distance of most of the sights It is extremely comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly The breakfast choices were extensive and although expensive the room service menu was varied and well presented and served reasonably quickly Any questions or requests made from the room were dealt with very promptly and professionally 
51401,H tel Madison by MH,No Negative, The room was clean with nice interiors bed was very comfortable mattress pillows and beddings were simply excellent Staff was very friendly and helpful especially Christian at reception and Zalde It has an excellent location many wonderful shops cafes restaurants bistros in the area Saint Germain du pres Mabillon and Odeon stations are all near by Brasserie Lipp Le Deux Magots and Cafe Flore are all a short walk away We would stay here again 
51402,H tel Madison by MH, The pillows Very low Uncomfortable Shower place should have a bigger glass to prevent the water go out , Location is excellent Hotel was very good Staff were lovely Everything is very near 
51403,H tel Madison by MH, Basin taps unusual as hot water came first , Good breakfast lovely staff Excellent position near 2 metro stations supermarket Many shops restaurants around hotel
51404,H tel Madison by MH, The room was very small The bathroom was not very clean The shower water spilled out to the bathroom every time we took a shower The bathroom sink was dirty , The location is perfect for a city trip
51405,H tel Madison by MH, Ceiling lights with no way to turn them off at night other than removing key card So if you need to use the washroom at night you disturb the other person as the ceiling lights turn on Bizarre to refurbish a hotel putting in lights that have no switch , Location
51406,H tel Madison by MH, King size bed turns out to be 2 single beds put together Poor ventilation for the bathroom, An excellent boutique hotel that I will definitely stay there again Room size is adequate for 2 people nicely lit with romantic lighting and stars on the ceiling 
51407,H tel Madison by MH, The staff added a charity donation without saying a word When asked what it was they seemed unhappy we asked the question and a very dry answer was provided We had a very good experience up until then , The location of the hotel is amazing right in the heart of the St Germain des Pres area 
51408,H tel Madison by MH, Breakfast Expensive and not interesting at all We went out for breakfast and we saved 175 in 3 days The buffet wasn t appealing at all My room a privilege was on 1st floor and we kept hearing a strange noise every night something rolling like furniture but not very loud and no one could tell us what was the problem Then my husband guessed It was from the door just underneath opening and shutting The rooms I booked for my family had no view of course that s why they were cheaper But even then very expensive Second floor and others are very tiny , Staff very much Location the best clean renovated and the beds amazing 
51409,H tel Madison by MH,No Negative, Lovely place with emaculate property and professional and very helpful staff I look forward to my next visit there It was easy to find on Booking com And was represented well I rely heavily on the ratings

51411,H tel Madison by MH, For the price breakfast was lacking the wow factor and the room furnishings look a bit tired Pillows really need changing really really hard , Great location had suite facing quiet courtyard Liked the coffee maker and kettle in the room nice toiletries and shower in the bathroom Had a room service dinner which was good Staff were welcoming and helpful Loved the log fire in the salon breakfast room
51412,H tel Madison by MH, Airco not cooling enough and window could not open because of noise and the smog these days, Very Nice room andvery personal service and great breakfast 
51413,H tel Madison by MH, The breakfast is now very expensive so this time we used several of the excellent cafes near the hotel , It was the third time that we have stayed at the hotel in the past twelve months so we like it The location is perfect with a metro station outside The staff are very friendly and helpful The rooms are well appointed and the beds very comfortable

51416,H tel Madison by MH, The size of the standard double room was tiny It is taken up entirely by the bed and the bathroom is equally small it is really only big enough for one person , The location is perfect and the general standard of the hotel very good
51417,H tel Madison by MH, Breakfast is very pricey, Great location the junior suite was more spacious although expect a larger hotel room rather than a suite and worth the extra spend very friendly staff and an incredibly helpful concierge Christian who booked all our restaurants for us in advance

51422,H tel Madison by MH, Nothing, We love St Gemain and the hotel is ideally located for the metro within easy walking distance to the Louvre Notre Dame and Jardins du Tuileries The Parisienne ambience is on the doorstep with pavement cafes and a huge choice of bars and restaurants The staff are all helpful and friendly and the rooms are a good size by European standards and spotlessly clean We travel from Australia so a home from home is important fully recommended
