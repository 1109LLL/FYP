326476,Durrants Hotel, Bar closed bang on 11pm Left to feel most unwelcome Request for food after 11 very poorly received Felt like it was a bother for barman , Accommodation v comfortable Very clean V friendly staff 
326477,Durrants Hotel, As above, The staff were nice The entrance was lovely but the room really let it down was very dated and could do with upgrades such as a new shower that doesn t leak
326478,Durrants Hotel, The breakfast was expensive but I was on a cheap deal so shouldn t really complain and there are lots of place nearby to have breakfast, The location was brilliant placed between the Marble Arch end of Oxford Street and the bottom of Marylebone High Street 
326479,Durrants Hotel, we couldn t check in at 13 00 so we came back but there was no explanation about hotel when we checked in , we loved the location very close to stylish neiborhood cute cafe nice restaurants and cute boutiques Hotel room was small but it is Europe so what do you expect Hotel was very clean 
326480,Durrants Hotel, Carpets in room need replacing as they are now difficult to keep looking clean although there was no obvious mess around the edges were very darkened from age The bar is very outdated and while relaxed in atmosphere and good service it could look more welcoming and have more comfortable seating and tables , Comfortable bed Quiet and relaxed Very helpful and pleasant staff The ability to park the car is a boon 
326481,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Great location with very attentive staff and a great bar area to meet guests Short walk to many good restaurants and Wallace collection a definite visit 
326482,Durrants Hotel, Needs extensive renovation now had the smallest most old fashioned box room I have ever stayed in Much worse than my previous stay here , A hotel with Great potential One of the best positions in London 
326483,Durrants Hotel, Not applicable hiwever a gym coukd be beneficial , The little bar is great for tea n drinks after dinner Dining is always lovely and staff remember you as Im a regular guest I like location coz next to it is my favourite sushi bar Defune some 40 yrs old since I Was a student I like Durrants like my home n GM Ian there a great fellow 
326484,Durrants Hotel, Whilst breakfast is a pleasure other dining experiences in the restaurant leave room for improvement in overall quality , We love Durrants attention to detail and the care that comes with years of dedication to high standards of hospitality Well done to all at Durrants and thank you for another enjoyable stay 
326485,Durrants Hotel, Honestly can t think of anything we d change, We ve stayed locally for many years and have always thought about this Hotel Wish we d done it years ago it was fabulous Old fashioned in a quality classy way Fabulous welcome and great quality throughout 
326486,Durrants Hotel, Only one thing I had an excellent breakfast but the coffee was poor Very surprising as I breakfasted at around 7 30 am A tiny niggle, Beautiful and relaxing decor Very comfortable room Charming friendly and obliging staff Loved the food very good take on traditional English fare Particularly appreciated availablity of half bottles of good wine Smashing breakfast 
326487,Durrants Hotel, Wanted to stay longer , Walking distance to Regents Park is great High Street just around corner Food bar and staff wonderfull Will always stay here 
326488,Durrants Hotel, Room was very basic and outdated There were stains on the headboard and the air con made the room feel damp No tea or coffee making facilities in the room no fridge Arrived back at the hotel at around 2 30am and had to wait to be let in by the night porter which took a while , Good central location without the expensive central price tag Friendly staff
326489,Durrants Hotel, Room was quite basic in comparison to the overall hotel No coffee making facilities in the room , Staff were very helpful I asked for some complicated directions to more than one place and the young lady was very patient and gave me lots of her time Thank you 
326490,Durrants Hotel, When we got there we were forced to pay 100 pounds for extras we might have I did not agree with the fact that I had to pay in advance for services that I had not used and had no intention of using The alternative was to leave the money in cash which would only be returned after check out The credit card charge is only released after four days Our room didn t have a mini bar nor air conditioning and we weren t able to fully open or close the windows The bathroom was a nightmare We had to wait almost ten minutes in between us to be able to use the toilet since it took ages for it to have enough water to flush again The lifts were incredibly slow and the stairs felt like they were falling apart beneath our feet ,No Positive
326491,Durrants Hotel, Minor issue of tea coffee facilities not being in our room but in fairness readily available by room service at reasonable cost Smallish room but compensated by a lovely bath shower room These comments should and are not to be taken as a criticism however as a balance to what we did enjoy , Food was very very good service and staff excellent Following check out they stored our luggage until our evening departure Could not fault the experience of our stay Above all probably one of the cleanest hotels we have enjoyed for the price Our first stay and we were made to feel as if we had stayed regularly 
326492,Durrants Hotel, room was tiny and lacked basic hotel amenities like a hot water kettle tea slippers etc , the old world feel of the hotel very nice and charming great location in marylebone

326498,Durrants Hotel, Variation in room sizes and condition last stay was in a small badly run down room Must in future specify an uprated room to avoid the disappointment of our previous stay, Recently refurbished room very large and comfortaable
326499,Durrants Hotel, The lack of customer importance When my lights went out at 6am it took 15minutes for the staff to come and put them back on this was only a 30second job , The room was very clean 
326500,Durrants Hotel, The room d cor was a little tired but was still clean and acceptable , The staff were very accommodating and friendly unlike most London hotels in which I have stayed Also the atmosphere was very warm and inviting The restaurant staff were particularly nice and the fixed menu very enjoyable and good value for money 
326501,Durrants Hotel, The minuscule bathroom was tricky although sparkling clean hey it s central London Rather expensive breakfast That s all , We were only here from midnight unfortunately after a party so didn t try anything except our room but I loved the town house feel and I think it would be a gorgeous place to hide out in the winter Extra comfy beds and my type of ambience 
326502,Durrants Hotel, Need a mirror in the bedroom the only mirrors were in the bathroom very difficult to get ready, Porters were very helpful Lovely location and beds were amazing 
326503,Durrants Hotel, Moved rooms no tea or coffee facilities still using sheets and blankets , First room smelt like it hadnt been aired for weeks long corridor with bunk beds and masses of toys at one end 
326504,Durrants Hotel, I was surprised that there were no tea making facilities in the bedrooms That would have made a great stay perfect , The hotel is in a lovely area The reception rooms are wonderful really old quaint and interesting The staff were fantastic We went to a function while staying at the hotel in the regatta room The staff serving that night were wonderful

326506,Durrants Hotel, We could not find a way to lower the heating at night All the other technical stuff was easy to use , Thoughtful arrangement of the room although small it worked very well Bed very comfy and bed linen crisp I liked the decoration which was mellow and cheerful no hard modern styles
326507,Durrants Hotel, Either tea and coffe making facilities in the room or reduce the cost of room service 4 50 for Cup of coffee is ridiculous, Old fashioned charm helpful staff comfy bed able to check in early
326508,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, A beautifully preserved hotel with lots of historic touches that add up to a most enjoyable experience Courteous professional and very competent staff

326510,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, We stay at the Durrant regularly having the same room It is very conveniently placed and has easy access to Liverpool Street Station Excellent Breakfast
326511,Durrants Hotel, no tea coffee making facilities bar prices distance to tube station but easy bus route , very pretty and good sized room lovely to have sheets and blankets and a lovely bathroom 
326512,Durrants Hotel, Unacceptable noise during the late evening and night due to recycling and emptying of waste I also had the strong impression that because I booked 3 rooms for a family of 6 through Booking com that we were 2nd rate guests I travel a great deal am not used to that , Great decor We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was excellent 
326513,Durrants Hotel, The bedroom was clean but very small for the cost Terrible view from bedroom window Away from the reception areas the hotel looked quite tired , The reception areas were very pleasant The staff were very pleasant and helpful
326514,Durrants Hotel, Cannot think of a thing That s why we will be back as soon as the need arises to visit London again , With a sense oh history but with elegant modern services it is a hotel apart from others I really don t know what else one needs from a hotel and of course it s location is second to none charming and attentive staff the most helpful I have known and I have travelled to very good hotels all around the world 
326515,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel but the room was very small and much too hot even though it was December and I had the window open it became stuffy and uncomfortable in the night
326516,Durrants Hotel, I think customer service could be improved but that s only a small factor I enjoyed my stay , Nice hotel in a beautiful part of London About a 5 min walk to Oxford St Rooms have a nice old style but do look a bit dated Some noise can be heard from the corridors Overall nice comfortable room however a little overpriced 
326517,Durrants Hotel, The room was tiny The bathroom was a hazard because the bathtub was considerably higher than the bathroom floor exiting the bathtub required help from a second person My girlfriend fell and she is only 25 The staff was unhelpful The room was cold , The hotel s location
326518,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location quiet but still very close to West End Nice to walk around the quiet streets and look at interesting shops no chains Interior well designed and essential individual 
326519,Durrants Hotel, I was with a work colleague in a twin room but the room was very small and probably better suited to a closer friend I have stayed on numerous occasions before and haven t had this as a problem without paying the surcharge for a superior twin I think when the twin room is selected the beds should be separated rather than pushed together but made up individually , location and general feel of hotel
326520,Durrants Hotel, First room was dirty old and carpet threadbare I asked to be moved and the second room was in improvement but they wanted me to pay extra , Excellent Location in central London
326521,Durrants Hotel, View of brick wall from window difficulty with cold water flow tv controls not working well No tea making facilities in the room No breakfast , Location size comfort helpful staff 
326522,Durrants Hotel, Overpriced needs renovating no draught beer 20 for breakfast which is a joke check you bill as was charged for breakfast I didn t have and they automatically include a tip as well Will NEVER stay there again , Location 
326523,Durrants Hotel, Bathroom was very small and shabby Cracked basin Room very hot fans were provided Net curtains very dirty No coffee tea making facilities , The young foreign staff were very pleasant Dinner in the restaurant good Comfortable sitting area in room 
326524,Durrants Hotel, The room was very hot and no way to control it except for opening the windows pity this wasn t sorted when it was refurbished Also lighting in the bathroom was way too bright , Nice and clean with efficient staff good toiletries 
326525,Durrants Hotel, The bathroom doesn t have an outlet for water in the floor so it gets really messy really quick They never changed the soap for my entire stay No air conditioning no heating and if you open the window you will be greeted with the smoke emanating from workers smoking in the basement stairs The bed is very small for two persons , The staff are wonderful people the location is excellent 
326526,Durrants Hotel, Old system limited facilities , Clean quiet friendly nice location size of the room is very suitable 
326527,Durrants Hotel, Apart from the room which was comfortable there were no added luxuries ie dressing gowns slippers body lotion in the room The bed had blankets on not a quilt which was not comfortable There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and no air conditioning Not value for money, Great location
326528,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, I have been staying at Durrants for nearly 20 years and have always found the staff incredibly friendly and courteous The historic building is both characterful and cozy and the location is perfect a tranquil location in the heart of the West End
326529,Durrants Hotel, If I was pushed to find something I didn t like it would be that there was no tea making facilities in our room and no mirror near a plug point but they were not big issues , The location of the hotel is amazing just 7 minutes walk from Selfridges what s not to like The staff were very helpful and the room clean 
326530,Durrants Hotel, No bad experiences at all A kettle and tea bags would have been a nice addition but this is not a complaint , The manager was very approachable and was waiting upon our arrival to personally discuss a food allergy issue We couldn t eat there due to nuts being used in the kitchen but he offered to send someone to buy something specially which I felt was above and beyond and was impressed with and touched by 
326531,Durrants Hotel, First time in my life I was made to pay on arrival for the entire 4 night booking I found this totally unacceptable Never occurred to me ever before Window sills filthy mini fridge not working, The Restaurant is excellent and deserves top rating
326532,Durrants Hotel, Room temperature a little too warm and noisy if we opened a window, Very convenient location for the West End in general Reasonably priced and friendly
326533,Durrants Hotel, I would have like hair conditioner in my room and tea and coffee facility, The staff were really helpful and friendly Very good service Thank you everyone
326534,Durrants Hotel, Durrants is a string of houses connected together to form the hotel While most of the hotel was quite bright and up to date it appeared that the wing where I stayed in hadn t been updated in a decade or two worn around the edges and with dim lighting It was expensive for the quality of the room , Ambiance was perfect Great location Convenient to great restaurants pubs and parks 
326535,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable In addition I enjoyed seeing the Wallace Collection it s right across the street 
326536,Durrants Hotel, Being challenged rudely amd abruptly everytime we entered the hotel as to whether or not we were guests Also on two occasions asked to show our key as proof by some rude young man with the charisma and discretion of an SS officer other staff were polite and helpful , ROOM 7 very nice and comfortable New modern bathroom well decorated Efficient check in and checkout Hotel is quaint 
326537,Durrants Hotel, No Tea Coffee making facilities How can a 225 per night not have this bed was a normal double No duvet hair on the bed clothes sink didn t drain away and had to complain , The style of the hotel toiletries

326541,Durrants Hotel, The sheets on my bed had dirty marks carpet looked very old Room was small Worst of all though was the terrible noise proofing I could hear everything said in the room next door plus was repeatedly woken up by doors closing unnecessarily loudly Not to mention the fire alarm at 6am no apology given , Nice traditional atmosphere and cosy bar 
326542,Durrants Hotel, Being asked to pay for breakfast when it was already included in the rate and being made to feel like I was trying it on , Great location staff and ambience
326543,Durrants Hotel, There was no information in the room about room service or the hotel menu etc but the staff were helpful when asked , The hotel was traditional but clean and tidy The room was quite small but had all we needed and the bathroom was modern and felt luxurious 
326544,Durrants Hotel, As mentioned above Also very small and narrow high sided bath that was extremely difficult to get out of Very high bedside table that needs legs cutting down to make it possible to use easily at night Also bedside lights almost impossible to reach , Atmosphere All staff except one who was rude and challenging because we didn t add a service charge Otherwise staff were very helpful and courteous 
326545,Durrants Hotel, Room very small was ok for one night as only had an overnight bag but nowhere to put a suitcase if you were staying longer very limited hanging space Would definitely stay again though, Good location
326546,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Professional and friendly staff not an easy balance to achieve Very interesting and attractive old building loads of character Room was quite small but had character too Not the bland chain effect 
326547,Durrants Hotel, Room smelt and was tiny and old fashioned serious lack of comfort Very basic for 250 with no tea or coffee making facilities and no information given when checked in i e Location of bar wifi breakfast included or check out times, Nothing
326548,Durrants Hotel, The receptionist was cold However the other staff was pretty helpful whenever needed , Feels like home I liked the many small rooms nicely decorated where you can sit read a book or have a tea The whole atmosphere made me feel relaxed and comfi 
326549,Durrants Hotel, Horrible Wi Fi quite old furniture and bathroom, Amazingly friendly and attentive staff great location beautiful interior design feel of real England

326551,Durrants Hotel, The room small, Location was great between thayer street and baker street and a lot of coffee shops around and the staff were very helpful thank you for everything guys 
326552,Durrants Hotel, The wifi is completely useless It just doesn t work You connect fine but the connection speed is so slow as to be absolutely worthless Don t even think of Skyping family it wont even download emails I know its an 18th Century building thick walls etc but annoying wifi is worse than no wifi Just say there is no wifi and save me the two hours of frustration I had before I gave up , The hotel is fantastic lovely olde world charm properly brilliant really took me back in time I loved it 
326553,Durrants Hotel, Room was small no breakfast at my rate Did not like the natural carpet a little uncomfortable , Central position hotel really well maintained outside staff helpful

326555,Durrants Hotel, the only negative is that there were no tea coffees facilities in the room , The staff were all very friendly the hotel was superb and the room was wonderful

326558,Durrants Hotel, The carpets and the wallpaper in the room is really old and needs a replacement You can not open the windows in the rooms which was a big minus for us Our first stay was in winter and did not notice it We wouldnt have stayed this time round if we knew this The reception staff could be friendlier , this was our second stay at the hotel we love the hotel general areas and the location 
326559,Durrants Hotel, Examples only one shampoo shower gel between two people No tea making facilities No hand lotion Bath shaped to save water make it uncomfortable to soak in , Location
326560,Durrants Hotel, Very shabby and threadbare all over Room had dirty doors and walls Shabby furnishings a bed that had seen better days pillows that seemed to have half of the filling taken out At the prices they charge 303 in my case you d think they d supply a minibar or at least tea and coffee making facility Staff interrogation when entering the hotel bordered on rude I know this hotel from 25 years ago They appear not to have done a thing to keep up its appearance since This is little more than a boarding house at Hilton prices I would never stay at this hotel again nor would I recommend it to anyone, Very little Location is about the only thing going for this hotel
326561,Durrants Hotel, Always miss the convenience of tea coffee making facilities in hotel bedroom , Location Elegant building with pleasant interior decoration Good sized room well appointed Bathroom Staff polite helpful 
326562,Durrants Hotel, The slowest lift in the world , Quiet location but not far from and central to several places of interest north to Madame Tussauds south to Bond Street and not too far from Baker Street tube

326583,Durrants Hotel, Managed to check in early which was good The room was small and pokey the fridge was faulty as was the bedside clock Took a full 3 minutes for reception to answer the phone They said they would send someone straight up 20 Minutes later no one had arrived phoned again long wait before anyone answered another 10 minutes before any one arrived 2 hotel service at best Breakfast was poor porridge tasted like sago had to ask three times for the coffee to come and 8 50 for a very small bowl of berries to go with the porridge is a rip off Ate out the second morning around the corner much better food better service and better coffee Couple of weeks ago we stayed at the Belgraves hotel in Chelsea which is in a different league would go there next time ,No Positive
326584,Durrants Hotel, Service at breakfast was incredibly slow on one occasion waited patiently for twenty minutes for my order to be taken but eventually had to give up , This is a unique hotel with its own individual style the overall impression is of being a guest in a stately home or old fashioned gentlemen s club The food served in the restaurant was delicious and the staff pleasant and helpful 
326585,Durrants Hotel, Tiny room size and small single bed, The style and familiarity as a long time customer in the best location in London New bathroom fit out is excellent
326586,Durrants Hotel, The key was really hard to work in the door We struggled with it every time No one asked us to hand in The key each time we were leaving the hotel and so when we returned the porter followed us up the stairs on the way in asking who we were and where we were staying in front of other guests It felt like we were imposters being accused of something and he didn t say why he was asking It was Only when We were asked for our key on the next trip out that we realised why It made us feel most unwelcome No one bothered to explain anything about breakfast either so we just went out instead I was disappointed that there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room , The rooms are all different which adds to the appeal 
326587,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast expensive standard and service variable Problems with plumbing basins slow to drain showers sometimes do not work properly or have no hot water One room had a loose toilet pedestal , Room service efficient and prompt Rooms comfortable 
326588,Durrants Hotel, Most of the staff were not up to their jobs There were a few exceptions Booking in and checking out were a nightmare Keys had to be handed in when you went out anywhere and there was always a wait while they found time to retrieve them for you I was told that I wasn t in the room for which I had left my key Problems with bill at check out Very gloomy outdated reception area coupled with the time it took someone to get to booking you in tempted you to turn tail and and find another hotel No facility to make a tea or coffee in your room Rooms and bathrooms small Horrible old blankets on bed, The location and the Occitane toiletries 
326589,Durrants Hotel, Nothing I liked all asoects, Very comfortable convenient and pleasant hotel The staff are professional friendly courteous and always willing to help I would recommend the hotel and would enjoy staying again in the future 
326590,Durrants Hotel, The toast under the poached eggs is too small too thin and not hot The risotto was delicious but was a serving for six Our daughter was very happy to take home the extra risotto and the delicious roast chicken that she could not finish Thank you to the staff member who made that possible , We like the friendly staff We like the bar We like no piped music We like the quiet ambience We love the location As we were given a suite we felt as though we were at home which was lovely

326593,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, The lovely old wood The leather chairs beautiful curtains All made a relaxing peaceful atmosphere So much nicer than modernised properties a great retreat in a busy city 
326594,Durrants Hotel, The female receptionist was quite grumpy and never even said hello or good afternoon We were surprised that you have to give the Hotel a credit of 50 on your credit card for each day you stay we already payed our stay two months in advance as security Nobody bothered to tell us about the facilities restaurant in the hotel wifi etc This is not up to standards Unfortunately also the maintainance of the installations is not up to expectations Dripping tap defect fridge broken light bulb in bathroom It took a letter to the Manager to get at least the fridge fixed on our last day there Oral complaints were ignored , The hotel is located quite close to Oxford Street and excellent for shoppers with big bags Room was quiet and clean one could sleep with an open window 
326595,Durrants Hotel, The room was too hot there was no thermostat to control the heat also the fan wasn t working Also we was told to sit in the lounge area so we could be serviced however we waited for almost 25 mins but no one came to attend , My colleague and I both enjoyed our breakfast 
326596,Durrants Hotel, The bedroom was particularly small and poorly lit, I ve stayed many times it has a lovely old fashioned feel which I find more relaxing than more modern and possibly better equipped hotels
326597,Durrants Hotel, Had to wait for the room even though we were told that the room would be ready at 2pm Waiting caused us to be late for our appointment We were offered to have a drink at the bar while we waited which was subsequently charged to the room From previous experience I would have expected this to be complementary ,No Positive
326598,Durrants Hotel, Had to move rooms twice 1st move due to the room bed and bathroom being very very small second room there was a loud tapping noise when we arrived back after dinner midnight so we had to move again Clearly there are 2 parts to the hotel an old part and a newly refurbished part the first 2 rooms we were given were in the old part which was tired and stale the 3rd room was in the refurbished part No apology from the hotel at all we were only there one night but it was very disruptive Car parking is only available for small cars my husband was directed to Selfridges car park to park his car by a member of staff but he found a car park much nearer to the hotel surely the staff know where the nearest car park is We won t return , location
326599,Durrants Hotel, We were told we d been upgraded not sure what from as this was a tiny room the same one we had last time we stayed un upgraded Don t create expectations you don t fulfill We may need to look around next time for our family London trip , Location Charming building 
326600,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, I love this hotel and stay here whenever I am in London It is like stepping back in time in the best possible way It is very charming beautifully furnished and has a delightful little bar and couple of small lounges which are very comfortable and cosy They serve a lovely afternoon tea and the breakfast is great The rooms are small but comfortable and it is always very clean and very well presented The location is superb a lovely 5 minute wall from Oxford street surrounded by great restaurants but is still very quiet and peaceful 
326601,Durrants Hotel, Service at breakfast was too slow , Friendly and professional staff Lovely cosy rooms Lots of great places to sit and have a drink and relax downstairs Super feel to the whole establishment 
326602,Durrants Hotel, Once the room was sorted out it was really quite lovely place to stay, Charming privately owned hotel with delightful reception and dining spaces rooms while not large can be quite comfortable though perhaps a bit quirky 
326603,Durrants Hotel, I didn t like how there where no coffee or tea facilities in the rooms for the amount that you pay breakfast even just a continental breakfast was not included Perhaps the small lounge areas could have complimentary basic tea and coffee facilities if they don t want to put any in the rooms Stayed in over 10 different hotels over 4 weeks of our stay in England and Durrants was the most expensive hotel that delivered the least amount , Position was fantastic close to Bond St shops and two train stations The hotel had a lot of small areas and nooks to sit and chat or have some time out Very clean and room was serviced excellently 
326604,Durrants Hotel, The room was very warm couldn t open windows had to have a fan on all night , Very quiet for a central London location Nice old fashioned ambience but plumbing needs updating 
326605,Durrants Hotel, The hotel was very disappointing The room had no air con the general hotel interior was very poor The room doors had old type key entry which were very difficult to open and had to be given in upon exit, The room was spacious 
326606,Durrants Hotel, It s a little tired A little tlc without losing the old world charm Room was way too hot luckily the area is lovely and quiet so l slept with both windows open all night , Staff were lovely Dinner was excellent and great value 
326607,Durrants Hotel, The only thing that we found was the lack of plugs in the room especially by the bed In fact the mobile was charged by the entrance door close to the ground The shower in the bath lacked a Non slip mat In general the bathroom could done with an upgrade , Great bar with nice log fire found this very cosy
326608,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming it made our stay so special There was nothing they wouldn t do to help us it was like visiting family We came for our friends 40th wedding anniversary the food was amazing and no detail was spared I highly recommend this hotel
326609,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast was great and everything very well presented but maybe a little expensive 38 for 2 , The room was clean comfortable and very well decorated including nice touches such as retro radio and clock etc The staff were all very friendly and helpful 
326610,Durrants Hotel, So spent 2 nights in at this property I had a small surgery on that day and while i was sleeping one of the stitches opened up and started to bleed After I arrive back home i check that i was charged for 2600 pounds extra i called back and their general manager said that he had given me a 50 discount on the damages and charged me only 2600 pounds They have charged this amount without asking me i only discovered it 2 weeks later on my credit card bill I don t know whether to get pissed over charging without calling or them estimating that their mattress costs 5200 pounds with the money you are paying to this hotel trust me you have much more options in London than this hotel ,No Positive
326611,Durrants Hotel, Staff were a little impersonal and serious, Location is excellent plus refurbished facilities great and at the price obtained through booking com you couldn t go wrong 
326612,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast could have been a little better the beans were a little dried out More toast with eggs fish option would have improved it Wasnt obvious from booking that breakfast was extra cost so that was not a welcome surprise, The old world dining room with wooden panels Freshly squeesed grapefruit juice In excellent location lovely pubs St Chistopers square had an excellent Turkish restraunt 
326613,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable and stylish in a traditional way which we both like with lovely touches such as the Roberts Radio A small but well appointed and recently modernized bathroom Delicious breakfast in a very attractive dining room and several charming reception rooms to relax in 
326614,Durrants Hotel, Bedroom needed some tlc , Lovely location Georgian building with lovely reception rooms where you can have a quiet drink and food Extremely comfortable with lots of history 
326615,Durrants Hotel, If you have a no phones rule in the dining room enforce it Even if people are just texting quietly it rules the ambience I asked a member of staff to mention this to another guest and no action was taken so I had to do it myself and got the evils by the guest and the table next door to them Have a rule or do not have a rule If you have it make it happen , Wonderful location good breakfast but overpriced 3 for a croissant is ridiculous 
326616,Durrants Hotel, The room was ok but there were marks on the carpet I like having tea making facilities in my room and there weren t any There was also a strange vase of bizarre fake flowers I hid that away , The situation is wonderful The bar is very atmospheric with a cosy feel and a log fore The room was very quiet 
326617,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, the hotel it self the room was lovely the staff very friendly and efficient the location excellent we couldn t tell you what the food was like because we had booked into the ritz for afternoon T but we shall be back 
326618,Durrants Hotel, Climate control facilities were switched off assume to save cost Room was rather uncomfortable therefore to sleep in When we complained we were asked to open a window by duty manager Mr Harpur His negative attitude and approach would mean we will think twice about staying again This is real shame we we have stayed there many times and love it there , Have stayed here several occasions due to it s proximity to key locations character facilities and friendly staff
326619,Durrants Hotel, Quality of steak, Staff attentive and helpful Room confortable Bar with open fire atmospheric Excellent restaurant especially staff Ate there twice unfortunately my husband s fillet steak inedible but because everything else the chef presented I can only assume it was the quality of the meat not the cooking Wonderful senior member of staff in restaurant she should be nurtured by the company Excellent customer experience because of her intelligence and attentiveness 
326620,Durrants Hotel, I am not so impressed with the style of the refurbished rooms I feel they have lost the character , I absolutely adore the character and charm of the hotel It has a calm atmosphere which is heaven when returning from a busy day in central London 
326621,Durrants Hotel, Room did not have tea making facility BUT kettle was available on request so take your own tea no problem Does anyone drink all that herb stuff other places serve anyway , Location excellent Classy hotel with much character style unlike many modern all the same aspect We particularly liked breakfast choose from a menu superbly served freshly cooked not stale buffet as at other places AND served on fresh linen Proper teapot etc quintessentially British Door entry with a real key not a plastic oh dear did I put it with handphone and it doesn t work Perfect late bar with open fire for a very pleasant nightcap 
326622,Durrants Hotel, I could have stayed longer , The bed and bed linens were a delight The bathroom was nice clean and functional The restaurant offers delicious food with welcoming service The bar is exceptional 
326623,Durrants Hotel, Nothing that we could see , My sister and I enjoyed everything although we did not eat at the hotel there being so many choices outside We did have a late night coffee which was served kindly and was extremely good Thank you for your service 
326624,Durrants Hotel, unfortunately one couldn t prepare a tea in the room for a hotel of this category it s a pit There wasn t a bathrobe either I had to ask for an adapter for mobile telephone they are so cheap that the should already be in the room, My dinner
326625,Durrants Hotel, Hallways are a bit run down but they are in the process of redecorating and it they will look great in the next couple of months we saw some work being carried out painting etc The rooms themselves are gorgeous as are the bathrooms , Great location near everything but a very quiet street we slept with the windows open Rooms are a good size for London and are nicely decorated We had a great nights sleep Staff really go above and beyond and are very friendly Gorgeous little pub downstairs wood panelling and big comfy chairs 
326626,Durrants Hotel, The reception staff were quite confusing at explaining issues around booking and credit card charges When you book through booking com the hotel does a pre charge which is equivalent to one night When you arrive they then charge you in full for your stay and then take another pre authorisation off you credit card This all seemed unnecessarily complicated and confusing and the reception staff did not explain this well at all Furthermore its been almost a week and they have still not unblock my credit card from the initial pre authorisation The breakfast was also confusing If breakfast is included no one explains how it works There is no buffet but a full menu and you can actually choose as much or little off it as you want but this was not mentioned at all One can feel a little ripped off by this and it might make more sense to just choose a la carte instead , The Durrants Hotel in Marleybone is in an amazing location just behind the Wallace Collection The porter staff were excellent and helped look after us well including assisting with a very tight parking space The room was beautiful and well appointed and the bathrooms in great shape with nice amenities provided within it Overall the hotel was really lovely with just a few snags that should be ironed out Ultimately the location makes it great value for money 
326627,Durrants Hotel, I was ignored for atleast five minutes when I arrived and I could hear a couple having sex in the room above me, Breakfast delivered to room was good and bed comfy
326628,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Staff very helpful room nicely decorated quiet street close to everything Will definitely go back of you like antiques the Wallace Collection museum across the road is a must 
326629,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, I ve stopped at the Durrants before and had a smaller room but this time had a room on the ground floor and it was big and really well laid out The breakfast was as nice as I remember so all in all a really nice stay 
326630,Durrants Hotel, slightly tired rooms and a tea making machine that I couldn t fathom out and looked like a toaster and no biscuits , General feel of the hotel and staff was comfortable
326631,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, We were given a gorgeous big room that was total surprise because we ve stayed there before and were expecting a small room like before which would also have been fine but this was real treat Very good breakfast We were there for our 30th anniversary but the hotel did not know that so this was just good luck 
326632,Durrants Hotel, Some of the rooms are yet to be refurbished but the refurbishment programme is ongoing , The location is excellent for W1 The staff are very personable and make every effort to make your stay a good experience The on site car park is an advantage but only for a small medium car 
326633,Durrants Hotel, No AC in the room so had to sleep with windows open Unfortunate that it was one of the hottest days of the year , Really nice place character building but with a modern feel inside the room Attentive helpful staff Good location around 10 minutes walk from Bond Street underground station 
326634,Durrants Hotel, Due to a mistake of the reception I was invoiced in a different currency and was charged a commission for the operation requested to cancel the operation and refund the amount The amount was refunded but I still had to pay high commissions due to the FX differences When asked for a refund because it was a mistake from the hotel reception they denied to support me Ended up paying 10 more due to their billing mistake,No Positive
326635,Durrants Hotel, Nothing, Loved the whole experience a lovely traditional old hotel with old fashioned values The staff couldn t have been more helpful the breakfast was excellent and I would definitely like to stay there again
326636,Durrants Hotel, Slightly weird restaurant staff operation They are trying but not sophisticated and sometimes a bit incompetent Also housekeeping staff Everyone suffers from a lack of training A slight tapping noise in the air vent all night in my room The room worked for me alone a double room but would have been impossible for two of us No convenient places to put things , Excellent location for cafes and high end shops relatively quiet neighborhood Good museum and beautiful church next door A bit of a walk to nearest underground Hotel lovely but rooms are tiny and slightly drab but very functional and comfortable Really nice all round 
326637,Durrants Hotel, The room was a bit tired looking the wallpaper was starting to come away from the walls Tea and coffee facilities would have been nice , Close to Hyde Park where we wanted to be Rooms were very clean Staff were very friendly Room was very quiet 
326638,Durrants Hotel, Not all rooms have renovated bathrooms We checked in and were assigned a room where the air conditioning was out of order The Front Desk apparently knew about this beforehand and nonetheless assigned this room to us Fortunately we checked the A C before unpacking We were given two options stay in the room and count on the A C being fixed once the technicial arrived at the hotel premises on a Saturday afternoon or move to another room Problem was solved because we agreed to move to this other room which was not the same category as the one we booked We got the older bathroom and twin beds instead of the queen size However the rate was unchanged , A traditional hotel in an elegant but yet lively neighborhood Shops and good restaurants within a two block radius Breakfast is a la carte so make sure it s included in your rate Ours was and we delighted ourselves with a wonderful belgium waffles with fresh berries on Sunday morning served by a very friendly staff 
326639,Durrants Hotel, Nothing we usually stay here when in London and it never seems to vary We only stayed on night this time but will return , Durrants is perfectly located in central London It is a unique hotel with cosy antique filled public rooms starched table clothes and attentive but not oppressively so staff It is a delightful change from the standard branded hotels The bedroom was a good size and the bathroom clean and well stocked with toiletries The management are discreetly present so when for example the barman was busy a manager appeared as if from nowhere to ensure no one was left waiting Service is always just the right balance of friendly but not familiar The hotel is near the Wallace collection and within walking distance of many restaurants 
326640,Durrants Hotel, 4 parking places for the whole hotel No mini bar in room No coffee tea in room Dirty bed on arrival we had to ask for the linen to be changed Non functional toilet the personnel tried but was not fixed eventually as compromise they did not charge us for parking 36 on site For a double room price tag 261 we booked it in advance for 155 the quality price equals rubbish , Central location Willing to help personnel
326641,Durrants Hotel, Bedroom was tired with dated furniture and decor No plugs by the bed needed an extension cable for a sleep apnoea pump but meant lead trailing dangerously across the room Price was very high for these issues, Public areas are well appointed as you would expect from a hotel like this The beds are really comfortable The staff are friendly
326642,Durrants Hotel, The head manager at the breakfast room was so ride that we and the couple waiting in front of us decided to have our breakfast in a nearby bakery instalead of the hotel,No Positive
326643,Durrants Hotel, Nothing, Comfortable room with pleasant mews aspect Good breakfast served fresh from the kitchen rather than a self service bar Excellent location with plenty of restaurants to choose from and good independent shops 
326644,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast Normally excellent service but this time they were just too slow but a bit stressy at the same time I had prepaid breakfast but didn t order a cooked breakfast because it took forever just to get my cereal and I just didn t have time to wait There was only one person on reception at checkout at prime check out time so I didn t have the chance to complain or ask for a refund it was an expensive cup of tea and bowl of cereal , Booked a single room because of high prices in London it was fine I ve stayed at Durrants before friendly reception and concierge staff clean rooms in good condition Great location for Oxford Street Hyde Park Regent Street can walk everywhere from there 
326645,Durrants Hotel, the rooms were small the hotel is very old and the floor wasn t straight having a very obvious inclination the beds we switched rooms and we tried two beds were way too soft , good location for the shopping area pretty clean decently friendly staff 
326646,Durrants Hotel, No tea coffee in the room and expensive room service, great location and beautiful traditional old style accommodation very old building with lots of corridors and rooms
326647,Durrants Hotel, most London rooms are small and this was above average for a single room my main gripe was the air con wasn t working and it was a hot night with warm water pipes running through the room that said it wasn t unbearable night porter did his best to fix the problem to no avail , Friendly knowledgeable staff very atmospheric olde world boutique hotel in a great location
326648,Durrants Hotel, Limited onsite parking which has a height restriction Closest car park is just round the corner but isn t ideal for parking overnight , The staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble Great location within walking distance of Oxford Street 
326649,Durrants Hotel, Room a little shabby One of the blinds was broken Could have done with a mirror on the dressing table for the hair dryer , Location excellent Wallace museum opposite well worth a visit Breakfast lovely diverse and freshly prepared to order All staff very attentive 
326650,Durrants Hotel, We were served breakfast by two waiters who spoke rather patchy English They seemed a little unfamiliar with the natural progression of an English breakfast Toast and jam arrived with the scrambled eggs We found it quite funny though , Really quaint and cosy 
326651,Durrants Hotel, Staff at check in could have been friendlier Rather dismissive and cold For the price probably better hotels in the local , Character of the hotel was impressive Concierge was great Location good 
326652,Durrants Hotel, There were no drawers for clothes in my 2 rooms The closet had hanging space but not much , The hotel has an authentic old world charm that makes the experience of staying in London all the more interesting The location is excellent just a short walk to Oxford Street or Marylebone High Street for shopping and dining The staff are helpful and attentive and the rooms are comfortable 
326653,Durrants Hotel, The day i got in had i booked directly with the hotel my rate would have been 155 I paid via booking com 220 n 258 for following day So i was really very dissatisfied that i did not get the best rate through booking com how can you make sure this doesn t happen to future bookings Now i am unsure i should use your services Secondly at that rate i expected at least a kettle in the room with tea bags and cups I had to call up for one Thirdly one part of the cupboard was very dusty and obviously missed every time it was vacumned and cleaned I didn t bother telling the staff since it would mean me waiting for them to come up , I love the warm interiors and the concierge guys 
326654,Durrants Hotel, The bathroom was pretty poor room 318 for the overall standard of the accommodation Desperately needs and update Crackled tiles horrid grouting missing mastic Rubbish shower head Worse than an average Travel Lodge , Great location and excellent breakfast Friendly staff lovely lobby and cocktail bar Bed was comfy and the room was comfortable if a little dated 
326655,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast was like Fawlty Towers While I was there nobody including me got what they ordered Free comedy in the morning but after a while it stops being funny , Good location Comfortable room 
326656,Durrants Hotel, The TV in room emits a bright standby light and because of tv position the light shines directly in your face as you sleep Price for room quite high, Staff lovely
326657,Durrants Hotel, Would have liked tea coffee facilities in room Took a long time to get coffee when we arrived back from theatre , An overall lovely experience Fab quaint hotel in excellent location Staff were super helpful and friendly 
326658,Durrants Hotel, There is nothing I don t like about the Durrants Hotel , I always stay at this hotel when I visit London It has retained its very charming elegant and British culture for the past 40 years of my life and is not likely to change And yet as an American I feel very comfortable there perhaps because I lived in London for awhile and when visit London I crave the British experience 
326659,Durrants Hotel, We had not chosen the smallest category of available room but the room we were given was still cramped for a double even by London standards I can t imagine what the smaller ones would be like The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows unsupportive The hot water flow was inadequate to run a bath and very noisy whilst attempting to do so Some aspects of the common areas are quaint and cosy and this might be a considered style choice on the part of the owners The same cannot be credibly argued in the case of the bedrooms if ours was representative of the hotel as a whole tired dated and indicative of lack of investment would be a fairer assessment , The location was good and the room was nice and quiet The breakfast choice was pleasing and our food was well cooked and presented Some of the sitting rooms and bars in the common areas have a cosy old world quality 
326660,Durrants Hotel, I thought the room was past its sell by date turn down service made the bed look crumpled and unmade no tea coffee facilities in the room so had to pay 4 50 plus a tip every time I wanted a drink in my room, Location and nice bar area
326661,Durrants Hotel, I find the bar prices extremely expensive compared to other establishments , When travelling alone I find it homely welcoming and a very convenient location for my needs 
326662,Durrants Hotel, The front door is locked all night and requires the services of the night porter to open it , This hotel is fairly central and great for Mayfair but as are all hotels in the area quite expensive 
326663,Durrants Hotel, The only slight issue that spoiled our stay a little this time was that the air conditioning hadn t been turned on in the hotel and it was a very warm spring day Our bedroom was on the front of the hotel in full glorious sunlight and it was far too warm This meant getting ready for our evening out and our night s sleep was uncomfortable , We always stay at Durrants it s a super comfy quintessentially English independent hotel and we love it Staff are lovely and the location is great 
326664,Durrants Hotel, A better shower , Beautiful older hotel in an excellent location The staff were friendly and helpful Because of the age of the building the bedroom was quite small the bathroom was larger but the shower and bath difficult for older guests Very formal dining room for evening meals but excellent food Attractive breakfast room but soft classical music would have improved the ambience for me 
326665,Durrants Hotel, Staff rude on arrival the main door was locked due to renovations had to enter through tiny bar door greeted by rude eastern European woman who said our credit card was declined even though we made arrangements for cash prior also took a hundred pound cash deposit which was a bit unusual especially since the tiny room we stayed in was 210 per night excluding breakfast Bell boys also rude tried to tell me I couldn t collect deposit until 7 Sunday morning even though we informed staff our flight was at 7 so needed it earlier After a mix up at breakfast which the employee tried to charge 52 pounds for two sausages and 1 slice of toast we had to settle on 27 pound which was ludicrous basically 12 pound for a pork sausage Shower was blowing hot and cold difficult to wash windows paper thin could hear everything even though on second floor room 210 Wifi drops in and out only redeeming features are location and one of the guys working there never caught his name but stocky bald and middle aged very friendly and helpful , Room clean good channel selection 
326666,Durrants Hotel, I last stayed here about six years ago and was looking forward to my visit There were however disappointments The toilet seat was broken as was the towel heater no water or power Shower water was at best tepid Incomprehensively for a four star hotel there were no refreshments in the room no kettle tea or coffee When I raised this with a member of staff my query was brushed off in a very arrogant way I assume that the idea is to force guests to use the rather expensive room service However when I tried to do this there was no reply despite several attempts so I stayed thirsty I was told that my laundry could not be brought to my room but that I would have to collect it this despite several completely unoccupied members of staff standing idly in the ground floor corridors Furniture and carpets are becoming shabby The hotel no longer merits its four star ranking , The atmosphere of Durrants is a reminder of a long vanished unhurried calmer age it still has something of the air of what one imagines hotels in pre independence India must have been like That said it has deteriorated since my last stay 
326667,Durrants Hotel, no complaints, The hotel has a wonderful old world atmosphere that is calm and reassuring and makes you feel you are really in Britain It also has an excellent location in an attractive village like neighborhood with many excellent and interesting restaurants 
326668,Durrants Hotel, Only a small quibble and this will sound very ungrateful because I booked a single room at the last minute I was given an upgrade to a double room which was lovely but a little old fashioned and a wee bit tired Though very comfy I prefer the refurbished Classic Room but it was sweet and generous of the hotel to give me this upgrade Thank you , Very nice as always I have visited the hotel on several occasions now It has an old fashioned charm is very pretty and the staff are invariably professional and helpful Super location just behind The Wallace Collection and next to Marylebone High Street with lots of trendy boutiques and fabulous places to eat I just love this place 
326669,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, The service of kitchen was appalling We had a meal in the evening and waited a very long time for a very mediocre meal Food was lukewarm and soup tasted watered down without flavour waiting staff was friendly but untrained One redeeming feature was good dessert Similar issues at breakfast waited 20 minutes for poached eggs 
326670,Durrants Hotel, Room service made a problem with my delivery but fixed it within 10 minutes after my call to the concierge No slippers available which I prefer when a hotelroom has carpet , The style of the hotel is lovely the service is very good staff polite 
326671,Durrants Hotel, Aircon wasn t working and window only opened a crack so the room was stuffy Pillows were flat and uncomfortable Can t believe any hotels still have sheets and blankets instead of a duvet but this one does , Fantastic location Staff fixed a broken window blind when I asked Bathroom was refurbished clean and had good lighting 
326672,Durrants Hotel, hallways and rooms very tired no coffee tea fridge room refreshments noisy lift very slow Staff acceptable but not particularly helpful , location
326673,Durrants Hotel, nothing, lovely boutique hotel in prime central London location with many good restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance with excellent restaurant bar and well executed public rooms 
326674,Durrants Hotel, No duvet just one sheet and one blanket so fussy bedding and not warm enough And no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which is a nono for me I need a coffee as soon as I open my eyes Next time I ll bring a kettle and ask for extra blankets , A charming and wonderfully old fashioned hotel in a great location Love the decor downstairs although the rooms are a bit dated Good bathroom and comfy bed and pillows But the best bit was breakfast Gorgeous old fashioned restaurant and fab food my husband had a fantastic full English and I had the best Eggs Benedict I ve ever tasted 
326675,Durrants Hotel, The bathroom shower didn t work very well , I have been staying in this hotel for many years and I appreciate the comfort of the bedroom very cosy and nicely decorated The staff is very friendly and helpful The Bar downstairs is very cosy and welcoming The Head Porter Clive is very good 
326676,Durrants Hotel, Room in need of re decoration and bathroom desperately requires a new toilet loo roll holder No tea making facilities in room , Gorgeous hotel in wonderful location 
326677,Durrants Hotel, Heating in the room not good enough The bathroom clean and nice but cold No heating , The location is perfect The hotel is old fashioned You can sit and relax in nice rooms and a friendly staff serves you tea 
326678,Durrants Hotel, One or two draught beers in the bar would be appreciated , The location is perfect for shopping theatre dining Very quiet at night The staff are very freindly and can arrange tickets and taxis for you We have been coming to Durrant s for many years now and it always seems to get better Hot tip the Cafe on the Corner 50 metres from the Hotel does full english great coffee and cakes and is inexpensive 
326679,Durrants Hotel, We were woken in the night and couldn t sleep due to noise like a heavy dripping sound from overhead pipes When my husband went to Reception at 3am the night staff immediately gave us keys to another room which was appreciated although still inconvenient Reception halved our room rate which was very good of them and much appreciated We took tea in a lounge area on Saturday afternoon which was relaxing and if good quality however staff appeared flustered and to not be well managed on that day , This hotel is a great location if you want Baker Street and Marylebone attractions It is traditional in decor and is a maze of corridors and rooms The bars were good and the staff were welcoming 
326680,Durrants Hotel, Toiletries in bathroom very meagre One small 10 ml shower gel and a shampoo If 2 people are staying in room and you haven t brought your own shampoo conditioner etc they didn t supply enough I know you can prob phone housekeeping for more but if your in a rush that s an inconvenience,No Positive
326681,Durrants Hotel, The decoration of the bedrooms and bathrooms is tired and needs updating as does the TV The remote control was useless , Bar really welcoming and good service 
326682,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Great location amazing staff especially Francesca and Federico but all staff courteous and can t do enough for you Restaurant food excellent Great rooms lovely ambience I will be back yet again 
326683,Durrants Hotel, No hot drinks facilities in the room Very unusual and not helpful when I had a lot of work to do Room size doesn t compare too well with competitors but absolutely fine for one night , Good location friendly staff good cleanliness
326684,Durrants Hotel, Nothing Back next week , Loved the ambience small public rooms lovely quiet bedroom and great bathroom great breakfast in bed the fabulous staff and fire in the bar 
326685,Durrants Hotel, bathroom was cold because there is no heating and no kettle , It s my third stay as it is a very quaint hotel with beautiful old furniture quiet room 
326686,Durrants Hotel, The room had insufficient and poorly placed electrical sockets The supply of bath products was a bit miserly The noise from the room above us was a bit of a drag , This hotel has some charm and class It is neither a bland and beige business hotel nor an over trendified boutique pad The small bar is pleasant embellished by dandy exquisites from Monocle on our visit Small room and tiny bath but good value 
326687,Durrants Hotel, Lack of heating in bathroom a towel rail that didn t really work No duvet sheets and blanket seems a dated thing to use No tea coffee facilities in the room An expensive stay with no breakfast , Not a lot
326688,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, I was only there overnight with an early morning departure so unable to enjoy all the hotel had to offer The bar with a real log fire was delightful 
326689,Durrants Hotel, Very outdated rooms on certain floors Also it s quite a maze to find your way around Stayed here before and had a lovely updated room but not this time, Location and lovely ambience
326690,Durrants Hotel, Despite having Do not disturb room was cleaned in the scheme of things this is not such a big deal Although the bar was a lovely spot to unwind the drinks were expensive , The overall charm and style of the property was very good and in keeping with a Marylebone location Location was brilliant as it was just off the High Street Staff were friendly and attentive 
326691,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Old England charm the rooms are on the small side but functional clean and comfortable There are a number of cozy living areas in the hotel that give an at home feel to the place Cocktails in the evening in front of the fireplace at the George Bar were nice breakfast and tea were good but not on the cheap side Location is optimum very central and practical yet the street itself is very quiet We ll definitively be coming back on our next London trip 
326692,Durrants Hotel, Quite pricey for a night but its a beautiful hotel and certainly worth it , We had a great stay at this hotel Everything was very traditional with a lovely bar and lounge to relax in Rooms were comfy and clean I d highly recommend it 
326693,Durrants Hotel, We would love to be able to make tea coffee in our room , The location in Marylebone is the best avoiding big hotels and huge tourist spots while being practically central The hotel has low key quiet charm which is perfect for London 
326694,Durrants Hotel, Bed covers are old and dated with stains Although there was a complementary water when I asked for more I was charged for it without telling me And despite my long stay Staff did not care to rectify the problem or apologize , It s very close to everything

326697,Durrants Hotel, Both the hotel AND booking com need to be more transparent about the status of car parking available at this hotel Availability is very low 3 spaces in the mews to the rear and cannot be reserved If travelling to the hotel by car expect to spend some time searching local side streets for on street parking the majority of which is for permit holders only If I d known this at the time of booking I don t know if I would have selected Durrants for our stay Not a criticism of the hotel per se Booking com need to be clearer about whether or not their bookings include breakfast By which I mean explicitly state the booking does not include it To just have no reference to it is not good enough Sadly it s becoming more common for hotels to not include breakfast as standard and we knew to check with the hotel on our day of arrival and in the case of this location I highly recommend Bill s on Baker St as an alternative for breakfast And to Durrants instruct your cleaners to be more attentive when cleaning your bathrooms I had to manually descale the shower head in order for it to work properly , Location is excellent near both Oxford St and Baker St The hotel internally and externally is very well presented The room was lovely and a good size The staff are very friendly The afternoon tea is great

326701,Durrants Hotel, The room was the smallest we have ever stayed in We have been traveling for many years and always stay in 4 5 star hotels This was by far the worst value for money We paid 175 for a room where you had to have your bag on the floor beside the bed There was a very small table a TV which didn t work the heating was broken as was the air con unit There is no tea or coffee and the bathroom flooded I don t like to moan and tolerate many issues with hotels but this was not good value and I think I would have begrudged 100 apart from the location Also be aware of extortionate service charges I went to the bar for two drinks which came to 15 and was charge 3 59 for the privilege , The location is perfect as we know the area well The hotel is clean and comfortable 
326702,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, We loved the location the hotel was lovely Our room was large and beautiful Beds were a little hard but acceptable We would love to have had a coffee pot in the room Overall would go back and recommend it to friends

326705,Durrants Hotel, We were kept waiting 30 minutes for food to arrive the ma tre d was screaming at a poor girl in the kitchen Lola telling her to go home it was awful the door to the kitchen was open and then he went back and started again It was like faulty towers only worse The food finally arrived after we complained about the wait Spoilt our breakfast completely which was a shame as the food was good once it arrived Shambolic ,No Positive
326706,Durrants Hotel, The hotel is not clean I was shown to an extremely small recently refurbished room The bath had not been cleaned as there were human hairs in the tub I complained and the receptionist reluctantly without apology moved me to another larger refurbished room This room was slightly better however I have taken pictures of the bathroom sink which was cracked and the grouting around it very dirty The carpet had large stains in a number of places and the bedcover also had a number of stains on it The walls were also marked Nothing that a good clean would not remove My room was on the third floor facing the front and was really noisy Very difficult to sleep There are no tea making facilities in the room and you are charged an absolute fortune for room service NEVER AGAIN Could not wait to leave I did want to leave as soon as I was shown the rooms but was told that I would still be charged for them Great Customer Service I have stayed in many London Hotels as I am a regular visitor and only chose this hotel for it s location I will stick to my regular hotels in future , The location is excellent

326714,Durrants Hotel, The room was small but very nicely decorated It probably wouldn t suit anyone who likes minimalist d cor , Bed was very comfortable Very traditional hotel we liked the d cor and the location All the staff were very professional and friendly Nothing too much trouble We liked the bar area very atmospheric the whole hotel made such a pleasant change from the usual bland corporate rooms The whole hotel has character We loved having sheets and blankets rather than duvets The hotel is within easy walking distance of Regent s Street New Bond Street and the fantastic Marylebone High Street We would definitely stay again 
326715,Durrants Hotel, Nothing, Everything A typical so british hotel Very quiet rooms The breakfast is simply so good I recommend the smoke salmond And every employee was so professional In few words the hotel to be

326717,Durrants Hotel, The room was so small you could not get out of both sides of the bed There was no tea making facilities only very very expensive drinks in the mini bar bar Over priced breakfast were everyone was unhappy with the very slow and bad service ,No Positive
326718,Durrants Hotel, The hotel frozen my money on the credit card for 7 days this is unacceptable when I arrived and checkin they ask my credit card again and they frozen other 100 pound so when I check out and went to pay because of the money frozen I didn t have enough credit available giving me a lot of trouble glad I had another card that was not business and I paid Another reason of my unsatisfaction is that my first night drunk people staying in the room close by waking me up in the middle of night at 4am by shutting doors and screaming for more than 20 minutes The day after I complained but the hotel didn t do anything in these cases usually good hotel refund you a night or give you a discount Very unprofessional , The place is center and this is the reason because I picked it 
326719,Durrants Hotel, It would have been nice to have an electric kettle in our room , The restaurant was top notch food service and atmosphere very cozy We also enjoyed spending time in the lounge by the fire after dinner This hotel has many lovely nooks and crannies in which to relax and just enjoy the elegant and inviting surroundings We will definitely stay here again 
326720,Durrants Hotel, It would be good to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room As nice as it is to order drinks to be delivered to your room sometimes it is more convenient to just pop the kettle on yourself , A great hotel with traditional service by lovely staff Situated in a very nice area of London 
326721,Durrants Hotel, No kettle drink making facilities fridge There was no duvet instead a bedspread cover was provided This didn t appeal so we didn t use it and the room became cold by 4am , The bed and pillows very comfortable the room quiet and of a reasonable size for its price Plenty of reasonable priced eateries close by Just about within a reasonable walking distance of city centre

326724,Durrants Hotel, No team making facilities in the room and they made mistakes each time I ordered rom service I ordered Earl Grey and breakfast tea but only got on of the two on two occasions , Lovely room if not a little tired But I know they have refurbished rooms could also do with fridges in the room we stayed in 
326725,Durrants Hotel, The facilities no water boiler that s not really acceptable in a four star hotel Photos on booking com and the rooms are so very different , Location The concierge team and the reception are very friendly and helpful

326728,Durrants Hotel, poor welcome at reception on arrival Other staff great During afternoon very noisy generator or fan outside the window causing vibrations but this stopped at night , Breakfast service menu choices and quality Perfect location Historic building staircase details Comfortable bed good bathroom 
326729,Durrants Hotel, Saying that the front desk staff was rude would be too generous Did not want to accept my UK driving licence as a piece of ID because I was a foreigner I explained that being a foreigner who lives in the UK when I travel by train within the UK I don t carry my passport but she still refused to accept it My room didn t lock from the inside chain was broken and it had obviously been pried open at some point before my stay because there were clear marks on the door of having forced it open Outdated rooms still using heavy bulky keys rather than access cards wallpaper falling off broken tiles in bathroom bedspreads and blankets instead of duvets lack of individual heating controls room was too hot all night bathroom window could not be closed The mattress was not particularly comfortable Definitely not worth the price In a city like London where it s quite easy to move around using public transportation there is no need to put up with rude staff and outdated rooms, Good location for Oxford Street and Soho Good toiletries in room Respectful housekeeping service 
326730,Durrants Hotel, No tea coffee in room Bedspread was too heavy so had to be removed but another lighter blanket would have been good because it wasn t that warm , Very attractive duel aspect room 
326731,Durrants Hotel, Beds could be more comfortable and a choice of a duvet instead of blankets would be good , The staff were helpful and friendly The restaurant was very nice and the food really good Have stayed several times and it doesn t disappoint 
326732,Durrants Hotel, the bedroom was small the bath was impossible to fill with the water flo rate being minimal similarly the shower came out as a drizzle The staff at breakfast were clueless still waiting for orange juice delay in sevice excessive Quality however was excellent,No Positive
326733,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast was very average The guy manning the toaster should be sacked every piece came out burnt The coffee was terrible the bacon was dry , Lovely hotel in an excellent location Good rooms nice bathrooms and helpful staff 
326734,Durrants Hotel, Breakfast only a la Carte and so expensive Be better to offer a fixed price continental or fixed price Full English Then the waiters would not get confused counting every piece of toast ,No Positive
326735,Durrants Hotel, We had arranged for transport to the airport through our airline and when the driver arrived to pick us up the head concierge would not let him use the bathroom and created a slight alteration We consider this unnecessary and inappropriate , It was convenient and met our needs
326736,Durrants Hotel, At least 50 too expensive for what it offered which besides location frankly wasn t very much The hotel is very dated and I don t mean in a quaint way it really could do with a major makeover I paid 155 had no Tea Coffee making facilities no breakfast and a shower that either dribbled or poured depending where the settings were placed I failed to find a setting for spray Overall very disappointed but at least as I left the Hotel and headed for the Underground a came across Bills Caf where I had an excellent breakfast for half the price The Durrant would have expected , It was well located for Baker Street Station 
326737,Durrants Hotel, Problems with the door lock which was well worn small room Although not the hotels fault noisy inebriated guests banging on doors at midnight Was not welcome , Old fashioned charm 
326738,Durrants Hotel, Limited room facilities no electric water kettle no refrigerator Old structure make sounds in the night , The Position is perfect Just several minutes walk from Oxford Street 
326739,Durrants Hotel, The Hotel should be updated regarding its infrastructure not to charge for not having European sockets quick stable Internet to use sensors saving Energy for sensors , The politeness of the personnel the atmosphere of the various Lobbies
326740,Durrants Hotel, Noisy room sullen bar staff had to ask for nibbles with our champagne only one bottle of water each night despite obviously having two people in the room and asking for two bottles , Location breakfast managerial response to complaints
326741,Durrants Hotel, Small room Tired decor and bathroom No plug sockets in convenient places More expensive rooms probably better Bar closed at 12, Comfortable bed
326742,Durrants Hotel, The room I was in 203 was unacceptably bad peeling wallpaper filthy sticky carpet and terrible bathroom with pink 70s lino and awful plumbing no amount of fancy toiletries can cover the awfulness of it No amount of traditionalism can justify the bad quality of the furniture wardrobe door would shut and blocked view of TV from desk Breakfast was overpriced and mediocre quality in old style British dining room all style but no substance Even the discount Booking genius price of 190 was excessive for the terrible quality I wrote directly to the hotel to provide this feedback a week ago but no reply so obviously they don t care about customer service and are in for one shot visitors To be avoided , Friendly staff and decent albeit dusty old world style public areas good location but negatives outweigh the positives 
326743,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Great location for Marylebone High Street and the West End tucked away on a quiet street Went with a group of friends and it was a perfect base for exploring the shops bars and restaurants of this vibrant area 
326744,Durrants Hotel, A little body cream would be great in addition to soap and shampoo in the bathroom , The turndown of the room in the evening The silverware The cosy corners allowing private chat with friends The bar 
326745,Durrants Hotel, The bar man was not so cheery especially when we did not want to put the drinks on the room and the price of a bottle of water and a beer was outrageous just under 9 , The reception staff were friendly and we could check in early which was great 
326746,Durrants Hotel, I cant think of anything bad or lousy of course they could spare a pair of throw away slippers which we always need and a bath robe yes, good little bar good staff good place to be in like return home food always great surrounded by good restaurants too
326747,Durrants Hotel, Kitchen closed early only sandwiches and came cold for 2 nights Floors are not straight need maintenance Breakfast a la carte not buffet, Location and bed only
326748,Durrants Hotel, Parking is very expensive so booked elsewhere to keep the car , The barstaff were truly fantastic making favorite cocktails off the menu staff were helpful and welcoming and WiFi was excellent Location is one of the best in London Couldn t have asked for more lovely place to stay 
326749,Durrants Hotel, i can t think of one thing , Antiques artwork beautiful furnishings and L occitane bathroom goodies Fantastic location and wonderful breakfast 
326750,Durrants Hotel, Poor ventilation very stuffy Poor water pressure shower ineffectual Noisy could hear people in next room Poor signage lift out of action Saturday night and took me 10 mins to locate my room as had to traipse across different landings but no signage for my specific area Hotel bar shut early Saturday night , Great location 
326751,Durrants Hotel, No air conditioning on a very hot night noisy traffic too Room old fashioned and needed a good clean Shower not up to much Would not stay again ever ,No Positive
326752,Durrants Hotel, A hospitality tray would have been nice , Excellent suite with new bathroom fittings Beds are turned down each evening Hotel has a traditional rather clubby feel with numerous public area rooms on the ground floor We used the restaurant one evening and thought the meal was excellent 
326753,Durrants Hotel, A little hot in the bedroom but a fan had been provided , Smashing quaint traditional hotel comfy bed very clean full of character ideally located staff service excellent 
326754,Durrants Hotel, Many things could have been better but there are not relevant so go and enjoy it , Hotel is a bit outdated but if you don t mind it s a good location and the folks working there are great
326755,Durrants Hotel, Unusually no tea or coffee making facilities in room I didn t spot this and wouldn t have booked if I had and over 5 for pot of tea for one extortionate , Good location Room ok 
326756,Durrants Hotel, Tired looking bedrooms Staff ok but not welcoming except for Concierge No A C in rooms All a bit unkempt and scruffy, location of hotel
326757,Durrants Hotel, The room was small and a little tired looking A pot of tea for two was 10 which I think is extortionate even by London prices , Very good sleep and good powerful shower
326758,Durrants Hotel, Had difficulty finding a plug to charge up my phone over night Bathroom was a little tired but everything worked fine good powerful shower a proper bath to sit in as well , A simply delightful hotel with lots of little extra rather old fashioned touches which are lovely for instance silver coffee pot at breakfast with silver cruet set all laid out on clean linen no help yourself it s all brought to you to order Someone to greet you when you come downstairs Great wi fi Nice smell of soap in the bathroom 
326759,Durrants Hotel, Not so good for just relaxing in the small rooms , Stayed at the Durrants before Updated bathrooms are very nice Small but comfortable rooms for sleeping 
326760,Durrants Hotel, The team lacked focus on service I asked for an iron and ironing board would have expected these items to be in a room anyway I was told I couldn t have it overnight and would need to call in the morning embarrassing having to open your door wearing PJ s at 7am No tea or coffee making facilities in the room you could purchase tea and coffee if required There was a house being renovated next door constant banging and drilling we wanted to rest for an hour before heading out again that was impossible The room was very small there was a wet patch on the carpet from the radiator general maintenance was poor Would definitely not go back to this hotel it is no where near worth the money we paid I would have been hugely disappointed had I paid the going rate 750 pound for two nights it wasn t worth the 355 we paid Stayed in a holiday inn express for our third night it was by far the most superior of the two at 60 pound for the night Obviously Durrant hotel have an abundance of regular unsuspecting travellers therefore not expecting this feedback to be worth much to them hope it s worth it to the unsuspecting travellers of the future , Location was very good for shopping 
326761,Durrants Hotel, Would have been happier to have been able to help myself from a buffet breakfast then order if necessary anything cooked My coffee was served in the smallest cup I have ever used for breakfast coffee Even a cappuccino could have been served in a breakfast cup , The beds as ever totally comfy The staff totally friendly polite helpful The food delicious but perhaps a little pricy for breakfast The suite was luxurious and a great bonus for a last minute booking 
326762,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, A very comfortable traditional feeling hotel in a beautiful old characterful building A quiet respectable hotel with a homely feel right in the centre of the busy West End Perfect
326763,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, A well located hotel which ticked all the boxes for me the room was a little dated but on the whole fine I requested a room in a quiet part of the hotel and was allocated a suitable room which was very much appreciated 
326764,Durrants Hotel, The room 215 was old and shabby dark tatty No kettle in the room Room service delivery boy was creepy Way overpriced Room was cold Walls as thin as paper and squeaky floorboards, This is my second stay here What a difference First visit was very noisy as room above reception but that room was very tasteful 
326765,Durrants Hotel, No kettle in the room so you cant have a cuppa when you want instead you need to ring the bell and nowadays we like to have our hot water 24 7 , the bed is solid and not wobbly and give no backache thank you for that The little bar is a good place for afternoon tea and business chat and their diners and breakfast a very traditional taste and great service from porter to chambermaid a lovely hotel in the city like home 
326766,Durrants Hotel, The room was tiny and in need of repair but is what you would expect for the 174 per night I paid However the room is sold on booking com as being normally 500 per night with a 64 discount The hotel confirmed that their best room is only 240 per night and I didn t have one of the best rooms Booking com have confirmed that the 64 discount is based on what the room has sold at on average over previous years If this was true then my 174 per night room has sold on average for 500 a night in previous years If this was true people have been happily paying an extra 326 a night above the advertised price Where are these people when I m selling something , Friendly staff 
326767,Durrants Hotel, The bedrooms are not as good as you would expect for the price Also a little off putting the constant audio of Winston Churchill in the Gentlemens toilets Not sure our German guests appreciated it however took it in good spirits , The downstairs area was very nice in a old gentlemens club sort of way The look of the building from the outside is impressive 
326768,Durrants Hotel, The furniture is old and consumed Old type of room key Sometime is diffuclt to open the room and you need to call some body to open the key The lobby is small due to more meeting rooms The elevator is very old and the room is not sound preventive and You can be disturbed by second room quest , The staff is coopertaive 
326769,Durrants Hotel, The upper floor corridirs and particularky the rooms themselves are very tired and need refurbishment and modernisation , The location is good and the style and appearance externally and on ground floor is lovely 
326770,Durrants Hotel, Very poor value for money 215 for a cramped room which felt more like a bedsit a pathetic shower and a postage stamp view of the sky if you pressed your head up against the window and craned your neck A complete rip off My complaint at check out was met with no more than empathy which is no consolation at all If you get room 107 prepare yourself I will totally discount this hotel on future trips to London ,No Positive
326771,Durrants Hotel, We were given a very small cramped room with a view of a wall from the window It was very claustrophobic and when I asked if we could change rooms I was told that since we had booked through booking com it was to be a standard room but I had actually received an upgrade to that room I hate to think what what we would have got without the upgrade I explained I always book through this means and have never been allocated such a room in this hotel We did get a change of room it was smaller again but you could at least see a bit of sky from that window , I liked the location as we stayed a few times before 
326772,Durrants Hotel, Our first room was quite small bathroom was grubby shower curtain stained bath mat had seen better days The bath was set quite high this wasn t acceptable as I was travelling with a companion who has knee problems I asked to be moved and was shown two rooms that were available neither perfect but better than the first No tea coffee in room Ordered room service efficient but expensive No fridge and only one complimentary bottle of water for two guests , Location of hotel was great Wallace collection just around the corner Fantastic worth a visit Marlybone is a busy high street with numerous places to eat luckily as hotel is quite expensive Staff were very friendly and accommodating We did have one meal in the hotel it was fabulous even though atmosphere was lacking as there was only one other guest eating Old fashioned charm with plenty of comfy places to sit and relax 
326773,Durrants Hotel, When booking on booking com receiving the worst kind of double room No tea and coffee making facilities no bathrobes old aircon smell of cooking in the evening from the back of the hotel sloppy and casual attitude from staff and no free newspaper I understand the rate of almost 190 GBP in the week with no breakfast or anything is considered a cheap rate to the hotel but is that a reason to dump me in one of the smallest double rooms in the back Also to be told allegedly jokingly that the room I was in was a worse room than others Also why would the owners not put tea coffee making facilities in each room After all even their 2 star competitors do this this is the first hotel I have ever come across in the UK to do this its almost like the owners feel that all guests should pay the GBP 4 for a cup of tea and they are living in the past or in the 1950 s Someone needs to let the owners management know that the year is 2016 The hotel owners Manager need a wake up call on what a customer expects as basics from such a hotel Even the staff stated often that they had heard this all before but the owners management just wont listen Shame as I and my company would certainly have given this hotel another chance if I had heard back yesterday after I had called to let them know my feelings Sadly it seems they don t care , Excellent wifi lovely classic building and furnishings good bathroom 
326774,Durrants Hotel, Not one single English staff member none that we met anyway took away the feel of being in the capital city of the U K shame other than that I would just say it was quite pricey Even after paying shy of 200 for the room for one night we then paid for two drinks which were 25 although everywhere in London is expensive a happy hour would be nice , Location was superb right off marylebone high street with gorgeous shops and breakfast places So clean real London feel to it Everything was perfect to look at room was beautiful Maids offered to turn down beds etc
326775,Durrants Hotel, Although I liked the traditional old English ambiance some elements of the hotel were a little tired and in need of a little TLC there was a floor tile in the bathroom that had come loose etc I love a shower that is nice and hot with plenty of water and this was certainly that however even at a low setting it was like having a wash with a power hose the water was high powered and very concentrated but I am being picky now The room was a little on the small side but it s an old building and again I am being a little picky , I loved the look and feel of the hotel The staff were really helpful friendly and attentive It was a pretty quaint and had a pleasant traditional aesthetic The location was good for a night out in the centre of London especially if you wanted to go to the theatre and we got a very good deal on the price The whole hotel was clean and comfortable and the facilities were good 
326776,Durrants Hotel, Arguing about the bill as the system of signing for orders does not work at this hotel Left a bad taste at the end of a nice stay, Great situation and atmosphere with a very traditional maybe dated feel
326777,Durrants Hotel, I d like to have had tea coffee making facility in my room I know that I could ask room service but I wanted to have tea more freely , Excellent location We could easily walk to the shopping areas and many good restaurants Staffs were so friendly and attentive During my stay I requested the receptionist and the concierge a few trivial things and they perfectly did I really thanked them Our room was not so spacious but very cozy and lovely 
326778,Durrants Hotel, No air conditioning a fan The difference between rooms is huge and standard of bathe room facilities The decor very dark compared to previous room , Location
326779,Durrants Hotel, The size of the key and having to leave it with the concierge every time you went out although obviously not a big deal though , Loved the interior and the layout of the hotel really traditional Staff were so friendly and helpful Bedroom was lovely and bathroom was modern with a super nice shower You can t go wrong with this hotel 
326780,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Compact cosy bedroom adjacent to lift however no noise issues and very comfortable bed Friendly and efficient staff Would definitely stay here again 
326781,Durrants Hotel,No Negative, Loved everything about this hotel Staff made us feel that our comfort was paramount Lovely ambience service and location Enjoyed leisurely breakfasts 
326782,Durrants Hotel, Everything else The hot tap coming off in my hand as I started to fill the bath issuing a geyser of water which I managed to stop by screwing the tap back but burning my hand in the process The excessive heat and lack of ventilation in the room and throughout the hotel, Nothing except location
326783,Durrants Hotel, Very poor room No mini bar Non remodelled bathroom Pitch dark if they are selling discounted rooms thru booking com then they should say the low cost is for a poorer room , Because i booked thru nooming com i got a very poor room 
326784,Durrants Hotel, Closet space in the rooms was small Daily upkeep of the room was not great as the fridge was never inspected and cleaned for 10 days Daily supplies of water and toiletries for double occupancy was stingy Had to share soap for days and only got one free bottle of water This was corrected when we asked , The old English style of the lobby area was warm and charming The rooms were well modernized and comfortable Additional rooms in the lobby area provided privacy for afternoon teas and drinks late in the evening Staff friendly and helpful Location is excellent 
326785,Durrants Hotel, The booking com said air con was a fan asked re parking was 200 yds away at 39 pound address on booking com 300 yds out in wrong direction help if give st number , Staff good
326786,Durrants Hotel, Wardrobe space insufficient 1 bar of soap for 2 people 1 bottle of water for 2 people dirty cups not cleared away , comfortable bed traditional setting tea served in silverware location opposite the Wallace collection 
326787,Durrants Hotel, It did state on their website that there were no tea making facilities in the rooms but I really missed that as I need a cup of tea first thing in the morning We ordered tea for two but it was over 10 a bit steep for 4 tea bags 100ml of milk and some hot water I didn t realise they had parking till I phoned beforehand to ask if there was any disabled parking They said I could park in their car park which was handy but when I got there they charged 36 per day We went with it as we were there but there was a car park not far away that was 12 per day They only have four spaces and there was never more than one taken At 36 that s probably why You can t park a high car there as it goes under the building and is on a steep slope with a low roof , Staff were wonderful rooms very comfortable and clean Loved the furnishings and the location was brilliant so close to Oxford Street Very peaceful and great nights sleep 
326788,Durrants Hotel, A bit more water pressure for the shower would be welcome as would tea coffee making facilities in the room , Very nice comfortable hotel in great location with friendly competent staff 
326789,Durrants Hotel, Room extremely hot no air conditioning so opened window and had staff smoking and talking outside into the early hours of the morning Small uncomfortable bed supposedly a double but really not big enough for two people Tired dated bathroom , Receptionist pleasant No other positives to report
