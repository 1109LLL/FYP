440791,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Although the building looks majestic on the outside the inner hallways on the higher floors could use some renovation old carpets walls and ceilings need a freshen up The wooden floors expecially in the hallways are quite squeaky Our room was in decent shape but had no airconditioning a fan was provided though We stayed during a 30 degree celcius period so the room was rather warm and hard to ventilate because of the small single window , Excellent location with spectacular view over the city provided your room is on the backside of the building Local bus to the city stops right in front of the hotel Ample free outdoor parking on the hotel site Friendly staff Clean updated bathroom with good shower Good beds Good wifi Price performance good 
440792,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien,No Negative, Nice atmosphere in the castle I cannot say anything wrong for the price I paid It is not a top level hotel like it could be in such a building like this but absolutely meets the 4 stars criterias Out of the town so it is a very calm area Very good breakfast 
440793,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The food in the restaurant was very poor Luke warm and looked like it was reheated and not cooked fresh The salad was not crisp and fresh also When I said this to a waiter he told me it was due to the salad dressing on it We stayed 3 nights but only ate in the restaurant on one night It was difficult to get bar service also I stood at the bar one evening and was ignored while the barman continued to cut lemons for a while He came eventually but seemed annoyed to be disturbed , Beautiful building with amazing panoramic views of Vienna and access to forest walks Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful Nice breakfast Lovely bedroom too 
440794,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Just one small window in standard room is claustrophobic Bathroom is of size I would expect in small ship cabin , View on Vienna is spectacular Breakfast outside is very nice 
440795,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Vienna is not the easiest city to navigate by car especially the Vienna Woods However this was our 3rd visit to Vienna and we were seeking something different Beware also of driving to other parts of the Wienerwald since it is not easy But then again this is Vienna , We did not eat breakfast here but at Ottakring The staff were very helpful Yes the bed is up the stairs in one s room but considered that part of our experience A night light is located at the top step as a reminder The bus stop is just outside the gate and the driver kindly allowed us to ride for free to Ottakring to buy our tickets Therefore the access to the Centrum is very quick and easy From the back of the schloss one has a beautiful view of Vienna 
440796,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The rooms get very hot during summer I m not too complicated in this respect but still had problems sleeping at night The AC is poor , The view of Vienna is very nice 
440797,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The standard rooms that we got had very small windows which the property s description conveniently doesn t show on the site so avoid rooms from the second floor if possible since all of them are with windows like in the attached image Besides this the whole 2nd story floor squeaks both in the hallway and in the rooms Overall the whole refurbishment that was done to the hotel seems on the cheap side In room bar was empty you need to actually ask for a refill at the reception It doesn t seem like a 4 star hotel except for the breakfast I am really wondering how when it received it s 4 star rating , Breakfast is good and is served on a terrace with a wonderful view over Vienna The location is also good if you like being in an area far from the city s busy streets Parking is big enough even if the hotel is crowded we managed to find a place at any hour we returned from the city 
440798,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien,No Negative, fantastic location if you want to stay outside Vienna however getting to the city center is rather time consuming beautiful surroundings great food and comfortable facilities
440799,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The room was rather small corridors are long , The hotel is a historic building on a scenic location overviewing Vienna Easily accessible by car Excellent breakfast 
440800,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Seems to be a bit understaffed at the front desk When 3 4 people are waiting for 5 minutes to check in or simply ask a question that s when a hotel manager should be adding at least another person Hotel grounds garden forest and pathways could be better cared for The area is gold as location but not enough highlighted Hotel needs a paint job and internal upgrades to make it look as it should considering the location and the amazing view it provides from the hills covering Vienna see my photos from our room , When we arrived at the hotel it was already dinner time so after we checked in and brought our luggage to the room we came downstairs and enjoyed the hotel s cuisine Vienner schnitzel was of course part of the menu The staff is very polite and always smiling The hotel location staff and especially the restaurant meets expectations but it could be so much better if the building and the surrounding grounds were better cared for 
440801,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Slightly chaotic breakfast arrangements though the breakfast itself was excellent I was not asked whether I wanted coffee every morning for instance so I wasn t clear what the system was , Excellent staff Given the location outside Vienna the late opening of the restaurant was very helpful 
440802,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Deco of the room is a bit of outdated but I like the bed on top of the shower room as in one room space , Being on top of the hill with this Baroque style is really breathtaking feeling to see the city through bedroom window from restaurant balcony and from public toilet maybe 
440803,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Furniture is a bit worn out will need replacement soon at least in the room where we stay Duvets were too hot for the room temperature bed could have been one big bed not two small beds put together , Location is really good excellent view on Vienna WIFI was ok it is free and works good Breakfast was ok tasty fresh Personnel on the reception friendly and willing to help I have no other contact with stuff Clean bathroom Room was a good solution how to turn small room with high ceiling into something useful for hotel room Despite the fact that it is far from city centre it is easily accessible by public transport and you can buy ticket at the reception 
440804,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The building in general is in need of renovations but nothing to bring discomfort The location is far from downtown but there is good connection with bus just in front of the hotel and then you pick up the metro , The location at the suburbs is nice and quiet The building is huge like a mansion as shown in the pictures The room had a nice feeling of old season and almost luxurious somehow Safe location and parking 
440805,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, It was my birthday during the stay and I did not get any kind note or complimentary trivial gift from the hotel staff management It is nice when service in hotel has this on their mind a chocolate bar a bottle of house wine a flower a note It is a matter of kindness and not about the value of present I also didn t like far from nice and polite staff at breakfast firstly I was not told at the reception that I need to make a reservation for table for breakfast this never happened in any hotel I visited before in my life To my surprise I had to wait for a table with kids one gentle woman saw what happened and offered her table This is really something I would not expect from a 4 or 3 star rated hotel in Austria ,No Positive
440806,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, There was no bench around the hotel so guests can stay and admire the view the road to the hotel is quite bumpy it s not so pleasant to drive the car Also the distance to the city center is big enough The elevator was a bit old and slow , Very nice view from the room very clean room comfortable bed modern bathroom friendly staff no problem with parking places fresh air because of the forest around the hotel quiet place The interior of the hotel is very interesting just like a palace 
440807,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The bathroom was smelling very bedly We request to do something but the staff opend only the window and this was it If we came back it was very cold in the room but nothing changed , Breakfast in the wintergarden Bus Stadion in front of the hotel 
440808,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, We couldn t catch any WiFi signal because of the location of our room The breakfast is not included in the price and it is really expensive , The hotel castle as a whole is amazing The room was really comfortable and calm The location is perfect 
440809,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Although from the outside the hotel looks beautiful the room was poorly decorated with stains on the wall Also we did not appreciate at all the clean but very smelly bathroom Finally for such a hotel I think that the staff should be better with their English ,No Positive
440810,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, only one person at the reception desk so because of other customer s reservation problem we had to wait almost 15mins for check in it is not good in 4 hotel do not buy public transport tickets in the reception they charge extra Euros 7 Euro extra for 2days ticket for that but they can tell you where to buy in normal official price, comfortable and clean room with nice bathroom and hot shower very nice and helpful staff very good breakfast beautiful place We were very happy to stay in this hotel 
440811,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien,No Negative, Nice architecture the rooms were very tall View from the room is realy impresive Nice personnel Right near the hotel there is a Christmas Market at least during December 
440812,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, We had problems with a rooftop window it wasn t closed and it was broken and it was snowing and we had a bad wind so in the room was a horrible sound and cold they fixit after 2 nights It s more a 3 star hotel no igenic kit cream or slippers , The location of the hotel is nice we had a Christmas market at the hotel this was lovely

440814,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien,No Negative, The pillows were fantastic The house so stunning beautiful It is a bit outside but you can reach the city center easily by bus about 15 minutes At night take a taxi which is around 17 EUR 
440815,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, A little bit far away from the city even considering that there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel an own car is fully recmomended , Nice place and nice environment 
440816,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Not a big deal but if not careful water can penetrate behind moving glass shower door For perfection minor reception uplift would improve general feeling , First time in Vienna I think that we picked the perfect hotel The style of the hotel just continues the overall feeling that you get in this museum city Having a parking in Vienna really comes in handy and the city is not far away Wifi was super very clean room good shower floor heating in the bath stylish art in the lobby nice view from the back of the hotel Overall very nice experiance
440817,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Very small bathroom though surprisingly there was room for everything so that is not a disadvantage in the end , Very enjoyable breakfasts friendly staff the hotel has great surroundings park and is situated on a hill overlooking almost the whole city The view from the outside terrace is outstanding Comfy beds and the bed linens were so soft There is a pillow menu so you can choose what is best for you 
440818,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Heating schould improve during nights I think feel was 20 degrees because of radiators you can not increase by yourself Of course if possible bacause high ceiling in room, Location on hill nearby park Only 10 min by car from downtown old structure partly refurbished new bathroom We feel very well good feeling to stay in building more than 200years old not so fancy but warm and great value for money
440819,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The room was heated to appr 25 Celsius degrees October and was hard to cool down on the loft comfort room Can be warm as there is no air cons in the summer The stairs are noisy in the comfort room , Great value for money place If you like staying away from the crowd and rather be close to the nature this is your place Do not expect luxury environment and you will be truly satisfied The carpets might be shabby here and there some catering tools might be left on the corridor but these are not the important things The walls are thick no noise from the neighburing rooms can filter through The beds are big and comfortable The bathroom is clean and modernly refurbished The view to Wien is beautiful The breakfast is as good as it can be without being luxury no fish or seafood for example The front desk guys are really kind and helpful All in all I would take it again And do not miss Villa Aurora just round the corner for lunch worday lunch menu for EUR 10 or dinner I am personally amazed by the spirit if the place Nothing but good food and wonderful service in a timelessly pure environment 
440820,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Saturday s evening social events disturb us because they took place behind the door of our room and the lounges adjacent to our room event lasted until 2 am it was disrespectful to us the hotel staff had to accommodate us elsewhere when we were more nights insufficient parking although it seems to be impossible very small bathroom, super bed excellent food and service in the restaurant great breakfast great views to Vienna from the castle park
440821,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, This place is about 20 minutes from downtown by car Worth the drive in my opinion , The building is really nice old but nicely restored and maintained lots of character lots of Viennese character Rooms are large and very quiet with recently redone baths and great views Breakfast is quite good and the breakfast room itself makes it even better Good value too 
440822,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Expensive Not very modern neighter classical just a mix of both without a clear identity , Excellent position very easy to reach the city center by bus subway or taxi Very beautiful park around the property and a nice history of the building Excellent breakfast 
440823,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The hotel appears to have a high turnover of one night coach visitors during the summer so breakfast check in and elevators can be overloaded on occasion , Staff very friendly Plenty of parking Situated in a park Limited dinner menu but excellent food Situated away from the city so you need a car or use the bus outside the hotel This is an old building but try the suite on the top floor with a view of thecity 
440824,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, A small bathroom noisy floor you hear steps on a wooden floor under the carpet 8 km from city centre , Free parking beautiful old building friendly and helpful personel good wifi connection great view from the hill 
440825,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, No Aircon During the September heatwave the split level rooms were a disaster The upper sleeping room was like an oven all night No obvious connection to public transport , Delicious breakfast as it should be for 16 euros Grand and splendid if fading building and setting 
440826,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The staff of the restaurant is not smiling at all they are not trying to understand the next wish of the guest and they behave like they are underpaid , The view of Vienna is impressive 
440827,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Only weather one of the days was with heavy rain , Very friendly and helpful staff clean room comfortable and the idea with bed on superior floor add design value good breakfast and good food at restaurant I like the architecture stiles with all details we can feel how it was to live in a big palace one hundred years ago Very easy to reach the center using the bus station is near gateway of hotel or by car The view is EXCEPTIONAL from room and from restaurant terrace we feel that all city is at our feet Worth all the money and for sure we will come again 
440828,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, However a bit far outside the city Must have a car or take the bus 15 25m to center Bath and amenities nice High ceilings required a large staircase up to the bed but I am sure it was necessary in order to work rooms , Great views and good service
440829,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Nothing, What is not to like about staying in a duplex suite that is categorized as a comfort room in a 19th century castle overlooking Vienna Friendly staff all the necessary amenities free parking at night so quiet that one can sleep with the window open The downside to all this is that you are dependent on either a taxi service or your own vehicle but that is not really a concern but a logistical planning object Having spent over half the working year every year for the last 10 living in hotels around the world in all categories in 4 and 5 stars over 1000 nights in total I will claim the following 2 points 1 I am an expert in staying in hotels 2 This has to rank amongst my all time favourites One of the best sleep periods that I have had 
440830,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Equipment is very old memories of old times , Very nice historical building Staff wonderful and helpful Parking free on the site of the castle Spectacular views from the terrace Vienna experience otherwise 
440831,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Didn t know the hotel renovation was on going It was scary when we were little late at checked in the hotel Hope it is finished now Old style room key made me confused how to open and close the door , Room was enough for my family A room for parents and the connected room for my son Such a wonderful arrangement for us Free and enough parking space 
440832,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, A maisonette bedroom is not comfort to some and should therefore not be called as such as it may be difficult for some to get to the bedroom Bathroom smelt rather badly of sewerage Bathroom is on the small side Room is advertised with 50m2 but is rather small due to the small levels , Location was incredible rooms are unsual Breakfast is opulent and nothing missing 
440833,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, We had a 2 story room and the stairs were making noise wood cracking noise Not the cheapest option given the distance from the city center , Breakfast is great and is a must if you stay here You can choose from a large variety of dishes Staff is kind and speaks English The view of the city from the backyard or from the terrace is really nice Transportation to the subway station is just in front of the hotel Free parking for clients is also a nice thing to have

440835,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Food choice limited restaurant more popular as cafe for pastries with locals Hotel under going renovation which we weren t told about so scaffolding around front entrance No bar despite bar lounge being mentioned on Web site and restaurant service stops at 11pm , Location excellent views of city and superb public transport right to door Room lovely 
440836,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, the entrance was hidden behind a reconstruction curtain had to walk around twice to see it there was no clear sign although the foyer is shiny and palace like the rooms are on the contrary a bit unpleasant Old materials bad design looks as if only the bathroom has been renovated in the last 20 years This is often the case in city hotels in Austria The room does not fit a 4 star hotel palace , parking location if you have your own car view bathroom
440837,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The weather was hot and so the walls heated up and as there is no air conditioning the room was too warm The duplex arrangement is ok but does not feel very big , The location on top of a hill overlooking Vienna is beautiful It is only a 20 minute drive to the centre of the city Breakfast in the summer when we stayed is on the terrace with fantastic views The building has lots of character Plenty of parking and grounds to walk the dog Friendly staff and good food both breakfast and dinner 
440838,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, This hotel needs a renovation badly In my choice of room it was written that i have view but instead of room with nice view i got a room with view on car parking I asked for change at reception but the man who was working there told me that i have view on the park behind car park And that they are fully booked because of wedding wich was in hotel that night And if i wanted a view i supposed to ask them for that in advance one day before arriving I told them that it was not was written in my booking condition but he answer it was guilty of booking com not his or of hotel and that i should make complain to booking So my room was like room for the staff from old movies like i am sleeping in 2 star hotel No sleepers no bathrobe no kettle , It is nice feeling sleeping in castle The view on the city if Vienna is amazing 
440839,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, slow internet connection, It s a classy and stilish place Superb and i think it s the best view over Wien Breakfast is very good Clean room A little bit old but i call it vintage 
440840,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Location approx 40 mins to centre via bus and underground Entrance is under construction so not a welcoming arrival the hotel should try to improve this as it distorts the first impressions No air conditioning made for a noisy fan on all night, Large split level rooms Fantastic views Large windows fully openable with large window sills to sit on and enjoy the view Free mini bar Breakfast with a view Free onsite car parking
440841,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The hotel needs a refurbishment and retooling for being a 4 I m curious how gained 4 Entering the room is with key classic key , Breakfast diversified 
440842,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Cost of food and accommodation was very high for what it was Constant building and renovation work ongoing whilst we were there so didn t look it s best , Location was great for Vienna access The free wafers in room was a nice touch Receptionist on both days was very helpful and spoke good English There is a great restaurant down the road from this hotel called aurora which is firmly recommend to anyone visiting as that was great food and service
440843,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Only tea in the room no coffee Very hot in the mezzanine level bed Floor Step too close between the bed and the stairs, Good location and view across the city Great breakfast

440846,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Hotel had a wedding so guests asked to dine in library where service was not good Next morning no hot water for shower Was told they had a problem for a couple of ays , I liked the look of the Hotel It was a one hundred year old hunting lodge Furniture and chandeliers in rooms reflected this

440848,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, There were some construction works and the workers didn t keep it tidy around their working place leaving their stuff out and ruining the atmosphere which otherways was fantastic , Fantastic countryside feeling close to city great view over Vienna
440849,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The hotel has a great view a nice garden and a free parking The building exterior is fabulous but for the interior a lots are to be done The interior designers had no imagination when they made the project a few decades ago The hotel need a desperate refurbish of the common spaces and some new decorations for the rooms It is very well soundproofed The bus station is just at the entrance so the car could be left at the hotel during the stay For 7 80 eur 24hrs if I m not mistaking for a ticket for all means of public transport it is more than decent price ,No Positive
440850,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, It was not a problem but you need to take Bus Train to get to the city Public transport worked well , The room was awesome Great view from the hotel territory The stuff was really friendly and helpful Free parking 
440851,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Through some mistake in housekeeping our room was not cleaned beds not made while we were there However the front desk attendant was very apologetic and helpful when this was brought to her attention It was also very hot when we were there so air conditioning would have helpful for sleeping Through Booking com reviews we knew that there was no air conditioning which enabled us to ask for a much appreciated ventilator fan with our reservation which helped greatly , We enjoyed our stay especially the peaceful location with the beautiful view of Vienna It was nice to be able to relax in the peace and quiet after being in the hustle and bustle of downtown Vienna The free parking was a nice plus and the trip into Vienna on public transportation was easy once we had done it the first time The bus stop is located right at the hotel entrance We had dinner on the veranda overlooking Vienna the first night which was delicious and enjoyable and the breakfasts were wonderful 
440852,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Hotel looks superb with great rooms but would benefit from a bar lounge area and the gardens and walks could be made better, Although location is a bit out of Vienna transport to Vienna was very good and easy to follow

440864,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Although smoking is not allowed in most places there is a smoking room at the entrance to the hotel near reception and the smoke spread throughout the hotel which is a little uncomfortable , The hotel enjoys a unique location over the roofs of Vienna We took the bikes with us and we liked that we could ride through the surroundings since there are lots of green spaces around We had a beautiful confort room with a stunning panoramic view The rooms are not luxurious but rather very nicely arranged in medieval style since it is a palat and very clean The staff was really friendly and accommodating Very good breakfast and food we preferred often to have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant and enjoy the great panoramic view from the large terrace the hotel has We will come back anytime 
440865,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The furniture could have been better to keep some of the glamor of an old palace, The hotel has a wonderful view overlooking Vienna It is relaxing and the breakfast was very good 
440866,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The hotel was in the middle of renovation works so we did not get the room we initially booked To avoid noise from the construction works we were placed into a standard room instead of a comfort room No reimbursment of costs were offered Our room smelled of mould or cigarettes or both There were some hair in the bathroom plus it smelled of pipes Everything was a bit dated and worn out so I m hoping that they are renovating not just the lobby , Beautiful old manor house with a nice park around You can see the whole Vienna from your window Quiet and tranquil location with good public transport connection to the city center 
440867,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, The walls in the room were dirty this is not acceptable for a 4 star hotel Old style is nice but not old furniture old sofa old everything except the bathroom , Large room and free parking Great view from the hill to Viena Great bed pillow 
440868,Austria Trend Hotel Schloss Wilhelminenberg Wien, Not at all what you think you are getting We expected a glamorous stay in the palace yet one finds a cross between an old school and a hospital structure inside with about as much service as one will get in either Hotel including rooms stinks from cigarette smoke I mean STINKS I know that they allow to smoke in Austria but this was out of the ordinary Furniture is stained and dirty carpets are ripped Bathrooms are tiny barely a room to turn around without falling into a toilet Huge hotel with one person at reception the only staff outside of the restaurant that we have seen during our stay Eerie feeling in the long empty corridors and quiet rooms at night we all immediately thought of Shining I am not big on ghost stories but it felt weird from the beginning and after I have read about the history of the property I think I must have had a reason to feel that way No air conditioner which means you either freeze if you don t turn the heating on old radiators or die from all the hot air sitting at the ceiling level where the beds are situated with no air circulation either Stairs leading to the beds are too steep not safe to walk up and down hand rail was broken too Restaurant resembled a school canteen I am sure hotel complies to four star standards on paper i e hairdryer in the rooms food on premises etc however outside that it does not feel at all like a four star more like two Needs and urgent investment and renovation , GREAT view from the hotel balcony beautiful hotel grounds gorgeous building architecture on the outside
