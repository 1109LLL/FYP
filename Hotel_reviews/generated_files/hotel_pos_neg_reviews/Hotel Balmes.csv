374412,Hotel Balmes, No coffee or tea making facilities in room One of the lifts was constantly broken Overall cleaning of room was good apart from one day when clean towels and sheets were left on the sofa and a pillow from the bed on top of the case of one of the works of art Perhaps the cleaner was interrupted mid job , Location we walked to the Gothic Quarter every day and also used the Metro to go further out Works of African Art in rooms Staff always helpful and friendly good tips on what to do and how to do it when we checked in
374413,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, what can you not like in paradise Oh my what a place this place is incredible Everything I needed to relax refresh recharge and it s only Day 2 
374414,Hotel Balmes, Rooms are small even for the European standards Book a higher standard room because you end up in a dark room near the pool It is not really a pool rather a cooling tub with very few chairs around No you cannot swim there it is too small Do not book the hotel for its pool rather for its great location nearby restaurants and clean modern rooms Bathrooms are also rather small The breakfast not great for the price but there is a very good breakfast place around the corner , Perfect location And very friendly and helpful staff Clean and modern rooms I would stay there again 
374415,Hotel Balmes, The location was a bit of a walk from the top of las ramblas at the end of the day the walk seems long with tierd legs We requested when booking 2 twin beds instead we got one double They said the next day we could get the 2 twin beds and then the next day we couldn t , Lovely hotel Fresh juice water and fruit in the lobby Nice clean room Great selection of restaurants in the area 
374416,Hotel Balmes, The pool area is very small and was overcrowded with children when we tried to use the facilities , We were upgraded for our one night stay which was very nice Most staff were very friendly and helpful but some quite the opposite A little expensive but a very nice hotel in a convenient location 
374417,Hotel Balmes, We had room 24 which had no windows felt very dark and the feeling of being underground We only spend a few hours in the room at night otherwise I would have asked to change rooms,No Positive
374418,Hotel Balmes, The combination of bath and shower facilities were not designed for the over eighties , Very well appointed room and comfortable bed Staff were without fault 
374419,Hotel Balmes, Can t think of anything , Really great location and very comfortable hotel Feels really luxurious but at a reasonable price Nice touches with water in the room quality products Rooms was bright bed super comfortable Location couldn t be better Parked in the parking opposite a bit steep 23 per day but easy safe Loved it 
374420,Hotel Balmes, I wish the breakfast buffet at the restaurant could be less expensive It made me choose for other options outside the hotel , Balmes is an excellent hotel I went to Barcelona with my brother and 1 year old baby and the experience was amazing Staff is very friendly polite and well prepared Really clean silent and confortable executive room Location is very good close to the main turistic sites 
374421,Hotel Balmes, Rooms not really soundproof and there was some construction work going on during my stay on my floor Also the elevators provided a little more bumpy ride occasionally they got you safely to the floor though , Very friendly staff extremely comfortable bed and several pillows on the bed really appreciate that in a hotel and good location with several nice bars restaurants close by 
374422,Hotel Balmes, When arriving we realized why this was so cheap My room was to the inner square a 5m by 5m slightly dirty area and I was ground floor thus very little light absolutely no view Otherwise rooms are okay but we assume there are some nicer ones with windows the ones to the busy road might though be noisy , We got a good price deal with booking on the rooms considering that this is a 4 hotel 
374423,Hotel Balmes, The disappointment was the room we had booked for our two friends as an Anniversary present was far too small to be called an Executive Room I didn t view their room until the day we left had I seen it earlier I would have asked them to provide a larger room which they show in the photos Our room although large there was no view and we had to have the blinds down day and night because anyone walking passed would be able to see us Very claustrophobic , The bed was especially comfortable The staff were great parked our car and a welcome glass of wine at the reception Even took our cases on arrival and back to the car on departure The room was lovely and clean all facilities we needed Welcome bottle of water and chocolates in our room each night I nearly forgot about a lovely red rose too 
374424,Hotel Balmes, The staff at times on reception didn t seem to be so happy to help with some of our questions or queries which was a shame because overall we really enjoyed our stay all by this , We absolutely loved our room Surprised at the size and design of it all wasn t what we expected it was a very pleasant surprise as this was for my partners birthday The location is great if you like walking and seeing all parts of Barcelona 
374425,Hotel Balmes, Unfortunately we got a room with a window to an internal opening you could only see other walls in a few meters I realize that someone must stay in this room but I was expecting something better for a week long stay The reception area was being renovated during our stay which changed the entrance atmosphere Alas the trip was also marred by the taxi driver to the airport who drove off with a brand new mobile left on the back seat the phone was turned off less than two minutes after and the driver denied ever seeing it , Centrally located and easily accessible this is a nice hotel to stay for a city break You can walk everywhere and public transport is plentiful nearby The hotel owner has an impressive African art collection exposed all over the hotel 
374426,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, Excellent Highly professional staff sparkling clean and well appointed facilities extremely comfortable great location I travel a good deal for business and this is one of the best places I ve stayed recently 
374427,Hotel Balmes, There was a window above my room and it was open all day and all night and at night the light shed in my room so that was a but disturbing but for the rest loved everything , I actually loved everything 
374428,Hotel Balmes, I liked the attempt at environmental awareness since i am an environmental consultant promoting those items however All the toilets leaked continuously not in our room but beside the restaurant and our shower sent much water on the wall when it was operating from leaks in 4 of the joints and valves but it did not impact the enjoyment of the shower , The bed and pillows were extra comfy We are still using the complementary water bottle for our travel needs in malaga The staff were always friendly and very accomodating even with our lack of spanish 
374429,Hotel Balmes, I didn t like the fact we booked a smoking room only to be threatened with a 125 fine for smoking in the room They said Booking com were wrong to advertise smoking rooms as the Balmes is a non smoking building,No Positive
374430,Hotel Balmes, Well the bathrobe was 2 but they never returned the 2nd one so I didn t have one to use after 1st day, I love the quiet of the room from street noise The room appeared although really not to be first time used Came with bathrobes the wife loved it And I like the fact that house cleaning doesn t disturb unless you want them too and they are not rushy to get you out but very flexible Floors were very clean Didn t get a chance for restaurant but maybe next time I am traveling to Paris in July maybe perhaps they have the same there Already the brochure said it did Thanks for a comfortable relaxing stay and the rose was phenomenal Great location to major attractions it s on middle of a triangular position of attractions
374431,Hotel Balmes, I loved the whole experience , I liked the warm welcome on arrival and the personal attention we received Of course I loved the birthday cake and cava 
374432,Hotel Balmes, There was some construction going on across the street from the hotel which was a bit annoying when working all night and trying to sleep in the morning This was nothing the hotel could do anything about Rooms have quite good soundproofing but against a jackhammer outside no chance But at least I know next time there probably won t be construction since they should be finished then , Comfortable beds nice clean room Staff is very friendly Hotel has private paid parking for customers Location of hotel is nice in the Centre Would definitely return to this hotel 
374433,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, Best location Minutes walking to Passeig de Gr cia and other main attractions Close to metro station Surrounded by great shops cafes and restaurants The rooms are perfectly cleaned and comfortable The standart room has everything you need comfort beds closet minibar safe TV free WI FI and complementary water at the arrival Excellent helpful staff at the reception They gave us helpful tips and even booked us tickets to the football game We didn t have the breakfast but the dinning room seems nice There is nice patio and the small cute pool at the ground floor Ask for a high floor it s pritty quiet even if the room facing the main street 
374434,Hotel Balmes, Room was very well appointed but quite small , Friendly efficient staff Bathroom excellent with all the toiletries you could wish for Super clean Comfy bed and spotless linen Balcony was a bonus but facing onto the road was quite noisy 
374435,Hotel Balmes, The smell aroma from the lobby The unproper management for the transit from the airport requested upon emails few days before the arrival The tiny rooms High rates for transit from te airport even we were clients of the hotel This situation guided us to another transport solution from the airport much cheaper and premium , Very well positioned in a quite street
374436,Hotel Balmes, The room was very small specially for the price we paid Same with the bathroom there wasn t even a hook to hang towels I didn t find the room comfortable at all They don t serve dinner which I found very strange for a 4 , The location of the hotel is excellent very close to many attractions shopping area and cafes restaurants The staff is very helpful and nice 
374437,Hotel Balmes, Expensive place You re mainly paying for the location near the shopping touristy area The hotel itself isn t that nice for the price , Location was good 
374438,Hotel Balmes, Cost of breakfast overpriced big time Noise of partying drunk people by the pool in the nite ruined chance for good sleep , Location of the hotel in walking distance to all city attractions Layout of the hotel family room on two floors funny unusual well designed small private patio 
374439,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in The room was excellent with very comfy beds a great bathroom and extra touches like bathrobe and slippers Staff are friendly and helpful The hotel has a great location which is close to main attractions and the metro to find everything else You won t regret choosing to stay here Would definitely book again 
374440,Hotel Balmes, Room 017 should never command a price of over 300 euros for a night s stay The reasons are the noise Every time the elevator is used it s really loud When the kitchen staff arrive at 6am you can hear every voice Finally the plumbing needs a serious overhaul Using the shower half the water ends up in the bathroom itself , The staff and in particular Carlos in the restaurant at breakfast are great All very attentive and pleasant 
374441,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, Just returned from an amazing weekend in Barcelona Booked a standard double room and was upgraded to a 2 floor suite Even without this though I cannot recommend this hotel enough great location away from the hustle and bustle but walkable to Las Rambles shopping and even walked to Sagrada Familia The staff in this hotel cannot do enough for you and we cannot wait to return again Thank You to all of you at Balmes 
374442,Hotel Balmes, Nothing all good, Staff were very helpful and helped with tickets to attractions directions recommending places to eat Convenient to all attractions and great restaurants 
374443,Hotel Balmes, It seems a matter of policy to tell arriving guests that their room will not be ready until 14 00 as at check out another guest was being told that he would have to wait We would have liked to add a day onto our stay but unfortunately their weekday rates were almost double what we paid for Saturday and Sunday , All the staff were great Reception kindly found a room that was ready despite our early arrival at 12 00 We had our cat with us and needed to settle him into our room before our lunch reservation at a nearby Michelin restaurant The breakfast offering was excellent value for money at 15 including an extensive fresh buffet of Spanish specialities fresh fruit beautiful pastries and eggs cooked to order all attended to by three very professional and friendly waiters I especially enjoyed the beautiful garden area with a very nice pool we did not plunge in but we did enjoy relaxing there with our lovely gin tonics prepared the great bar staff 
374444,Hotel Balmes, dark room with tiny window and no daylight despite request and upgrade payment later upgrade cost waived and changed to a slightly better room seemingly helpful but actually frustrated front desk staff not genuinely customer focused was really disappointed that front desk person the person with Elvis hair didn t even grant me 1 hour late check out In all my travels I have never seen a hotel that doesn t show courtesy of ONE hour late check out, Location was quite good It s a clean hotel and I think it s a hotel that trying to provide a good service just not there yet 
374445,Hotel Balmes, Some staff not very engaging others really good , Close to main attractions Outdoor garden pool settings very nice and staff friendly 24 hour supermarket almost next door good breakfast cafe a couple of doors up 
374446,Hotel Balmes, I arranged a late check out but the hotel knew nothing of it despite me having email confirmation The walls were paper thin and fortunately our neighbour was good humoured about us chatting late into the night we didn t know he could hear every word, Comfy bed little terrace was great
374447,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff Lovely room with nice toiletries chocolate by bed comfy pillows large towels and robes Breakfast price was reduced to 10 euros and very worth the money Cooked breakfast if you wanted as well as usual cold buffet Small pool but most welcome after hot day sightseeing 
374448,Hotel Balmes, Very minor things that were missing from the room ironing board and iron a mirror outside of the bathroom e g there is a dressing table with no mirror Also our room was next to a fire exit staircase which the door was a self closing one which slammed shut if people walked through This was a minor inconvenience early in the mornings on a couple of occasions , The hotel was good overall and I would recommend to friends and family if they were looking for somewhere to stay Easy to get to from the metro or trains from airport and close to the top of the Ramblas and the posh shops of Passeid de Gracia Most sights were accessible from the nearby metro or a 20 30 min exploratory walk Staff were really friendly and helpful hotel was very clean and modern throughout The pool area was nice to spend an hour in after a long day sight seeing and before venturing out for dinner The room was spacious had a safe and lots of complimentary bits We chose to not have breakfast as we felt 16 50 each was steep and I m pleased with this as within 250m there are a number of pattiseries including a gluten free one which offered a lovely breakfast for under 4 each 
374449,Hotel Balmes, So much noise from the bathes Water system is too noisy The noise has came from other rooms also and it is very disturbing Curtains can not be closed completely We have used a buckle to close them Red light the smoke sensor is disturbing A better system could be used For once time housekeeping has forgotten to replace the face towels and so for half day face towels were missing Slippers had not changed even once At the last day we put them into the wate basket but still no slippers had been replaced The worst thing is that the bidet is not been cleant The toilet is hygienic but the bidet is not , The location of the hotel is good It is near to the city center metro lines Air conditioning system is sufficient for keeping the room at the desired condition WiFi is free and usefull for communicaitons We have talked with our friends via Skype WhatsApp Beds and pillows are comfortable Me and my wife have slept well No problem with the other guests Due to the our problems hotel staff did not charged the price of the last day 
374450,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, The hotel was in a good location the staff were very helpful and friendly They even went to the effort to wish my wife a happy birthday by presenting her with a cake Our room was comfortable and clean I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Barcelona 
374451,Hotel Balmes, Our Family room on the Ground floor was a bit of a cell inc under powered air con , With one exception all staff outstanding helpful agreeable 
374452,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, The Bed and sheets were great Staff very friendly especially pool side bar guys Ally Jos and the lovely Juliette who we just met on our last day before departure Husband and I had a great relaxing break away 
374453,Hotel Balmes, I didn t appreciate being overcharged on roomservice When I questioned it i was told they didn t have a allocated button for steak so I got charged an extra 2euros for hamburger Not acceptable and not a very good variety on room service I paid 14euros for steak that I couldnt eat requested really well done and it came rare Our room was across from housekeeping store so noisy in the mornings , Some of the staff were very friendly really welcoming and helpful Rooms were really clean And upon arriving to hotel the lady at reception was so helpful Provided me with early check in 
374454,Hotel Balmes, The receptionist upon check in got the reservation wrong wasn t very friendly and took a while to admit to the mistake The room was very small unappealing and with no storage Poor value for money compared with other nearby hotels which also charge EUR 150 plus for better rooms The chamber maid barged into the room suddenly while I was sleeping at 9 pm at night , The location 
374455,Hotel Balmes, It was noisy late at night when guests arrived home The hallways echoed no carpeting and even guests speaking in normal volume in the hallways sounded like they were in our room We were awakened every night by later night arrivals Once they entered their rooms however all was quiet again Felt we paid more than it was worth Breakfast expensive to us , Very helpful and friendly staff Location good for getting just about everywhere Clean but dated We were hardly there so I can t speak to the pool area bar etc Small but adequate rooms Great cafes bakeries coffee etc within a short walk 
374456,Hotel Balmes, Internet connection in the garden and pool area was poor and unreliable, Within walking distance of train stations La Rambla huge shopping areas and some places of interests too Cleanliness of room was exceptional on a daily basis Staff all friendly and welcoming Staff in the garden pool and outdoor bar area were all excellent 
374457,Hotel Balmes, Tea and coffee facilities in the room would have enhanced the stay, Great location if you know Barcelona Staff were very friendly and helpful and always greeted you with a smile Rooms were spacious and very clean Interesting art works made it modern and quirky 
374458,Hotel Balmes, its hard to say if i was to quibble maybe more menu choice , its a lovely hotel friendly staff fantastic food and setting The rooms are really well decorated 
374459,Hotel Balmes, The breakfast is too expensive it s better looking around The parking is expensive too but it s in Barcelona , Great position in 30 minutes you can reach the ramblas or the Sagrada Familia Clean and nice room Free wi fi 
374460,Hotel Balmes, It was a bit difficult to take a shower in the tub as you had to maneuver around the drain and there wasn t a lot of room for that And the pool closed too early it would have been nice to take a dip in the evening , Very service minded staff and our room was always nice and clean 
374461,Hotel Balmes, Crazy parking prices 26e a day And if u drive a smart you ll be good otherwise good luck to enter their parking , Rooms are spacious enough for 2 pax bathroom as well Clean comfortable bed Just an advice don t bother urself calling the hotel or ask them to extend an extra night just use booking com cheaper n better 
374462,Hotel Balmes, Rooms a little small and building work in the adjacent building but I guess that s not the hotels fault , Its a really nice hotel located not far from the beach and near to shopping bars etc Very friendly reception staff and lovely little swimming pool at the back Rooms a little small but nice 
374463,Hotel Balmes, Poor wifi Jacuzzi was cold, Room was very clean and comfortable Garden and pool were great Location was really good for metro and train to airport Bar staff especially Juliet were really cool super nice and looked after us every day Lobby staff were also really helpful on numerous occasions
374464,Hotel Balmes, If you want to eat breakfast there it is pricy but there are many options nearby so you really don t need it , The hotel is in a great location for walking places including the metro restaurants hop on hop off bus and Gaudi landmarks The single room is tiny but had everything you need to be comfortable including many toiletry items and a comfy bed The garden area with small pool and bar is a pretty and relaxing spot You also receive a ticket to the Egyptian Museum upon check in which was an added bonus 
374465,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, Loved our night here The staff could not have been more attentive polite and helpful Well appointed two storey family room like a mini apartment Appreciated the White Company toiletries and fluffy towels Lovely shady pool bar area Would have liked steam room to have been working but did not detract from our stay We will return Thank you Balmes staff 
374466,Hotel Balmes, The noise I think it was the lift I could hear Also when staff arrived presumably though a back staircase you could hear the echoing footsteps , The staff were very friendly and helpful I also liked the African art The location was excellent 
374467,Hotel Balmes, I was put in a room next to a group of young girls holding a hens party all night I d just flown 17 hours needed sleep They also tried to bill me twice for the one room , breakfast although expensive was very nice
374468,Hotel Balmes, The TV was fuzzy every channel The location is just ok it would have been better to be a bit more central and nearer to Pla a De Catalunya You can walk most places from the hotel but it s at least a 25 minute walk to Sagrada Familia and 50 minutes to the Beach Eixample has plenty of lovely streets but the street Balmes is on is quite bleak and dull looking meaning the view from the hotel is not great , The room was very nice despite being small The overall cleanliness of the place was excellent and the staff were very nice The price was very good despite being a 4 hotel Great for a short stay solo travel and business trips The free wifi is great very fast Plenty of places for clothes shopping just a 10 minute walk away to Passeig De Gracia 
374469,Hotel Balmes, Location of room on first floor was loud Lots of doors slamming early in the morning Patio was right next to door leading to pool and offered very little privacy As a married couple we were given a room with twin beds and our children were given a pull out sofa Not comfortable options given the price point , Amenities offered in bathroom 
374470,Hotel Balmes, The whole experience doesn t meet expectations of a 4 stars hotel facilities staff friendly for most of them but not professional enough room size Be also aware that pictures with a fish eye effect mislead about actual sizes Moreover rooms on the street side are way too noisy even with closed windows , Good location Clean Staff speaking several languages 
374471,Hotel Balmes, We got a bag of laundry done and it was 88 Parking was 48 for 2 nights 2 x G T was 21 82 Booking com cost was 190 checkout cost was 178 extra extortionate Lastly the porters lost a Michael Kors handbag and they ve absolved responsibility Keep an eye on your luggage or insist on carrying it yourself , Lovely hotel staff were friendly and the facilities are fantastic 
374472,Hotel Balmes, The spiral staircase in the room was slightly awkward to get to the toilet in the night There wasn t a bannister for the full set of stairs The air con didn t work , The room was big enough for 4 people The pool was a good size and the facilities were clean The staff were very accommodating and friendly 
374473,Hotel Balmes, Double bed was dreadful it was a sofa bed and very uncomfortable Smells in room varied from cigarette smoke to toilet like odours not ours , Staff were superb Hotel was very convenient Pool great
374474,Hotel Balmes, The single room simply too single in terms of available space , Excellent position close to the majority of points of interest downtown Barcelona
374475,Hotel Balmes, Very minor negatives cleaners walking into the room a few times during the stay was a little frustrating They do provide do not disturb signs so as long as you remember to use them should be fine No heated pool it was freezing No tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Staff were very attentive and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable Pool side drinks service was great Good location close to metro 
374476,Hotel Balmes, Small room for 158, Clean good location pleasant staff small pool and garden Walking distance to most of the shops and surrounded by dozens of Restaurants many very good
374477,Hotel Balmes, Family rooms is so small that we can not walk inside it when our luggage is open and also includes old fashioned bathroom may it will be more clean also The walls are so thin that we think that the next room are also inside our room We want upper floor rooms for our group and we stay at the first floor and also private terrace for the family room and stay at a all of our request does not met It may be according to the unavailability , The location is almost perfect and near all of the popular places that you must visit when you go to Barcelona Some of the rooms are renovated and useful for the visitors The officials and the other all staff are so friendly and help you about your visit and all other questions 
374478,Hotel Balmes, The rooms are very small and very dark No sofa or chair as described Nowhere to place your luggage or anything really other than the floor And the rooms are really noisy ,No Positive
374479,Hotel Balmes, Knowledge on historic sites could be better I tried to buy a ticket for Park G ell at the hotel and was told that the entrance is completely free , good breakfast nice and quiet room comfortable beds friendly staff
374480,Hotel Balmes, Would ve been nice if staff had given us a brief tour of the hotel Or even just pointed us in the direction of the dining room pool etc Instead we had to wander around ourselves and we must have looked like lost sheep, The room was beautifully cleaned everyday The pillows were amazing 
374481,Hotel Balmes, there is no air conditioning in the room we went in April and it was way to boiling even then so in the height of summer it would be very hot , I liked the jacuzzi and the manager was extra friendly and helpful The bed was really comfy and the location is brill 
374482,Hotel Balmes, Rooms are not exactly sound proof so some earplugs added to the toiletries goody bag would be a cheap but very useful addition , Rooms were clean beds comfortable and towels were thick and luxurious Little swimming pool sauna and jacuzzi gave it a special feel 
374483,Hotel Balmes, Breakfast was expensive so didn t go to restaurant at all during visit, Bed was very comfortable and room and hotel very clean Good location Staff helpful and friendly
374484,Hotel Balmes, We didn t like the problem we had with the hot water there was a problem with the boiler and we were left without hot water for the whole morning also we had a problem with the electricity due to the fact the fuse kept jumping, We like the friendly staff good location good size rooms
374485,Hotel Balmes, No English channels at the TV mattress was a bit hard to what I am used to , Bubble bath Sauna nice garden with small swimming pool amenities bathrobes all our requests have been taken in account
374486,Hotel Balmes, We didn t even consider having breakfast as it was expensive We grabbed something from a nearby cafe each morning instead which worked out much cheaper , Very friendly and helpful staff We travelled with our 6 month old baby and his cot was made up for him when we arrived We needed access to a microwave in order to sterilise bottles each evening and this was no problem either The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable Location was pretty good lots of places to eat nearby We were advised which nearby metro station had a lift since we had a buggy Found it quite difficult to find accommodation in Barcelona that wasn t a hostel at one end of the scale or very very expensive at the other so Balmes was really a great middle ground 
374487,Hotel Balmes, OK well we would all like a bigger pool To be honest at the price the Balmes is perfect for me and I do keep on returning again and again , What s not to like Right next to Balmes and Rambla Catalunya in a quiet area at a good price with a pool to cool off in the summer Returning again and again 
374488,Hotel Balmes, The only thing was the temperature in the room as it was very warm When we opened the window the traffic noise was quite annoying so we had no choice but to bear the heat , Everything was first class I loved the room especially the decor very eclectic All the facilities provided were fantastic The location couldn t have been better just around the corner from La Pedrera and Diagonal metro station I will recommend this hotel to all my friends 
374489,Hotel Balmes, Soundproofing is not the greatest To the person that stayed between Christmas and New Year s Eve in room 422 if you are reading this Please learn to close the bathroom door without slamming it It is a skill that will help you in life Yes Brandy I m talking about you , Staff was very friendly and helpful The location is great close to public transportation and shopping areas 
374490,Hotel Balmes, The service of the reception was very bad for a four star hotel We could hear every single noise for our room neighbours once we even woke up in the middle of the night due to someone taking a bath , The design of the hotel is nice and our bed was for Spanish measures big The room was clean but smelly 
374491,Hotel Balmes, Breakfast seemed very expensive we didn t have it for this reason so don t know if it was good value for money or not Our booking confirmation stated we had a bath however upon arriving we did not not a problem though we just popped to the hot tub instead , Couldn t have had a better hotel in such a good location for the money we paid Barely a 10 minute walk until you were at La Rambla a few minutes from Av Diagonall both of which got us easily to most places we wanted to visit Staff we really kind and helpful We felt really welcome here 
374492,Hotel Balmes, Only the fact that the jacuzzi was not working and would have been nice to relax after a days walking , The location was fantastic very close to many shops and restaurants 
374493,Hotel Balmes,No Negative, The location and the staff were superb and very helpful Our room was very comfortable although the sounds of a party at night were very loud and kept me up until about 3am Breakfast was very good and adequate The staff assisted me with renting a car It was great 
374494,Hotel Balmes, The doors are paper thin and noise in the corridor can be heard loud inside the rooms Ask for a room that is far away from the elevators The interior of the rooms could use a little more character they feel a little bit too sterile But this is probably a matter of taste , The staff is very friendly and helpful My request for multiple bills when checking out was handled without a problem The location of the hotel is ideal for tourists You can easily walk to the city center and the most of the subway lines The hotel and rooms are very clean and they get cleaned every day Late checkout until 12 00 pm without additional costs is also a huge plus 
374495,Hotel Balmes, We had booked a double bedded room but ended up with 2 singles and it wasn t a very big room Our friends had a superior room which was much bigger so would have been worth the extra money , The location of Hotel You could walk to the Ramblas not too far away anyway We had a room with a bath which was good 
374496,Hotel Balmes, I was in this hotel 2 years ago and had a very good impression So I booked it again Alas this time it was different I got a tiny room hardly larger than the bed in it looking over a busy street so it was quite noisy , The location is very good close to the center especially if you re not against a 15 minutes walk and in 3 4 blocks from metro stations The hotel is decent and the value for money is fair However the comfort of the stay depends a lot on which room you get some are perfect the others are questionable Take care to ask for a silent room if you want to sleep well 
374497,Hotel Balmes, The staff was not overly friendly but we re always available I didn t know about the airport pick up drop off until I had arrived and they were very struck on the checkin out times , Location is perfect and the room was large clean and quite 
374498,Hotel Balmes, Much noise from road traffic and lift next door Not possible to look through window as windows were frosted and there was scaffolding outside, clean spacious apartment
374499,Hotel Balmes, Traffic noise in front rooms is loud from 6am Could do with double glazing especially as the air con was quiet and efficient The swimming pool is shaded in the afternoon and the water must go through the freezer as it is unbearable to swim in , Room was clean and comfortable with plenty of storage Breakfast was nice with adequate choice Location was central a couple of blocks from the metro with nice local resurants and bars 
374500,Hotel Balmes, Staff unfriendly first they gave us an old uncleaned room doors were used and almost broken the room was not cleaned the closet and beds old ugly and worn out So we asked for a different room Than we got much better room small but renovated and clean The pooll was mot heated the garden sholud be much nicer for the price no bar at the hotel It seems like the whole hotel was not well cared for very dissapointing if the stuff was nicer the whole impression would be better on the contrary the conclusion is we werent satisfied at all sorry, Location and breakfast are good
374501,Hotel Balmes, The breakfast was expensive for what was offered and the pool was absolutely freezing , The staff were excellent very knowledgeable friendly and willing We were upgraded from an executive room to an apartment which was great and overall the stay was very nice 
374502,Hotel Balmes, It s not necessarily bad but the wifi isn t great and only one device can connect There were 2 of us but only 1 phone could use the wifi We stayed 5 nights room was very nice but view was facing a wall , Hotel location was great very comfortable bed and air con in the room was a huge bonus We didn t eat in the hotel so I can t comment on this I would definitely recommend this hotel
