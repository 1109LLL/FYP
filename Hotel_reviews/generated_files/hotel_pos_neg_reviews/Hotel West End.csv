239443,Hotel West End, What s not too like , Perfect hotel second time I ve stayed there and once again I have no complaints The location is fantastic as are the staff Definitely recommend to fellow travellers 
239444,Hotel West End, We had a problem with our closet It didn t close and open properly We couldn t reach it easily We called the staff they said they fixed it but it didn t look like In the end of our stay manager told us that they cannot repair it It was annoying all the time we wanted to get out closes from wardrobe In the end my friend didn t take her cosmetics as it was hidden under the doors which we couldn t open, Location In first day lady manager met us She was so nice and tried to help us with everything we asked 
239445,Hotel West End, I don t understand what I have to do to book a room with balcony I will research further , This is my fourth stay at Hotel West End over the last seven years I booked the superior room for five nights I expected to receive a room with a small balcony as I always have but instead I was offered a room on the first floor without a balcony After discussion I switched to a room on the sixth floor the top floor without balcony but lovely quiet and charming I was able to sleep with the windows open because there was so little street noise Everything about the room was comfortable including the bed linens and spacious bathroom with combination tub shower The hotel offers Hermes products as bath amenities The breakfast is ample and delicious I was very pleased that the hotel offered non dairy milk for those of us who are vegan This was the first time I experienced this in my two weeks in France Another great stay in this fabulous hotel 
239446,Hotel West End, Eggs was cold and under cooked A C unit in room had to be turned on by front desk and could not be adjusted unless we call the F D to request very inconvenient Also I asked for a bottle of Red wine to be put in the room on arrival since it was my anniversary seems like this was missed but was given a Chocolate Eiffel Tower , bed comfortable clean room balcony view great if you stayed on the 5th floor Staff was friendly Front desk was nice efficient
239447,Hotel West End, This has nothing to do with the hotel or area it is in Paris has a major refugee problem there on every street or street corner, Lovely location within walking distance of all the tourist areas some nice restaurants nearby but please make a reservation as there are long queues for the popular ones 
239448,Hotel West End, Although breakfast was satisfactory it could have been a bit more diverse , This is a great hotel The room was a reasonable size very nicely decorated well kept and clean The bed was so comfortable The bathroom was a generous size There was also a balcony with a view of the Eiffel Tower The staff was friendly and helpful The location is also great central with a lot of shops and restaurants nearby Wifi worked perfectly fine Over all we ve had a lovely stay Would definitely recommend 
239449,Hotel West End, The man in charge of the breakfast room was an absolute disgrace He refused to clear dirty tables was incredibly rude to everyone There needs to be more breakfast staff we payed over 1 000 euros for 2 nights the service he provided his attitude were unacceptabe , Everything apart from the disgustingly rude breakfast waiter The hotel all other staff were amazing 
239450,Hotel West End, Facilities were slightly dated the bathroom was very basic and the plug wasn t working so couldn t use the bath in room , The location was fantastic and the hotel was beautiful breakfast in bed option was also a really nice touch 
239451,Hotel West End, Nothing , This was a fabulous hotel excellent staff and atmosphere from the moment you stepped inside so warm and welcoming High end shops and restaurants in every direction 5 min walk to the Eiffel Tower and much more Found it hard to leave 
239452,Hotel West End, Even if it provides for a good level of cleaning moquette was really dusty Breakfast a bit basic and sad not in line with the good standard overall , Cosy hotel for a very pleasant staying Silent and comfortable room nice personnel charming lounge excellent location 
239453,Hotel West End,No Negative, Front desk was great Chloe helped procure tickets to the Louvre and Musee d Orsay We had room 103 which was large and beautifully proportioned with magnificent bathroom We had great bistro style dinner at Chez Andre up the block Walking distance to lots of subways and high end clothing stores on Avenue Montaigne 
239454,Hotel West End, Our mini bar wasn t restocked after the last occupant and there were tiny details overlooked in the bathroom hair in the bath tub no face washers The room was a little small but it didn t detract from our enjoyment of our stay For the price though I d expect the basics covered , I chose this hotel as I wanted the glamour of the Hotel Plaza Athenee but couldn t afford the 500ish a night they were asking After going into the Plaza during our stay I have to say this is an excellent alternative I would probably choose it over the Plaza after my experience this weekend The location is excellent for a visit to Pairs we were able to walk to the Champs Elyesse very easily and the Eifel Tower is a stone through away It has excellent transport links to other areas of Paris While the Plaza asks for hundreds of pounds a night for a view of the tower we got ours for less than half of that for 493 for two nights The photo attached is the view from our room on the 6th floor mind you I had to lean a little awkwardly out the window to get it What I liked about this hotel was the friendly and intimate feel much unlike the Plaza which felt like a place you d go to be seen The lobby and reception were well decorated and the staff are warm and accommodating They have an honesty system in the front room for drinks which was a nice touch Around the corner at the Plaza they are asking 16 for a bottle of Bud The rooms while small are comfortable and the is minimal noise at night time despite the central location The breakfast was included which was an unexpected surprise they will deliver the continental breakfast to your room for free if you pre order the night before All in all I was very glad I chose this hotel and felt that it was good value for money I would definitely choose this hotel again 
239455,Hotel West End, Hotel needs updating Room was supposed to be superior but was small Terrace faced an abandoned building on Main Street If you are looking for luxury this is not your hotel Toilet was not working properly Carpeting needs to be cleaned Shower water pressure low Not enough info given at check in For example the light switches phone in room to call desk Not enough towels and soap bathroom tile around toilet didn t look clean We did however like the location , Location
239456,Hotel West End,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful especially Daniel The hotel is super clean and the bed comfortable Seeing the eiffel tower from the rooms are a bonus The breakfast was very nice and fresh too 
239457,Hotel West End, One room was two hours late with check in they had had a very busy week with lots of people leaving on the day of our arrival but we had been traveling since three in the morning so the room not being ready was very annoying , Hotel was lovely air conditioning was great view from room was lovely as in the picture Breakfast was good plenty to choose from and excellent time scale from breakfast on the weekend 7am to 12 noon which was brilliant Staff were lovely and helpful and very friendly
239458,Hotel West End, Our only complaint is the size of the breakfast room Way too small given the size of the hotel Yet breakfast quality was very good, A very well located comfortable hotel Large room and very clean and well maintained Excellent location very close to Champs Elysesee Would definitely stay again Breakfast was no additional charge 
239459,Hotel West End, Considering we paid 500 aud per night for a deluxe room we were expecting a bigger room It was quite small They also had no tea and coffe in the room The staff did bring it up but again for the money you expect more When booking we asked for an effiel tower view they wrote back and said we will see but cant guarantee When we got there they didnt mention it We asked and they said there is availability but not for the solid 6 nights Call me crazy could they not havemoved peoples bookings around before got there Pretty disappointed , The location was fabulous 
239460,Hotel West End,No Negative, The breakfast room service was fabulous and was available up to 10 30am maybe later I forget If you are looking for a location quality hotel for a great price this hotel is the answer In addition the staff was always ready to help in any way possible even when we were checking out When we return to Paris we will definitely stay here again 
239461,Hotel West End, The room was entirely pleasant but rather basic and personality free Shower head was a bit low There were no face washers in the towel set Minimal electrical outlets No room mirror only bathroom , Excellent breakfast delivered to room No fuss 
239462,Hotel West End, See above pkease, The breakfast room was far too small The waitress was pleasant but too slow The food wasn t stocked up enough we had to keep asking for things 
239463,Hotel West End, Nothing at all , Excellent customer service from Daniel who helped us immediately taxi arrived Carlos helping with museum tickets and restaurant advice organising taxis and restaurant bookings Henrique making us very early morning coffee before our departure and running out with beautiful flaky crossaints and pain au chocolat to have breakfast on the run At all times every staff member was very helpful Our room had view Eifel Tower and a balcony which made our stay extra special for our 41st anniversary Quiet neighbourhood close to Champs Elysees and stunning boutiques Comfortable bed and nice big soft towels Easy walk to the Louvre and Musee D Orsay 
239464,Hotel West End, The standard room is very very small and not nice at all As soon as we entered we asked for an upgrade and we moved to a very nice and spacious deluxe room This room is as the pictures big and new with a beautiful bathroom We also didn t like the breakfast you have max 3 options , The location of the hotel is great It is quiet and so Parisian Beautiful 
239465,Hotel West End,No Negative, Fabulous location between the Seine and Champs Elysee and with a Metro station 5 mins away plus lots of restaurants Beautifully decorated with very comfortable bed and friendly staff
239466,Hotel West End,No Negative, It s just right It s in the perfect part of town surrounded by wonderful restaurants The staff is warm and welcoming Nothing is too much trouble You can walk to the Seine and see the Eiffel Tower you can walk to shopping The rooms are small but very comfortable The breakfast is just right Not too much not too little This is my second time there and I ll go again and again 
239467,Hotel West End,No Negative, The style and look of the hotel were very nice as was the room although a bit noisy due to some construction perhaps The breakfast was lovely and the location was terrific 
239468,Hotel West End, We would have liked a tea and coffee making facility in the room , The view is just spectacular from the top floor The rooms are all a bit small but that is typical of Parisian spaces petit But made up for it with the rich decor Breakfast is always a treat Don t expect big American breakfasts This is France so croissants and other delectable pastries are the order of the day The staff are polite and extremely helpful 
239469,Hotel West End,No Negative, Great breakfast provided in an attractive setting Also our balcony with small table and chairs gave us a romantic view of the Eiffel Tower At night it was spectacular The location made it an easy walk to the Champs Elysees 
239470,Hotel West End,No Negative, The staff were excellent very helpful and welcoming Wonderful location with large room and balcony and Parisian flair Great breakfast selection and coffee 
239471,Hotel West End, My only criticism would be that the noise from the street was sometimes very loud but that is not the hotel s fault , The room was extremely good The staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was good 
239472,Hotel West End, Breakfast room ever so small You might have to wait for a table , Really attentive lovely staff Very nice breakfast Lovely clean rooms with nicely appointed bathroom 
239473,Hotel West End, It was my third and last stay at the hotel two of the front office emyloyees are not supposed to work in the hospitality industry Some of the employees are very careless they don t know how to deal with the guests They re not dedicated to their job at all , The location and cleanness of the hotel A beautiful boutique hotel 
239474,Hotel West End,No Negative, When we checked in we were even upgraded to a corner room which was very nice I visit Paris around 8 10 times a year I will definately stay in this hotel 
239475,Hotel West End, Nothing , A lovely hotel in a great location The staff were very helpful room very clean and the continental breakfast was delicious We asked for a room with a nice view and when we arrived we had been given a room with a balcony and a view of the Eiffel Tower Perfect 
239476,Hotel West End, No complaints at all really other than the tub not having a shower head high enough for standing I had to hold the handle , The entire atmosphere of the hotel was awesome The character of the hotel was very nice with all the little touches of a different time but still modern enough for comfort I was in a corner room with amazing beam exposer and an awesome view of the canal 
239477,Hotel West End,No Negative, The receptionist offer of a private taxi when when all other taxis was considering more strike action as well as a room upgrade at the time of checking in
239478,Hotel West End, No bar at this location although they have an honesty bar You can sefl serve yourself and mix a drink but very expensive and no ice some of the time , Great location 
239479,Hotel West End,No Negative, The upgrade our room so we booked a standard room but finally they gave us an amazing room it was really kind The room was clean comfortable really cosy and beautiful really french style the bathroom was very nice with good bath equipment details that you would appreciate the position is perfect to enjoy paris so really recommended Very good breakfast fresh products and good variety 
239480,Hotel West End, Breakfast room was tiny but the breakfast was very good, Very pleasant and helpful bi lingual staff with a great service ethic Gorgeous room thank you for the upgrade and exceptional location Super well worth a return visit

239483,Hotel West End,No Negative, Your staff was wonderful They even gave us a personal wake up knock on our door when I didn t understand the regular phone call They made being a tourist a lot easier Thanks to all 
239484,Hotel West End, West End hotel was not worth the money paid for it It doesn t have a chic charm that you might expect from a 4 hotel You can hear a lot what s in the corridor Those rooms with windows inside i can not call it the yard there is too much noise with air pump , Location is great Staff is very friendly You can get breakfast to your room at no extra cost 
239485,Hotel West End, Breakfast room became quite crowded in the morning but staff worked hard to accommodate everyone I would absolutely stay there again Great job to The West End Hotel and staff , Around the corner from the famous Four Seasons Hotel George V Arch de Triumph Champ Elysees Really fabulous location 20 30 minute walk to Eiffel Tower Louvre Also some great restaurants close by Really nice boutique hotel offering a fantastic location lovely rooms and a very nice hotel staff 
239486,Hotel West End, The bath has been full of someones hair but we were too late back in the hotel to move from room to room or call somebody that time however we did communicate that to the hotel staff in the morning , The Hotel is well located charming inside and outside although the rooms are not too big but that is common for Paris The breakfast choice is also good and tasty Hotel staff had also taken care of us by providing all the information we requested in advance such as parking restaurants and my grandfather has been also congratulated on his Birthday with a small gist Liked everything 
239487,Hotel West End, Terrible terrible service , Terrible service I booked a room with a balcony specifically and paid premium price and once checked in it was not the room that I booked It was not the room that was advertised and they were not helpful at all Extremely disappointed 
239488,Hotel West End, Breakfast room is quite small and less choice we can make The sound proofing effect of room is bad we can hear neighbor s cell phone morning call and chatting very clearly For suggestion you d better use ear plugs when sleeping , Location is excellent Bathroom is big and with luxury shower products 
239489,Hotel West End, Poor facility and bad reception with very unpleasant front disk staffs I have been delayed when check in for almost five hours with very roud attitude from the lady I meet on the arrival In addition nearby the hotel there was a work on the street from 7 o clock in the morning till 11 o clock non stop and made made me awake with no positive reaction from the hotel management, Nothing it is so disappointing to book in this hotel In fact the rating displayed in your sight is vake and should be remove to avoid diminishing your credibility
239490,Hotel West End, Set amongst back streets it doesn t have the greatest view but is close to all the main attractions The breakfast room is very small but the positive of this is they offer free breakfast in bed , We had an amazing spacious room with large balcony free breakfast in bed is great and the location it self is easy to get everywhere

239492,Hotel West End, Certain rooms don t have much light but the front desk changed it for us very quickly , Amazing front desk staffs and management very friendly and helpful polite and friendly the same time The building is full of character even it doesn t have the best modern features but it has a special Parisian old school feel to it Very tidy clean and exactly the type of hotel fit in my personal preferences 
239493,Hotel West End, There wasn t really anything not to like , The location was excellent and i really liked the ambience Being on my own I felt completely safe in the area and it was easy to get anywhere in Paris by foot or by Metro The staff were lovely and very accommodating The breakfast which was included was very good I had a balcony room with a view of the Eiffel Tower
