376556,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No possibility to open windows in room atmosphere can get stiffy with A C only, Spacious very clean rooms Reception was uber friendly helpful during check in 50 meters walking distance from tube station U4 
376557,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, if you want coffee pods you have to go to reception room service selection was poor had to register for wifi every time you used it , Air conditioning worked excellent dinner
376558,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Every thing was great, Grate location very nice staff Patrisha was so helpfull Our room was upgraded and it was amazing The hotel is 100 m walk from the U4 staition 3 staitions from karlsplatz which is the center of the city and from there you can go anywhere Food was OK bed was VERY comfort Right in front of the hotel there is a small supermarket I would defenetly go back there on my next trip to vieena 
376559,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Uncleaned bed side table some snacks missing in the minibar , The location is really great in the middle of Wienna main atractions Rooms are very cosy and nice very friendly staff Great coffee machine in rooms 
376560,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Hotel location is very good Hotel is new and stylish rooms are big and beds are very comfy Staff is friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and spa on the roof was nice 
376561,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, it might be advisavle to improve air conditioning system We assume that it is generally switch on off , Very comfortable hotel You can get to the metro station in 2 minutes by walk The hotel is located in 3 stations from Karlsplatz where main historical places are located The staff is friendly and helpful The room is quite new and has everything which is required for staying bathrobes slippers shampoo soap etc Only kettle is outstainding however there is a coffee machine There is also a parking at the hotel 22 Euro per night 
376562,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, There s very little to do near the hotel and the neighborhood isn t particularly attractive However being so close to the U bahn means you can get anywhere with ease Also Mariahilf is only a 20 minute walk away Be alert at night because the park between the hotel and station is poorly lit and we were approached several times Obviously none of this is the hotel s fault , Chic well appointed rooms near U4 station We enjoyed the free Nespresso machine which was restocked daily Solid wifi 
376563,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The breakfast was hugely overpriced, The facilities in the room were great It looked even better than in the pictures and the staff were really helpful
376564,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, i think the cleaning Lady was in a haste she left her sponge in the bathroom sink one day still alright, Awesome beds nice spa area very friendly and Helpful staff Early Check in was possible good Location
376565,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, There is no room service after 10 30 or similar and the restaurant closes about the same time No food at the bar except for cakes and a really lousy pizza Fortunately there is KFC outlet and a gas station with good sandwiches only 5 minutes away The room has no warderobe closets at all Just a small open built in cove with hangers One can hang 2 3 suits and 2 3 dresses at most No drawers at all One has to keep the clothes in the suitcases on the floor Most unpleasant The garage is small and curvy with tiny places for each vehicle No way to open the doors without hitting the next vehicle Frankly that garage is a laugh but they charge 20 euros per day The funniest part the elevator from the lobby runs to the second garage floor only 2 To get to the third floor 3 you have to exit the lobby elevator and switch to another elevator which runs only from 2 to 3 Unbelievable and ridiculous Finally to reach the stairs instead of the elevator one has to run through a maze of doors placed without any inherent logic Even though the hotel looks attractive it seems that the architects massed things out , Nice spacey and comfortable room big comfortable bed 
376566,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, There wasn t kettle in the room besides coffee machine and we are not coffee drinkers Requested the kettle for 4 times to boil water as it s winter and after 2 days of waiting the hotel staff told us they ran out of kettle as other rooms also requested , The room was spacious we got a big terrace too big bathtub Good selection of breakfast like the deco design of the hotel 
376567,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, It s nice when hotels give free bottles of water every day , Nice hotel Clean and nice rooms I had a Junior suit very nice with a perfect bathroom Free espresso machine with coffee and milk Chocolate on bed when I first entered in the room Nice possibility to have a small discount on bar by asking service putting outside the door in the evening a target to do not clean room every day but 1 times in two days Anyway I received new coffe and milk for espresso machine 
376568,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Service was on occasion a little slow and the habit of closing curtains to the bar well before it s closing time was a little off putting , Very comfortable bedrooms plenty of space and well insulated from outside noise Very friendly staff especially the barman A little way out of the centre but taxis were not expensive and always arrived promptly 
376569,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Cleaners used strongly scented detergents and air fresheners and the soap and shampoo provided by the hotel were extremely smelly too Some sort of aroma therapy I m assured but not good for asthmatic people I was coughing for 2 first days but luckily cleaners did not spray anything more during my stay Maybe allergy room would ve been less smelly No kettle in the room A kettle is a must in a hotel of this high level , Very spacious stylish practical clean and quiet room nice big shower Bed was very comfortable Personnel was friendly and accommodating apart from the woman at the reception when I left Not sure if she replied to my bye or if she was talking to her colleague because she didn t look at me and spoke very quietly The hotel is only 100 metres from the Margareteng rtel underground station located practically between the centre and Sch nbrunn easy access to both Breakfast was good lots of varieties including at least a dozen different tea varieties 
376570,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Difficult to keep the room cool, Lovely modern clean hotel with excellent staff well located close to an underground station just a couple of stops from the city centre
376571,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Nothing at all , Absolutely loved this hotel I had a junior suite which was spacious and light with a nicely designed and user friendly dressing area Nespresso machine and underfloor hearing in bathroom both great Mark at reception went out of his way to accommodate my requests for changes to my booking room and dates of stay Hotel is not in main touristy part of town about 2 5 km out but within a minute or two s walk from U bahn station so super easy Having said that I walked most of the time in an attempt to offset the many pastries that s part and parcel of Vienna 
376572,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Nothing , The room was great lots of space We upgraded Breakfast was excellent and it s very near the city only 3 stops on the underground i would stay in this hotel again Staff were very helpful 
376573,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Could have been prompt at offering tea and coffee waiting staff in the restaurant avoid eye contact needed to walk around to get attention however in the bar they were very attentive , Good selection at breakfast not being rushed
376574,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, We were lacking service due to obviously shortage of per personnel Staff was always very busy and in stress At lobby bar at late mornings we had to go around and find someone who can prepare us a coffee since noone was at bar Restaurant the same first they had no space for us and we waited 45 min Then waitress was stressed and telling us kitchen will close in 15 minutes and firstly not willing to serve For me the general question with all these obvious staff savings i don t need to go to Hotel I can take apartment instead and go out for breakfast and dining I remember 10 years ago service in Hotels in Vienna was differently , Breakfast was ok Rooms are spacious good equipment so nothing to complain 
376575,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Nothing , The room was a great size and the breakfast was excellent with great choices Location was very good would recommend this hotel Looking forward to returning to Vienna and will stay at this hotel again 
376576,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Sleeping quality could have been better connected twin beds instead of a large double bed drifting apart during nighttime and creating a huge gap in between , Great and easily accessible location cosy and warm interiors pleasant extras and facilities bar Spa garage excellent price quality balance 
376577,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, wifi signal was REALLY bad in our room 4 star hotel in 2016 should have top notch internet access in every room , location was pretty good for staying for few days and see something in Vienna close to shonnbrunn city center etc 
376578,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, In sauna there were not enough glasses and the ones that were there were plastic ones in fitness i suggest having the staff for sauna because this would rate your Hotel more , The fact that I am staying in Falkensteiner and the comfort rooms 
376579,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Dirt in bathroom cold in bathroom and in whole room Poor selection for minibar no champagne etc , Good breakfast with good range and quality of food new hotel with parking 
376580,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Expensive bar Breakfast not included and 20 euros each per day , Good location Few underground stops from centre Clean and tidy hotel Supermarket next door 
376581,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Although breakfast was so good it is expensive 20 euros , Ambiance Rooms are spacious Location only 3 mins walking to the metro station Breakfast was great Will definitely recommend it to friends
376582,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The Nespresso coffee machine in the room was very disappointing as there was no choice to have tea instead of coffee The hotel was not ready to provide tea bags etc instead of coffee There are not good restaurants in the vicinity so one has to go to the main city which is 2 stops away by U Tube, The hotel is very neat and clean The rooms are very spacious The breakfast is very good On day one they have upgraded our room which was a good gesture Mark and Patricia from the front desk and Josef and Roman from the restaurant were very helpful 
376583,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The health spa opening hours were not very convenient and so we didn t bother going in there in the end There seemed to be more business meeting going on in the spa area than any relaxing a bit disappointing I had absolutely zero phone signal in the room and was awaiting an important text message which I found 2 hours later when we went into the city , The location is very good close to the underground station and also the tram stops into the city There was a secure underground car park which was great though this was an additional 20 euros per night The staff were friendly and helpful The room was very clean and a decent size We were on the 6th floor and there was little or no noise from the street despite being close to one of the main roads The bar area was very good and smartly presented 
376584,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, EVEN ONE SMALL INDOOR POOL WOULD BE APPRECIATED JUST IN COMPLETION TO SAUNAS, GREAT POSITION COMFORTABLE ROOM QUITE GOOD BREAKFAST AND ALSO WE LIKED SAUNAS AND ROOF TERRACE 
376585,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Several problems with the wifi connection getting dropped we use an AirMac which the staff suggested might be the problem , Breakfast was very good the restaurant menu was short but satisfying and the room was comfortable and spacious Very handy to the subway 
376586,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Hotel staff could have been nicer to the guests, excellent location all sites are within a few underground stations or 20 30 min by foot spacious rooms very clean and comfy rich breakfast
376587,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Comfortable room lovely decor nice view into the courtyard Loved having a Nespresso machine Very convenient to public transport just a few mins walk to nearest U bahn station
376588,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, 2 single beds was pushed together instead of having a double bed but still very comfy , Me and my boyfriend went away for our first holiday together and the hotel couldn t of been anymore perfect the staff was very friendly and helpful and made us felt very welcome The hotel was very clean and the room was perfect The hotel is based a very short walk from the underground and from a lovely market place Vienna city centre is only a 20 minute walk away and a lovely park nearby I would defiantly recommended a long weekend break to such a beautiful city 
376589,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The service in the restaurant was not the best By the time we arrived for breakfast at 10 20 on a Saturday everyone was rushing to clean up paying little attention to the fact we just walked in Plus the majority of food was empty and clear these would not be refilled ,No Positive
376590,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Very clean comfortable and spacious room Good location right next to U Bahn station which is few stops from the city center Billa groceries shop is conveniently located across the street We definitely enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel 
376591,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, would have liked a double bed instead of two singles , Hotel and staff where fantastic staff very friendly room was clean easy access to the metro station and the city centre Very enjoyable stay 
376592,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, This hotel does not located at city center However you can take subway to city center Three stops to the city center If you take a train to Vienna central station you can take tram 18 directly to the hotel the stop is about 10 minutes walking distance However if you have heavy luggage you probably want to take taxi I take tram and it works for me The is a supermarket bela across a street of the hotel , Breakfast is awesome That costs me 20 Euro but it worth to try once Remember to order omelet It s already includes in your 20 Euro The room is really spacious I love the room and the design Bathroom is awesome too 
376593,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, This hotel has very nice rooms The decoration is very tastetful This is a very nice terrace at the top the hotel is very modern 2013 the hotel is well located near line U4 which goes to the center Everything is clean and efficient a good place
376594,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Breakfast is a bit expensive 20 but abundant There are nice restaurants nearby on Gumpendorfer Strasse Good breakfast for less than 10 at Lemon Tree for example Location is not in the city center but actually it is not a problem , Spotlessly clean modern rooms and common areas friendly staff comfortable spacious quiet rooms with excellent beds and a nice sofa A large luxurious bathroom A handy coffee machine in the room Easy access to the subway a good supermarket across the street Excellent value for money this was the best hotel we have ever been at you won t be disappointed
376595,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The housekeeper entering my room at 7 8am every morning waking me up Not appropriate they also forgot to clean my room one day , The rooftop terrace is amazing I watched the sunset over Vienna from here in a very comfortable lounge chair Hotel is very close to U Bahn and Citybike Front desk staff extraordinarily helpful 
376596,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No double beds only two joined single beds not even the mattress on top to keep the beds together Sheets are very small had to often adjust my bed Very poor room cleaning They don t refresh floors or wipe dust So if you stay for more than 2 nights you ll have clouds of dust flying in the room and lying under tables and luggage No care for spa area There is no even one responsible there so used towels lying near saunas Finnish sauna can be cold They offer tea but nobody cares for hot water they also offer apples but nobody replenish them Lobby bar is very sad No atmosphere at all We had to permanently ask for services nothing worked smooth , Spacious rooms large safe fast internet coffee machine with daily replenishment of coffee capsules 
376597,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Very nice hotel just a two minute walk from the nearest U Bahn station Just two stops from the Naschmarkt and three stops from Karlsplatz Supermarket right next door is nice to load up on water food 
376598,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The air condition controller in the room was not working Since the cooling level of aircondition was controlled from central and couldnt stop it the room was too cold in the morning In my reservation on booking com i checked the box with one double bed option but they gave me a room with two single bed ,No Positive
376599,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Check in was so easy The room was quiet facing a courtyard and one of the cleanest I have stayed in Two minute walk from the U4 line with easy access to anywhere in the city I would definitely stay again 
376600,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, It s perfect for pets They had a great welcome gift for the dog dog bed bowls snacks towel and a doggy poop bag dispenser A little dog park and and some green right by the hotel Public transport is also very close So easy to get to the city center and hip places 
376601,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No complimentary water in the rooms and location wasn t great there wasn t much around the area But it was only a 6 uber to center of town Only 2 english channels on the tv which often you get more options in EU hotels Breakfast was a bit overpriced at 20 for a continental breakfast especially when you compare to room cost , Staff was really nice went above and beyond particularly had great experience with the bar staff loved the nespresso machines in the room the rooms were up to date and modern with lots of outlets throughout which is always nice 
376602,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, I was charged 20 for having two pieces of toast the one time I had breakfast at the hotel It was my own fault for not remembering this price but I think 20 is a lot for breakfast especially if one is travelling alone This is compared to going to a stunning cafe for breakfast for 6 , Beautifully designed modern rooms extremely friendly staff I chose the Falkensteiner because of the appearance of the rooms it seemed more stylish and less sterile than other hotels and I wasn t disappointed 
376603,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Looks cold no warmness no love in the air not good TV stations options Far away if I compare to Falken Belgrade , Close to Metro Station 
376604,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, perfectly located 10 minutes away from the city center by metro the room are spacious and clean with the booking com rates the deal is perfect 
376605,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The bed is not confortable enough King bed is not available just two single beds and two separate edredons , Breakfast nespresso machine shower sof and table not in all rooms 
376606,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Its a bit far away from the centre and you need to get the underground overall a trip to the centre would take about twenty minutes The breakfast was a bit pricy, A very good hotel with friendly and helpful staff the room was adequate with all the facilities you would expect in this type of hotel
376607,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Breakfast was very expensive so we ate out , Lovely modern hotel The room was really spacious and nicely decorated The staff were lovely and even gave me a cake bottle of wine and a card as it was my birthday Really good location 2 minutes walk from the U Bahn 
376608,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No double bed only twins and had to have bed made up with a double sheet which would have been fine but still had two single duvets as no double duvets available , Excellently situated hotel a short walk from the tube station and 3 stops into the centre of the City so very easy access Nice bar and restuarant and comfortable room
376609,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Hotel is new but they have to change the matrasses soon My back and neck were damaged by the hole in the middle of it Also due to central airflow the air is extremely dry and there is no possibility to open window , This great new hotel for business people Location is not in the center but if you are second on third time in Vienna it does not count because metro station is next to hotel Vienna is much more than the historic center Room was American size and great feature is makeup stand for ladies Try sauna and Spa on 7th floor Especially massages 
376610,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, We were a little disappointed about the Quality of the cocktails , The style the rooms the amenities are clearly Falkensteiner Very nice and convenient rooms and a fine and fresh choice for breakfast The Aquapura SPA area is a little smaller than expected but we were still lucky to get 2 beds there Prices for a massage are really competitive 50 for 50min full body massage 
376611,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The fact that the breakfast is a bit too expensive , Breakfast in the morning was good but a bit expensive 20 EUR day there is a Billa market right in front of the hotel The hotel is in close proximity to the Margarettengurtel metro station The bathroom has heaten floor and the rooms are heaten by air conditioning which is really silent The rooms are quite spacious we had the deluxe room and featured with windows from the ceilling to the floor which offer a very good view to the nearby surroundings The cleaning was effective we had a daily replacement of towels and bath shampoos 
376612,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, The Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten is a relatively new hotel with clean and modern facilities The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and excellent We stayed for five nights and found the hotel to be conveniently located two blocks from a metro station that was three stations away from the city centre The breakfast buffet was extensive and the quality of the food was excellent Our room overlooked the street which was quiet and had a nice outlook but we had to draw the curtains at night as flashes from the tram were like lightening not a problem 
376613,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, Because we stayed 5 nights received a free room upgrade Great staff Well located worth U bahn station a short walk then only 3 stations to city centre 
376614,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, My room was very clean overall but sheets could be cleaner , Amazing service and room for this price Staff was incredibly kind and hotel was very well furnished It is quite close to the U bahn Also they upgraded my room without any charges due to Weihnachten This hotel will be my first choice for my future Vienna trips 
376615,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Maybe not the hotel s fault but the taxi they called for me charged me 17 euros for the short trip to the Westbahnhof train station which is just 2 tram stops away It was a Sunday morning at 10 30 am so traffic was light A similar taxi trip in Innsbruck or Berlin would not have cost more than 7 euros But this is just a minor point and did not really spoil what was a good experience with the hotel , Helpful staff who speaks good English Location is just a short walk from the U bahn station Nice facilities sauna steam bath and gym Extended my stay by another two nights Would love to return 
376616,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Too expensive breakfast You can get a quality breakfast for the same price in the city center well known caf s , Great looking hotel outside and inside with good accessibility by metro or tram We ve really liked the interiors look 
376617,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, In SPA area there were naked guys always Although it might be normal in Austria I felt strange and scared to go there They charged extra for mini bar although we did not drink any Better to check your invoice carefully before you sign on it , Hotel building was new and modern
376618,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, parking is 20 night Parking on the street is 9 00 22 00 Receptionist was pushing parking in garage although we arrived late saying you may get ticket we don t know anything but you may get ticket , Nice atmosphere design Very good breakfast 
376619,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, not all the staff was polite and nice breakfast pretty pricey at 20 euros for what you get , good value for money confortable room double room nespresso coffee maker in the room parquette floor close to the metro 100m Margaretengurtel station I would recommend it for a short break in Vienna 
376620,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, I would not recommend to do a massage it was a guy with quite heavy hands The cleaning lady knocked twice on Sunday early morning and it was pretty annoying , I love the ambiance of the hotel amazing decor and very comfortable room The front office guy was so nice to upgrade us because it was our anniversary The spa area is also nice and cosy 
376621,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The hotel s policy recommends to enjoy the hot steam and sauna completely naked It is an austrian feature as far as I know but it s not convenient for every guest Be aware of naked old guys in the sauna , Convenient location not far from the busy city center supermarket just across the street relaxing spa and fitness area comfortable design and big bright rooms high quality service and attentive staff free cancellation policy additional coffee machine in the rooms 
376622,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The room was very warm Mind you it was cold outside We had a wall of windows overlooking the street but there was no way to open The halls were cool Called to see about a fan No fans Because of the room temperature without a result I would not stay here again, Nice hotel Friendly staff Excellent breakfast Has lifts 
376623,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Just one small recommendation to expand SPA treatments , facility service friendliness very good choice of breakfast food But my favourite was coffee machine in the room small espresso give me an energy just when I need it 
376624,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Room was hot with no way to cool It was 78F 25C in room but 58F 14C outside Staff checked on it No resolution or fan just sorry did comp the parking fee at least , Hotel parking is nice but set GPS for Emil Kralik Gasse 6 to arrive on side street by street parking and their ramp entrance just take a ticket and ramp will open Nice breakfast good location between city center and palace both short metro rides Recommend nearby Ristorante Gondola Italian restaurant 
376625,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten,No Negative, If you have a high standard for hotel but do not want to spend too much money here would be your best option Room is very big super clean Very very comfortable bed 
376626,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No bad experience but was disappointed that we were given two single beds in one as opposed to one double bed As a couple this can be a bit awkward , Staff were wonderful always ready to help when you need it Beautiful rooms too Easy location station just a minute away and only a few stops into town or to other popular sites such as the schonbrunn palace 
376627,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, Room 601 has the worst wireless Internet connection ever You need to stay close to the door for a good connection On October 1st at 8C outside there was no heating in the room so it was really cold , Friendliness of the staff 
376628,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, First of all it was so difficult to park into the garage the size of the parking was too small also the cost was 20 per day for the car charge I have a disc problem but there was no service to take my luggage to the room was my first time I traveled to many countries but it was first time for me that a 4 star hotel without a service when you want to travel your first priority that you to be comfortable The water warmer was very dirty and we couldn t make a milk for our baby The staff at the restaurant was to rude I thanks that s because when they told me that the room service will cost 7 and I told her that I will come to the restaurant even I waited for half an hour to get my bills , The bed was very comfortable The location was great The price was good 
376629,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, The cleanliness of the room could be improved We found stray hairs in the bathroom and stains on the tiles which was surprising given how new the rooms are English TV channels were also lacking and it was impossible to watch the dual tone SAP channels in another language other than German , The room was tastefully decorated albeit sparsely The breakfast room bar and rooftop terrace were also pleasant surprises 
376630,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, wifi need to register it s not convenient , quite spacious and clean room near MRT private parking supermarket is across the street but it s closed on Sunday 
376631,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, One elevator for 400 beds is too low and it s annoying to wait for elevator for 5 minutes It s rude to every traveler to push them waiting for dam elevator Cleaning ladies didn t clean the room because from 9 12am we put sign for not disturbance Due to that fact no cleaning lady came to our room after 12am without any explanation We had dirty towels and bed sheets for 3 days ,No Positive
376632,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, No food available after 10pm except a pizza which was frozen and not good Breakfast layout was crowded and unorganized Neighborhood not the best but close to the subway and a grocery store , Nicely decorated hotel Modern and clean 
376633,Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten, If you plan for a longer stay the one or two small shelves in the room will not be enough for your clothes and other belongings , Beautiful design of the room very clean with air conditioning very helpful when outside is 40 C very good breakfast close to the metro Indeed value for money truly a 4 stars superior hotel
