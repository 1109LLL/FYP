81101,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and professional the room was luxurious the pool and spa was amazing location was perfect 11 10 The best hotel decision I have ever made according to my partner She was very happy 
81102,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Very poor room design and no bath in SUCH an expensive hotel We foolishly thought at the price it would have been included Staff did move us to room with bath but no view Bath taps were too clever to be useable even front desk staff couldn t operate them , Lovely staff
81103,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Don t tell guests the front facing rooms are VERY quiet even with double glazing room facing street is not very quiet There are always cars and unexpected noises It s OK quiet , The staff were nice They said my assigned room would be very quiet front facing I did not find it quiet to my standard following night they changed my room to courtyard that was quiet It was an upgrade and the superior room the size was very good for Paris I will choose superior room when I next visit d They keep the spa and pool very clean 
81104,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, The room size was too small even the bathroom, 1 The staff was friendly sweet polite specially the concierge was so helpfull and make our stay more valuable his name was Hakim 2 location was super 3 the room service food was delicious 4 the atmosphere and decoration 5 the bathroom products was good I do recommend this hotel boutique
81105,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, The breakfast was not decent for this kind of hotel Highly recommend to eat out, The spa and levelof comfort were superb Super silent and cozy easy to start sightseeing Paris
81106,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa,No Negative, Absolutely outstanding stay The staff was so attentive and the attention to detail amazing Would absolutely stay here again Close to major tourist locations yet a quieter street A perfect balance and trip 
81107,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Shower was cold Even when water heater turned up to maximum Bath tub was much warmer Also the pillows were slightly thinner than I like , We truly enjoyed our stay The staff were amazing and the hotel is absolutely beautiful Perfect location close to all the major sights The concierge service was extremely helpful 
81108,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Nothing , An exceptional Hotel in a great central location The rooms are large for Paris and exquisitely furnished The most comfortable beds I have ever slept on in a hotel and I travel extensively The service was impeccable and all the staff went out of their way to make our long weekend in Paris and our stay at the hotel a truly pleasant experience 
81109,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa,No Negative, An absolutely incredible boutique hotel offering so much value for money at the top end of the hotel market You could pay 4 times more for a room at one of the more established 5 hotel chains in Paris and yes you d have a bigger lobby and some extra facilities you d never use but at Le Narcisse they ve really focussed on the things that matter Excellent service beautifully designed rooms a top end spa and they ve invested in really high quality fixtures and fittings To top it all the restaurant provides exquisite fine dining without a silly price tag to go with it and again the service was faultless Whoever runs this place should be proud I ll be back 
81110,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Would have been useful to have a handrail at the whirlpool tub, It was simply perfect Decor and amenities were simply ooutstanding Staff was wonderful Personable professional and caring they ensured that everything was tended to beautifully Hakim our concierge listened carefully to our needs and helped up plan the perfect itinerary The next time we saw him he followed up with us It was the experience of a lifetime
81111,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Room service was a little late and wrong however was not charged Room could be slightly bigger but that s a recurrent issue in big cities Unfortunately we were not able to have dinner at Cleo next time , Decoration and small details Great portable wifi device provided 
81112,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Breakfast is nice but does not worth the money , The room was spacious and the bathroom was great Everything was very clean the staff was very nice and helping The spa was also good 
81113,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Had a bad experience that is not related to the hotel but the staff were amazing in extending support and help to make my stay great , The hotel staff is amazing The hotel is amazing it s a small boutique 5 start hotel and that what makes their attention to details suburbs 
81114,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa,No Negative, Great helpful staff Concierge gave us great tips and managed to get us last minute reservations at a very popular restaurant They are very capable and aim to please 
81115,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, the size of room does not perfectly match with its price which means it is a bit small , really good bed location room complimentary wine bathroom service etc 
81116,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, The shower was a disaster Water leaked all the time from the glass door So after each shower we had a lake in the middle of the bathroom They advertise the view to the Eiffel Tower in the pictures But only when you arrive they tell you that only the executive suite has the view I selected this hotel because of the view and we were disappointed I emailed their Spa in advance to book a massage for two They never replied , The location is great and the staff are nice and friendly as it should be in a 5 start hotel The room was spacious and clean 
81117,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Stayed at more five star hotels in Paris This is best value for quality , Small luxury hotel in the heart of Paris recently renovated Rooms very comfortable and large for Paris with great materials Service excellent and restaurant was a special surprise with a talented young Canadian chef from Montreal 
81118,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Pricey but worth the splurge , The facility was brand new and absolutely stunning staff was a great match to the hotel Friendly and spoke English well 
81119,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, Nothing the hotel and service were great just wish we could have stayed longer, The whole hotel was excellent the staff were friendly helpful and discreet We used the spa sauna and pool every day and they were really nice We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to everyone

81125,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, The pillows were too high but hey that s a personal preference , Decided on this hotel after reading such lovely reviews Was not disappointed From the moment you arrive the staff are attentive and warm The room was absolutely beautiful High ceilings but a modern and boutique feel The area itself is in walking distance of Eiffel Towe and not far from the very fashionable St Germain The spa facilities were charming too In short thoroughly recommend this hotel and would stay there in a heartbeat 
81126,Le Narcisse Blanc Spa, The basement parking which near the hotel is extremely expensive which is 40 euros for one day This is the most expensive parking fee during my 15 days trip in Europe Well This is Paris The breakfast is also expensive and the staff giving us service for the breakfast did not remind us the fee of breakfast was not included in the payment I have paid Strongly suggest do not take the breakfast at the hotel , Nice staffs in the reception My wife and I arrived at hotel very late around 11pm There is a basement parking very closed to the hotel A young man walked to the entrance of basement parking with me since this is my first trip in Paris I have to say the staffs there are all very nice and helpful Especially Fouade a very nice man who was always keeping smile while answering my questions We also had very short conversation about football and Paris Saint German which make me feel like the talk between friends Room Interior design and decoration are also very nice Everything is new and high grade Distribution is good Room size is a little bit small but acceptable in Paris The bed is comfortable not too soft and not to hard Besides street but not noisy Location is perfect only 10 mins walking to Eiffel Tower Definitely 5 star standard I will be back for sure when visiting Paris
