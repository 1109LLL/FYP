246693,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, 1 The hotel lacks a personality and overall has a dull ambiance to it which is encapsulated in all elements of the hotel 2 The mattress was curved and a had a huge hole in it This made the sleeps extra uncomfortable and is completely unacceptable for a 4 star hotel to use a worn out mattress such as this Also there was not a proactive effort to replace the mattress, Location
246694,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Prices in mini bar were very expensive For the price I would have expected more complimentary tea coffee and biscuits in the room, Location breakfast
246695,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The room was very small , Free mineral water good tea coffee in the room Appreciated slippers robes good quality bedding and towels in a standard room Requested a quiet room and that is what we got We have booked to stay again 
246696,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Staff confused not service oriented clumsy Had difficaulties operating their order systme and payment terminal Every interaction took ages Asked for an Iron 4 times Never arrived Seems liek nobody ever trained them for the job , Location room comfort general facilities 
246697,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Adding 8 optional gratuity to an already expensive room rate Swiping my bank card for 50 in case of extras which we didn t have and 5 days later still waiting for it to be returned , V comfy bed and great shower 
246698,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, We loved our stay here the staff couldn t do more for you the room was beautiful and the location is fab one street over from Chiltern St handy if you can get into the desirable Chiltern Firehouse to eat few mins walk to Marylebone High St with it s quirky shops and eateries There s a Sunday Farmers market within 2 mins walk just behind the hotel which is definately worth a look Would definately stay here again and recommend to family an friends 
246699,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, Bed very comfy it had a mattress topper n it Fab to have sky sports so my husband could watch the rugby Great to have fresh milk bailable although I think it was full cream we should have asked for semi skimmed A special thank you to Nico who was so friendly and helpful We would come back again 
246700,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room small on the front of the building so could not have window open Hotel tried to add an additional service charge to my account I asked what it was and they said a tip for the staff They should have been more direct with this proposed fee My confirmation did not show this fee so I did not pay the extra 12 00 I thought the hotel was poor value for money , It was average
246701,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The bed was awful had a spring sticking up in the mattress and quite saggy in the middle My husband did alert the management who told us they changed mattresses but I m wondering if they just rotated it as not much better after the change There is building next door didn t start early in the morning after 9 so that was no problem but the internet was out on at least 2 days we were there for some hours Some of the staff were lovely others seemed to have a very ambivalent attitude to guest concerns Disappointed because our previous trip the staff were so lovely and we arrive to a bottle of champagne balloon and mini birthday cake and this time nothing for my 50th , Great location we have stayed here before 4 years ago for my husband s 50th Large rooms for central London hotel and elegant decor Nice modern bathroom with good shower and heated towel rail 
246702,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, rooms are quite small, love its adjacency from Fitness First a gym with high standards and indoor swimming pool etc also love the proximity to a waitrose a series of independent stores coffee places and a very very good italian restaurant 
246703,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Coffee in room not so good but Costa is only 500m away , We went for room with terrace and it was great Awning in case of rain plus heaters and blankets for later in the evening 
246704,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was small but quality bed and shower made up for it , Great location with easy access to London s best shopping Hyde Park and lovely cafes and restaurants in Marylebone and Fitzrovia Easy street parking at weekend was a real bonus Welcoming professional staff 
246705,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The room was small The etched glass door does not provide much bathroom privacy The internet worked fine the first day but after that it began to drop out frequently I mentioned it to the staff only upon checkout They may have been able to rectify the problem if I had reported it during our stay , Great location very clean very comfortable bed friendly staff An unexpected bonus was the Handy device which we used when we went out exploring London and was indeed handy 
246706,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, I very much regret that I was not informed that when a cab is booked through the hotel twice the price of a street cab would be charged I complained about this to two different staff members both said they would look into the issue and would get back to me however none did What I am left with now is not being informed about the fact that I would have to pay double the price to the cab arranged by the hotel plus my complaints not being taken into consideration which is very disappointing , The bed was very comfortable Room was very clean In the room there is everything one may need in a hotel room hair dryer nice towels slippers cattle complimentary water tea coffee newspaper 
246707,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Bar prices are highly overpriced, Lovely boutique hotel with great location good cleanliness throughout room with everything you need including an android phone to use out of the hotel free of charge and a Lovely comfortable bed staff were lovely and couldn t do more for you we didn t eat at the restaurant so can t comment Fab hotel we will definitely be using this as our base next time we visit london 
246708,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, We were a little surprised to find our room on the level below ground level on the street so looking up to the footpath There was also a fair bit of staff noise down there with doors outside our room opening and closing every ten seconds or so in the afternoon which was pretty annoying , order off the menu breakfast
246709,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, We had a junior suite The furniture other than the bed was not comfortable style over comfort The sofa comfort would be vastly improved by large squashy cushions Ditto the easy chair If you planned to be out most of the time this is not significant The menu is somewhat limited especially if you have gluten free requirements However the staff did try hard to accommodate special needs The menu has a range of pizza and sandwiches but as he is gluten free my son was limited to fillet steak rib eye steak or a gluten free tagliatelle which came undercooked It would have been nice to have gluten free veal and lamb options , The bed was extremely comfortable The staff were lovely extremely helpful and responsive Very professional The location is very quiet at night 
246710,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, There is no buffet breakfast only a la carte but that is understandable is a boutique hotel There are plenty of eateries a few minutes walk away , Finding a hotel in London for a private visit that doesn t the earth is a constant struggle This one is convenient for tubes and the Airport Express and was pretty good value It is a nice area to walk area and an added bonus is the mind blowing Wallace Collection just around the corner in Manchester Square which amazingly is free to enter Room was on the small side but adequate and very comfortable 
246711,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, There was a faint smell of smoke from my bedding There was a cigar room nearby and that might have been the reason I would have preferred not to have had a room with an accessible bathroom It didn t have a bath and I was looking forward to relaxing in one I also thought the restuarant was overpriced The service was excellent but I struggle to justify paying 30 for two fillets of fish green beans and tomatoes , The bed was comfortable and the location of the hotel was excellent It is close to Marylebone High Street with it s lovely shops and its easy to get to all the attractions from nearby Baker Street station The hotel was clean and there wasn t a lot of noise from outside which was good The room was a good size and there were nice tolietries and a robe with slippers in the bathroom I also liked that there was a mini bar room service and tea coffee making facilities I have stayed in more expensive hotels in London which haven t offered all of these 
246712,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Reception we and as it transpired other guests who had arrived before us were kept waiting to check in because the receptionist was busy with a complicated matter on the telephone We suggest that newly arrived guests should be the priority not some administrative matter Wardrobe most of the available height and space in the wardrobe was taken up with the mini bar Bathroom this was a good bathroom but the frosted glass door which left a gap between the door and the frame meant that we had insufficent privacy when using the toilet Service we were shocked to be disturbed at 6 p m by a person presumably a staff member knocking on the door to ask if we had any requests for service When we mentioned this to the receptionist the following day we were told that this was not hotel policy and she could not undestand why anyone would do that Service charge Ten Manchester Street have an optional service charge of 3 which was not mentioned on the booking confirmation or the property description This charge is added to the bill unless the customers requests not to pay it Given all the above we did not pay it , The room was very comfortable with a very large bed table and two easy chairs We liked the provision of a range of glasses including flutes for use by guests in the room The shower and bath were very welcome after a long journey 
246713,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Hard to fault , I stay here often Well appointed very comfortable excellent staff conveniently for me located in pleasant area Undoubtedly my favourite place to stay in London 
246714,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was slightly on the small size, Hotel and facilities were spotlessly clean staff were polite and friendly at all times and the consierge had good knowledge of the local area the food was great 
246715,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Bed could have been a little firmer as I have a lower back issue , Lovely quiet small boutique hotel Location excellent for shopping and restaurants Room is well appointed very clean Good TV and programming free Wi Fi We took an upgrade at reasonable cost Staff very helpful and obliging Linens towels excellent quality We visit London frequently and are always on the lookout for reasonably priced smaller quieter hotels Will definitely consider further stays here 
246716,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, More secure parking with easier discount usage we could not use the 15 offered due to a broken machine , This hotel is cosy and comfortable but also luxurious The staff were very accommodating and friendly The surrounding area was lovely and breakfast was scrummy 
246717,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, For a boutique hotel the standard of the in room coffee was poor The bed was also extremely small and even at 5ft6 my feet poked out the bottom , Quiet for central location 
246718,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Our room was on floor 1 Same price as the rest of the floors It was freezing when we got to the room in the evening for the first time It took more than a couple of hourse for the room to get warm Internet was poor at least in the room , Beautiful location Staff ws cery friendly and helpful The hotel had a gret charm to it and had very nice decor 
246719,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Everything fine, Early evening there was a lot of door banging but quiet at night Needed google maps to find quick check in and check out Loved slippers and dressing gown nice extras 
246720,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Staff need to be trained to provide the type of experience and service visitors would expect from this type of hotel, Comfortable bed and excellent location 
246721,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff At the end of your stay service charge is added to your bill I was informed that at the end of the month this is pooled between all the staff However you can have this removed if you do not want to pay the charge To me it makes more sense than just tipping the staff you come into contact with 
246722,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Being asked if they could freeze an extra 50 pounds per day in case I decided to consume drinks or whatever during my stay I refused 2 Being told Management expected an extra service charge for my stay when I checked in 3 having to ask for the temperature in my room to be raised as central heating was controlled centrally 4 my bill being slipped under my door at 03h with extra charges for food I hadn t ordered thereby causing me additional annoyance , Bright cheerful room 
246723,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The room is really small I stayed in many hotels in London but even for London it is VERY small For the price we paid 211 pounds I would expect bigger room for two persons with at least some desk chair and area to place the bag In the room we got it was really no space for anything from entrance from the door you get directly to the bed to open the wardrobe you should find other place where to move your bag and there is no really any more space The bed itself was also not too big for two persons This room would be probably Ok just for 1 night stay as a Single but definitely overpriced and non comfortable for two persons , Good location clean room nice staff
246724,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was underneath reception at night was noisy with doors Drinks very expensive Ordered a burger to room They don t cater for wheat gluten allergy So no bun no chips a few salad leaves Not good Mind you London seems behind with allergies,No Positive
246725,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, A bit pricey , Great location Very friendly staff The availability for Handy was a nice surprise The cigar bar downstairs also has characters 
246726,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Super hotel but my breakfast experience was atrocious Buffet was threadbare and set out late and there was no bread except for packet blotting paper which only arrived after begging for some bread ,No Positive
246727,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Not a fan of glass transparent bathroom doors Also every time the bathroom was cleaned the shower head was left facing out of the shower so when it was turned on you got a blast of water in the face soaking the bathroom , Great location
246728,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The staff at breakfast We had paid for and had been informed that it was a breakfast buffet However this was so the first morning but there was a different chef and one totally incompetent waiter for the entire dining area the second The in charge staff dealt with this in a most professional manner I m confident that this was not the normal occurrence and we would definitely stay here again , The front of house staff were excellent but we had problems with Breakfast staff on second morning The in charge staff dealt with this in a most professional manner I m confident that this was not the normal occurrence and we would definitely stay here again Our Junior Suite was very comfortable and quiet Good bed and bathroom Location was wonderful 
246729,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Nothing to dislike , The comfort of the bed the quality of the fittings and d cor friendly efficient staff On top of this an excellent fresh breakfast each morning The hotel is situated in a quite road which is a few minutes walk to Marylebone High Street 
246730,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was fine though not very big but that s just London hotels generally I suppose Bed was not the biggest or most comfortable but ok TV signal in room was intermittent though didn t really matter as we weren t there much , A good hotel in great location for us

246733,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Nothing really the wi fi wasn t amazing but it was free and it did work so better than a lot of hotels we have stayed in , Very slick hotel with really friendly staff the service was great Spotless room and very comfy couldn t fault it 
246734,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was tiny literally 12 inches around the bed and very small shower room too This was described as a superior double room on the website , Friendly staff and easy location close to most things in London
246735,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Really TINY room that was advertised as Sperior Double very misleading Ridiculously expensive drinks to which they had the tumerity to add a 12 service charge for pouring them come off it Rude night receptionist failed to stand to greet guests his only focus appeared to be on extracting credit card details ,No Positive
246736,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Nothing with regards the hotel however there was some road works which started the morning we were leaving , The details which came down to th staff the property itself was excellent great room and comfy able Hypnos bed Location was ideal and yet close to all main locations of interest

246738,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, Really nice and friendly staff Hotell is very well situated close to shopping nice restaurant and sightseeing Have stayed here before and will absolutely come back 
246739,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Bedroom very small so that you had to edge around the bed though bathroom was a good size Fittings a little worn e g handheld shower head base came away from bath scuffed and slightly old areas in bathroom Also provided bathrobes and slippers but were quite low quality so may be best not to provide , Great location right in the heart of Marylebone very close to shops and lots of places to eat and within walking distance of all the attractions A very clean room provided shampoo etc Very comfortable and large bed Happy for us to leave our luggage on the last day 
246740,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, For me it is perfect , Oasis of calm in London Nothing is too much trouble for the helpful and charming staff Beautifully appointed without being over the top 
246741,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was a little small and given it was a disabled use bathroom I m not sure how a wheelchair would have got around the room easily Mattress a bit soft but that s a personal preference issue not a critisism, Bathroom facilities excellent Quiet room Aircon good location very good and very helpful professional front desk 
246742,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, All lovely crisp white bed linen on super comfy bed Bathroom towels robes equally as good Staff all very friendly helpful Hotel is tucked away a little so road noise

246744,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff Well appointed comfortable bedrooms Personal service all round Great location quiet at night yet close to shopping and fabulous places in London
246745,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, the decor could be more charming and a bit less standard But it is perfectly fine , tucked in a quiet street behind discreet doors this hotel feels like a home but with the anonymity of a hotel Loved my short stay there Perfect for business of leisure 
246746,Ten Manchester Street Hotel,No Negative, Good location small room but well appointed Would have been nice to have more coffee available as this was quite meagre and consider a nespresso or similar rather than standard instant coffee Otherwise good service 
246747,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, I ordered a sandwich from room service it was very underwhelming and too expensive for what it was Bread was on the stale side too , Very comfortable bed helpful friendly staff 
246748,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, it is not possible to book the brekfest trough booking brekfest expensive, perfect location in the middle of West End quiet street meny restaurants in the suraundings typical english atmosphere in the hotel good sliping

246755,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, My room 306 was especially small but for just one night and only for sleeping in it was perfectly OK and very clean and comfortable Drinks in the bar are truly London prices i e v high , A very nice hotel in a good location in Marylebone and convenient for central London The place has an air of quality and comfort Nice welcome and friendly staff Breakfast was excellent
246756,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Basic Attention to detail was overlooked E g 3 people in room only 2 robes 2 cups 2 sets towels Ordered sandwich late at night turned up insipid looking no garnish no crisps no butter no mayonnaise Specifically said we wanted to pay cash but money was taken off credit card without authorisation from us Shame , Location cleanliness service excellent
246757,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Restaurant has limited menu , Very helpful concierge and reception staff We found our room a little small but were upgraded for a very fair price Ideal location 
246758,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The street noise was there all the time which was a bit disturbing while sleeping No buffet at breakfast so it was time consuming if you are in hurry in the morning or want freedom of choosing of your breakfast at your pace , great place to stay for London

246764,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, The breakfast full English was rather congealed and unappetising Plus a glass of fruit juice was not included , The location and friendly staff 
246765,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, Room was disappointing There was intermittent noise from a down pipe that was located behind the bedhead Twice in the night awoken by a loud whirring noise from TV box , Great location and a small boutique hotel

246767,Ten Manchester Street Hotel, We had one breakfast in the hotel during our 3 night stay which was pretty ordinary and expensive it is better value and more fun to visit one of the many excellent continental cafes nearby Space is obviously a major issue no room for a bath in our junior suite bathroom , Location fantastic for ease of access all around central London
