322815,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, The Jura automatic espresso coffee machine was a bonus The staff over heard my young son mention my wife was celebrating her birthday and the next evening a wonderful birthday dessert was in the room Housekeeping must have seen the stack of pillows in the bed as the pillows are very soft and sent up firm pillows without requesting Amazing attention to detail The shower was the best my family experienced in our European travels and the daily complimentary bottle of local wine white red was beyond expectations Exceptionally clean quiet and enjoyable experience My family and I travel several times a year and stay in luxury boutique hotels and The Guesthouse Vienna is one of the best ever

322821,The Guesthouse Vienna, Hated not having a kettle Even though hot water is delivered it was never hot enough , Bed was excellent staff so friendly good size rooms Location perfect and a wonderful cafe 
322822,The Guesthouse Vienna, I think they need to figure out the horse smell issue on the street Perhaps bleach the street nightly or use a citrus solution that is non toxic I can see this being the only issue in the hot summer , I wish I could have stayed longer because they had so many free things 4 free bottles of wine plenty of bottled water and little cake treats when I arrived The bed was amazing and the cleaning staff was excellent Lastly the front desk reception helped me tremendously with food reservations

322830,The Guesthouse Vienna, The only thing would have been to have a supply of hot water i e a kettle in the room or hot water tap for those who like coffee the machine was great but for those who liked tea like me you had to ring to get someone to bring hot water it would save the staff having to do that as well, The view was brilliant right by the State Opera and because there was sound proofing you slept well Breakfast had lots of choice and the staff were always helpful and friendly Ideal location to walk around the city

322861,The Guesthouse Vienna, It would have been good to have breakfast included for the price we paid for the room , The hotel was in a great central location the room was perfect beautifully designed and finished and great complimentary wines We had a fantastic few days in Vienna thank you 
322862,The Guesthouse Vienna, More choice of main courses in restaurant but it is understandable as there are many other choices nearby, The GuestHouse was in an excellent central position near the Opera House and Albertina and Hofburg for sight seeing and near enough to the the U3 metro to go to the Vienna Congress Centre without changing lines Our bedroom was modern and functional with a view of trees and the Albertina The food was good and refined 
322863,The Guesthouse Vienna, Coffee machine didn t work which didn t bother us but it should have been checked , Everything The service was outstanding comparable for me to the Peninsula in Hong Kong 
322864,The Guesthouse Vienna, Too short stay , Rooms you don t want to live Cozy and ergonomic design inspired by sixties top city location wide windows with panoramic view to Albertina and Opera and sitting library big bathroom wine cooler in the room with free bottles of Austrian elegant and attentive receptionist No doubts come back 
322865,The Guesthouse Vienna, Bathroom was clean sleek and elegant however the glass door in our room opened across the wash basin and was a bit in the way The layout did however provide a lot in a small space , Sitting area in room was appreciated and wine in fridge meant a pre dinner drink was possible After busy touring days this was like being at home Great food available in restaurant and casual deck area freshly made organic meals 
322866,The Guesthouse Vienna, The pillows are too soft, Good location close to the old town Albertina Museum and other interest places The bedroom size relatively a little bit smaller but it s cozy and clean with separate shower and toilet 
322867,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, Was our first stop on a 17 day European vacation The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful The room was of a pretty good size though not spacious as far as US standards Perhaps they could ve added to the floor space by eliminating the 6 foot tub and just making do with the large shower Modern and clean with a complementary mini bar Couldn t have asked for a better place to start our vacation 
322868,The Guesthouse Vienna, The only thing that I don t like is the pillows which I have given my feedback to Guesthouse Though they helped me by giving me more hard pillows It is still too soft , The staff of Guesthouse Vienna from the reception Dining and even the Bell Boy Their service was really super excellent Location was fantastic I was shocked that I booked the superior Double Room On the day I arrived and the room beverage was filled with 2 bottles each of white and red wines A Pepsi An orange juice A tonic A beer and 4 bottles of sparkling and still water To my surprise next day the housekeeping continues to fill up those beverages again For the last 6 nights that I have stayed I had a total of 24 bottles of red and white wines I drank to my hearts content with no additional charge at all I made up my mind to have Vienna as my stop over coming from Berlin for 2 nights and I left the luggage with Guesthouse to travel to Salzburg and Budapest for 6 nights The minute I checked in All the luggage was already in the room Their service was so excellent and I have decided to update to Deluxe Opera View Room which is facing the State Opera and Albertina There was a little miscommunication and you guess what the Guesthouse Vienna upgraded my room and I only have to pay the difference of Euro 60 and got a roller Bed for my daughter which they charge for Euro 98 got waived for 4 nights Fantastic The Reception area went to suggest that I take a day tour to Danube River and the Abbey and they arrange it within 2 mins My family enjoyed so much Tks to all the staff in Guesthouse Vienna Gabi Natasha Alex and all of them whom has made my holiday a memorable one 
322869,The Guesthouse Vienna, Every time you take a shower it will leak all over the room and smells awful Rooms are quite small, Free wine and minibar Location is central and breakfast is good 
322870,The Guesthouse Vienna, the room is not sizable for a family but more for a couple or single traveller the glasses door for the shower room can t be closed tightly so water actually flooded out and makes the place a bit messy everyday, Good location within 10 mins walk to kalsplatz metro station and 20 mins to Stephen Church Quiet place at night Service crew are nice and ready to help the hotel is very generous to offer free mini bar drinks and wines everyday
322871,The Guesthouse Vienna, would have liked a hot water kettle in the room rather than to have to ask for tea delivery, Great location gorgeous room wonderful amenities and staff
322872,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, Fantastic location within walking distrance of all first district attractions Spotless hotel A lovely personal note and dessert to welcome us and complimentary wine each day of our stay The comfy window seat in the room overlooks the Albertina with stunning night time views The staff are very helpful and friendly Airpot transfer by taxi can be organised for 45 euro Would return and would highly recommend this hotel 
322873,The Guesthouse Vienna, In all honesty there not a lot to not like Except you have to be extremely clear with what you are ordering with the language barrier , The amenities were much more than we expected and the staff was bilingual Food was fantastic location was superb

322876,The Guesthouse Vienna, Shower leaked but that was more of a problem for the housekeeping , The free wine and non boozey drinks was amazing Also quiet and nice to have a good sized living room to sit in
322877,The Guesthouse Vienna, There is nothing linked to the hotel or their staff that I didn t like , This is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at in all my European travels It was superb from the attention to detail staff efficiency friendliness and caring comfort and cleanliness location and facilities It is truly a serendipitous gem and worth every cent 
322878,The Guesthouse Vienna, Nothing, Nice welcome hotel very well located in the center of Vienna nice attentions very good bakery almost free minibar and coffee and very good breakfast
322879,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, From the moment we arrived the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a comfortable stay at The Guesthouse We were only in Vienna for one night but thanks to this hotel s convenient location and hospitality we enjoyed ourselves and the beautiful city 
322880,The Guesthouse Vienna, Cant think of anything, They have 4 bottles of wine for your consumption every day the location is amazing the staff is incredible I would stay here everytime 
322881,The Guesthouse Vienna, Breakfast not included in price No buffet and was expensive in restaurant attached to hotel Bathroom area small and only separated from bed with frosted glass door So it was like you were sleeping in the bathroom Air conditioner confusing to understand , The breakfast restaurant was good Free 4 bottles of wine and all the soft drinks and water in the minibar were free Cute room
322882,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, Beautiful hotel great decor and vary spacious rooms and bathrooms The hotel is in a great location very central and yet not noisy at all Also the hotel restaurant serves an excellent breakfast lunch or dinner

322886,The Guesthouse Vienna, The room is modern but the bathroom is a little dated and not well thought out , Spacious room free 4 bottles of wine daily extremely friendly staff and fantastic location
322887,The Guesthouse Vienna, The bed frame corners which are made of metal are very sharp and both my wife and myself got cut on our legs when brushed against them accidentally , Near to most of the places of interest and quiet 
322888,The Guesthouse Vienna, Nothing to dislike , Very helpful and friendly staff The most central location right in the middle of the attractions but still so peaceful and quiet The a la cart breakfast was delicious 
322889,The Guesthouse Vienna, There was no iron in the room but once we asked for this it was brought up to us The room had everything but was a little small , Location was perfect and the room had mostly everything you could need

322891,The Guesthouse Vienna, Paying for breakfast , This hotel is in the best location you could ask for when touring Vienna The staff was very helpful and the restaurant served a delicious breakfast 
322892,The Guesthouse Vienna, The hotel was very keen to get feedback on how we were getting on So much so that we had staff knocking on our door in the middle of the afternoon each day to see if everything was alright or to fill up the coffee machine with fresh coffee beans This was well after the room servicing in the morning and was annoying in that it always seemed to coincide with my wife s shower This is a minor issue only and could be easily rectified by the hotel management Other than that the light switches were a little cryptic for turning off on , The hotel was in a great quiet location in the centre of the old city and in easy walking distance to many of the main attractions shopping center Our room was very spacious and we had a nice view of the opera house The bathroom with a separate toilet room was also very spacious and well appointed The hotel had a great restaurant bakery associated with it which was very busy for breakfast and lunch but a little quieter for dinner The hotel very generously supplied complementary good quality local Austrian wines which we could either drink in our room or take to the Hotel restaurant to drink with dinner at no charge The complementary wines beer were restocked each day One the best hotels we stayed at in our 3 week tour of Europe I have no hesitations in recommending this hotel 
322893,The Guesthouse Vienna, Although we enjoyed the bakery breakfast the rest of the menu didnt entice us to go there at night however finding somewhere else to eat wasnt a problem , The location was first class Just a walk out the front door and in one street you were amongst all the shops and restaurants and opposite the art gallery 
322894,The Guesthouse Vienna, It s a boutique hotel and small not much open area or elaborate reception or waiting area We were not aware that it s a compact one but still nice , Location was excellent and very convenient staff was very friendly and helpful especially Nina Food was also quite good 
322895,The Guesthouse Vienna, Coffee machine always appeared to be out of water Didn t understand why when entering room al the lights cam on and a pain to find swith to switch all off, Staff were very attentive extremely helpful
322896,The Guesthouse Vienna, Nothing the hotel was excellent and breakfast whilst not included was very good and service was great, A lovely contemporary hotel in the heart of the city with good design touches The complementary Gruner vetliner provided as part of the room stay was worthy of note The wine was replenished every day if used which was excellent Reception staff were very helpful as were the porters The hotel is in a perfect central location and we could not fault the hotel well worth a return visit

322904,The Guesthouse Vienna, TV programs are mostly in local language it was useless Some of the waitresses are not in a good mode They seem very serious and they do not have the time to discuss the menu items in detail I understand that they are very busy serving others but I guess they have to serve their customers better than that , Location services provided some drinks were provided free of charge and cleanliness
322905,The Guesthouse Vienna, I don t like the European way of sleeping under 2 different blankets One blanket that covers the whole bed is much more comfortable I asked for a large blake and it was not possible ,No Positive

322907,The Guesthouse Vienna, Nothing , The room is comfortable nicely facilitated totally quiet though the hotel is faded to a plaza room service is very good and the stuffs are very kind It is highly sophisticated if I say in one word This is the fundamental difference from most of hotels in Vienna which are traditional narrow old and often noisy

322911,The Guesthouse Vienna, Not really a negative but at the price it would be nice to have breakfast included That said the breakfasts served downstairs in the cafe were fantastic , We had a wonderful stay the rooms are fabulous and lots of little touches complimentary bottles of wine maps personalised business cards with the hotel address etc We loved the reading nook in the window and the comfortable beds Staff were friendly and very helpful helped us track down a pair of glasses left on the bus and good restaurant recommendations 
322912,The Guesthouse Vienna,No Negative, I ve encountered friendly staff here and there on my travels but nothing like this My wife needed a hair appointment and they arranged that on the spot at about 10pm A few days later I became ill not from the hotel and they brought me tea and offered to go to the apotheke for me What else can I say 
322913,The Guesthouse Vienna, Not really a big deal the pillows were too soft for us We asked for a firmer one but still we found it too soft , The location is great Stylish room which we like very much unlike usual high end hotels The restaurant on ground floor of the hotel serves really good food for us who are not used to the traditional Austrian food very much Staff was excellent too giving good advice to the mini concert we asked for

322915,The Guesthouse Vienna, Entrance door is bit heavy for ladies and the door man is not always standby in front of the entrance But it is not so a big problem rather it is very good from the security point of view Other thing is perfectly arranged in this hotel , If you are a repeater tourist of this city and would like to seek deeper experience this hotel is perfect Useful map with hip addresses is available in the room Well designed furniture Great view of Albertina Platz from the Deluxe room Tasty bottles of wine are available for free and you can bring them to the restaurant located in the ground floor 
322916,The Guesthouse Vienna, Breakfast good but expensive and no buffet food good but expensive and small portions location nearest subway station 15 min by foot price paid 290 EUR for cheapest room that usually costs 235 EUR room good but nothing special for the money , Beverages in mini bar free location downtown staff nice and professional 
322917,The Guesthouse Vienna, Limited free Wi Fi 2 GB day separate unidentified faucets for hot and cold water small and slow B O TV small restaurant small portions of food for the money no breakfast buffet guy who served us breakfast menu wasn t very nice , Awesome big clean luxurious room bathtub comfortable bed free beverages 33 cl Pepsi juice water with gas 4 bottles of wine tasty food delicious club sandwich location downtown near subway shopping street and Christmas markets around the corner

322942,The Guesthouse Vienna, Nothing , The guesthouse is located in a very central but still quite place just next to Albertina museum and Burggarten Our room has a bit of view of the State Opera It is close to every thing the restaurant on the same street is really good and the main shopping street is about 100 meters away The hotel room itself is very well designed comfortable bed oak floor clean and new bathroom convenient mini bar etc The small backery and restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel is also nice I personally like the Quiche with bacon very much The staff of the hotel is also extremely friendly and helpful The tram station is only 3 mins walking distance away I took the direct tram many lines to the university of Vienna every day Anyway too many nice details I think I will stay in this hotel again if I come to Vienna next time

322950,The Guesthouse Vienna, No bad experience breakfast is available from the deli restaurant downstairs and it is great It is a popular and high quality place hence the price is reflective however when combined with your room rate it does become an expensive affair to sleep and eat as such would be worth looking at an inclusive or discounted breakfast offering would be a shame to see people do it once and then seek an alternative for the remainder of their stay granted you d expect people to explore and venture out but it s so good and so convenient to start your day everyday , Perfect location modern and trendy staff were attentive and knowledgeable They have really grasped customer experience and service The little things stood out pillow spray a mini bar where the majority of contents were there for you to use daily waters wines etc In room espresso machine trendy art work good quality towels and linen Great room layout and that reading bay window looking out over central Vienna just magnificent
