408292,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, No complaints from us , Good location for metro system and tourist attractions The pool was nice as was the sauna steam room after a day in the heat The staff were friendly and helpful too 
408293,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Room was right next to the 24hour in hotel guest laundry Very very noisy due to people talking and laughing waiting for their clothes to be done Ask for a room far far away , Great location Close to M line so travel in and out o the city was very easy 
408294,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I didnt understand if we could use Playstation contents from fridge etc , I went with my 3 children we were all so impressed with the spacious comfortable room The breakfeast was delicious I went for a swim every morning in the lovely pool and worked out in the gym The hotel was very central you couldnt get a better location so we went shopping on the hotels doorstep walked to the Duomo Museum of History and Planatarium The metro was outside the hotels front door facilitating easy transport to Milans many treasures Great resturants such as Sabatini where my kids had the best pizza ever and I had the tastiest homemade pasta all within 10 minutes of the hotel 
408295,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Front desk staff were mostly pretty hopeless Requested on site parking but told to go elsewhere for 27 day Then given incorrect map to parking After returning staff acknowledged bad map then given new incorrect location After over an hour I found spot on street Following day one knowledgeable employee got me useful info Come by train or skip this place , Excellent location and very good breakfast 
408296,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The area was not what we were expecting Service in the restaurant was not acceptable we waited over an hour for our children s main course and when it arrived it was not as described on the menu expected chicken fillet and received a type of reformed stuffed chicken and ham fritter The door on our shower jammed and our son was left unable to have a wash , Good selection at breakfast and a comfy mattress
408297,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, One of the suitable place for business trip and vacation Location is so good because of closing to two lines of metro and locating on one of the important street There are a lot of brand near this hotel and suitable for shopping The breakfast is good but could be improved 
408298,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The staff was slow we had to wait about 15 minutes for one guest before us in line When we got up to the room it was being cleaned and we had to wait , The staff helped us to get early check in as we had a sleeping one year old with us The area around was nice felt safe and it was close to the central station Nice room 
408299,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Shower cubicle is quite small , Clean rooms efficient and helpful check in Thank you Kith Well located and even though in the city center not noisy one does hear the whoosh of the underground but you are City Centre Easy access to metro which facilitates moving around Ample breakfast I d stay here again

408304,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I ve reserved the parking place but upon arrival learned all places are occupied , Highly professional stuff Good breakfast Very nice rooms Excellent location 
408305,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The bacon could have been more English or Danish as in the usual English Breakfast and the Toaster that doesn t toast is a regular feature in most Hotels today There must be a solution out there please somewhere , Booking in was calm and relaxed and the young lady who booked us in was just lovely She smiled a lot was very pleasant and efficient We pre ordered breakfast for the following morning and she then offered us free breakfast for the remainder of our 4 day stay A Nice touch and unexpected The request for a Balcony was met and with shutters and double glazed door we had a quiet night s sleep on the Main Road side of the Hotel Feather pillows offered by Staff was really appreciated by my wife who will complain of hard pillows This all added to the very quiet peaceful and relaxed night s sleep All Reception staff were friendly helpful and available to answer any questions asked They even helped with my limited Computer skills in printing Boarding Passes The Central position close to Metro shopping and restaurants with Taxis available in minutes The Room was spotless cleaned every morning and there was plenty of extras available Breakfast was well organised even at the busiest times and there was all of what you would want from a breakfast Food was covered and good Hygiene standard was noticeable What more could we ask for Enjoyed our stay at this Hotel 
408306,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Gym Pool area were OK but not fantastic , Very large room and comfortable space great proximity to shops and sightseeing very fair price for the quality in a major city close to public transport and easy to reach from train station 
408307,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Couldn t really find any fault, Great hotel An example of how a hotel should be run with lots of little touches the made our stay more pleasurable Will definitely book again 
408308,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, the hotel is amazing comfortable location is great facilities were excellent they have a very friendly staff really they are a good image to the Italy speacially the guy in the bar MAX and the manager of the restaurant I think his name maybe Rafael thank you great respect to the hotel everything is positive love you 
408309,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, We did not like the fact that the spa has no staff at the spa center the towels run out the tea pots are not replenished The guests have to go up to reception and ask for things they go back down and check the info provided then they notice that on the shelves on which towels were supposed to be there were none because the receptionsts had no way of knowing if towels had already been depleted , The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood Corso Buenos Aires is a good shopping street The pre check in done online expedited our check in significantly The hotel is clean the staff is friendly The swimming pool and the Turkish bath are great for relaxing after a long day in the city The breakfast offers a wide selection of pastries cheese ham etc with one tiny comment there are no tomatoes peppers or cucumbers to have with the cheese the ham and the egg varieties The metro station Lima M1 red line is just outside the hotel 4 stops away from Duomo 
408310,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I was travelling for business and there are no place to meet and work with colleagues the breakfast room if not accessible after breakfast time The hair dryer is barely drying the hair I ended up going to work with wet hair after 15 minutes trying to dry them , Very well located 15 min Walk from Milano Central train station which deserves Malpensa airport Nice Spa Gym whcih is always hard to find in Europe Nice terrasse on the rooftop to enjoy the sunset 
408311,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The a c did not work for both nights n then when they got us the fan there was insufficient ice available for the fan so we hardly slept for those 2 days as it was very hot The sound on the TV volume did not work A very bad experuence, The staff were frienfly
408312,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Pool a little bit on the small side The pillows in the room weren t very comfortable Breakfast wasn t all that good , The hotel and room was beautiful and the staff friendly Brilliant sun terrace on the roof Sauna and steam room great 
408313,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, No iron and hairdryer subpar rooms small no English on the TV, The pool spa was great and the hotel breakfast was the best of any Beat Western I ve stayed at Complimentary self laundry very helpful and staff was great 
408314,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Breakfast was average Tinned fruit Cold hot food Fruit juice was very processed Yes fresh fruit was available but just apples and kiwis , Roof top area is a nice touch
408315,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The room was very clean but the cleaning lady didn t replace the shower gel as it was finished and that was very annoying ad I realised it only when I was under the shower She also left a cup of coffee instead of replacing it with a clean one They say they offer you coffee and biscuits for breakfast There ware no biscuits After lunch I was in my room and I hear the door opening It was a cleaning lady looking for another cleaning lady Are you serious Privacy that unknown word , Big room Spa is free Nice roof top Central position just next to the tube station Staff at the reception was very kind Thumbs up 
408316,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Report for unblock the drain in my bathroom but no body came to fix ummmm Hotel is kinda old , There are a lot of guests in this huge hotel breakfast is good not much guests during breakfast time as some reviews mentioned here The check in staff is polite but only one male staff at reception is not that helpful he is a bit rude and impatient 
408317,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The room was good but the corridors were smelling very bad like something has been rotten there and I checked friends rooms which was in another floor and there wasnt any problem on their corridors,No Positive
408318,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Lovely clean room and friendly hotel staff had to pay 27 per day for parking and 14 per day for breakfast which seemed steep having already paid considerable amount for the room breakfast arguably not worth the money and the terrace restaurant is not open air as the pictures advertising around the hotel would suggest Over priced average food Good comfortable base for exploring milan but would go elsewhere for food drinks
408319,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, We travelled with a 2 yr old The ztaff accommodated our needs even lending a loan stroller for use Thw breakfast selection had a great spread and options 
408320,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, This was our second stay at Galles Best Western The hotel is gd for its location close proximity to the train station We liked the availability of triple quadruple rooms to accommodate our family We liked that breakfast was provided to us for a very small fee We picked the hotel also for its gym and pool It is right next to a shopping area where you have the street brands and within walking distance to afew supermarts if you need to grab some food 
408321,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The beds are not very comfortable The lifts are a bit slow and annoying , I stay here all the time It is my base in Milan The hotel is not super luxurious but has a lot of practical amenities free wifi gym pool turkish bath facilities It is at a main subway stop for easy access to the town center 12 min walk from a great park if you wish to run and lots of bars shops and restaurants are close by It is a super convenient place to stay 
408322,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, nothing, I always try this Hotel this is one of the best for me in Europe every thing is standard location is nice and the staff are really helpful it has a Spa and Sport center I love this hotel so much 
408323,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, REALLY friendly staff Excellent breakfast for 1 Roof terrace with views Gorgeous cafe chocolatier next door Walking distance from train station
408324,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, no isolation a lot of noise from the hall and the AC was so strong I put it at 23 degree but really it was 16 now I have a big cold since the past week, great lcoation nice people beautiful hotel
408325,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Pool is not for swimming Tiny room but okay for one night view from the window onto a wall Posh arrogant hotel guests that cant be bothered to reply to a hello or ciao Entire hotel and room seem old and outdated somehow , Very nice breakfast buffet Clean bathroom TV with programs from all over the world Good wifi 
408326,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, , Great place to stay Staff was extremely friendly and always willing to help Location was perfect just at Lima metrostation and next to a shopping street Room was clean Rooftop terras was cool 
408327,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Do NOT use the restaurant for dinner Food is at least questionable service is owful Paid the bill anf felt like robbed , Location is pretty good Hotel is clean enough Staff is great 
408328,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Nothing to declare , I had an amazing time while I was there The staff is pretty helpful in anything you need and the rooms are too comfortable Excellent breakfast
408329,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I have no complaints about this hotel it suited my purpose perfectly , The hotel is very well appointed a nice touch was the rooftop restaurant for breakfast The staff were warm and friendly I would certainly return to this hotel without hesitation 
408330,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I cannot say something negative all was ok, First the very kind staff this was the best Secondly the beds were very comfortable even the extra beds In any case this hotel in general is a very good option 
408331,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, We didn t like that the parking was a bit far away but they did let us drop off our luggage then park in the garage The electricity did also go out in the early morning which we thought was a fire alarm and went to the lobby with our children to find the staff not having a care in the world that people were panicking , The hotel was clean up to date and comfortable for our big family Nice sized rooms and bathroom The breakfast buffet has a great selection for everyone and was very fresh 
408332,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, More an observation than a dislike breakfast area could get very busy but to be fair we were there at the weekend just give yourself plenty of time if you are clock watching , Great location on main shopping street not far from central station within reasonable walking distance of the Duomo area but if you don t fancy the walk the metro is right outside the hotel Excellent breakfast with great selection for all tastes Lovely roof terrace with great view over the city Good organisation at reception with very pleasant helpful staff Also very secure system for leaving luggage after check out if you have a late flight Would definitely stay here again 
408333,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I opted to include breakfast however we left for the airport at 630 which was before breakfast They didn t offer anything for that The restaurant tries to hard to be fancy and is over priced and not great I selected that hotel Bc they advertised airport shuttle I went back to look and they do offer it twice Once just airport shuttle and the other airport shuttle additional charge You can imagine I was frustrated when I discovered it would cost 100 euro to go to the airport The room was very hot and the ac didn t work quit right and of course it s down town so loud with the window open , Very comfortable bed and clean room The hotel was very friendly and easy 
408334,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Larger room better Wifi connection , I ve all ready been there many times would recommend this hotel for Excellent location very cooperative friendly staff small but very nice SPA 
408335,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Noise isolation is not good I hear sound on the street and neighbors, I like the hotel comfortable room big bad very good and helpful personal The lady on reception met the guests and help with different questions trains schedule how better to reach the way for meeting points etc There is special room where you can change the clothes 
408336,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The room was dirty especially under the bed full with dust An empty water bottle has fallen under the bed and we find it the day after still there Staff on the breakfast not good the breakfast counter totally not under the control food on it everywhere A lady Gabriella during the service was eating a chewing gum often with her mouth open terrible to see , the swimming pool Staff on the check desk was very professional After our complain about the dust under the bed they give to us a vip card and didn t let pay us what we used from the fridge bar 
408337,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, This is a busy city centre hotel so breakfast was crowded with staff struggling to keep on top of food levels and clearing tables more staff would have helped Noise from the busy roads around the Hotel could also be an issue to some but a fair trade off for location for me , Staff were very friendly and check in was quick rooms were clean and comfortable The location was great for exploring the shops and tourist attractions either on foot or using the local underground We arrived by train and walked from the Central Station in under 10 mins 
408338,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, When we got to our room there was quite a bad smell in it and also the tv in the room had extremely bad reception but that could have been due to the bad weather, The staff were amazing they let us check in early and were so accommodating too 
408339,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Safety deposit box in our room was not open from previous guests who stayed We reported it on our first day but it was not resolved so we did not have one , Good location comfortable hotel 
408340,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Room was on the first floor and we could hear the subway The room rambled every time The hotel is a bit overpriced and average at best , Nice staff at the breakfast room Good fresh cappuccino s Two steps from the subway 
408341,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The included breakfast was not that good not much variety and too crowded and understaffed to cope The staff were nice but there just wasn t enough of them For example very hard to even get a coffee or juice for the crowds and when I got there the juice was all gone Accordingly there was not much value to the included breakfast These buffet breakfasts can be a shambles if not done properly , The steam room and pool facilities were welcome as was the late check out 
408342,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Single beds were uncomfortable because of the size Gave my daughter I a handicap room because they had no other with 2 beds yet it was specified on booking It smelled sour we slept with the windows open to keep it vented Bathroom set up was for handicap Everything was low difficult to use without straining , Pool spa were nice 
408343,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, No milk on hospitaligy tray only powdeted, Excellent breakfast and tea and coffee in room Some milk sachets on hospitality tray would be good good public transport links
408344,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, It is not only that there was no heating in the room the centralized air condition pushed cold air It was real freezing in the room Despite my phone calls and my requests from the staff to warm a little bit the room they did nothing I have been few times in this hotel rooms are not very big saying in understatement but the location is good However it is in un expectable that one chooses a 4 stars hotel in the center of Milan with the adequate price and need to freeze in the room while the staff is so helpless ,No Positive
408345,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, just the point is there are no deference between a person stays there for the 1st time and a person like me always chose this hotel because of the advantages In every hotel around the world they really noticed you are a loyal customer or not , This was my 4th time I have stayed there All the things are really nice good location Nice Staff very good breakfast Don t missed it
408346,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Beds were super comfortable Great breakfast included Loved the compact pool and spa facilities Unbeatable location for the price right next to a metro station 
408347,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Staff was not particularly helpful proactive or pleasant My room was tiny and while I am best western loyalty card owner I did not receive the perks that come with I was also woken up by cleaning staff early in the morning even on Sunday For a four star hotel I would expect more , Roof terrace was pleasant and location was good Sauna was a nice add on 
408348,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Wifi internet connection did not work or worked really slowly room 508 Too much noise on the corridors during the night Breakfast is a bit chaotic and the ingredients are mid to low quality , Comfortable bed and room Good temperature Very convenient location just in front of the metro station Lima Efficient reception operation 
408349,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Drinks in the hotel bar were quite expensive but there are plenty of alternatives nearby, Best thing about the hotel is its location close to Lima metro station and on a busy shopping road as well as being only 10 minutes walk from Centrale railway station Breakfast is great and staff very helpful It is not the cheapest of hotels but Milan is an expensive place so in that respect it is good value 
408350,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I was provided a room in an alcove with two rooms close to each other The other room had some very very noisy young men so I really didn t sleep at all I think hotel staff should look at their guests and provide rooms with the least amount of noise especially when a quiet room has been requested , Location was great and the staff were very accommodating when I asked for a room that was not so close to the elevator Breakfast was typical for a European hotel Good choices 
408351,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the breakfast was amazing The accommodations were awesome I wish I had had more time in the hotel to enjoy them 
408352,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The rooms were a little tired looking but the price was right , The location was great for shopping and restaurants We rented bikes from the hotel and used the biking maps listed on the QR code in the room My daughter and I felt safe walking around in the evening 
408353,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Breakfast was pretty average Coffee was poor and things kept running out and took a while to be replenished We waited half an hour for orange juice , The room was a good size for a city center hotel and despite facing onto the main road it was surprisingly quiet The staff were lovely always happy to help and smiling This hotel has 2 things in particular that I thought were simple but made life so much easier Firstly they offer a special repacking room so you can repack cases on arrival and check suit case weights before you fly etc On the last day we checked out but left our luggage at the hotel We returned several hours later and were able to comfortably repack our cases with all of our shopping They also had one power point in the bedroom which was permanently on not only when your key card was in the slot This meant we could leave things charging while out and about etc 
408354,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Comfortable rooms A well equipped bathroom Good breakfast The hotel is close to the city center 10 minutes walk to the main train station and 15 minutes walk to the city center A metro station is opposite the hotel s entrance 
408355,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Breakfast met our lowest expectations safe on room was never fixed had to ask for conditioner room heater never worked , Location was fantastic The room was nice with very comfortable bed 
408356,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Nothing bad to report , Love this hotel so much it s about 20 minute walk to the centre of milan out but they make up for this by how well equipped they are Everything was so clean and tidy and the staff so helpful and friendly The breakfast was awesome and the 2 roof top terrace were a bonus The spa is lovely and clean and relaxing I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member and will definitely be staying in best westerns from now on 
408357,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, For the price of the hotel it isn t that flash 4stars but it is old and dated Room service finishes at 1030 so if you re coming in late don t expect a meal Breakfast wasn t bad but nothing outstanding I have stayed in many hotels in milan and understand they are generally expensive but this is a bit much for what it is in my opinion Also aircon didn t work Photos make the place look better than it is In saying that the staff were very friendly and we re able to help with everything, Location was good near Lima metro 
408358,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I didn t like the fact that the hotel staff and the hotel barman permitted a group of french people go up to the rooms in a very bad state of intoxication They were so extremely drunk that they pretty much peed themselves They punched the doors the walls etc Vive la France , I ve made an error with my booking but they fix it Thank you 
408359,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Can t think of anything I guess we were disappointed of not having time to use their SPA facilities that looked quite nice , Excellent location right next to Corso Buenos Aires filled with shops for excellent shopping Right next to a metro stop that it s 3 stops away from Duomo and one stop away from central station also 10 mins walk Easy to get to from Linate by public transport or else EUR 20 taxi ride From Malpensa a 1 hour shuttle to central station Good sized room for 3 persons very comfortable bed and great bathroom Unexpected bonus a water boiler for making tea or coffee Great breakfast choice Very friendly and helpful staff 
408360,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, When arriving early we were requested to pay 20 eur to get the room I understand fee for late checkout but never earlier been asked to pay extra for early arrival if room was ready Pool was under maintenance during the second day Gym equipment were ok but air condition hot and high moisture due to next room pool , Breakfast was good breakfast staff excellent Other staff also polite 
408361,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Lots of choices of breakfasts and they tasted good Helpful stuffs Most importantly the location was perfect less a minute walk from Lima station to hotel 
408362,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, A little expensive, We got a early flight to catch and couldn t have the breakfast in the morning Thanks for the hotel preparing us a breakfast box so that we could have the breakfast on the way to the airport 
408363,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The don t have plan for the Loyalty system even they didn t know that s is not my first time I m there it s really Important and its strange to me the Hotel in this level Doesn t have Loyalty system , This is my second time of stay in this hotel I like it so much for many reasons the most important are the location Staff Room Spa 
408364,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The rooms are super noisy I have been granted a room on the second floor when we entered the walls were litterally shaking I believe it was the metro Then we asked to change and I have been given a 5th floor slightly better but you have all the noises from the street plus noise from corridor Definitively not a place you want to stay to rest , The terrace is very nice with a nice view The pool is OK even though we can t really swim 
408365,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Rooms are super noisy The rooms shake when the metro circulates the noise of the streets is very loud and so the noise of the other guests in the corridors Plus rooms are super small , The pool even though you can t swim as it is small
408366,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Breakfast was v good but the juice and the mixed fruits were bottled not fresh however fresh fruits like mandrins apples etc in pieces were available , My stay in Best Western Galles was v pleasant and I saw improvements since my last stay over a year It was worth more than the amount paid Totally it was comfortable 
408367,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Extra costs for parking were excessive 27 per night That said parking was very safe but suppose it would want to be at that rate , The location and staff 
408368,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Single room good but a little small if staying more than a few days , Roof top view Indoor Pool Buffet breakfast Lounge bar Reception staff very attentive Location excellent Love Milan Trams Great restaurants within 5 minutes walk huge choice of places to eat 
408369,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I had ordered a double room with 1 big bed but there was 2 seperated small beds which they made together and when i told about this situation they said there is no free room with double bed right now Kettle was broken in the room There were a bit problems with WiFi , Excellent location 
408370,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, we stayed in the 5th floor since 7 8 in the morning it was noisy like crazy the cleaning ladies would not stop moving stuff near our room every morning since the walls are thin it was impossible to sleep pass that time the electricity if the room stops at 4 am or so so we had to get up to put the card in and out again the heater stops around 2 am so it s very cold so we wore extra hot clothes but we woke up at early in the morning sweating because the heat was back again that was a nightmare i know this problem isn t just in this hotel but a few others in Milano but it doesn t make it better also it is above the subway metro so you can hear it all the time or feel its vaibration, let me start by saying that i love this hotel its location is great the stuff is nice the breakfast is great service is fast it is defiantly a 4 stars hotel 
408371,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, everything about the hotel from the food to the staff could not fault this hotel i was there a year ago to the same day i brought two different please to my group and they loved it too 
408372,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Breakfast manager was very rude towards me and my partner He had no professional communication towards his team member either It was very busy breakfast room but there is no excuse for being rude to a guest ,No Positive
408373,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, For the lunch or dinner i would eat somewhere else the restaurant on 6th floor was not my cup of tee , Exceptional 4 star hotel Very good choice for breakfast Good location just beside the metro stop Swiming pool litle bit small but ok
408374,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Not a single thing , Fantastic breakfast for 1 Euro Great facilities Great staff extremely helpful and professional Great location We SHALL be back 
408375,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Walking to the trains Stazione Centrale takes 15 minutes Taking a bus might save few minutes Not ideal location for early train connection specially if one wants to have some breakfast House cleaning was great during my stay But pity I lost my eye mask on the bed upon departure and wasn t able to recover it , Breakfast buffet from 7AM to 10AM Good long hour Lots variety salty sweet hot cold fruits eggs The cappuccino was fantastic with soya milk SPA swimming pool gym are great And a cave chamber with salt that was wonderful Position great for taking Metro Lima Walking distance to Porta Venezia The luggage service was very impressive There is a changing room on ground floor Useful for transitioning between flight city visit Beautiful outdoor terraces Hot water boiler tea sets in the room Bathroom drys fast Heating good and quiet 
408376,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, The hotel location is really good Around 800m far from Central Station 3 metro stations away from duomo Milano the metro access is exactly in front of main door of the hotel breakfast buffet is really nice very small Gym but it s good don t miss the Spa I had a great experience there 
408377,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, A full cash refund of my mistaken double booking The Hotel have no reason whatsoever to keep my money and just offer me a credit against my next trip The trouble is there wont be one as we didn t like Milan at all and will nogt be going back again , The proximity to the Lima Metro Station which is only 4 stops away from the Duomo
408378,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Location is excellent so are the SPA facilities and the room Although we arrived in the early morning we could access our room straight away and we could enjoy the SPA that was highly appreciated 
408379,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Do not take 1 euro per weighting a piece of luggage It was quite strange to pay 1 euro in such a comfortable hotel for this service , Small but very comfortable wellness area including hammam sauna swimming pool Exellent breakfast included 
408380,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, We were in transit from Venice to Paris and needed an overnight stay relatively close to both Centrale and Garibaldi railway stations We also wanted a place with a pool for the kids to have a swim This hotel ticked all the boxes The staff were very helpful with advice on transport options to get to Garibaldi station and the room service was quick and good 
408381,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Concierge really must be new sweet gal from Philippines but didnt know answers to many routine questions She was nice but needs training , EXCELLENT hotel beeakfast the best room super comfortable front desk super helpful and friendly didnt get to use but saw the wonderful pool and spa area was too busy running around town as tourists But facilities looked great
408382,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Just fantastic Wish we had stayed here for the entire duration of our visit to Milan We stayed at Sina The GRAY prior to here for 2 evenings We paid MORE than double for 2 nights stay there with less facilities Will definitely be booking again for March return 
408383,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, The hotel was only 850 m from Milano Central Railway station however the walking there was not too comfortable because of the uneven sidewalks The hotel itself was very good nice comfortable room nice bathroom Unfortunately we did not have time to enjoy the swimming pool or other attractions 
408384,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The room maybe was a bit small but the worst thing was the noise of the underground Visit this hotel but ask for a room at a high floor, Comfortable close to the Railway Station walking distance from the fashion district Good spa good breakfast The Restaurant offered us a perfect dinner 
408385,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The inside room facilities can be better, Perfect location with good rooms with a sizable lobby makes the proparty worth for business and family trips the hotelis located in the midst of shopping street make ongoing it very idea

408392,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Light sleepers be aware metro makes rumbling noise when it passes we were on the second floor Price Quality was rather poor for a 120 Euro day price you would expect some more room and comfort although it could be the additional city tax The rooms are a bit dated There are smoking and non smoking rooms be aware of this when booking We were non smokers and got a room that smelled from years of smoking , Location was excellent close to the metro station Lima station red line from where you can explore the entire city Nice breakfast area Clean rooms Nice spa area with showers sauna and small swimming pool

408395,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, It appears that the hotel do not look at booking requests at the time they allocate rooms We booked a superior room with bath quiet room if possible and booked breakfast at time of booking At checkin he said that I now had to pay for breakfast as I didn t book I insisted I did book Then he told us after having a look at reservation don t worry now this doesn t matter So obviously didn t look at any request or booking we made on web site We got a small triple room with tiny shower on second floor outside was metro line Totally the opposite what we requested After entering the room I brought this this to their attention and 3 rooms later we got room with bath Why didn t they save the hassle for us and just give us this room The reaction of the reception staff at this time didn t make us feel that our issue was that important Breakfast is well below what was expected Two days the same Cold scrambled egg both days on buffet Coffee machines not working There was other items on buffet cooked meats cheese pastries and bread rolls which all looked fine Hotel is ok and fine as we never spent much time inside But if we had to spend time inside hotel I would have looked at another hotel We expected more for the price we paid and the rating the hotel has , Fabulous location a gentle walk from central station Close to some great restaurants and metro All main attractions are within walking distance from hotel or if walking is an issue the metro is directly outside hotel Young gentleman on the bar was very polite 
408396,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I am a Hotelier Student in the 2nd best school in the world so I know exactly how check ins need to happen There is one girl forgot the name in the front office staff that was BEYOND RUDE I was ready to fight with her When you work in a hotel in the front office department your attitude needs to be on the side When we already checked in at 13 00 for the room but the room you gave us was not going to be ready before 15 00 we were kind enough to leave and come back later at 21 00 because we wanted to spend our day out BUT when I come back tired after the whole day and you make me wait 15minutes saying you cannot find the reservation and that it doesn t exist and on top of that shake your head AND when I try to approach you in order to help with a solution or communicate you yell and give me your hand in my face you need to back off and respect your body language gestures and communications AND QUESTION yourself whether you belong to work in a place like the hospitality industry Thank you , Lobby bathroom amenities and the space of the bedroom

408430,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The pool was unsupervised by staff Every time I wanted to go in the pool there were quite a few children in there messing around even though it said children should be supervised by parents Sadly they weren t supervised by parents so it needs a staff member to keep a more watchful eye on this area , Staff were very helpful regarding giving information on how to get to a location which trains to use etc

408436,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The tram noise was disturbing through the night The first room we was offered was over powering by a chemical smell the sun terrace didn t reflect the photos and there was no bar service to the roof terrace as stated there was a telephone to use for the bar service to the roof terrace however nobody answered the phone the roof terrace furniture had seen better days and could of done with a little TLC On check out they tried to charge us tax which wasn t stated on the website anywhere it is only on questioning the tax was is taken off our bill And we was told it is only chargeable on local residence , I liked the location staff was very helpful friendly The rooms was clean along with the hotel food was super and good value for money The bar was a little pricey 
408437,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Noice of the subway trains could be heard into the room although the room was on the 4th floor we slept well anyway though We had reserved non smoking rooms but one of the rooms we got smelled severely of cigarettes This was despite the fact that the room had a sign on the door saying it should have been a non smoking room , Location of the hotel is great since there is a subway station right next to the hotel Hotel is nice and cozy with attentive and informative reception staff Good breakfast buffet 
408438,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The superior room could be bigger and the breakfast esp coffee we are in Italy after all taste better but it was still very good value for the price , Very good location nice bathroom very clean pool very nice rooftop terrace Sauna and gym looked good too although we did not use them

408443,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, It was so expensive and didn t even include breakfast , It was refreshing for the kids to have access to a pool after a couple of weeks in the heat of Italy The location was only ten minutes from the train station 
408444,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I was surprised for the extra charge for fried eggs at breakfast and pancakes would have been good , I liked how everything went past my expectations throughout my stay It was always like they had thought their services one step ahead Every single staff member did their best to make our stay an enjoyable one

408446,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The pool is a bit small and unfortunately in the basement Otherwise there is nothing not to like in this hotel , We loved loved this hotel We had a family suite which was elegant and very spacious After traveling for several weeks and staying in hotels that were much less attractive this was such a treat We loved the soft robes the slippers the gift of chocolates and water the beautiful decor and the very helpful staff Although the gym was in the basement the showers in that area were excellent as well We were also really greatful for the fantastic breakfast served on the terraza with nice views of the city Great hotel in a great location 
408447,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Although the entrance hall and public areas on the ground floor were spacious upstairs was a warren of narrow corridors and it was very easy to lose your bearings Clearer signs are needed We were genuinely concerned about getting out if an emergency had arisen We think the hotel should address this issue The room was smaller than we expected This was ok for a couple of nights but not for longer stays Really slow lifts which led to queues and they always seemed to be full when they finally arrived The stairs were narrow and also difficult to locate Checkout was not very swift or smooth They initially tried to charge us for breakfasts which were included in our booking This error was rectified immediately when we protested We overheard the same thing happening to other guests It seemed a bit odd as details of our booking were on their computer system Overall we felt the hotel was rather overpriced for what it is We will not return nor recommend it to friends , The bed was comfortable and the room was quite well equipped There was a good choice for breakfast and we also had a tasty evening meal in the restaurant We appreciated the friendly service in the restaurant We liked the views from the top floor restaurant and also from the rooftop terrace Located in a lively shopping area and close to a metro station 
408448,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Longish wait to check in but apart from that everything was fine, Nice hotel and a clean and very modern room We used the free pool and spa when we first got there which was nice The hotel is right next to a metro stop that takes you straight into the heart of Milan 
408449,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Checking out was a bit messy as it was very early I settled my bill the night before to save time but male receptionist was not convinced and thought I owed for some breakfast which was prepaid Also taxi they called for us would not take 5 people and we were very anxious about missing our bus connection so we got a bit cross Air conditioning in one room did not seem to function properly , I mostly enjoyed the swimming pool as did the children I loved reading in the garden and enjoyed a drink on the roof terrace at night with my daughter Also the central location was excellent The restaurant was very good and the staff friendly and helpful 
408450,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Nothing Everything was great, Excellent location a few steps from the metro Nice rooms with comfortable beds very good breakfast Reception desk outstanding provided excellent support with lots of info for trips inside and outside Milan Highly recommended I would come back again 
408451,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The rooms are quite small and basic No duvet covers just sheets on top of the duvet which makes it feel a bit cheap The subway was very loud and could be heard until after midnight , Good location friendly staff Good pool and gym 
408452,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The breakfast was shocking And they advertise a roof top garden which is up utility stairs at the back of he hotel onto a roof with not garden whatsoever The spa pool is advertised as looking huge but it is squashed in a room from wall to wall The area is also a bit dingy , I liked that the Metro station was right outside the hotel and the one guy at reception called Kit was excellent
408453,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Room not very big Closing Gym for 6 hours is unprofessional clean room for room and dont close full spa area for such a Long time during the day , Great stay
408454,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The restaurant and the quality of the food were so poor , Location is so prime The staff were so helpful pleasant and knowledgeable I like that they are smiling all the time I like when I ask about something they give me some hints and thy provide full information There were enough staff by reception although the hotel was crowded they managed to give everyone enough time They gave me the feeling of an important customer Rooms were cleaned well furnished and just the right size 
408455,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The breakfast was very poor They advertise a roof top garden but don t tell you you have to walk up steps that look like Utility stairs and it leads to a few terrible tables with a view of nothing The shower was minute and the rooms are just tatty As for the spa pool that you see advertised it s crammed in one room and full of people , The only two things I liked was that the metro station was right outside and they have a magnifying mirror in the bathroom 
408456,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, I have read good reviews on this hotel on Booking com so I decided to make a reservation for family room for my trip to Milan at the start of my holidays 1 night and at the end of my holidays 2 nights The first time me and my family arrived we received two connected rooms with 2 bathrooms HOWEVER the second time we arrived around 2 weeks later despite booking the exact same room same price at the same time with the first time we received a COMPLETELY different room The room we received the second time is very small with a king sized bed and a SOFA bed yes I repeat A SOFA BED for a 4 stars hotel really I went down to talk to the receptionist who claimed that she is a hotel manager She has claimed that the first time was a upgrade we were not inform about that AT ALL She has also excused that it could be because her English was not perfect hence the reason why we could not understand her My family and I were left extremely disappointed and unhappy with this unacceptably inconsistent service and staff explanation We will not come back to this hotel ever again,No Positive

408459,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, everything was great in my opinion the pool is more suitable for winter since the pool area is very humid , very lovely international hotel in the breakfast room you could hear almost all dialects of the Arabic language some Korean Japanese and Chinese the food was great much better than other hotels the stuff was charming all of them and especially Stefano best thing they allow dogs which makes them number one on my future list when I come with my family one last thing room was beautiful and clean

408466,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Hot room with dysfunctional AC We were looking out for a restful night before our international flight out of Milan Staff on duty could not rectify the problem The GM of the hotel informed us the next morning that AC was under maintenance The rest of the common areas were nicely air conditioned Met another guest who had faced a similar problem Secondly we were told that the airport taxi would come in 5 minutes but it did not turn up at all then they booked another taxi by which time we were quite sure we would miss our flight Very stressful day in Milan , Pool spa laundry facilities late check out Good breakfast at reasonable charge Could keep our bags after check out for rest of the day till we left for the airport 
408467,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The small room , The hotel was lovely and clean I booked two superior rooms of 20 m2 but was only allocated one Our room was extremely small We talked to the manager but he said it was superior Maybe because they put gowns in the room We actually struggled to move with the suitcases in the room My reason for paying quite a bit extra for a bigger room Breakfast was amazing Good quality food and always replenished All and all a good experience 
408468,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Hotel restaurant was a bit limited in the evening would have been nice to have more local pasta dishes , Great location with metro station right outside Staff were very helpful Rooms big enough for a city hotel Good restaurant Cin Cin Bar Restaurant just down the street 
408469,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The full flight of stairs within our room was a surprise I would have accepted help with the bags had I known this Also expected 2 pull out sofas as that was the option I selected when booking , The room was large and luxurious Plenty of room for family of 4 with 12 13 year old kids Definitely a relaxing place for our last night 
408470,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Took time to fill out personal information in order to facilitate the check in and submitted the form through Google docs Surprisingly even if the form was submitted the clerk at check in didn t seem to be able to access the information , Good location friendly personnel
408471,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, Everything was fabulous the room the bed the location and the breakfast but best of all the attitude knowledge and friendliness of the staff It made our stay perfect 
408472,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Not really a quiet neighborhood, Great breakfast at an affordable price The terrasse on the rooftop is nice Busy street full of shops The person that waits in the lobby to provide recommendations is extremely helpful
408473,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The website pictures were very misleading for 150 per night I was really disappointed by the standard of the first room we were allocated as I had opted to pay extra for the Superior Room but had been allocated something below the standard I d expect even when compared to an Ibis Standard room Also the hotel pool was tiny again clever photography made it look considerably bigger than it was , Good location by metro station excellent breakfast although loud and very busy Good outdoor roof space for sitting sunbathing Raphael on reception was a superstar we were not happy with our room at all as the website pictures were VERY misleading and for the price very over priced Raphael listened to my disappointment and worked with me to delay my check in to try and find me a better room later in the day So we didn t check in on time but at least our room was closer to the one we were expecting All this thanks to Raphael and his hard work and excellent customer service 
408474,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Standard rooms are small , Best location in Milano Excellent staff Spotless clean Good breakfast Reasonable prices Been twice to BW Galles and coming back in July 
408475,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Had to miss breakfast because the hotel insisted on calling the cab too early, We arrived early and they were kind enough to hold our luggage until check in
408476,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The bed was too small just 190 cm long That is not really the normal standard especially when thinking about business travelers , Wifi worked well The restaurant in the terrace is nice
408477,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Room was dark It faced the courtyard but had no natural sunlight even though the week I was there was sunny , FrontDesk Staff were quite good esp Kith and Stefano Dining room managers at breakfast and dinner provided exceptional service 
408478,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, only thing i can comment is the the metro we were at the 4rd floor but you can count the metro when it passed under the hotel it can be a big rpoblem for you if you check for a silent night , breakfast was very rich but you have to wait a bit for the table if the hotel is full anyhow it is close the buones aires street and metro station 
408479,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, the staff was not much friendly comparing to other staff in Italy maybe they are practical any how they are pilot but a smile will not kill you , the location is amazing 1 minute and you will be in the metro easy access to the shopping streets 15 minutes to walking to reach Duomo Milan 10 min walking to the main trains station many services around you the room very modern and clean the size is good all the facilitates are working properly nice design nice pool the rate was not bad

408485,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, As it came out only when entering the room the hotel is placed right above the metro station Due to this fact it was too noise by half and every 2 min we had a feeling that it was earthquake , I would say that the only positive feature of this hotel is it s placement near the central train station 
408486,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, breakfast can be improved 2 years ago it was better but last year and this year it is not that good , Perfect location shops around for shopping chocolate and clothes with supermaket and very delicious sabatini resturant next to the hotel metro 10 m

408521,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, We had the one bedroom suite Room was far too small for the 4 of us Hardly any space for suitcases and to move around It s really just a room for us to crash after a day out The mattress was lumpy but the sofabed was comfortable Room too warm even for winter , Location was good Conveniently located next to Lima subway station Nice breakfast We were on the 5th floor and did not feel the subway underneath Two TVs and with BBC and some English crime channels With the Smart TV in the bedroom you can select either Italian or English for some of the channels 
408522,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The way we were receive by the manager even though everything was setup before travel her actitude was deceiving we were treated very ruff by her and went to over charged us for a prebooked room that was already setup for a child she went and charge us for a extra person we feel that were treated unfair by her and the only thing she care was to extra charge us as far as the attendant keith he was more professional than her we like to be refunded for the extra 200 euros when we conplaint all she could say go somewere else in the middle of the night if you dont like it , The location well kept facilities

408528,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, big drawback was it became warm iN Milan and they couldn t turn the heat off so I could not sleep well first night and kept waking up all night the 2nd nt As nice as the hotel was if you cannot sleep it is not acceptable , i liked the property in general good restaurant and loved the garden rooftop

408531,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The air conditioner in the room was not working and that is not acceptable in an hotel of this price and quality , The location is great as you stand out of the hotel and you are in the subway Facilities are in great shape and the room has a nice old fashioned style Staff of the hotel treat you in a very polite manner 
408532,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, It is really a terrible experience and the only bad memory for us in this trip in Europe Firstly the location of this hotel is too close to the metro station which I thought it would be one of the advantages at first Actually it is toooooo close that I could feel every train passes by so that we felt like having a terrible sleep on the train for the whole night Secondly the hotel insisted that they provided us with one economy double room that I could not believe it is a room for two guests till now I could hardly place two pillows in a line and we could only lay still there not sleep So you can imagine how narrow the bed is The room has one bottle of water one bath towel and one facecloth So I guess every guest would define it is a room for one person But the staff in the reception answered me it is a double room and insisted you booked one economy double room Okay I have no choice as it is the first stop in Italy for me After a long trip we are so tired to move anymore So I did not hesitate for a second to cancel the next night stay in this hotel and book another hotel which can provide me with a normal double bed BTW I stopped one of the staff on the corridor who just passed by and asked him whether my room is a double room or single room He said he could not tell me what kind of room it is Thirdly it is the only hotel in my trip in Europe this time for two weeks that could not lend us an adaptor and did not help us with carrying luggages I guess the guests who booked the economy double room do not deserve assistance Last but not least the wifi signal is weak So I guess I will never ever choose this hotel , I will never choose this hotel
408533,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, We requested a high room which we got but although it was meant to be a double room it was very small and the bed was also very small Larger people would have had a problem getting into the shower as the doors were very narrow , The location is great for visiting all the main attractions in Milan Breakfast was very good and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful 
408534,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Noise in my room from the underground Metro It wasn t loud enough to affect my sleep and having a Metro station just outside the hotel front door was very convenient , The helpfulness of the staff
408535,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, From 6AM to 1AM there is constant rumble from the metro which is passing very close to the hotel Wifi is poor at times, Nicely decorates rooms and bathrooms Central location next to metro stop but

408545,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The constant rumble from the Metro trains passing under the hotel from 6 30 am till 11pm Not what I expected from a hotel of this quality and price We were on the 3rd floor But it could still be felt slightly on 6th floor breakfast room When I asked for another room they were not able to accommodate us and just said sorry If this was a budget hotel you would accept it But it isn t , Had secure underground parking If a little expensive at 27 euros a night But it is a major city I suppose Metro stop right outside the door making it easy to get into centre 
408546,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, The bed was right against the wall and really not suitable for 2 people The shower was small you could hardly turn around , The hotel was in within walking distance from Milan Central rail station Free use of washing machines and dryers Right near a good metro service to the Duomo

408553,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles,No Negative, The hotel is located near Lima Metro Station which links the hotel with the most touristic attractions The rooms are not big but they are very clean and have air conditioning Good breakfast with a nice variety The hotel has safe underground parking but it is a challenge to park big cars as the parking spaces are small individual garages We were pleased to find in the morning the car windscreen cleaned together with a thanks letter from the hotel and a bottle of water 
408554,Best Western Plus Hotel Galles, Due to uncontrollable flights changes in our schedule months prior to our vacation we no longer needed our hotel in Milan because we would be flying out of Rome However even though we tried for months to cancel the reservation or credit it to a future stay at another location the Best Western absolutely refused to work with us and refused to refund our money or give us a credit We had to put a dispute in with our credit card company which is still being sorted out now I would never recommend staying at any Best Western if this is their attitude towards Customer Satisfaction ,No Positive
