270172,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser,No Negative, I am sure I would have loved to stay in this hotel However because of traffic we never got there in time to use our reservation Until next time it is only a mirage of the mind 
270173,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, We had booked twin room but it was not available for the two first nights so they upgraded us to junior suite for the rest two nights The room was lovely but the bed was creaky , Lovely atmosphere quiet room and still in the center Everything in walking distance Also very good buffet breakfast 
270174,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, I booked a room wth 2 beds In fact it was a suite with a large double bed and a sofa bed The beds were very hard Apart from that and that there was no TVs we could understand nothing in English apart from cnn news I would not fault this property, THe reception staff were lovely and very helpful and attentive and answered all ur questions efficiently The breakfasts included with the booking were excellent 
270175,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, We travelled by car and parking in the neirborhood had very narrow parking places Hence we had to choose parking near opera theater which is quite expensive , The hotel is based in the center of Vienna and walking street shops sightseeings are just nearby The lady on reception was nice hospital and answered all our queries regarding our stay We will definitely consider to choose this hotel next time 
270176,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser,No Negative, Charming old world style hotel Really enjoyed the ambiance lovely breakfast and very comfortable bedroom Wonderful central location down a small pedestrianised side street 
270177,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, There was simply nothing to complain about except maybe the size and busy ness of the elevator but that s a trifle and it added to the charm of the place , The location was on a small very quiet and quaint street and yet right in the middle of everything Excellent breakfast and the perfect ambiance for Vienna Best stay ever in the city and I would definitely stay again 
270178,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, Person who greeted us at reception late at night was a little grumpy Doesn t help when you are tired after travelling a long way and a little worried about having found the right hotel However other staff were wonderful , Loved the location and the room A magnificent place to stay in Vienna Although it is noisy until about 11 pm outside it really quietens down after that and you can sleep with the windows open I wouldn t have wanted to stay anywhere else 
270179,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, The fee was high and when you make reservations you have to move from site to site when looking for it The information in different sites may be different Because the price for the room was high I understood the parking would be free of charge or included in the prise That is why the feeling went down when paying another nearly 20 euros on top when checking out , Loation room and breakfast were all great The free basic bikes to go to the old town was great in a beutiful evening 
270180,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, We had to check out very early the following morning but forgot to inform the kitchen so we didn t manage to get the breakfast box on the way to the airport , Breakfast is simple but good 
270181,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, I was expecting a bigger room from the pictures it looked bigger For this reason I found the price a little bit too high , The staff was very kind even before the arrival they were answering promptly to my requests Breakfast buffet has a large variety of food despite the small dimensions of the restaurant Food was was delicious The room was clean and the bed very comfortable but the best part is the position You are in the pedestrian area in the Innere Stadt I would definitely recommend this hotel 
270182,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, Bathroom was a bit dated Water leaked all over floor when you showered but didn t ruin our stay , Staff were very friendly Room was a good size Good attention to detail Breakfast was very good We were upgraded to a suite with a sofa bed as they didn t have a twin room 
270183,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, The bathroom was a little squishy but not a major issue , Our stay was great from the minute we arrived at the front desk The staff are very welcoming and fountains of information The hotel itself is opulent but quaint The breakfast is amazing and can easily set you up for for the day So convenient to get around and many of the main attractions are just around every corner

270185,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, maybe they can upgrade their Hairdryer it s a bit out of style, The hotel is very near at the Center of Vienna easy access to mostly everything Very convenient from the airport we took the CAT train to the Mitte Vienna 16 minutes travel time from Mitte Vienna only 1 stop using the UBahn just a few minutes walk to the hotel Breakfast is good served by the staff with a good smile the lady at the reception was very nice too the guy on night duty was very polite in helping us on how to get to Prater at night Giant Ferris wheel is located at Prater The room is airconditioned bed was very comfortable the best that I like is the bathroom designed from Original Versace love the color well maintained hotel applause to the owners And the smell when you enter the hotel is so refreshing which means it s CLEAN this hotel have 2 entrance access at both sides of the street you can find restaurants literally a few steps to the shopping centers a Paradise for shopaholic Stephansdom is about 12 15 minutes depending on your speed Vienna is the place for Opera and it s very accessible from the hotel Though this property is near the streets it s very peaceful quite at night safe Lastly it s a beautiful Baroque hotel
270186,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, I was sharing a suite with my mum who is 82 years old and I requested a room with a shower but unfortunately they have no rooms with separate shower cubicles All the rooms have bath tubs with shower attachments and my mum was unable to use this I also found when I used the shower in the bath tub the water was escaping through the glass door onto the floor no matter how careful I was The bathrooms are very pretty but could do with an update , The property is situated right in the centre of town so is perfectly placed to get to everything You can easily walk to the main shopping street the Hotel Sacher and the Opera House It is in a pedestrian cobbled street where there is an amazing organic restaurant called Christina Rojik Die Biowirtin and the service there is excellent The hotel is small traditional cosy and beautiful Nespresso machine in the bedroom Complimentary coffee cakes and fruit in the lobby All the staff were super friendly especially Brunner Breakfast was great and the boiled eggs were always perfectly done just set egg white and runny yolk

270240,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, Everything was awesome with this hotel The only thing that could be improved was really a small thing The WiFi was fast but every time you left the hotel and if you were up after midnight the system would kick you off and you had to go back through the registration again It was not a huge deal except for the fact that the user id was a totally random 9 character id and the password was another random six character password It was so random that it took me a few days to even get close to memorizing it even though I had to enter it about four times per day This would in no way keep me from staying at this hotel but just a very very VERY small item that kept it from absolute perfection ,No Positive

270245,Schlosshotel R mischer Kaiser, A minor point but why does a hotel of such quality and style and at these prices think it a good idea to have a bottle of mineral water in the room stating Welcome and in small letter cost 3 90 Euros Many establishments do it and it is penny pinching , This was a high quality hotel with staff that really seem to care Beautifully appointed in a classic style which befits that part of Vienna basically liked everything
